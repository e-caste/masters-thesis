00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.940
Recall, when we were examining
the motion an object,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.480
in two dimensions, we
introduced Cartesian coordinates

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.860
and a position vector.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.200
Now let's suppose
the object has moved

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.140
to a new point, along the orbit.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.980
Well, we'll write
another vector r of t.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.680
And let's say this took a
time delta t to the new point.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.990
And what we want to
define is the displacement

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.780
of that object.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.990
So that's a vector delta r.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.410
And recall that a vector
of time of t plus delta t

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.490
is equal to the old vector r of
t plus this displacement vector

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.040
delta r.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:58.660
Now what we want to consider is
a limit as delta t goes to 0.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.020
And let's just look
graphically at what that means.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.540
As we move this delta,
delta t-- as delta t

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.140
gets smaller and smaller and
our object is getting closer

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.470
and closer to its
position at time t,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.330
and the position vector
r of t plus delta t

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.970
is getting closer and
closer to r of t delta t,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.400
the key fact is that if we
do a tangent to the orbit,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.929
then the limit of delta
r is approaching tangent

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:36.470
to the curve.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.940
So in the limit,
delta r, the direction

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.200
is tangent to the orbit.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.289
So that's our first key
property of delta r.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.520
Now the second thing
we want to express

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.870
is, if we write delta
r, as a displacement

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.680
in the i-hat direction
and a displacement

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.240
in the j-hat
direction, now again,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.728
maybe we can just clean
this up a little bit,

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.810
and see what we mean by that.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.640
So here's our delta r.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.500
And we have a little
delta x in this direction,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.360
delta y in that direction.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.850
Remember delta x or delta y
can be positive or negative.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.230
That's all right.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.600
Now if we want to define
our velocity as the limit,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.600
as delta t goes to 0 of
delta r over delta t,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.829
then what we see is we have two
pieces, the limit as delta t

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.810
goes to 0, of delta x over
delta t i-hat, plus the limit

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:54.280
as delta t goes to 0 of
delta y delta t j-hat.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.329
And the definition
of these limits,

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.210
we'll write that as
the derivative dr, dt.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.860
So the velocity is dr, dt.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.170
And that's equal to dx, dt,
how that coordinate function is

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.460
changing in time, i-hat
plus dy, dt j-hat.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.380
Now as far as notation
goes, we write

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.940
this philosophy as an x
component of the velocity

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.440
plus a y component of
the velocity, where

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.260
the x component,
the x, is dx, dt.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.960
And the y component is dy, dt.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.550
Now recall that the direction
was tangent to the curve,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.640
but the magnitude
of the velocity,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.070
what we call the
speed, is just the sum

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.960
of the squares of the
components, the square root.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.630
And so now we've
describe what we

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.111
refer to as the
instantaneous velocity.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.170
So far we've looked that a
trajectory in two dimensions.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.030
Let's again consider
some type of motion

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.330
where we choose a positive
y-axis, a positive x-axis,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.860
an origin, e at vectors,
i-hat and j-hat.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.839
And I'll have some
type of trajectory,

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.010
where our object is
moving like that.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.820
We know that at this
particular time,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.390
the velocity is tangent to
this trajectory, at that point.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.700
And now, what we'd
like to do, is

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.510
try to describe--
we've described

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.020
it's two components
ex and vy as a vector.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.730
So if you did vector
decomposition,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.870
you would write a vector like
this and a vector like that.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.530
This is the x component.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.570
That's the y component.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.270
And now if I define
this angle theta,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.960
we know that a vector has a
direction and a magnitude.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.600
We've seen what we call
the magnitude the speed.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.240
So that's just the sum of
these components squared,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.160
square root.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.580
Speed is always positive.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.590
So we always take the
positive square root.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.210
And now what about the direction
of this vector in the xy plane?

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.530
Well, we can see
from our geometry

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.110
that the tangent theta
is given by the y

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.460
component over the x component.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.310
Or one could say that the angle
theta, at this given time,

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.270
is the inverse
function of vy over vx.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.740
And so now we've described not
only the direction of velocity,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.590
but the angle that it's making
with the horizontal axis.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.540
And so we have now completely
described the velocity,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.640
instantaneous velocity,
vector at time t

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.450
in terms of its two component
functions, its speed

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.130
and the angle that makes
at the positive x-axis.

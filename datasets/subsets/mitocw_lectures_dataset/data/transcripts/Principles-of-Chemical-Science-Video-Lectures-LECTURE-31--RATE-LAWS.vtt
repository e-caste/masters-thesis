00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:21.890
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.790
So today we're starting the last
unit of this class, which

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.990
is kinetics.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.180
So, we're moving toward the end
of the semester, and today

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.680
will just be an introductory
lecture on kinetics.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.370
So, again, kinetics are the
rates of chemical reactions,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.630
and so we're going to talk
about, we're going to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.240
introduce you to rate
expressions and rate laws.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.670
So, when you're considering a
chemical reaction, we've been

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.100
asking so far in this class
whether the reaction will go

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.500
spontaneously.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.150
So we've been talking a lot
about thermodynamics, we've

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.180
been talking a lot
about delta g.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.930
But we also need to consider how
fast a reaction goes, and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.560
that's kinetics.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.310
So, a kinetic experiment is one
in which you measure the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.280
rate at which something's
happening.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.310
The rate at which a
concentration is disappearing

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.980
or whether the rate at which
a concentration is forming.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.820
You're measuring some kind of
change of a reaction, change

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.410
in composition versus time.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.990
So, I'm going to give, for an
example, of why kinetics are

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.310
important talking about the
oxidation of glucose.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.080
And I'm going to ask -- we're
going to do a little

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.730
experiment, and I'm going to
ask the TA's to help me.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.110
Everyone needs to have something
to do an experiment

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.010
with, something that might have
some glucose in it to do

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.370
this experiment.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.220
So, if the TA's could help me
hand out the ingredients for

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.270
this experiment.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:07.440
So, don't open your experimental
apparatus until I

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.420
give the OK.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.720
So, just collect it and let me
set up the experiment for you

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:24.180
while we're handing
things out.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.110
So you're all familiar with
this reaction, so we have

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.920
glucose and oxygen go
to c o 2 and water.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.300
And so we've talked a lot
about delta g for this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.890
reaction, and delta g again,
is equal to delta h

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.580
minus t delta s.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.670
So for this particular reaction,
we have a negative

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.220
delta h nought, so what does
negative delta h mean about

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.840
this reaction?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.870
It's exothermic.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.780
Delta s nought is positive, what
does that mean, if delta

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.970
s nought is positive?

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.960
What's increasing?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.070
Entropy or disorder of the
system, which is favorable.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.120
So, our delta g nought is
a big negative number.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.130
So, in terms of thermodynamics,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.170
what does this mean?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.200
Is this reaction spontaneous?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.450
Yes, it's very spontaneous,
it's very

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.090
thermodynamically favorable.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.880
Now, when glucose in products
are wrapped, they're often

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.920
wrapped under a nitrogen
environment, so, oxygen is not

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.560
sealed up in this container,
in the wrapper, and they do

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.540
that to prevent bacterial
contamination

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.620
and things like that.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.470
So, the glucose that would be
in a wrapped candy is not

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.350
exposed to oxygen.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.700
And so if you look at this
thermodynamic information up

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.320
here, one might imagine that if
you ripped this open, and

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.620
oxygen came in, that there might
be some kind of level of

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.740
explosion with c o 2 coming
out and water coming out.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.780
Now, you know, you might say
well, if you have one sort of

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.400
little thing it might not, but
now if everyone has one, and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.590
we all open it at the
same time, what do

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.560
you expect to happen?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.410
Let's try it.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.600
Oh, we need some
more down here.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:54.940
Anybody else need any?

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.540
All right, so I'm trying mine,
and I'm not really noticing

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.080
anything happening.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.390
So the situation is the
following, It is a spontaneous

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.360
reaction, but it's slow.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.430
So here, kinetics are
very important.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.100
So, how many of you are having
Thanksgiving with a small

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.950
child around, younger siblings
or something like that?

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.880
When you see them eat a lot of
sugar, which can happen over

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.200
Thanksgiving, it sometimes seems
like an explosion has

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.800
occurred, that there's
all of a sudden hyper

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.460
energy running around.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.030
But that could be due to this
reaction biochemically,

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.700
getting a lot of energy into the
system, but probably you

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.510
will not see c o 2 and water
coming off of the small child

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.070
as they run around.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.690
So, let me introduce you to
a couple of terms, if you

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.550
haven't heard these already.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.050
So people are often talking
about compounds being stable

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.350
or unstable.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.080
When they're doing this, they're
talking about the

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.950
thermodynamics of a system,
the tendency to decompose,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.200
whether the reaction is
spontaneous or not.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.730
Then you can also hear people
talking about whether the

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.130
compound is labile or non-labile
or inert, and this

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.530
refers to the rate at which
that tendency is realized.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.550
So you might have a very
unstable compound,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.370
thermodynamically it wants to
decompose, but it also might

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.560
be very non-labile, it might
be fairly inert, that

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.710
kinetically that decomposition
is going to take such a long

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.730
amount of time, that you're
not going to notice the

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.640
tendency to decompose.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.820
So, these two can play
off each other.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.690
So, you can have materials
that are very unstable

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.030
thermodynamically, but you
won't really see them

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.980
decompose because the rate is
just way, way too slow.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.320
So, you know for this particular
reaction, this is

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.960
how we get energy -- we make
ATP's of energy for the body.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.480
So it's slow, but in the body we
have to do something about

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.040
that because we need energy to
keep going, and so to be a

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.360
useful energy source, the
oxidation must be fast enough.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.520
So, does anyone know in the body
what happens to make that

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.420
reaction faster?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.010
Enzymes, right.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.820
So, enzymes are catalysts
and they will

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.890
speed up the reaction.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.190
So, let me just give
one more example.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.520
Some of you may have heard the
commercial from deBeers, "a

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.740
diamond is forever." If you
haven't, you will probably

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.490
hear that quite often between
now and the Christmas season.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.160
This is a very popular time, I
guess, for people to buy each

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.760
other diamonds.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.250
But if you look at that the
thermodynamics of this,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.220
graphite is actually much
more stable than

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.890
diamonds by 2,900 joules.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:12.050
So, one could argue that
graphite is forever, not that

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.200
diamonds are forever.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.000
Of course, here kinetics are
on the side of the diamond,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.640
they're relatively kinetically
inert, it's a huge activation

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.480
energy barrier, which we're
going to be talking about in

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.140
this unit for the conversion.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.050
So, diamonds do, in fact, stay
around for a long time.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.860
One could still argue that,
perhaps, a better gift would

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.100
be a graphite ring than a
diamond ring, but I have a

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.650
feeling that probably even if
the person receiving said ring

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:49.490
was a chemist, they might still
not a 100% appreciate

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.280
that gesture.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:57.250
So, it's important, the
thermodynamics are important,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.510
but kinetics are also really
important to understand what

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:06.750
kind of chemical reactions
are going to occur.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.320
So, let's think about what are
some factors that would affect

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:17.310
rates of reactions.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.500
So let's write down, and you can
think about what are some

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:31.300
factors affecting rates.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.850
What's one thing people can
think of that might affect the

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.010
rate of a reaction?

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.020
STUDENT: Temperature.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:44.760
PROFESSOR: Temperature,
definitely.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.240
And this is used quite
often in cooking to

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.420
get things to occur.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.110
What else affects the
rate of a reaction?

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:10.600
OK, yeah, so pressure could --
if you're changing things,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.060
applying pressure to sort
of switch things around.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.350
That will depend, say, for
pressure on the nature of the

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.490
material and things like that of
what you're talking about.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.640
So let's make that a bigger
category and put

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.480
nature of the material.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.490
What type of material it is.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.460
And also, along with that, if
you're thinking about a

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.590
particular reaction and how it's
going to go and how you

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.060
might get it to sort of push one
way or the other, you're

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.260
also thinking about the
mechanism of that reaction.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:57.700
So what's reacting with what
will make a difference.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:05.630
I think I also heard someone
talk about concentration, how

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:11.830
much of it you have. And you
told me the last one that

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.620
we're going to talk about in
this unit, when we were

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.840
talking about how the body gets
the oxidation of glucose

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.240
to go, what was necessary
there?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.900
A catalyst, right.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.470
So, those are all the things
we're going to talk about in

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.690
factors affecting rates of
reaction in this next unit.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:47.350
So now, chemistry is an
experimental science, and so a

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.890
lot of kinetics are involved
with measuring

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.320
the rates of reactions.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.790
So let's talk about how
one might measure

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.100
the rate of a reaction.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.660
So here's a particular reaction,
we have n o 2 plus

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:05.420
carbon monoxide, going to n o
plus carbon dioxide, and one

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:11.690
could measure the rate of
decrease of the reactants or

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.700
the amount of increase
of the products.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.990
So let's just look at
one of the products.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.780
So one might be plotting a
change in the concentration of

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.370
one of the products
versus time.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.870
And you may find that it goes
up, and then maybe starts to

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.300
level off a little
bit over time.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.380
And now, how are you going to
measure a rate out of this,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.820
the rate at which this
reaction is going?

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.590
Well, one could measure an
average rate, which would be

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.780
some change in concentration
over some change in

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.470
the amount of time.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.140
And you could express that as
the change in concentration

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.400
over the change in time.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.830
So, you could pick a particular
interval, say, we

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.150
want to measure the average rate
from time is 50 seconds

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.110
to time equals 150 seconds, and
we'll look at how much the

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.690
concentration has changed
over that time interval.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.980
So, we can do a little
calculation of the average

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.720
rate and get a number, 1 .

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.530
2 8 times 10 to the minus 4
molar per second, and that's

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.320
an average rate.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.720
But if we had picked at
different interval, we would

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.200
have gotten a different
number.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.910
So the average rate depends on
the time interval, so that's

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.740
not always ideal.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.290
You don't always want to know
an average rate, which might

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.860
be different depending on which

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.120
particular unit you pick.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.240
So often, when you're talking
about rates, you talk about

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.190
instantaneous rates.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.670
So the rate at a particular
instance of time.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.050
And so let's look at
instantaneous rate.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.250
So, we have the same reaction,
same plot, but now we're going

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:04.990
to be considering instead of the
average rate, the rate at

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.500
a limit when your time interval
is going to zero --

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.140
at a very, very small time
interval, so the rate at the

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.370
particular instance.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.040
And so this can be expressed as
d times the concentration

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.900
of a product, n o, over d t.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.090
So, as delta t approaches zero,
the rate becomes the

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.820
slope of the line tangent to
the point, that particular

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.240
time point that you're
interested in.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.670
So, let's find an

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.570
instantaneous rate at 150 seconds.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.680
What is the rate of this
reaction at 150 seconds?

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.160
So we can look for 150 seconds,
we can have a point

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.150
on the curve at 150 seconds.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.220
And so as our time interval
approaches zero, the rate will

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.250
approach the slope
of this line.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.720
So we can draw a slope that's
tangent to the curve at the

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.930
time t, it's time 150 seconds,
and then we can calculate the

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.760
slope of that line.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.230
And so we can do that math,
calculating the slope, and

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.150
here we find that at an
instantaneous rate that time

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.060
equals 150 seconds, change in
-- this is the slope of the

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.840
line -- the change in
concentration over change in

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.670
time, and that gives you 7 .

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.410
7 times 10 to the minus
5 molar per second.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:41.020
So, that's instantaneous rate
at a particular time.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.390
What do you think the
instantaneous rate is called

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.030
at time equals zero?

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.130
Any guess?

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.710
Initial rate, yeah.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.155
So, initial rate, instantaneous
rate at time

00:15:52.155 --> 00:15:53.980
equals zero seconds.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.660
So that's instantaneous rate.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.090
So now, let's talk about rate
expressions, and then we're

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.300
going to talk about rate laws.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.830
So, same equation.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.950
Again, you can monitor how
much your reactants are

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.440
disappearing, you can monitor
the amounts of your products

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.420
being formed, and you
can express this in

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.310
the following way.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.140
So we could say that the rate
is going to be equal to the

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.435
decrease in one of the
reactants, so minus d times

00:16:24.435 --> 00:16:29.080
the concentration of
n o 2 over d t.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.640
We could also express it in
terms of the second reactant,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.380
so minus d times change in the
concentration of the other

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.200
reactant over time.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.930
Or we can express this in terms
of the products being

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:50.710
formed, so here there's no
negative sign, so we have d

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:58.810
concentration of n o over d t,
or our last product, d times

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.930
the concentration
of c o 2 d t.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.820
So this would be a rate
expression, and these would

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.040
all be equal to each other,
if we make the following

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:09.890
assumption.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.450
We're going to make the
assumption here that there's

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:17.950
no intermediate species that's
being formed, or that if there

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.760
are intermediate species, that
their change in concentration

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.320
is independent of time.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.730
So if there were some other
really complicated thing going

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.720
on here, then those rates may
not be equal and we might have

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.320
something else in the mechanism
that would cause one

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.740
thing to disappear a lot faster
than something else

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.790
that's being formed.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.550
But these should all be equal if
you assume no intermediate

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.030
species, or make assumptions
about those

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.840
intermediate species.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.490
So, then the general expression
for a rate

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:56.620
expression, if we have an
equation, a plus b going to c

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.950
plus d, where we have
coefficients of the reaction,

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.970
small a, coefficient small b,
coefficient small c, and

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.870
coefficient small d.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.840
So we could express the overall
rate then, minus 1

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:17.360
over a times d a t t minus 1
over b, d b d t, 1 over c, d c

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.280
e t, 1 over d d d d d t.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.520
That was not easy.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.350
All right, so that's the general
form for the rate

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.430
expression.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.480
So just to make sure that
everyone's on the same page,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.010
why don't you do a
rate expression

00:18:35.010 --> 00:19:10.890
for me for this one.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:25.360
OK, just 10 more seconds.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.760
Excellent.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.620
So you just have to pay
attention to your minus signs,

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.540
your stoichiometry.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.680
So, it's minus for the
disappearance, stoichiometry 1

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.620
over 2, and then no negatives
for your products of things

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.410
that are appearing.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:48.920
Very good.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.490
Rate expressions, not
that complicated.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.930
All right, so now we're going to
talk about rate laws, which

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.260
are slightly more complicated
than rate expressions.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:03.040
So, a rate law is -- you
come up with a rate law

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.950
experimentally, and it's the
relationship between the rate

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.600
and the concentration.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.250
So we have -- we're going to
introduce a term called the

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.680
rate constant, which is
the small letter k.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.890
And so the rate constant is
going to tell you about the

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:23.070
relationship between the rate
and the concentration of your

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:27.710
reactants in a reaction.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:32.780
So, if we had that same reaction
here, we could also

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.660
write that the rate is equal to
a rate constant times the

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.900
concentration of your reactant,
a, raised to a power

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.760
m, and b raised to a power n.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.370
So here, m and n are the order
of the reaction with respect

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:55.530
to a and b respectively, so m
is the order of the reaction

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.840
in a, and n is the order of
the reaction in b, and our

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.850
small letter k here is
the rate constant.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.430
So that would be an expression
for rate law.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.670
And so, now I'm going to tell
you a lot of things that are

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:14.030
true about rate laws.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:19.040
So, a rate law, again, comes
from experiment, so you can't

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.220
just look at the stoichiometry
of the reaction and predict

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.050
the rate law.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:28.370
So m is not the stoichiometry
of the reaction in terms of

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:32.370
the a, that is, unless the
reaction is what we call an

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.620
elementary reaction, or a step
in a reaction, and we're going

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.620
to talk more about that next
week -- then you can, if it's

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.750
an elementary reaction,
then you can use

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.870
stoichiometry to predict.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.160
But for other reactions you
can't, and that'll become more

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.700
clear next week when we talk
about this in detail.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.360
So, rate laws are not limited
to reactants, sometimes a

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.610
product will show up.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.540
It's not that common, but it's
possible, and again, it's

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.350
experimentally determined.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.210
So the experiment would have to
tell you whether that term

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.850
is going to be there or not.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:13.450
So, occasionally you'll see a
product term in a rate law.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:19.440
So, in terms of m and n, the
orders of the reaction, m and

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:25.030
n can be integers, they can be
whole numbers, or fractions,

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:32.120
negative or positive, lots
of options for m and n.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.610
And let me tell you about all
the options for -- we're going

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.440
to use m here.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.080
So, you have this table in
your notes, most of it is

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.180
blank, some of it is filled in,
and we're going to fill in

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.720
the parts that are not
filled in right now.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.530
So we're going to start in the
middle where the order of the

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:56.470
reaction is one here, m equals
1, and that's called a first

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.400
order reaction.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.570
So these names are pretty
much intuitive

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.800
when you look at them.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.680
So here, the rate law for a
first order reaction would be

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:14.490
our rate constant, k, times
the concentration of a.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:18.090
So let's think about what that
rate law would mean.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.640
Say you double the concentration
of a, what would

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:27.210
happen to the rate
of the reaction?

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:31.830
How many people say double,
raise your hand.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.260
Good, that's what happens.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.370
All right, so it doubled the
rate of the reaction.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.760
So now let's think
about m equals 2.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.730
See on your handout that that's
called second order --

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.960
again these names make sense.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:54.080
The rate law for this would be k
times the concentration of a

00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:01.430
squared, so m equals 2, and
that's shown over here.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.740
If you double the
concentration of

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:11.760
a, what would happen?

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:18.840
So you should quadruple
the rate.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.880
So what about if you tripled
the concentration?

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.930
Why don't you go ahead and tell
me if you triple it for m

00:24:24.930 --> 00:25:03.410
equals 2, what would
happen to the rate?

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:16.870
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.430
Excellent.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.430
That's right, 9 times.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.400
So, you're definitely getting
the hang of this.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.800
All right, so let's move
down and talk about m

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.220
equals minus 1.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.600
If you think of a good name for
this let me know, because

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.470
no one ever calls that
anything, so we

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.980
can leave that blank.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.460
And go ahead and talk about what
the rate would be there

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.580
and how we would write
the rate law.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.260
And so, the rate law, then,
would be k, our rate constant,

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.570
times the concentration of
a raised to the minus 1.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:26:02.700
All right, if we double the
concentration here, just yell

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.690
out what you think
would happen.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.110
You would 1/2 the rate of the
reaction, or you can think

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:14.550
about as 2 to the minus 1, 1/2
the rate of the reaction.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:17.810
And you will have problems on
problem-set 10, which will be

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.240
due a week from Friday where
you're going to be given

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.420
experimental data, and you have
to look at it and see,

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.350
OK, what happened to the rate,
and then what does that mean

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.240
about the order of
the reaction.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.980
So this is a lot of what
the problems are

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.280
like in this unit.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.430
All right, also there is no
name that I'm aware of for

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:44.360
when n equals minus 1/2, but
we can write the rate law.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.750
So that's just going to be k
times the concentration of a

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:52.150
raised to the minus 1/2 --
again, for the order of

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.850
reaction, they can be integers,
they can be

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.520
fractions, they can
be negative,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.050
and they can be positive.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:04.270
So, tell me for doubling the
concentration here of this

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:44.830
one, what's going to
happen to the rate?

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:59.560
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:06.870
Yup, so most people
got that right.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.540
So, if we go back here, 0 .

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.860
7 times the rate, you could
think about this as 2 raised

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.140
to the minus 1/2.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.790
These get a little more
complicated and are some of

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.590
the harder ones on the
problem-set to recognize the

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.600
relationship.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.110
So if you remember all the
possibilities, it's going to

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:25.380
help you think about what's
going on when you see the

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.590
experimental data.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:32.040
All right, so let's go up to m
equals 1/2 here, and this one

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.840
sometimes does have a name --
anyone want to guess what that

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.040
one might be called?

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.960
Half order, very good.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.490
So, half order, and so here our
rate, then, is going to be

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:52.530
equal to k times a to the 1/2.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.540
So, if we double the
concentration here, what

00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:05.120
happens to the rate?

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:15.400
Someone want to yell it out?

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.160
So, 1 .

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.080
4 times the rate.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:26.960
And m equals 0 -- any guess
of what that's called?

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.440
Zero order.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.730
And the rate law here,
the rate is going

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.480
to be equal to what?

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.200
K, and that's it.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.660
So the rate equals k.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.990
So what does that mean -- if you
double the concentration,

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.750
what happens to the rate?

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.780
Yup, no effect on rate.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.800
So that's zero order -- the
concentration term, it doesn't

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.920
matter what the concentration
is, and there will be some

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.570
that you'll see on a problem-set
like that, so if

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.810
there's no effect on rate,
you have a zero order.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.960
So those are the possibilities
that you will see for the

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.470
order of reactions, and again,
you'll be given experimental

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.840
data and have to figure out the
order of the reactions.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.630
And often, it's not just as
simple as one thing, there'll

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.930
probably be two things in
there, so you'll have to

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.150
figure out the order with
respect to both

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.550
of those two things.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:29.740
So that makes it a little
more complicated.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.340
All right, a couple more
things that are

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.370
true about rate laws.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:40.050
So the overall reaction order
is this sum of the exponents

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.680
in the rate law.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:47.800
So then, if you had this rate
law, rate equals k times a to

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:53.220
the 2, second order, and
b 1, the overall order

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.960
for this would be?

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.750
3.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.430
So, we have third order.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.540
Sum of 2 plus 1.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.470
So for this particular one, your
second order with respect

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:12.830
to a, first order with respect
to b, third order overall.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.630
Units.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.470
Units for k are a lot of fun.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:21.120
So it depends on what the
reaction is, and often, for a

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.590
problem, you'll have to figure
out what the units for k are,

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:28.520
depending on are we talking
about molar per second or

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.150
what's going on.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:34.560
So just pay attention to the
units for k, they can vary.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.110
And sometimes one of the
problems will be what are the

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.930
units for this particular k, so
you'll have to figure that

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:47.450
out per problem.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:51.410
So now, again, kinetics is
experimental -- we determine

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.670
rate laws experimentally, and
sometimes this is not easy,

00:31:55.670 --> 00:32:00.120
because sometimes there'll be
very small changes that you're

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.760
looking at, or those changes
will happen really quickly, so

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.290
the interval of time
is very short.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.990
And sometimes when you're
trying to measure these

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.180
changes, the reaction's
happening faster than your

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.050
equipment can record
those changes.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:19.800
So this can be technically very
difficult, and so one

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:24.240
thing that scientists do is they
use integrated rate laws.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.760
So in this way, you can
express concentrations

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.840
directly as a function of time
and you don't have to worry so

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.680
much now about measuring those
small amounts of changes that

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.890
occur are very, very quickly.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.700
So let's talk about integrated
rate laws.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.800
And here, we're going to start
a derivation of an

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.230
integrated rate law.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.410
So here's -- we're told this is
a first order reaction, and

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.290
so we're going to do the first
order integrated rate law.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:58.310
And in this reaction, a is going
to b -- we can write a

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:03.150
rate expression for this.
so we can talk about the

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:08.030
disappearance minus
d a over d t.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.500
We can also now write the rate
law for a first order

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.930
reaction, and we know that that
is our rate constant,

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:18.710
small k, times the concentration
of a.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.510
So we know we can write the rate
expression, and we can

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:25.840
write a rate law for this
first order reaction.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.010
So now, we can do
a derivation.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.430
So, in this derivation, we're
going to separate our

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.780
concentration terms and our time
terms. So we're going to

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.620
move everything with
concentration to one side, and

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.910
things with time to
the other side.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:45.120
So, on one side, then, we can
have 1 over the concentration

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.780
of a, we're going to bring
that down here.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.910
We have d a over here, and
then we have our negative

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:57.130
sign, and our k over here, and
move d t also over to the

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:58.650
other side.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:02.130
So now we have concentration
terms on one side and time

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.600
terms on the other side.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.200
And now, as you might have
guessed from the name

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.230
integrated rate laws, we can
integrate, and so we can look

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.910
at the interval from the initial
concentration or

00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:19.410
original concentration of
a, to concentration of a

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:21.190
at some time, t.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:27.330
And we can also look at from
some time, 0, to the time, t,

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.380
in question.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:34.780
So there's that expression
again.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.860
Now you can write this
expression also in terms of

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.660
natural log.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.940
So we can re-write this in terms
of the natural log of

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:47.340
the concentration of a at time,
t, minus the natural log

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.340
of the concentration of a at
our original time, or the

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:58.990
original concentration,
equals minus k t.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.430
And you can also express it in
this term, so you can just

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.310
bring this guy over to the other
side of the equation,

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.680
and this is one expression for
the integrated rate law that

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.830
you will see.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.640
There's also another expression
that you'll see,

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.870
and let's show you
what that is.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:22.180
So you can also take the natural
log and bring these

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.480
two terms together.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.970
So natural log of your
concentration of a at time t,

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:30.540
over your original concentration
of a

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.630
equals minus k t.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:36.580
And now you can take the inverse
natural log of both

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.280
sides, so just your
concentration at time t over

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.040
your initial concentration
equals e to the minus k t.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.690
And that expression is often
written in your book or on

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.380
equation sheets as a
concentration at a particular

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:57.910
time equals the concentration of
the original material, e to

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.890
the minus k t.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:03.160
And these are the two
expressions that you'll see

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.040
the most often.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.560
This one is often referred to as
your integrated first order

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.180
rate law, whereas this
one is the equation

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.020
for a straight line.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.250
So these two are the ones that
you will see the most often

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:23.960
for integrated first
order rate laws.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:27.830
So one was an equation for a
straight line, so let's come

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.840
up with a straight line.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.690
So if you plot your data,
if you've measured your

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:38.470
concentration of a at various
times, you can take the

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.210
natural log of those
concentrations that you

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:45.040
measured and plot them
against time.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.650
And if you do this, and it is,
in fact, a first order

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.730
reaction, you should get
a straight line.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:55.750
So here, we can look at this in
terms of a straight line,

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.800
so on y-axis, we have the
natural log of the

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.700
concentration of a at a
particular time, and that's

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.610
plotted against time, over
here in seconds.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.570
And so, what does that mean in
terms of what is this, what is

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:21.020
the intercept here?

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.190
Yup.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.240
So the natural log of your
initial original

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.190
concentration of a.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.880
And what is the slope
of this line?

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.730
The slope is negative k, and
so the slope is really what

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.100
people are after.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.770
So often what you want to do is
measure rate constants for

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:47.890
particular reactions, and if
you can then measure the

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:50.860
concentration of a at particular
times and plot it

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.270
this way, you can come out
with your rate constant.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.650
And that's what you want to
know, and those are some of

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.280
the problems that you're
going to see.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.390
Are you going to see
experimental data for what

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.200
happens to rate at particular
concentrations, and you can

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:11.390
come up with values for
your rate constants.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:17.660
So, let's talk about one other
thing, which is half life.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.400
So people are often very
concerned with half life.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.440
When do you hear about
half life a lot?

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.930
Does anyone know?

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.480
Yeah, when we talk about
radioactivity, which we'll be

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.460
talking about next class.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.620
They're very concerned about
the half life, which is the

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.830
time it takes for the full
amount of your original

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:46.460
material to be reduced
by a 1/2.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:50.330
So we can look at an equation
that we had up above for our

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:54.520
integrated first order half
life, and we can think about

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.260
this in terms of a half
life expression.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.610
So here, t has a particular
special meaning -- we have t,

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:07.770
1/2, which is the abbreviation
for half life.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:11.500
And so half life by definition
is the amount of time it takes

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.870
for the original concentration
to be reduced by 1/2.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:18.740
So here we have our final
concentration, concentration

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:20.390
of a at a time t.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:25.080
So when we're talking about half
life, we're going to have

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.180
1/2 as much as we had
when we started.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:33.490
So our a t is going to be our
original divided by 2, 1/2 the

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.700
amount we had in
the beginning.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:41.930
And so, now t has a special
name, it's t to the 1/2 here.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:46.930
So now we can simplify this
expression to come up with an

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:52.620
expression for half life for
a first order reaction.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:57.790
So, the a to the 0, our original
concentrations cancel

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.280
out, and so we have the natural
log of 1/2 equals

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:07.480
minus k, our rate constant,
times t 1/2.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.700
The natural log of
1/2 is minus 0 .

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.810
6 9 3 1.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:19.540
We can get rid of our negative
signs and solve for t 1/2,

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.950
because this is a half
life expression, so t

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.640
1/2 equals 0 .

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.670
6 9 3 1 over k.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:34.410
So that's an expression just for
a first order half life.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.730
And notice that half life
does not depend on

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.000
concentration here.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.030
That term dropped out.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:46.220
So half life depends on our
rate constant, k, and k

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.550
depends on the material
in question.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:53.480
So, for radioactive material,
some radioactive materials

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.980
have short half lifes, so their
k's are very different

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.730
from each other, and so that
can be very important,

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.450
especially when you're thinking
about storing

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.330
radioactive waste.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:11.110
So, using that value, tell me,
for the same material then,

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:15.530
does it take longer to go from
1 ton to a 1/2 ton, or from 1

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:43.180
gram to 1/2 gram?

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:57.670
Let's just take 10
more seconds.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.220
Yup, it takes the same
amount of time.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:06.110
And then just to finish up here,
we have one more thing

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.900
to do and then we're done.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.790
So here, in a plot for a first
order half life, the

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:17.950
concentration of the material
at the first half life has

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:22.040
dropped by how much?

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.860
1/2.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.020
At the second half
life is what?

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:30.380
STUDENT: 1/4.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.120
PROFESSOR: And the
third half life?

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:34.450
STUDENT: 1/8

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:38.900
PROFESSOR: Yup, so that's
first order half life.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.790
All right, everybody, have
a happy Thanksgiving.

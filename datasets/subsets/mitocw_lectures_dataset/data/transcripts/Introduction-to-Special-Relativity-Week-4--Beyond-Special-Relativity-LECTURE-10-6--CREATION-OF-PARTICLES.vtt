00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.938
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, special relativity.

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:11.480
In the previous
section, we have seen

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.170
how we can look at energy
and momentum of particles

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.219
in a decay.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.220
Here we now want to, in
collisions of particles,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.230
create new particles.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.360
The example, the
first example here,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.830
is the collision of two protons
to create a proton, a neutron,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.510
and a charged pion.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.080
The masses are given there.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040
So the question now is,
what is the minimal energy

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.790
needed in order for
this process to occur

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.950
in a fixed-target experiment?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.550
Fixed-target experiment is
we have an accelerated proton

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.990
and another proton at rest.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.570
This might just be a hydrogen
target just sitting there.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.420
So the question is,
how much energy--

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.460
how much do we
have to accelerate

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.930
the proton for this
process to be possible?

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.700
Now, again, stop the video,
and try to work this out.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.350
The important part
here is to realize

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.100
that minimal energy here
means that, after the decay

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.890
or the decay after
the process occurred,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.770
all the new particles
need to be addressed.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.610
That is when the process
requires minimal energy.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.300
So, instead of analyzing
this in the laboratory frame,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.825
we want to analyze this in
the center-of-mass frame.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:27.200
All right, the
momentum has to be

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.220
conserved in this discussion.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.440
So there needs to be
some sort of momentum.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.720
But, in the center-of-mass
frame, that's not required.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.890
So, in that frame, the momentum
of all outgoing particles

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.720
can be 0.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.710
And that's how we start
the discussion here.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170
So, in this S prime frame--

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.840
here S prime is the
center-of-mass frame--

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.800
the energy, the minimal
energy required, is 2 times

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.890
the mass of the
proton times gamma.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.990
So here, two protons
are colliding

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.690
with the same velocity.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.250
And that's then
equal to the energy

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.675
after this process, c squared
times the sum of the masses,

00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:05.880
the sum of the mass of
the proton, the neutron,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.190
and the charged pion.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.710
And then you just have
to solve this for gamma

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.360
to find gamma equal to 1.08
or beta in this frame of 0.37.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.410
Note, this is the gamma,
relativistic gamma,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.220
or the velocity beta of
the protons, two protons

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.630
in the center-of-mass frame.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.100
So we're not quite there
yet with our answer.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.430
The answer then needs
to be boosted back

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.140
into the laboratory frame.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.470
And we have seen how we can
do this for beta or velocities

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.050
in general.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.510
We find beta in the
laboratory frame is 2 times--

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.890
or just result, 0.37,
over 1 plus 0.37

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.680
squared, which is 0.65.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.440
That velocity, we can
then take and calculate

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.210
the gamma factor of the proton
in the fixed-target experiment.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.210
All right, so we
analyzed this situation

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.310
in the center-of-mass
frame and then

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.060
did a Lorentz transformation
by just looking at the velocity

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.890
into the fixed-target frame.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.750
So this means now, numerically,
that the proton colliding

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.100
with the proton at rest has
a total energy of this one

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:27.210
proton of gamma m0 c squared,
which is 0.32 times 938 MeV

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.230
over c--

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.970
MeV.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.370
And so that results
in 1.238 GeV.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.110
But we're interested
in the kinetic energy.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.660
So the kinetic
energy here is given

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.770
by gamma minus 1 m0 c
squared, which is 300 MeV.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.730
So we have to accelerate
a proton to 300 MeV

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.430
in order to be able to
have this process to occur.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.250
All right, very similar
problem now, but here

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.750
we want to produce anti-matter.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.870
So we have a process of proton
plus proton into three protons

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.450
and an antiproton.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.930
Charge is conserved.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.760
In the initial state,
the charge was 2.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.730
In the final stage, the
charge was plus 2 as well.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.089
OK, this works very similar
as in the previous problem.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.360
But what we want to do here
is compare the fixed target

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.640
with symmetric collisions.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.370
OK, so, again, the question
is, what is the minimal energy

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.980
needed in order to
produce antiprotons

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.270
in proton-proton collisions?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.730
OK, so, exactly following
the same procedure as before,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.670
in the center-of-mass
energy, the energy is 2 times

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.400
the mass of the protons
times gamma times c squared.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.430
And that's 4 times the
mass of the proton.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.640
OK, gamma prime,
so the gamma factor

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.380
in the center-of-mass
frame is 2.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.180
Beta is 0.75.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.370
And then we just do the
very same thing again.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.190
We calculate the velocity
in the fixed-target frame.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.330
And we find the velocity of
beta of 0.96 and gamma of 3.57.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.880
So, if we compare this now,
we need a pair of 1 GeV--

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.140
remember, gamma minus 1
is the kinetic energy--

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.630
protons in a collider
experiment or 2.57 GeV

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.940
protons in a
fixed-target experiment.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.080
OK, so you see that, in
fixed-target experiment,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.910
in order to produce
new particles,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.556
the energy has to be much
larger, a factor of 2.5

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:31.110
here in this example, than
a colliding experiment.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.360
And that explains why we use
collider experiments in order

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.170
to test the energy frontier,
in order to produce the largest

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.190
possible energies.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.770
And the LHC is one
example where we

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.430
have proton-proton collisions
in a circular ring where

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.960
those protons are
brought together

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.890
in symmetrical collisions.

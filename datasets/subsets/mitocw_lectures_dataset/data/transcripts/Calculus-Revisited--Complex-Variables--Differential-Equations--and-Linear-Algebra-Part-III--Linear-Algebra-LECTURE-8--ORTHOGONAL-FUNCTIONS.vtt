00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:31.800
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.730
Welcome to our final lecture
in part three of calculus.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.850
And I suppose it would be nice
to have an appropriate story

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.660
to tell.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.700
And the only story
I can think of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.780
is, on the transatlantic
flight, the stewardess coming in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.320
to the passenger's cabin
midway over the Atlantic Ocean

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.150
and saying to the
passengers, well,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.100
I have some good news and
some bad news for you.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.380
The bad news is that
we're almost out of gas.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.780
And the good news is that
we're making wonderful time.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.870
And the reason I thought
of this particular story

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.960
is that, in a sense, we
are not almost out of gas,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.420
but in terms of this being a
fundamentals type of course

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.120
in which we're trying to
give the ingredients of what

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.870
goes into all advanced
mathematics courses,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.510
we have sort of come
to the end of the road.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.250
We have finished the so-called
ABC's of mathematics.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.860
As far as making wonderful
time is concerned,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.550
I would say we've done
deliberately just the opposite,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.210
that we have essentially taken
one or two central themes

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.590
and tried to unify all
of elementary calculus

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.530
in terms of these
central themes.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.030
And when you do
something like this,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.760
it's very difficult to come
to the end of a course.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.712
You sort of don't
know where to stop.

00:01:49.712 --> 00:01:51.420
So you go back to a
little trick that you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.352
learned in about the third grade
when you wrote compositions

00:01:54.352 --> 00:01:56.310
where you learned that
you could write anything

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.040
that you wanted as long
as the last line was,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.410
we all had a very nice time.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.420
So we now must look
for a line along

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.970
those particular thoughts.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.350
And if we recall that we
began as our major theme

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.790
in this course the idea
of mathematical structure,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.980
the idea of what new math really
meant, not new meaning brand

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.820
new, but new meaning the
opposite of passe, new meaning

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.900
meaningful, I can
think of no nicer way

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.440
of ending the course than
by picking as an application

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.810
a topic that existed long before
the so-called new math was

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.630
born, and which
exists in an even

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.160
more enlightened way in the
spirit of the new mathematics.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.530
And the topic that I have
in mind to conclude with--

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.890
and it also ties in with
our lecture of last time

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.060
on the dot product--

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.090
is the subject called
orthogonal functions,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.470
which has as a special
subtopic, Fourier series.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.200
Now the way this comes
about is the following.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.110
And you have to know
nothing about vector spaces

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.260
to appreciate what we're going
to do now, that in a sense

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.950
we imitate what Fourier
actually did in trying to solve

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.690
a particular type of problem.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.620
We suppose that we have an
infinite sequence of, functions

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.615
which I'll denote by
the family phi sub

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.780
n of x, and a particular
closed interval

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.510
from a to b such that each
member of my family phi sub n

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.310
of x is integral on the
interval from a to b.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.370
And we'll also assume
that the integral from a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.870
to b of the product of any
two of these functions, two

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.170
different members of the
set, that that integral is 0.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.050
In other words, the
interval from a to b

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.210
phi sub i of x times
phi sub j of x dx

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.190
is 0, provided i
is unequal to j.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.920
So we're assuming this
particular property,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.870
remembering of course
that the product of two

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.790
integral functions
is, again, integrable

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.680
so that this thing makes sense.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.920
Now traditionally, when
a family of functions

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.650
had this particular
property, that family

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.360
was set to be orthogonal on
the interval from a to b.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.310
And I will leave
it for a little bit

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.360
later to show you how this jibes
with the meaning of orthogonal

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.839
as we defined it in terms
of dot products last time.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.750
Let me show you how,
for example, Fourier

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.400
decided to use this
type of information.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.230
Suppose we had a
given function f

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.500
of x that also happened to
be integrable on the interval

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.520
from a to b.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.590
Or written more
succinctly, we assume

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.160
that the integral from
a to b f of x dx exists.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.430
Let's also suppose
that f of x happens

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.670
to be a linear
combination of the members

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.270
of the orthogonal family phi
sub n of x, in other words,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.800
that for the given
orthogonal family, f of x

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.990
is summation Cn phi n of x
as n goes from 1 to infinity.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.090
And the question is, under--

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.370
or with the knowledge that
this is an orthogonal family,

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.400
how can we determine
each coefficient C sub

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.310
n if this condition
here is the whole?

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.100
Or to make this more
concrete and keep

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.350
it as non-symbolic
as possible, let's

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.320
suppose I wanted to figure
out here what C sub 3

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.000
happened to be.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.290
The trick is this.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.440
I recognize that, from
this basic definition,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.170
if I multiply phi sub 3 of x by
any other member of this family

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.140
other than phi sub 3
itself and integrate from a

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.540
to b, that term will be 0.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.930
So what I do is I come
back to this relationship.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.980
And I multiply both sides of
this equation by phi sub 3

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.880
of x, keeping in mind if
I wanted to find C sub k,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.490
I would have multiplied both
sides by phi sub k of x.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.940
I'm just picking
k equals 3 here.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.560
I multiply both sides
by phi sub 3 of x.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.830
And because phi sub 3 of x is
a constant subscript, meaning

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.600
it doesn't depend on the
summation n which only affects

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.810
the subscript here, I
can bring phi sub up 3

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.120
of x inside the summation sign.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.100
Now the trick is I integrate
both sides of this equality

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.750
from a to b.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.160
In other words,
I put an integral

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.670
from a to b on both sides
here, augment this with a dx.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.730
And I now know that
this is the case.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.407
My next gimmick, if you
want to call it that--

00:06:20.407 --> 00:06:21.990
and if you don't
want to call it that,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.790
you should, because
it is a gimmick,

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.260
as we'll explain in the moment--

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.240
I simply interchange the order
of summation and integration,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.430
remembering that the
integral of the sum

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.300
is the sum of the integrals.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.060
I interchange this order.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.820
And I now have the
summation n goes from 1

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.720
to infinity integral from a to
b Cn phi n of x phi 3 of x dx.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.660
And now remembering
that the integral

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.920
from a to b, phi sub n of
x times phi sub 3 of x dx,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.290
by definition of orthogonality
is 0 unless n equals 3,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.070
all of these terms drop
out except when n equals 3.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.270
Now what happens here?

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.960
When n equals 3, this
term here is C sub 3.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.910
This is phi sub 3 squared x
dx integrated from a to b.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.750
And all the remaining terms are
0, because the integrand is 0.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.970
In other words, the right-hand
side simply becomes--

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.460
well, since C3 is a
constant, I can take it

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.840
outside the integral sign.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.180
It's C3 integral from a to
b C sub 3 squared of x dx.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.640
And now you see from
this relationship here,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.850
I can solve for C sub 3.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.150
Namely, I simply divide
both sides of this equation

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.410
by this number here.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.750
Now what I said by
gimmick is simply this.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.000
When we said that
the integral of a sum

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.210
is the sum of the integrals,
that was only for a finite sum.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.310
You may remember in
part one of our course

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.310
when we talked about uniform
convergence, one of the things

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.010
that we pointed out was
that for infinite sums,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.490
you weren't always guaranteed
that you could interchange

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.010
the order of summation
and integration.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.350
Or as I usually put it, you
could always interchange them,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.782
but you may not get
the same answer.

00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:09.240
So the first question
that comes up

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.850
is, how do I know
that I am allowed

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.670
to interchange this order?

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.292
By the way, the second
question that comes up is--

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:18.750
and this is a more
subtle question,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.980
but going back to what
we're talking about before--

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.950
how do I even know that there is
a linear combination of the phi

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.560
sub n's that comes out
to be the given f of x?

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.600
You see you notice that
our demonstration here

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.456
presupposes that f of x
can be written this way.

00:08:33.456 --> 00:08:35.039
You see the two
questions that come up

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.130
is, given an f of
x, first of all,

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.000
can it be written this way?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.539
And secondly, even
if it can, do we

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.930
have the right to interchange
the order of integration

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:46.872
and summation?

00:08:46.872 --> 00:08:48.330
By the way, assuming
for the moment

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.700
that we can do this
mechanically at least,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.430
notice that what
C3 turns out to be

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.610
is the integral from
a to b f of x phi sub

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.600
3 of x dx divided by the
integral form a to b phi sub 3

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.430
of x squared times dx, and
again, replacing the 3 by a k.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.620
This is how every one
of these coefficients

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.240
could have been determined.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.070
And now you see, as
a very, very brief

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.660
aside which I will go into much
more detail in the study guide

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.270
when we talk about the exercises
and the various discussion

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.770
of the exercises, given a
series of functions which

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.520
is integrable, a
sequence of functions

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.240
integrable on a given
interval from a to b,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.700
one usually defines the dot
product of these two functions

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.930
to be the integral from a
to b the product of the two

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.910
functions times dx.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.490
You see, remember
last time we showed

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.570
that all you needed
to have a dot product

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.700
was a rule that showed
you how to combine

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.950
two members of your set
to give you a number?

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.170
And certainly, this
thing here is a number.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.470
And it also had to have three
or four basic properties.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.260
And as one of the
exercises, we will

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.560
show that those properties for
a dot product are obeyed here.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.630
But this is where the word
"orthogonal functions"

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.690
come from.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.830
Notice that in terms of this
definition of a dot product,

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.995
two vectors are orthogonal
if their dot product is 0.

00:10:08.995 --> 00:10:10.620
And now they're saying
that this equals

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.590
0 is the same as saying
that this integral is 0.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.130
And that's precisely what the
definition of orthogonal was.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.110
So you see, this
is the connection

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.770
between the vector space
interpretation of orthogonal

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.828
and the traditional
interpretation of orthogonal.

00:10:26.828 --> 00:10:28.620
And as I say, I'll
leave further discussion

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.030
of that for the notes.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.900
But the important point is this.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.800
If I mechanically solve
for these coefficients--

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.410
in other words, suppose
I'm given f of x.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.500
And I'm given a
family of functions

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.840
phi sub n of x which is
orthogonal on the interval

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.130
from a to b.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.280
Suppose that without even
knowing whether f of x

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.133
can be represented as a linear
combination of the phis,

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:52.425
and that without even knowing
whether I can interchange

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:56.020
these two operations, the order
in which I perform these two

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.990
operations, let's suppose
that I mechanically

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.770
invent as my coefficients the
C's in this particular way.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.740
In other words,
regardless of whether it

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.540
means anything or
not, I can always

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.720
multiply f of x by phi sub k
of x, integrate from a to b.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.720
You see, the product of
two integrable functions

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.010
is always integrable.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:19.760
I can always divide that by the
square of the function phi sub

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.770
k of x from a to b, keeping
in mind, by the way, that

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.750
as long as phi sub 3
is not identically 0

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:35.550
or if it's not 0 other than
on a set of points of measure

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.030
0, what have you, notice
that the square of a number

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.170
can't be negative.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.310
So if phi sub 3 of x
is different from 0

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.170
in enough places,
by squaring it,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.920
I have a positive integrand.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.920
And when I integrate
a positive integrand

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.720
I can't get 0 for an answer.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.640
So I don't have a
zero denominator here.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.120
But the point is this.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.250
If I choose the
C's as I did here,

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:04.710
see, with the C's as just
defined, we write that f is x--

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.640
and then we put a
little squiggle here.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.490
See, don't know if
we had the right

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.760
to assume that this series
here is equal to f of x,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.220
but we write this little
squiggle mark here.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.780
We call the resulting infinite
series capital F of x.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.120
And what we say
is that capital F

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.920
of x is the Fourier
representation of little f of x

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.530
with respect to the
family phi sub n of x.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.200
You see, we don't say
that these two are equal.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.570
But when we choose these
coefficients the way I just

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.090
mentioned, this
is, in any event,

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.990
called the Fourier
representation of the function

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.800
little f of x.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.140
I see there are many
questions that come up.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.180
And in the form of an overview,
let me just state them.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.720
First of all, how do we
know that capital F of x

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.130
is even a convergent series?

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.930
After all, this is
an infinite series.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.060
How do we know it
even converges?

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.910
Secondly, if it does
converge, how do we know

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.580
that it converges to f of x?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.440
The answer is we don't know.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.520
We really don't know.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.640
But there is a rather
remarkable result.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.100
And the result is not
that difficult to prove.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.960
But in the form
of an overview, I

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.820
prefer to omit the proof here.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.000
It will be an exercise
in the study guide,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.010
but I think it's
important to see what

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.710
the statement of the result is.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.530
And then we can talk about
the ramifications of that.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.540
But the proof would
actually obscure

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.340
the beauty of the result.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.390
And the aside, which I leave
as an exercise, is simply this.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.820
Suppose you took a
linear combination

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:39.780
of the first n of the terms
phi 1 of x up to phi n of x.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.890
If you choose the C sub k's
to be the so-called Fourier

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.170
coefficients the way
I just mentioned,

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.010
what is interesting is this,
that even if the Fourier

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.760
representation doesn't
converge to f of x,

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.480
it has the property that
it gives you the best

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.250
least square approximation.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.550
In other words, if
I were to compute

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:07.080
the difference between f of
x and the sum of the first n

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.350
terms in the Fourier
representation

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.840
where the C's were chosen
according to the method I just

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.548
mentioned to you
before and square

00:14:15.548 --> 00:14:17.340
that difference-- you
see, this is why it's

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.410
called the mean square idea.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.140
You see, large errors and
small errors, in other words,

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.330
a large negative error can
cancel a large positive error

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.360
because the algebraic signs
tend to cancel one another.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.590
But by squaring large errors,
all of these become what?

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.420
Squares of large magnitudes
are large positive magnitudes.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.810
By squaring, I really
magnify the errors.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.150
The positives can't
cancel the negatives.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.730
And what this says
is that if I use

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.780
this linear combination
of the phi sub n's,

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:58.610
that the square
approximation error is less

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.760
using these coefficients
than if I had used

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.180
any other possible
coefficients, that if I picked

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.790
any other coefficients in the
whole world other than the ones

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.610
that I found by the method
indicated just a little while

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.770
ago, if I summed these
terms, subtracted that

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.790
from f of x squared and
integrated the results from a

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.510
to b, I would get a number
which was at least as large.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.000
And in most cases in
fact, unless the d sub k's

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.040
were chosen to equal
the C sub k's, I

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.950
would get a number which
was larger than this.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.930
Now you see what
this thing says?

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.220
What this says is that there
can't be any real interval

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.370
where this gets
very, very far away

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.550
from f of x, because you see,
if it did, if it did get very,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.630
very far away, this would
be a large magnitude.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.020
Squaring it would give me
a positive large magnitude.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.810
Integrating that from a to b
would make this thing still

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:54.980
very, very large.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.740
And why should it stay
smaller than any other linear

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.600
combination that I can get?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.330
And I'll emphasize this
more from a concrete point

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.960
of view in a few moments.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.910
But for the time being, what the
impact of this beautiful result

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.648
is-- and notice, it
doesn't look like much when

00:16:10.648 --> 00:16:11.690
you look at it like this.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.640
It just looks like
some abstract remark.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.910
But the beauty of this
remark the impact of it

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.370
is that, when you write
the so-called Fourier

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.187
representation, as opposed to
power series, which I'll also

00:16:23.187 --> 00:16:24.770
mention at the end
of the lecture what

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.660
the contrast really is, the
Fourier representation, if it

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.740
does converge at all, converges
to the function, what we call

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.170
in the large, that
over the whole interval

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.940
it starts to fit the
function very nicely.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.790
Now I'll come back
to that in terms

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.310
of a more specific
example in a few moments.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.670
Let me point out that, Fourier,
being basically an engineer

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.150
and a scientist, worked
with one particular set

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.410
of orthogonal functions, a set
of orthogonal functions that

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.110
were very, very natural
to anybody working

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.110
with wave motion or
things of this type,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.280
as you'll see in a moment.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.750
The special case that
I have in mind is this.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.050
Consider the family
of functions--

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.003
well, I can call
this cosine 0x, which

00:17:08.003 --> 00:17:09.170
is another way of writing 1.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:14.819
But I have 1 cosine x, cosine
2x, cosine 3x, cosine 4x,

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.920
et cetera, and also
included in this family,

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.339
sine x, sine 2x,
sine 3x, et cetera.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.609
I claim that this
family of functions

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.780
is orthogonal on the interval
from negative pi to pi.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.190
What I mean by that is what?

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.760
That if I take any two different
members of this family,

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.620
multiply them together,
integrate from minus pi to pi,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.453
the result will always be 0.

00:17:41.453 --> 00:17:43.370
Now the-- I won't go
through this whole thing.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.700
That will also be one of the
exercises in the study guide

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.750
will be to verify this.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.850
But let me give you a
head start in doing this.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.850
Let me pick two members of the
cosine, two different numbers

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.240
of the cosine family here,
and multiply them together,

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.890
and integrate from
minus pi to pi.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.410
In other words, let me
take integral from minus pi

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:07.350
to pi cosine mx cosine nx
dx where m is unequal to n.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.430
Now again, without
belaboring this point,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.090
remember that the formula
for cosine a cosine b

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.600
comes from looking at the
formulas for cosine a plus b

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.070
cosine of a minus b and
adding these two results.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.650
And the sine a sine
b terms drop out.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.680
To make a long story
short, or somewhat shorter,

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.430
cosine mx times cosine
nx is another way

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.780
of writing one half
the sum of cosine m

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.820
plus nx plus cosine m minus n x.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.160
Now you see, to integrate
this, very simply,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.320
this just gives me what?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.530
A 1/2 here.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.100
This is sine m plus
n x over m plus n.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.020
This is sine m minus x--

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.010
m minus n times
x over m minus n.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.010
And those, by the way, the
fact that m is unequal to n,

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.290
guarantees me that my
denominator here can't be zero.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.970
And at any rate, noticing
that when I evaluate this

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:10.620
from x equals minus pi to
pi, that these are integral,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.410
meaning whole-number
multiples of pi,

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.180
both these terms are zero.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.240
And we've established the
fact that this is zero.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.500
So at least the members of the
cosine family are orthogonal.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.550
One can also show the members of
the sine family are orthogonal.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.420
And one can also show that any
member of the cosine family

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.770
taken--

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.950
multiplied by any member of
the sine family integrated

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.220
from minus pi to
pi also gives zero.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.620
So the point then
is, fair enough,

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.640
that this family here
is an orthogonal family

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.310
on the interval
from minus pi to pi.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.700
And the beauty of this result--

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.850
and let me point out
that in textbooks

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.560
on advanced mathematics,
the multitude of pages

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.800
I use to prove the
results, but the statements

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.710
of the terms that
you prove are not

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.170
that difficult to keep track of.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.100
Let me just give one major
result, a result that

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.290
is very, very crucial,
and one that I will

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.390
emphasize in the study guide.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.620
And that is this.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.620
Suppose that I am given a
particular function little

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.250
f of x, which is piecewise
smooth on the interval

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.035
from minus pi to pi.

00:20:22.035 --> 00:20:23.910
And remember what I mean
by piecewise smooth.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.460
I mean it's a differentiable
function except that it

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.880
may have a finite number
of jump discontinuities,

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.730
that if I plot the
graph y equals f of x,

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.630
I get a smooth curve with
the possible exception

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:41.070
that there may be a few jumps
in it, by few meaning what?

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.550
A not-too-great infinite
number, a set of measures

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.400
zero type thing.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.130
But we won't belabor
that point right now.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.500
But the idea is this.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.620
Suppose that I have this
piecewise smooth function

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.880
little f of x.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.270
And suppose capital
F of x is the Fourier

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.630
representation of little f
of x relative to my sines

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:01.290
and cosines.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:06.000
In other words, capital F of
x is the linear combinations

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.460
of the cosine terms
and the sine terms

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.127
where the coefficients are
chosen by that little recipe

00:21:11.127 --> 00:21:13.210
that I showed you at the
beginning of the lecture,

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.940
and which, as I
say, I'll reinforce

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.790
as we do the exercises.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:21.127
At any rate, let's call
this capital F of x.

00:21:21.127 --> 00:21:22.960
And in this particular
case, in other words,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.050
what particular case?

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.150
If little f of x
is piecewise smooth

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.300
and the orthogonal functions
are the sines and cosines

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.420
on the interval from
minus pi the pi, then

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.800
the Fourier representation
of f of x, capital F of x,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.430
is given by the following.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.280
And this is a
remarkable result. It

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.910
says that capital F
of x at any value of x

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.250
in the interval
from minus pi to pi

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:52.860
is little f of x plus plus
little f of x minus over 2.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.030
Now, what does f of x plus mean?

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:59.280
That means the limit of f of x
as you approach the given value

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.140
of x from the positive side.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.870
And this f is x
minus is the limit

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.510
of f of x as you approach
the given value of x

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.040
from the negative side.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.900
In fact, to keep this
easier to understand

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.100
so I don't use x in two
different ways, what I'm saying

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.030
is capital F of x sub 0
is computed as follows.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.470
See what little f of x sub
0 is as x approaches x0

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.550
from the left.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:28.035
See what f of x0 of f of x
approaches as x approaches x0

00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:28.660
from the right.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.140
Add these two results
and divide by 2.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.930
I hope that you can see
that what I'm doing here

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.330
is taking the average
of these two results.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.610
Half the sum is the average.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:46.460
Also observe that if f happens
to be continuous at x0,

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.190
f of x0 plus is the
same as f of x0 minus.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.710
You see, the only time
that these two things can

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:59.220
be different is if there is
a jump in the function at x0,

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.440
because if there is no jump,
as I approach x0 from the left

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.510
and approach x0 from the
right, the two values I get

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.870
must be the same.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.460
In other words, notice
that at the points where

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:16.590
f is continuous, this is nothing
more than f of x0 itself.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.960
And what this famous
result says is

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.130
that, except at the points
at which little f of x

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:27.240
is discontinuous, capital F,
the Fourier representation,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.450
is little f itself,
that the Fourier

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.150
representation converges
to the function itself.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.090
And what it does
that's remarkable

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.960
is that where there is
a jump in the function,

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.310
it equals the
average of the jump.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.010
Well, let me show you that
in terms of an example.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.440
Let me pick a very simple
function to begin with.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.970
Let me define the
function little f

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:56.460
of x to be negative 1 when x is
in the interval from minus pi

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.510
to 0.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:02.820
And let it be, say,
positive 1 when x is

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.080
in the interval from 0 to pi.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.830
So graphically, you see how
this thing is going to look.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.670
It goes like this.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.950
By the way, notice that this
is what mathematically we

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.070
call an odd function.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.710
F of x is the negative
of f of minus x.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.650
Notice that the
sine terms are odd.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.300
The cosine terms are even.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.690
You see, cosine of x is the
same as cosine of minus x.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:33.130
But sine of x is
minus sine minus x.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.230
So the sine terms are odd.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.210
The cosine terms are even.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.120
So the first hint or the
first nice simplification

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.310
that takes place by
choosing this example

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.110
is that because this
is an odd function,

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.550
the cosine terms
will all be absent.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.430
And it turns out that if I use
the procedure indicated earlier

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.370
in the lecture--

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.162
and again that will be
one of the exercises

00:24:54.162 --> 00:24:56.350
so that you get the drill
that's necessary here,

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.810
again, I only want to
give you the overview--

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.290
it turns out that the
Fourier series representation

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.020
of this particular
function, capital F of x,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:10.000
turns out to be 4 over pi
times the summation sine

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.340
n x over n for n odd.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.730
And what that means is
it's 4 over pi times

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:24.490
sine x plus sine 3x over 3
plus sine 5x over 5, et cetera.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.670
By the way, these are very
difficult things to draw.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.740
You're not used to
working with these.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.010
I should point out this, that
if there is anything that

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.145
works nicely in the laboratory,
it's sine and cosine terms,

00:25:36.145 --> 00:25:38.020
because those are things
that you can produce

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.360
very nicely on an oscilloscope.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.630
Analytically, these are
very nasty terms to handle.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:47.470
But electronically,
it's a very nice way

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.540
of getting a feeling
for Fourier series.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.100
But I don't have
electronic chalk here,

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.580
so I just talk about it and
draw these things for you.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.590
But for example, to
show you what I mean

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.560
here, let me just take
the first two terms.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.180
Let me plot the curve y
equals 4 over pi times

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:08.170
the quantity sine x
plus sine 3x over 3.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.370
And if I plot that curve,
which I've done here

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.810
in the accentuated
chalk, look at how nicely

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:19.150
that curve starts already to
fit the graph y equals f of x.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.650
You see how it fits over here?

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:25.750
No perfect fit any place, but
notice that, by and large, it

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.100
fits the curve very nicely
without too big an error all

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.015
the way along here.

00:26:31.015 --> 00:26:32.890
It has roughly the right shape.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:37.210
And notice also it goes
through the origin,

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:40.030
because when x is 0,
capital F of x is 0.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.130
And that's exactly the
average of the jump over here.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.110
So you jump from minus 1 to 1.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.590
So the origin is the
average over here.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.320
By the way, even though I
don't draw very well, what

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.630
I have tried to do
here is show what

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.390
happens if I tack on just
a couple of more terms.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:59.530
I've tacked onto this
the term sine 5x over 5

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.690
and sine 7x over 7.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.240
And then the graph would
look something like this.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.330
You see how nicely
this starts to fit?

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.100
It fits very nicely along here.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.060
But wherever there's a jump,
it jumps to-- it averages

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.740
out this way.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.350
By the way, one
other observation--

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.830
obviously, the function
is I'm constructing here

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.960
is periodic with period 2 pi.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.400
If I replace x by x plus 2 pi,
I don't change the sine any.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.020
And so obviously,
the function which

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.230
I'm calling capital F
of x represents more

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.670
than this given function.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:38.200
Rather, it represents the given
function reproduced infinitely

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.260
in both directions
with period 2 pi.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.140
But again, I'll leave
that for the exercises.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.700
To summarize what's
happened over here,

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.370
you see how nicely
this thing fits?

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:52.390
If I actually took capital F
of x and computed this limit

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.300
for each value of x,
what the graph would look

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.000
like-- now obviously,
I can't get this

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.860
on the oscilloscope, because
no matter how many terms I use,

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.800
no matter how large a
number, n is still finite.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.080
But if I actually
took the infinite sum,

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.810
the graph that I would
get mathematically

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:12.680
is I would actually get the
straight line x equals--

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.900
I'm sorry, y equals
negative from minus pi to 0.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:23.260
It would be y equals
positive 1 from 0 to pi.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:27.400
And at 0 itself, the
function would be 0.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.340
You see, it splits the gap.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.260
It splits the jump.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.780
And then of course, the
function would repeat itself

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.270
at a regular interval of--

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:41.020
regular period of 2 pi, that
this is what capital F of x

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.000
would look like
if you graphed it.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.730
By the way, to give you an
example of an even function,

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.870
if we were to use this
same technique for getting

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:53.740
the Fourier series for f of x
equals the absolute value of x

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.930
on the interval
from minus pi to pi,

00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:01.430
it turns out that capital F of
x would be pi over 2 minus 4

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:07.180
over pi summation over n odd
cosine nx over n squared.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.810
By the way, if this
looks a little bit

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.630
like the previous
problem, notice that this

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.700
is more than just coincidence.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.687
If you differentiate
the square root of x--

00:29:18.687 --> 00:29:20.770
I'm sorry, if you differentiate
the absolute value

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.600
of x, what is the derivative?

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.460
It's minus 1 for x negative
and positive 1 for x positive.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.430
It's the function that we were
just talking about before,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:34.120
only it doesn't exist
at x equals 0, you see?

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.940
What I'm driving at over here
is that it's not surprising

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:42.460
that the terms in here are the
integrals of the terms that

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.320
were in our previous summation.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.380
But notice that the absolute
value of x is an even function.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.200
Consequently, it's the cosine
terms which appear here

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.430
rather than the sine terms.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.410
And again, I've run the risk of
drawing my own diagrams here.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.010
I have plotted this
for n equals 3,

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:05.950
meaning I've plotted y equals
pi over 2 minus 4 over pi times

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.570
the quantity cosine x
plus cosine 3x over 9.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.760
And that's represented
by this curve

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.890
drawn in the accentuated
chalk over here.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.870
And again, notice how even for
just a small number of terms,

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:24.580
we have already captured in the
large the shape of the curve y

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.820
equals the absolute value
of x, which by the way

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.240
contrasts very sharply
with power series.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.130
Remember how power
series worked?

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.310
First of all, you had to require
that the function that you

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:40.240
were talking about possessed
derivatives of all orders.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.440
Secondly, when you wanted to
fit the function by its power

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.063
series, you picked
a particular point.

00:30:47.063 --> 00:30:47.980
Remember what you got?

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.950
You first got a tangent
line approximation.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.290
Then you got a
quadratic approximation

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.500
that fit the curve in a
neighborhood at this point

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.780
better than the
straight line did.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.720
But after a while, the
thing would sag off.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.580
Then you added a cubic term.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.330
And that fit even
better for a while.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.590
And then again something
weird might happen.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.450
And you kept on going like
this so that ultimately,

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.750
even though you had uniform
convergence, what you were

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.710
doing was you were getting
a splendid fit near one

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:26.770
particular point and slowly but
surely, and actually very, very

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.860
slowly, and also actually,
very surely, but you

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.890
may not have noticed it,
these approximations were

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.620
starting to fit better and
better as you went out here.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.560
But the least square
approximations

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.730
would not be too good.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.210
In other words,
out here someplace,

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.440
there was starting to become
some drastically large errors.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.030
On the other hand, the Fourier
representation does what?

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.950
It fits the curve that you're
talking about very, very

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.960
nicely very, very quickly.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.200
And this is one reason
why Fourier series

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.570
are as powerful as they are.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.570
And by the way, again,
to end on a nice theme,

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.060
Fourier series probably
have as much space

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.100
devoted to them in
pure mathematics

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.270
as they do in
applied mathematics.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.270
It's a beautiful topic
from both points of view.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.360
But I felt that for
our lesson today,

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.350
since it is a finishing touch
to essentially the equivalent

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.230
of three-plus
semesters of calculus,

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:26.770
that we should juxtaposition
the old and the new

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.920
and show the peaceful
coexistence versus

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.290
this idea of polarization
where you either

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:35.800
have to be a traditionalist
or a modernist,

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.100
where you either have to be
an applied man or a purist,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.370
that all of these ideas
mingle side by side.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.260
And about the only choice
you have as a human

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.570
being depending on
what your interests are

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.240
is what proportion you're
going to mix them in.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.860
Well, at any rate,
this brings us

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.380
to the part of the course
that always gives me

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.820
a little bit of remorse.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.400
And that is, I hate to let
my captive audience go.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.230
We have now been
through, as I say,

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.840
the equivalent of a couple of
years of mathematics together.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.730
It has been a great
pleasure for me.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.560
I hope it has been for you.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.270
And once again, I would like to
thank everybody who has worked

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.400
with me on this,
but in particular,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.250
the usual three people who
have been with me through thick

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.790
and thin on this, John
[? Fitchar, ?] project

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:24.660
self-study manager, who has
also done a lot of work with me

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.340
in helping me write
the study guide,

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.790
who has given me a lot of advice
on how to give these lectures

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.340
and how to prepare
them for the taping,

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.220
and has also been our
director for the taping,

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.030
to Miss Elise [? Pelletier, ?]
who in addition to her usual

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.480
secretarial work, has typed
much of our study guide and has

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:49.170
worked as a video technician
for us, and to our chief--

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:53.340
I'll just call him chief
of audio visual effects

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.848
at the center here,
Charles [? Patton. ?]

00:33:55.848 --> 00:33:57.890
I am particularly indebted
to these three people,

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.307
indebted to a lot
of other people.

00:33:59.307 --> 00:34:02.250
I thank you all for
being with me this long.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.450
And I hope that our
paths will cross again.

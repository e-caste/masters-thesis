WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I actually would like to take this
occasion to praise and thank the TAs.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We've been teaching this course for
about a dozen years and we've had

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
some really excellent groups of TAs,
but this year's crop is really off

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
scale, really outstanding.
And we're all very grateful.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
[APPLAUSE] You know their names.
I won't go through them all.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But the fact of the matter is
these TAs teach this course because

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
they're told to teach the course,
and at the same time they're doing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
all their thesis research, so
they end spending about 168 hours

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a week on various kinds of work.
So it's not a natural thing for

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
them to spend an enormous amount of
time, as they have been this year,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
really just off scale
extraordinarily good.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Here they are, Winston,
Susan, Michelle, Sara, Divia,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Jim, Sydney, Yasmine and
Cha. So thank you all.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
At the same time, I'd also
like to thank Claudette

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Gardel who runs this thing.
This is a large undertaking,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
believe it or not, with
almost 350 students enrolled,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but it's moved seamlessly and
without any problems this year for

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which many of us are very grateful.
So, thank you Claudette. I'm going

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to spend today trying to
broadcast into the future,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
forecast into the future I should
say, about where all of what we've

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
talked about this
semester is taking us.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Where is it going to get it us in
terms of where we're going to be ten

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
or twenty years from now and what
you're going to be in the middle of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
ten or twenty years from
now as you begin to move,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
as it will happen surely, as
day follows night, into midlife.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Imagine that. When you're
35 or 40 this will happen.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And in order to do so I just want
to go back 125 years or so to give

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you a feeling for what the
history of biology has been like,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
some of it, since the
end of the 19th century.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Just to give you a little flavor for
what can happen to biology if things

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
aren't done right. Charles
Darwin had a cousin named

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Francis Galton. He was
knighted by the Queen and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
called Sir Francis Galton.
And he was an early pioneer in

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
statistics. And he coined
the term eugenics. And,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
as you may note, eugenics
is simply the science of

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
trying to use genetics
to bread better livestock,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
better plants, and ultimately
maybe to breed better human beings.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And we humans have been doing
eugenics on plants and livestock for

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
at least 10,000 years. That
is to say we have continually

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
been selecting out the best of the
breed as the progenitors of the next

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
generation of the breed. And
in that way corn, which was

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
originally this large when it was
grown 5,000 years ago in Mexico,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the cobs have now become
this large and quite tasty.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And all of that is through selective
breeding. But in the last half of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the 19th century, inspired
by Darwin and subsequently

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
by Mendel's work on Mendelian
genetics, a whole science of

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
eugenics grew up in this country
which included not only the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
improvement in the quality of
livestock and plants but also

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
improvements in the gene pool
of humanity. There was a strong

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
conviction that genes were directly
responsible for all kinds of

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
physical traits, as well
as mental and psychological

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
traits. There was a
strong belief that some

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
races were superior and other races
were inferior because of genetic

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
gifts or genetic deficits. And
this included as well within

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
races, however one defined them,
different ethnic groups. There was

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
a firm belief that science could
ultimately solve a lot of social

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
problems including urban violence,
labor unrest, manic depression,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
schizophrenia and even
mental retardation.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And the eugenicists, as
they came to be known,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
came to believe that the
problems of the world, alcoholism,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
poverty, prostitution, criminality,
feeblemindedness, chess playing

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
ability, tendency to
commit industrial sabotage,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that was big in the beginning of
the 20th century when the unions were

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
coming into power, they were
all associated with one or

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
another rather penetrant
Mendelian allele.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
A well known geneticist named
Davenport, who subsequently was

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
associated with an unnamed
university up Mass Ave.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
studied various ethnic groups and
races and concluded that on the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
basis of genetics the Germans
ranked highest in quality such as

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
leadership, humor, generosity,
sympathy and loyalty.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Italians and Irish ranked
lowest in most of these traits,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
he was lucky he survived in this
town since together Italians and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Irish, I think encompass
70% of the population.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
British were lowest in two of
the traits. Irish were highest in

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
suspiciousness. Jews were
highest in obtrusiveness,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
whatever that is. And all of these
things were said to be genetically

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
templated. And so at the beginning
of World War I IQ tests were first

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
instituted in this country during
the draft in order to determine who

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
was genetically fit to serve
and who was below standard.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And using IQ tests, which
were implemented in great

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
numbers and throughout the
society in the 1920s, a well known

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
geneticist named Goddard
discovered that 80% of Jewish,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Hungarian and Polish immigrants,
as well as Italian and Russian

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
immigrants were mentally
defective or feebleminded,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and that these traits, these
mental defects in 80% of these

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
groups were transmitted as
regularly and as surely as the color

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
of hair or eyes. I'm not
making up fairy tales now.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I'm telling you what's happened in
our history. In the 1920s there was

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
a Eugenics Record Office in this
country which existed for the next

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
twenty years, an American Eugenics
Society which has 1200 people,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and J.H. Kellogg of Battle Creek,
Michigan, you know how he made his

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
money, don't you? Cornflakes.
He founded a Race Betterment

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Association whose intent was to
better the gene pool of the American

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
population through selective
breeding. By 1928 there were 376

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
college courses taught across this
country on the subject of eugenics,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
i.e., how to improve the human
race by beginning to breed more

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
fit individuals. And so
when the Nazis came to power,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
as they did in 1933 in Germany,
they had much to draw from.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
In fact, most of their scientific
rationale, to the extent they had

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
any, didn't come from Germany,
it came from eugenicists in the

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
United States. And so
they began to look amongst

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
their society for people
who were useless eaters,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
i.e., they consumed food but didn't
produce, they lived lives not worth

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
living, the elderly, the
chronic poor, the crippled and

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the misfits. And
they began involuntary

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
sterilization. So, people
who were regarded as

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
genetically less fit were sterilized.
By the time the Nazis finished

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
their 12 years in power, 400,000
people had been sterilized

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
in Germany because for one or
another reason they were regarded as

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
somehow defective. And as
the Second World War made

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
resources more tight, they
just did something much simpler,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
they just euthanized people,
they just killed them if they were

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
regarded as in one way or
another genetically defective.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
In fact, my father had a first
cousin who around 1936 or so was

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
gassed because he had
a bad stuttering defect.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So, this is all things that
really happened to people.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
As a consequence of all of this
eugenics, by 1924 Immigration Act

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
was passed which severely
circumscribed the amount of people

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
immigrating into this country
because the immigrants were widely

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
viewed as diluting and
contaminating the American gene pool.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And this probably, well,
this undoubtedly had a

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
devastating affect on this country
which we'll never really be able to

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
know because the truth of the
matter is that to the extent we have

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
economic and scientific
robustness in this country,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
it has come, for the last century,
year after year, generation after

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
generation from the immigrants
who come to this country,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
not people who were here
three, four, five generations.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
It's the immigrants who
brought in the new ideas,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the energy, the power, and I
venture to say that if I were

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
to ask what fraction of you are
first generation Americans the

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
number would be pretty high,
right? But in 1924 that was for a

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
while stopped simply because people
coming into the country were viewed

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
as genetically less
than acceptable.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
By 1940 thirty states had compulsory
sterilization laws in this country,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
i.e., people who were deemed to
be genetically less gifted were

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
sterilized against their will.
60,000 of those sterilizations were

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
performed in this country. And
the eugenics moment gained more

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and more adherence. What shut
it off ultimately was what

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
happened in World War II where
six million Jews were killed,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
along with probably five or six
million Slavs and other races who

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
were deemed, and gypsies, there
were probably half a million

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
gypsies killed by the Nazis,
different groups of people who were

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
deemed to be genetically less
deserving of living and genetically

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
less likely to be productive
and useful human beings.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And were it not for World War
II, it's quite plausible that the

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
eugenics movement would have
continued to grow and that today,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
when we talk about genetics, much
of it would be referred to a belief

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that somehow we can determine
people's phenotype and genotype and

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that we can predict how useful or
useless they're going to be on the

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
basis of our insights into genetics.
And this ideology of genetic

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
determinism, I say it had a great
decline, this is the phrase we use,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
genetic determinism, i.e., to say
that an individual's life course is

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
strongly dictated
by his or her genome.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
These are her alleles. You
heard a lot about the alleles

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
last time from Eric. But
genetic determinism is once

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
again coming to the forefront.
Why? Because now, for the first

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
time, we actually have a
science of human genetics.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
When all of this other stuff was
going on 50 and 100 years ago it was

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
all pseudo-science, it was
all made up. No one had the

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
vaguest idea what genes
were present in people's DNA.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
They didn't even know about DNA.
They didn't really know about most

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Mendelian traits being
passed in human populations.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And they had no way of knowing,
in the vast majority of cases,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
whether a certain person's phenotype
was or was not dictated by genotype.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So is this notion of a strong
genotype-phenotype connection

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
totally nonsense? Well,
I'll give you an example of

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
where you might begin to think it
isn't. And it comes from studies of

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
identical twins who were
separated at birth and brought up

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in different families. So
these identical twins obviously

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
have an identical genotype.
So here's a famous story that I

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
like to refer to. There
was a chance meeting in 1979

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
between a steelworker named Jim
Lewis and a clerical worker named

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Jim Springer. They both lived
in Ohio. They were separated five

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
weeks after birth and they were
raised 80 miles apart in different

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
towns in Ohio. And
at the age of 39 they

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
discovered themselves
through some change meeting.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
They discovered each other.
Well, they both had dark hair,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
they both stool six feet tall
and they both weighed 180 pounds.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
That's not so surprising. They both
spoke with the same inflections,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
which they clearly had not yet
learned to speak with when they were

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
five weeks old. They
walked with the same gait.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
They made the same gestures.
They both loved stockcar racing.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
They both hated baseball. They
both married women named Linda.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
They were both divorced and in
their second marriages both of them

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
married women named Betty.
They both drove Chevrolets.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
They drank Miller Lite. They
both chain smoked Salems.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
They vacationed on the same
half-mile of beach in Florida.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
They both had elevated blood
pressure, severe migraines,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
both had undergone vasectomies,
they both bit their nails, and their

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
heart rates, their brainwaves and
their IQs were so similar that you

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
couldn't tell whether it was the
same person or two separate people

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
being studied. Now, what
do you begin to think of

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
all that? Well,
that's an extreme case.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
The fact is most identical twins
raised apart do have a bit of

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
divergence in their phenotype,
in the way they grow up, but it

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
begins to plant in your mind the
notion that maybe many aspects of

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
the way we think and act actually
have a strong genetic template in

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
them. And one can begin to study
identical twins and ask things about,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
especially those who are separated
at birth, and not use such extreme

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
anecdotes like the one I just used.
And one begins to find that there's

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
an impressive list of attributes
that can only be explained by their

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
being a strong genetic determinant
in them. And these traits include

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
being alienated by people around one,
extroverted, being a traditionalist,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
looking backwards in terms
of one's customs, leadership,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
career choice, risk aversion,
attention deficit disorder,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
religious conviction and
vulnerability to stress.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Heritability it turns out,
if you study identical twins,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
is about, I'm sorry, happiness,
if you study identical twins, is

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
about 80% heritable it turns out
and depends little on one's wealth,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
achievement or marital status. But
80% of it, if you study identical

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
twins, seems to have a genetic
template. And you'll say,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
well, that's all very satisfying,
but it begins to be a little

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
unsettling because it begins to
cause each of us to ask are we

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
really who we think we are or are we
just kind of cassette recorders who

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
are playing out the program that was
stuffed into us when the sperm hit

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
the egg that lead to each
of our appearing on the face

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
of the planet? To what
extent are we individuals or

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
to what extent are we simply
manifestations of genotype?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And to what extent do we have
freewill? That's kind of an

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
interesting question.
Now, people like Eric,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I'm not pointing an accusing finger,
people like Eric have begun to

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
refine the science of genetics
so it really is a science.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And so, restriction
fragment polymorphisms,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
SNPs, haplotype analysis are now
uncovering a staggering array of

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
human traits. I believe that the
number of human traits that have now

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
been localized, specific
genes, most of these are

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
diseased genes, exceeds
2,000 is my recollection.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And there are only 21,000,
22,000 genes in the human genome.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And the pace with which genes
and genotype and phenotype will be

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
linked to one another is going
to increase if nothing else.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Many of the traits that one thinks
about in terms of human beings are

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
obviously polygenic. They're
not single strong Mendelian

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
alleles with strong penitence.
They represent the confluence,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
the collaboration of multiple
alleles that are conspiring to

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
create one or another phenotype.
And these polygenic traits or even

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
polygenic diseases have
traditionally resisted analysis

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
because mathematically they
are so complex to dissect out,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
to dissect out the contributing
genes which together as a cohort

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
create a genotype. But,
as Eric told you last time,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
people like you who are great
software developers will one day

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
begin to figure out how one can take
extraordinarily complex datasets and

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
begin to associate specific
chromosomal regions,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and ultimately genes, with
specific genetic sequences that

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
contribute to a polygenic trait.
I think at one time Eric spent,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
about three or four years ago,
he worked with people at Cornell

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
studying the polygenic trade
of ripening in tomatoes.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
It's a polygenic trait like
probably chess playing ability in

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
human beings. And was able to
localize ripening rate of tomatoes

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
to five or six distinct genetic
regions in the chromosomes of the

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
tomato plant. But that's only
a harbinger of what could come.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
So let's imagine now, again,
I'm not blaming Eric for this,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I'm just telling you he's the one,
he more than anyone else almost on

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
the planet is the person who is
leading the charge to refine and

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
strengthen these extraordinarily
powerful tools that enable us to

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
discern how our genome
creates us the way we are.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
But he's not going to be the
one who applies these tools.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
They'll be applied
all over the planet.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
There are geneticists everywhere
who are interested in looking at how

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
different aspects of human phenotype,
including disease phenotype are

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
governed by the alleles, by
the SNPs, by the polymorphisms

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
that we carry, and
obviously by the genes and

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
proteins that we make.
So let's begin to imagine,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
let's put ourselves fast-forward
ten years and begin to imagine where

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
this is going to take us.
We already know about a very

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
substantial number of genes that
determine the risk of different

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
kinds of cancer, i.e.,
there's at least 15 different

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
cancer syndromes that people have
which have been associated with

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
specific genetic loci. I
talked briefly about retinal

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
blastoma, which is a rare one,
but even commonly occurring cancers

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
will soon be connected with
specific alleles in the genome.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And the risk of getting them in
one's lifetime will be relatively

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
accurately predictable. It
might take another decade but it

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
will happen. Manic depressiveness,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
some people have great swings in
mood. 2% or 3% of the population

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
doesn't wake up happy every morning.
And this is also, I believe, going

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
to yield two specific analyses
and association with certain genes.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
There's already a suggestion
that the D4 dopamine receptor,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
which is involved in receiving
one of the neurotransmitters in the

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
brain, may have a polymorphism
that's connected with manic

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
depressiveness. There will
be probably alleles which

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
are connected with, in some
way, novelty or adventure

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
seeking. There are going to be
alleles that are associated with

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
anxiety, probably maybe connected
with the serotonin transporter in

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
the brain. Cardiac disease
susceptibility is already mapped out

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
in a number of traits in
the most extreme cases,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
but cardiac disease is very
frequent in this population.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And there undoubtedly will be
alleles that are discovered that

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
determine whether one has a high
risk or low risk of getting heart

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
disease, of getting arthrosclerosis,
and whether or not one can go to

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
McDonald's every day and
Big Macs with impunity.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Can one do that or not?
Some people probably can.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Some people can eat as much salt as
they want and it doesn't give them

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
high blood pressure.
Other people cannot.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
We still don't really understand
that. Schizophrenia is probably

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
also very strongly genetically
templated, not totally but very

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
strongly. Susceptibility to
rheumatoid arthritis probably also

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
has a strong genetic component.
Difficulty or ease with which you

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
solve math problems probably also
will one day be associated with a

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
certain number of genetic loci.
How many difficulties in learning

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
languages? There's already a trait
that was discovered in a family in

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
the Netherlands, I
believe, and they had a very

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
specific grammatical defect in the
way that they assembled the syntax

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
of sentences associated with a
certain allele of a certain gene.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Difficulty in just adding rows of
numbers may also be associated with

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
certain combinations of alleles.
Now, you will say, well, it's

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
impossible, it's inconceivable that
these different aspects of cognitive

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
function can be associated
with a small number of genes.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
But let me tell you something
else. We talked a week ago about the

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
evolution of humanity over the
last couple hundred thousand years.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And the pace with which the human
brain has evolved over the last half

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
million years, and more
recently the last 200,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
00 years, has been so frighteningly
rapid that the evolution of

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
cognitive function and perception
in different ways can only have

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
happened through the actions
of a small number of genes.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
If one needed to have dozens of
genes change in concert in order to

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
acquire the penetrating minds that
we now have in which our ancestors

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
500,000 years didn't have,
the evolution could not have

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
occurred so quickly. And,
for that reason alone,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
one begins to suspect that the
genetic differences between people

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
who lived 500, 00
years ago visa vie their

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
cognitive function and
ours are not so large. And,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
therefore, a rather small number of
genes may have been responsible for

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
conferring on us the powerful minds
which we now, which most of us,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I didn't say anything,
which most of us now possess.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
So where is this going to take us?
What are the consequences of this?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Let's imagine ten or twenty years
down the road when we can do some

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
kind of SNP analysis on one of these
chips that have been developed in

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
California and here and in various
places. And we can begin to imagine

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
the allelic diversity in a newborn
child's DNA or even prenatally

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
if you want. So what are
you going to do if you

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
begin to find on a chip of a child's
DNA that this kid is likely to be

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
very good in language, probably
is going to have poor math

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
skills, will be a rather
anxious and obsessive person,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
will have difficulty associating
with his or her peers,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
and is likely to come down with
heart disease at the age of 45?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
How is that going to affect
your relationship to that

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
person, that child? And
will you give that child a

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
different kind of education than a
newborn who has SNPs which indicate

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that without doubt they're going
to get 1600s on their morning boards

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
and their shoe-ins for admission
to MIT? Are you going to treat those

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
kids the same or are you going
to treat them differently?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Do you give them the same kind
of education and nurturing?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
And how do you treat them
throughout their elementary and high

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
school? Are you going to segregate
them into different groups or is

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
everybody going to be
given an equal chance?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Well, you might say it's our
tradition in this country to give

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
everybody equal footing, in
part because of a reaction to

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
what happened in World War II in
no small part. But what if the time

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
comes when people say we need to be
more efficient economically in this

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
country and we need to devote our
resources, need to maximize the

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
investment, the benefit we
get from various investments,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
and so it's much more efficient to
put kids in a certain genetic class

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
in one school and kids who have
another level of genetic giftedness

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
in another school? Of
course much of this will be

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
foolhardy because all
of these genetic tests,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
although they will give you
probabilities of certain phenotypes,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
they'll never, at least for the
foreseeable generation or two give

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
you certainties. No one
will be able to predict with

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
absolute total certainty about the
potentials of one or another young

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
person on the basis of DNA tests,
at least not in the near future.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Right now one can predict with total
certainty that somebody who has a

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
certain allele will come down with
Huntington's disease at the age of

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
30 or 40 or 50. There
the predictability,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
the penitence is 100%. But what
if somebody has an allele that says

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
with 60% likelihood they're
not going to very good at math?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Is that already going to be enough
to justify their segregation amongst

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
a group of the
mathematically less gifted?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Let's say that they've gone through
elementary and secondary education

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
and high school and they've made
it through college and they start

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
looking for employment.
Actually, there are jobs out here

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
to be had in this economy,
you wouldn't know it, but there

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
actually are people who can find
jobs. And let's say one has now an

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
employer who is evaluating a certain
job candidate for employability.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Maybe they'd like to have a good
medical checkup before they employ

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
this person ostensively to see
whether this person is healthy

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
enough to last for ten or twenty
or thirty years of employment.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And maybe they'd like to include
among that medical exam that

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
person's DNA just in case.
And what if the DNA tells the

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
employer that this individual is
likely to get colon cancer in 18

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
years and has a slight
susceptibility to mood instability

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
and perhaps even
manic depressiveness,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
that this person is not one of those
who can go to McDonald's and eat Big

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Macs with impunity but has a
tendency to arthrosclerosis?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
You can think of whatever
possibilities you will.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Will that be, therefore, a
ground to reject that person as an

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
employee? Well, you'll say
they really have no right

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
to do that. But keep in mind that
with increasing frequency in this

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
society medical benefits,
medical insurance is paid by the

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
employer. So does the employer want
to have a whole workforce of people

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
who are in various stages of
terminal disease or would this

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
employer like to be able to pay
the lowest possible health benefits

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
because the employer has taken care
to employ only people who have a

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
really terrific genotype,
whatever that is defined as being

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
arbitrarily admittedly? And
what about marriagability?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
As my sister always says to me, if
you want to marry a man the first

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
thing you should do is look
into his genes. That's a double

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:34.000
entendre. Anyhow.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
See, somebody finally
got it. [LAUGHTER]

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:44.000
The fact is that
maybe certain

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
people will be deemed to be
less desirable genetically.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Well, the fact is we've been doing
that for the last million years.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
If you're attracted to someone and
you end up marrying them then they

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
have phenotypes which you think
are in one way or another valuable.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Consciously or unconsciously,
you are practicing a form of

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
eugenics. But obviously there
could be a much more subtle form of

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
eugenics where part of the marriage
contract states that you want a

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
sample of that person's buccal swab
or some lymphocytes to check out

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
what kind of DNA he or she has.
Now you say, well, that could never

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
happen. But it happens
today regularly.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
There are villages in Greece where
there are a substantial percentage

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
of people who carry the trait
sickle cell anemia which,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
as you may know, is not so serious
phenotypically in heterozygous form,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
but in the homozygous form
is actually devastating.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And the reason they have sickle
cell anemia is that those areas of

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Greece historically had
high rates of malaria. And,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
as you may know, sickle cell
anemia actually protects,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
in the heterozygous state actually
protects one from the ravages of the

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
malarial parasite. So
about 20 years ago it became

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
possible to do a simple genetic test
to determine whether an individual

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
was heterozygous for sickle cell
anemia. And what happened is that

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
somehow what was supposed to be
confidential medical genetic tests

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
got out. They became public.
And young individuals in the

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
population became known as carrier,
as heterozygotes for sickle cell

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
trait, even though phenotypically
they were reasonably normal because

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
the heterozygote condition
is not so devastating.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So those individuals were soon
ostracized, to use an old Greek word.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
They were soon put to the side.
They were placed in the pool of the

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
unmarriable because nobody wanted
to marry them. And so they then,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
as a consequence, began to
marry amongst themselves.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Remember what I told you about
homozygosis with the sickle cell

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
trait. But that's only
one example of that.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Among Orthodox Jews, among
Ashkenazi Jews between 2% and

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
3% of the population carries an
allele for Tay-Sachs disease which

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
is phenotypically silent in the
heterozygous state but in the

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
homozygous state is a devastating
condition which leads to death in

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
the first years of life. So
now among the Orthodox Jews in

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
New York before two young people
will get married they will do a test

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
to see whether they are
heterozygous for the Ta Sacks allele.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And, in fact, it's not limited
any longer to Orthodox Jews.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Because if they're both
heterozygotes their marriage to one

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
another, in spite of
anything else they consider,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
is strongly discouraged. Among
those who don't live in such

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
a closely structured society such
people might nonetheless decide to

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
get married and then face the
devastating possibility of one of

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
their four offspring on average
coming out as a homozygote and

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
having an incurable genetic
disease which is going to lead

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
to their early death. But
what about other traits?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
And what time will this
genetic discrimination,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
where will it begin and where
will it end? What if you find an

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
individual who has a trait of manic
depressiveness among relatives?

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
And when will these
genetic tests become public?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
When will they be private
knowledge? You say, well,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
they can all be kept private.
But ultimately there are already

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
insurance companies which are
demanding to determine whether and

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
individual can be insured by looking
at whether they have genes for

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
certain kinds of
disease-causing alleles.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
After all, why should they insure
somebody, give somebody life

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
insurance if they are likely to come
down with Huntington's disease at

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
the age between 35 and 40,
which will surely and inevitably

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
lead them to an early grave?
You'll say, well, we cannot have

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
genetic information like that become
public or even become accessible.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Maybe that's a solution. The
problem is we've been talking

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
about these issues for 10
to 15 years in this society,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
and we've not yet converged any kind
of solution. And the solutions to

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
these problems should not be left
in the hands of molecular biologists,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
because molecular biologists or
biologically cognizant people by now,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
like you, are no more gifted and no
more insightful to deal with these

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
issues than anyone else is.
They're intuitively obvious these

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
issues. You don't need to know
about SNPs to begin to understand

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
the potentially devastating impacts
that the misuse of genetics can have

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
on our society. And what
happens if one of these

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
days people discover alleles
for certain aspects of cognitive

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
function? Chess playing ability.
The ability to learn five different

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
languages. The ability to
remember strings of numbers.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
The ability to speak
extemporaneously in front of a class,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
for what it's worth, for 50
minutes several times a week.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Whatever
ability you want,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
valued or not so valued, what if
those alleles begin to come out?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And here's the worse part. What
if somebody begins to look for the

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
frequency of those alleles in
different ethnic groups scattered

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
across this planet?
Now, you will say to me,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
well, God has made all his children
equal. But the fact is if you look

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
at the details of human evolution,
some of which I discussed with you a

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
week ago, last week, you'll
come to realize that most

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
populations in humanity are
the modern descendents of very

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
small founder groups. Remember
about the story of the Fins.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
70% of Finish men carry the same
Y chromosome. All modern Fins,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
most modern Fins, all of them are
likely to be the descendents of a

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
small founder group that
came into Finland 2,000 or 3,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
00 years ago and carry with them the
peculiar set of polymorphisms that

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
founder group happens to have had.
And arguments like that begin to

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
persuade you that there'll be
different allele frequencies in

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
different populations of humanity.
What if somebody begins to discover

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
that Macedonians have an enormously
high rate of the ability to play

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
chess because of a certain
allele? And here I'm talking very

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
speculatively. I'm not
literally meaning that.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And Tibetans have a very poor
ability to construct software

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
programs because of a genetic allele
they carry? I hope nobody's Tibetan

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
here. I tried to choose two.
Are there any Macedonians? All

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
right. I succeeded. All
right. Anyhow. So the fact is

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
it's inescapable that different
alleles are going to be present with

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
different frequencies in different
inbreeding populations of humanity

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
or populations of humanity that
traditionally have been genetically

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
isolated from one another. It's
not as if all the genes that we

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
carry have been mixed with everybody
else's genes freely over the last

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
100,000 years. Different
groups have breed

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
separately and have, for
reasons that I've told you,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
founder affects and genetic
drift acquired different sets and

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
different constellations of alleles.
So what's going to happen then, I

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
ask you without wishing to hear an
answer because nobody really knows?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Then for the first time there could
be a racism which is based not on

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
some kind of virulent ideology,
not based on some kind of kooky

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
versions of genetics,
because the eugenicists in the

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
beginning of the 20th century, as
well as the Nazis hadn't had any

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
idea about genetics, they
were just using the word,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
even though they knew nothing
about the science of genetics as we

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
understand it today. But
what happens if now for the

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
first time we, i.e., you
who begin to understand

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
genetics, begin to perceive
that there are, in fact,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
different populations of humanity
that are endowed with different

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
constellation of alleles that we
imagine are more or less desirable?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
What's going to happen then? I
don't know. But some scientists

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
say, well, the truth must come
out and that everything that can be

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
learned should be learned, and
we will learn how to digest it

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
and we will learn how to live with
that. But I'm not so sure that's

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
the right thing. And you
all have to wrestle with

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
that as well. And even
more insidious is the

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
following notion. Remember
the story about the two

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Jims, the two guys from Ohio who met
one another at the age of 39 after

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
they'd been separated at five
weeks of birth? That story begins to

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
persuade you of something I said
before, and that is that a lot of

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
what you think you are isn't
what you made of yourself,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
isn't what your parents made
of yourself, isn't what your

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
environment made of you
and your experiences.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Maybe it's all just in your genes.
And if that's so then maybe you

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
can't take credit for any of
the good things you've done.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
And conversely maybe you're not
responsible for all the bad things

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
you've done. Maybe three years from
now somebody will begin to plead

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
that even though they were
not criminally insane when they

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
committed a string of serial murders,
in fact it really wasn't their fault

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
because they happen to have this
particular genotype which is known

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
to be correlated with a
strong tendency to violent.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And, by the way, there
is an allele which has a

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
correlation, I forget which one it
is, has a correlation with violent

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
behavior. So what if one begins to
write off everything we do as not a

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
reflection of our own freewill,
our own volition, but instead a

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
consequence of the genes which
our parents hoisted on us?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Of course, we can blame it on them.
As a father of children, I can tell

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
you that it's amazing how many
different things can be blamed on

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
the parents. [LAUGHTER] Of
course, the parents have their

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
own out. The parents can
blame it on their parents.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
So now it goes back to the
grandparents, back to the beginning

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
of time. We laugh about these
things and they are amusing,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
but they are taking us on a
collision course with some very

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
difficult problems. And you
guys have to wrestle with

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
them and you guys have to explain
to the people who haven't taken 7.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
12 where the world of
biology is taking us.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
And on that note, I want
to tell you that Eric and I

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
have enormously enjoyed
being with you this semester.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
We wish you much luck and
success in your future lives.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
We hope some of you have become
interested in biology and that you

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
found this course a little different
from what you took in high school.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
And have a wonderful winter
vacation. See you. [APPLAUSE]

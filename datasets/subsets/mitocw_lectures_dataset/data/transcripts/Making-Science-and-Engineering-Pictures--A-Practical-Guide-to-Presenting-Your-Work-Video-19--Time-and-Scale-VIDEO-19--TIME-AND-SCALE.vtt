00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.300
Some of you might
want to present

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.720
what happens over time
with your photographs.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.170
Other than creating a video,
it's usually quite compelling

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.890
when watching a dynamic
phenomena that's true.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.875
And if you think about
it, all of science

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.740
is ultimately dynamic, right?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.970
Things change over time.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.770
We generally assume one
has to watch a moving image

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.710
to see that change.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.850
So here, for example,
you are seeing

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.600
something called the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.490
It's a complicated
oscillating reaction

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.110
that we're observing
within a Petri dish.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.210
But it's not a video, in
the sense that it wasn't

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.250
taken with a video camera.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.800
You're seeing a series of
still images that I made

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.310
and I was privileged
to make in professor

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.640
Zhabotinsky's lab at Brandeis.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.990
I took the images
11 seconds apart

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.480
over a period of five minutes.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.540
By the way, I made
the images in film,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.380
which became slide formats,
as you might remember--

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.360
or then again, maybe you don't!

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.490
And you're seeing digital scans
of those individual frames.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.140
We're seeing the
spiral waves forming.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.840
A color indicator allows
us to see the reaction.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.430
So what we're really seeing
is a series of still images,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.289
one right after the other.

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.930
That is in fact what a
moving image is, isn't it?

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.320
So that looks
pretty interesting.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.420
But in my opinion,
just as interesting,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.430
is seeing the individual
images lined up in a grid,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.080
so that we can compare
one image to the other,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.580
and note two changes that occur.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.300
I am convinced there is a place
for this kind of presentation.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.610
Here's another example.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.890
You're looking at
a one centimeter

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.770
across circular
"sandwich", let's call it,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.990
of two pieces of glass.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.140
The glass contains, within this
"sandwich", material called

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.600
block copolymers in a solvent.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.870
And over time, the solvent
evaporates around the edges

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.730
so that over time the
block copolymers self

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.150
assemble in different
orientations.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.190
And that change is
visually translated

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.210
into changes in color.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.100
And so again, we're
seeing a series of stills,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.630
one right after the other,
viewing it as a moving image.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.270
But here too, looking
at each side by side

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.640
can clarify exactly
what is going on.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.900
I just want you to
think a little bit

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.100
about seeing a series of stills
instead of only an animation.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.660
By the way, here is that
still image in the journal.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.260
Let's talk a little
bit about showing scale

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.230
in your presentations.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.020
My purpose here is to nudge you
to think a little differently

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.640
from perpetuating the standard
approach to showing scale

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.020
within an image.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.620
Instead of for example showing
that overused coin side by side

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.090
with your device, how about
making the composition ever so

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.180
slightly more interesting.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.490
You could also think
about showing your device

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.200
on top of something other
than a coin, for example,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.170
something more recognizable and
more interesting in structure.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.150
In this case, I
use a compact disk,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.350
which might not be familiar
from years to come,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.960
but I'm trying in here anyway.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.440
I hope you still
know what it is!

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.780
And in the caption we
can get more information

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.660
about the size of the
device or the material.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.440
And here we're seeing
an image of a structure,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.430
giving the reader both a
sense of scale and property.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.700
The presence of the
coins suggests the scale

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.079
of the small objects,
but we're also

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.320
seeing that the structure itself
can collapse and then bounce

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.100
back, which is in fact
the important part of what

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.380
this is about.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.360
In this image, which we'll
see again in week six,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.780
you're seeing a
syringe needle, which

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.520
I used to place some colored
water onto a surface.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.960
It's a suggestion of the scale
of the square drops of water.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.710
It isn't quantitative.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.410
But just a hint of
a size, if you know

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.070
the size of the syringe needle.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.079
And another way you might
present an idea of scale

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.290
is to show something from
various points of view

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.110
as we zoom into the material.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.590
So here is that old computer
memory core we saw before.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.080
Something I'll bet most of you
haven't seen before this class.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.940
And in the next image, I made
the picture with a 105 lens

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.010
getting closer to the material.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.880
And again, here I'm coming
even closer with another tool,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.240
something called a
stereo microscope.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.100
Once again, even getting closer
with a compound microscope.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.780
And finally, I made an image
with a scanning electron

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.450
microscope, which I've colored.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.740
So yes, it's true.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.450
I'm not exactly showing you
the exact size of the material,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.210
but I'm taking you sort of
through a sense of scale

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.660
and maybe sort of
telling a scale story.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.400
The same with this
morpho butterfly wing.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.310
As we zoom into this
structure, first

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.360
taken with a camera and lens.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.060
Then getting closer
to the material,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.250
looking with a colored
scanning electron micrograph,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.290
we see more detail.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.520
And even getting more
enlarged, seeing it

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.800
with another scanning electron
micrograph, which I colored.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.780
Now it appears blue
initially, but there's

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.600
no blue dye present.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.030
The color is due to the
structure of the wing, which

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.340
is what we're seeing.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.409
And it's an interesting story,
which I suggest you look into.

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.560
Here's another idea.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.720
Instead of always
placing a scale bar

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.360
either in the lower right hand
corner or the lower left hand

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.690
corner, how about if we place
the scale bar within the image

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.860
in a more designed approach.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.160
You just did see
an example of this.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.780
And here's another example.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.540
I've placed and labeled the
scale bar within the image.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.440
The full design of the
image works better.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.830
The information is there,
but doesn't compromise

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.930
the aesthetics of the image.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.510
The scale bar works with it.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.460
And the same with this image,
which you've also seen before.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.510
The bar doesn't always
have to be on the bottom

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.460
right or left, unless of course
the journal insists on that.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.620
There is no reason why it has
to be placed in that format.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.130
That's one of those perpetuated
rules that, in my opinion,

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.440
have no logic to it.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.750
For our book On The
Surface of Things,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.380
we wanted to suggest a
comparative sense of scale

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.880
when looking at all of
the images in the book.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.310
We used the head of a pin,
which measures about between one

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.450
to two millimeters,
as a reference point.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.570
Next to each image,
you see a blue outline

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.510
of a pinhead made relative
to the size of what's

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.820
in the photograph.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.710
So for example, looking at
this image of ferrofluid,

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.560
the pinhead appears
around this size.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.130
Note the blue circle.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:21.190
But when we have to zoom way
down to the nano scale level

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.910
in order to see the indentations
of this compact disk,

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.150
the pinhead circle almost
becomes a straight line.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.310
We hardly see the curvature.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.120
Because the indented
areas are so small,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.850
we cannot use photons
to image that surface.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.380
We have to use electrons with
a scanning electron microscope.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.360
So just imagine traveling
down to that nano scale.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.010
Well the pin head enlarges
as you pass it by.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.220
I think it worked quite
well for the book.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.159
I hope you do.

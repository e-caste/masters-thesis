00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.750
Soon after a meal, your digestive system breaks
down the food you have eaten into a simple

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.439
sugar called glucose. Glucose is absorbed
from the gut into the bloodstream, causing

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.689
your blood sugar level to increase. In healthy
individuals, feedback mechanisms in the body

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.990
bring blood sugar levels back to normal. In
some people, this process breaks down, resulting

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.840
in diabetes.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.860
In this video, we'll take a closer look at
feedback loops, how they tie into the body's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.390
mechanism of internal regulation, and what
happens when these mechanisms fail.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.399
This video is part of the Information Flow
series. A system is shaped and changed by

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.579
the nature and flow of information into, within,
and out of the system.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.930
Hi, my name is Leah Okumura and I am a Technical
Instructor in the Biology Department at MIT.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.370
Before watching this video, you should be
familiar with the concept that your body is

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.399
a tightly regulated environment. After watching
this video, you will be able identify the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.020
general components of a feedback loop, examples
of negative and positive feedback loops in

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.020
the body, and describe how feedback loops
are vital to healthy function and survival.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.440
Our bodies rely heavily on feedback loops
to control and regulate important biochemical

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.160
and physiological functions.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.500
There are two types of feedback loops in biology:
negative feedback loops, and positive feedback

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.110
loops. These act to either reduce or amplify
the changes that occur in a given system.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.110
Let's see how feedback loops can be applied
to thermoregulation. Imagine walking into

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.800
a room that has an air conditioner on at full
blast. After a few minutes, you find yourself

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.420
shivering from the cold. Does the shivering
serve a purpose? Yes! The rapid muscle contractions

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.420
from shivering generate heat within the body
and warm you back up. Now imagine taking a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.720
walk outside on a very hot and sunny day.
After a few minutes under the hot sun, you

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.479
are perspiring profusely. What purpose does
sweating serve? As sweat evaporates from your

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.590
skin, it helps to cool you down.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.970
Thermoregulation serves to control our body's
temperature much like a thermostat regulating

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.900
the temperature of a room. From this diagram,
you can see how thermoregulation follows a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.710
simple loop. Because the response in this
case is always to reverse a given change in

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.840
body temperature, we call this a negative
feedback loop. Positive feedback loops are

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.360
just the opposite. When a change occurs in
a system, a positive feedback loop acts to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.760
increase or exacerbate it. Labor preceding
childbirth is a classic example of a positive

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.190
feedback loop. Contractions of the uterus
during childbirth stimulate the release of

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.970
a hormone, oxytocin, which in turn induces
more uterine contractions. The self-amplifying

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.760
nature of the positive feedback loop is repeated
over and over with increasing intensity until

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.180
the baby is born. After birth, contractions
stop and the feedback loop ceases. Here are

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.370
a few well-known physiological processes and
parameters that involve feedback loops. Pause

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.010
the video here and determine which ones involve
negative feedback and which ones involve positive

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.180
feedback.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.350
Negative feedback loops minimize deviations
within a system, keeping its parameters close

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.790
to a desired set-point. The control of blood
glucose, blood pressure, and breathing rates

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.650
rely heavily on negative feedback loops.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.450
Positive feedback loops, on the other hand,
tend to destabilize a system by amplifying

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.600
a stimulus towards an extreme. This is important
in irreversible processes such as action potential

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.560
generation, blood clotting, lactation, and
ovulation.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.560
There are many other examples of negative
and positive feedback loops in the human body.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.540
Now let's take a closer look at specific components
involved in a feedback loop.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.310
The receptor is the component that detects
and measures changes in a given parameter.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.910
The receptor then relays this information
to a control center. The control center compares

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.259
the measured parameter to a desired set point.
Based on the extent of deviation, the control

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.710
center decides on the appropriate response
and sends signals to an effector. Effectors

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.120
can be muscles, organs, or any other component
that receives signals from the control center.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.990
In response to these signals, the effectors
can either enhance or reduce the deviation.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.770
If the deviation is enhanced, we have a positive
feedback loop. And if it is reduced, we have

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.770
a negative feedback loop. Now let's go back
to our thermoregulation example in greater

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.860
detail. Here, the parameter we are controlling
is internal body temperature. The receptors

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.970
of temperature in our body are specialized
cells called thermoreceptors. Thermoreceptors

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.020
continually monitor our temperature and pass
this information to the control center in

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.340
the brain, called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus
compares the measured temperatures to the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.340
set point of 37 áµ’C. It can distinguish temperature
differences as small as a hundredth of a degree!

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.220
The hypothalamus then sends out signals to
effectors in the body to initiate corrective

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.880
mechanisms when our temperatures are too high
or too low. The effectors react accordingly

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.250
to adjust our body temperature. When we are
too hot, signals are sent to activate our

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.740
sweat glands. Blood vessels in the skin are
also stimulated to dilate. These changes increase

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.480
heat loss from the skin. When we are too cold,
signals are sent to the tissues to increase

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.389
metabolism, and to the muscles to induce shivering.
These mechanisms generate heat. Signals are

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:58.389
also sent to constrict blood vessels and to
raise skin hairs to minimize heat loss.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.520
Both negative and positive feedback loops
are equally important for the healthy functioning

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.520
of one's body. Complications can arise from
failure of these mechanisms.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.199
Let's look at blood glucose regulation, and
see what happens if the feedback mechanisms

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:20.340
do not work as they should. Glucose is the
primary source of energy for the body's cells.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.430
Thus, in a healthy individual, glucose levels
are tightly regulated to maintain a fairly

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.479
constant and optimal supply in the bloodstream.
Too little or too much blood glucose could

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.949
be damaging to the body. Circulating levels
of glucose are monitored by specialized beta

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:41.850
cells in islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.
In response to high glucose levels, for example

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.430
after a large meal, these same beta cells
release a hormone called insulin into the

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.510
bloodstream. Insulin is transported to the
rest of the body, whereupon it stimulates

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.690
the cells to take up and adsorb glucose. Insulin
also promotes the storage of glucose in muscle

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:04.050
and liver tissues. These actions act to remove
glucose from the blood, thus lowering blood

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.830
glucose levels to the normal set-point. Blood
glucose regulation is a classic example of

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.080
negative feedback. Pause the video and identify
the receptor, control center, and effectors

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:22.080
in this particular feedback system.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.550
The receptors are the beta cells in the pancreas.
These same cells also act as the control center

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.880
and send signals to the effectors in the form
of insulin. The effectors are the cells of

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.880
the body that increase their uptake and storage
of glucose in response to insulin. Now let's

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.360
see how failure of the body to regulate blood
glucose levels results in a disease known

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:52.100
as diabetes. There are two common forms of
the disease.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.490
In Type I diabetes, also known as early-onset
diabetes, the insulin-producing beta cells

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.180
of the pancreas are destroyed due to an autoimmune
reaction. In this form of diabetes, the body

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.289
is unable to produce insulin. The lack of
insulin means that the cells of the body do

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:14.270
not take up glucose in response to increasing
glucose levels. Hence, glucose levels in the

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:21.270
blood continue to rise. In Type II diabetes,
or late-onset diabetes, insulin is still produced

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.930
but the body's cells no longer respond to
it. This is often due to years of insulin

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:33.198
over-production, caused by a high-sugar diet.
The inability of cells to use insulin properly

00:08:33.198 --> 00:08:40.120
means that high glucose levels in the blood
persist with time. Type I and Type II diabetes

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.019
have very similar symptoms but they arise
from different causes. Pause the video and

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:52.019
identify the parts of the feedback loop that
break down in each.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.649
In Type I diabetes, there is a lack of signaling
between the control center and the effectors.

00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:06.970
In Type II diabetes, the effectors fail to
respond to the signals from the control center.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.420
The end result is the same in both forms of
the disease - glucose accumulates to toxic

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:17.129
levels in the blood. If left unchecked, diabetes
can lead to kidney failure, blindness, and

00:09:17.129 --> 00:09:22.429
heart disease. Feedback loop breakdown leads
to the development of an unstable internal

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:26.800
environment. This tips the scales towards
imbalance, increasing the risk of illness

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.860
and progressive damage to the body. Many other
diseases and pathological conditions follow

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:38.860
a similar progression.

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:43.660
In this video, you learned about negative
and positive feedback loops, their general

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:49.980
components, and how they regulate the flow
of information. We identified feedback loops

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:56.980
in the body and examined their role in childbirth,
thermoregulation, and blood glucose regulation.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.230
Our body relies on a finely-tuned system of
checks and balances to function smoothly.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.279
Feedback loops, like the ones described in
this video, provide this balance. Failure

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:11.239
of these mechanisms, as in the case of diabetes,
can be detrimental. We hope that you will

00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:15.139
apply your knowledge of feedback loops and
the consequences of their failure in the study

00:10:15.139 --> 00:10:20.540
of other biological processes and diseases.

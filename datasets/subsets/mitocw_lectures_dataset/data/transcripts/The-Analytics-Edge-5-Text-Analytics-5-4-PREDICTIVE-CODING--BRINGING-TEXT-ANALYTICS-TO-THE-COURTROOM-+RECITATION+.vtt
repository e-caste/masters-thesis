Hi.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.090
I'm John, and I'll be leading
the recitation this week.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.580
We'll be looking into how
to use the text of emails

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.980
in the inboxes of
Enron executives

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.309
to predict if those emails are
relevant to an investigation

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.440
into the company.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.320
We'll be extracting
word frequencies

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.260
from the text of the
documents, and then

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.620
integrating those frequencies
into predictive models.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.510
Let's get started.

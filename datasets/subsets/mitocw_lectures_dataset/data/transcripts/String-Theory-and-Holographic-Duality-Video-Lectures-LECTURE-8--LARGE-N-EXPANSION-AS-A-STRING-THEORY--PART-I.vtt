00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:22.460
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.465
So let us start.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.090
So let me first
quickly remind you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.670
what we did in the last lecture.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.600
So we first talked
about the-- so we

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.460
talked general observables
and gauge series.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:03.380
So we're interested in
correlation functions

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.599
of gauge invariant operators.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.825
In particular, we will be
focused on local operators.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.590
So we say, for example-- so
the local operator can also

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.845
be separated into, say,
the single trace operator.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.840
Yeah, the single trace operator.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.670
So n just labels
different operators.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.150
Or say that the double
trace operator-- sometimes,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.290
in order to avoid confusion,
we put some thoughts

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.310
that means these
two operators should

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.280
be considered grouped together.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.720
And then you evaluate it
at some spacetime point.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.470
Say this would be a
double trace operator.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.860
Or maybe the higher ones.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.360
OK?

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.730
And also, we found that a
typical correlation function--

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.220
say if I look at
endpoint function,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.150
endpoint connect
equaling function

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.710
of single trace
operators, then the scale,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.745
with n as [INAUDIBLE],
again, you

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:41.170
sum over all the h, which is
the topology of your diagrams.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.530
And then to the power
n to the minus n-- n

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.940
is the number of the endpoint
functions-- the minus 2h.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.370
Than say some function.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.020
Fn, which can depend
on the coupling

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.810
constants and also will depend
on x1, x2, xn, et cetera.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.320
OK?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.580
So this will start us
leading order with N 2

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.272
minus n, which come
from the planar diagram.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.100
And then the next order,
just N to the minus n.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.330
So this will be
the torus diagram.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:29.830
The diagram you can put on
the torus Or genus 2 diagrams.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.330
OK?

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.777
Et cetera.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.340
So we also discussed
that this behavior

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.999
has important
physical implications.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.373
We talked about
two implications.

00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:57.602
We talked about
two implications.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.270
You say that kind of
independence means that,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:16.810
in the larger limit-- say in
the N go to infinity limit-- we

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.510
can essentially treat the
action of the single particle--

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.330
a single trace operator on
the vacuum-- as generating

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.537
a single particle state.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.710
We often call this
as glueballs state.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.808
Glueballs, OK?

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.380
So this single
particle state, they

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.530
don't have to appear
really as, say,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.500
a symptotic state in your
scattering, et cetera.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.630
It just say the
behavior of such state

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.520
behaves like single particles.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.830
And then, if you act on
the double trace operator,

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:15.220
on the 0, then that gives
you the two particle state,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.890
and et cetera.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.740
And the triple trace operator
will give you the three

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.981
particle state, et cetera.

00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:21.480
OK?

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.810
So this is one aspect.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:36.280
And the second aspect
is that if-- say

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.500
if there is some single
trace operator whose

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:47.083
expectation value is non-zero,
then the fluctuations

00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:47.708
are suppressed.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.160
OK?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:06.400
So for example, if you look
at the ratio of the variance,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.650
so O squared, the
connected part of the O

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.020
squared, is essentially
the variance of this guy.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.920
And divided by
expectation value itself,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.340
the scale is 1 over N
because of that behavior,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.371
and this goes to 0.

00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:21.870
OK?

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.550
In the margin, as
N goes to infinity.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.660
So that means the
fluctuations are suppressed.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.800
So any questions regarding this?

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.910
Good?

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.710
OK.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.850
So now let's talk
about the third aspect

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.343
of it, the third implication.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:19.630
So now, suppose we interpret
this endpoint function, so

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:25.720
this connected
endpoint function,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.180
say we check it symbolically
as, say, some kind of blob.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.955
Then you have [INAUDIBLE] x.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.510
Say 1, 2, 3-- n minus 1, n.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.810
OK?

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.740
So each line means an
external operator insertions.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:08:06.610
So if we interpret this as some
kind of scattering amplitude,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.630
so as generates some kind of
scattering amplitude over the n

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:27.600
glueballs, then you can show,
because of this behavior,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.830
you can show, because
of this N scaling.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:41.539
And then, again,
to leading order,

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:58.690
in the N goes to infinity limit,
the scatterings are classical.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:18.110
Classical means-- you said
it only involves tree level

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.610
scatterings.

00:09:27.777 --> 00:09:28.276
OK?

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.580
So now I'm going to show this.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.880
This is the conclusion.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.636
So now I'm going to
justify this statement.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.825
So before I start
justifying this statement,

00:09:47.825 --> 00:09:48.908
do you have any questions?

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.910
Good.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:04.910
So let me just
make a few remarks.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.720
So first-- so let's look
at the simplest case, which

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.700
is the three point function.

00:10:15.927 --> 00:10:18.010
So the three point function
can be considered just

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.689
as effective vertex.

00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:21.480
It can be considered
as an effective vertex

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.970
of three particles
intact with each other.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.130
Say one glueball is split
into two glueballs, et cetera.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:29.410
OK?

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.000
So this, from that definition,
scales as 1 over n.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.580
OK?

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.270
This scales as 1 over n.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:50.480
So if we treat it as
a basic vertex-- so

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.590
suppose we treat it.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:11:08.620
Suppose we treat it as a
basic vertex with coupling g.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:14.900
So g is 1 over N. OK.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:31.100
The from simple, then
to easy to see, then

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:51.560
tree-level amplitudes for
n-particle scattering,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.980
n-particle scatterings
are precisely

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.090
scaled as g to the
n minus 2, which

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.840
is n to the power
minus 2 minus N.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.760
And then this is precisely--
we see for the leading scaling

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.470
here.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.190
OK?

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:16.430
So is this fact obvious to you,
that the tree-level scattering

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:23.500
for n-particles with basic
vertex given by g will scale

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.951
like this?

00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:27.940
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.230
Why is it proportional to g?

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:35.330
Because each-- they start
in a double line notation.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.240
Each line contributes
to like a g square.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.324
So how that g comes from--

00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:44.240
PROFESSOR: Now, which g
you are talking about?

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.100
Oh, no, no, no.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.710
Maybe let me call it--
it's a different g.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.840
It's a different-- yeah,
let me call it kappa.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.250
Or let me call it g tilde.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.310
Yeah, it's not the same.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.600
It's not the same g as before.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.840
This is just something
I-- [INAUDIBLE] there.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.710
I just call it some
kind effective coupling.

00:13:10.632 --> 00:13:12.461
Yeah?

00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:12.960
Yeah.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.670
Just imagine you have a
process whose basic interaction

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:23.380
vertex is g tilde, and g
tilde is order 1 over N.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.290
And then the tree-level
scattering for n particle

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.830
will depend on this coupling
to be g tilde to the n minus 2.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:33.330
OK?

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.601
So this clear to you?

00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:36.100
Yeah.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.475
You can just draw
a tree diagram.

00:13:37.475 --> 00:13:38.997
You can see the immediate tree.

00:13:38.997 --> 00:13:39.496
OK?

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.800
So this is consistent.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.880
So this behavior is consistent
to interpret that as a tree.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.040
But you don't actually
have to assume

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.660
the basic three-point vertex.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:10.130
So you can also say-- you can
also include-- higher order

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:10.630
vertices.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.550
But your vertices
which include should be

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.500
consistent with this scaling.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.370
OK?

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.080
Suppose if you're want to
inclue four-particle vertices.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.500
And then this should
scale as g tilde squared,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.542
which is N to the
minus 2, because

00:14:38.542 --> 00:14:40.250
the four-point connective
function should

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.450
scale as minus 2.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.910
And similarly, if you
have a five-point vertex,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.260
then it should scale
as g tilde to the cube,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.320
which is N to the minus 3.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.120
The five-point function
should scale as N minus 3.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.030
OK?

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.100
So you can also add such
higher order vertices

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.200
as far as you are consistent
with this large N scaling.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.910
So then you can easily
convince yourself

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:16.540
that even including such
higher order vertices does not

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:24.950
change this conclusion, that the
N-point tree-level amplitude,

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.940
again for n-particles,
will scale like this.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.645
OK?

00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:30.978
Will not change that conclusion.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.150
So this is second statement.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.290
And these two statements, just
to give you a heuristic way

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:47.510
to see that this kind of scaling
can be generated-- indeed,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.470
generated by
tree-level scatterings.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:59.930
So now I'm going to
prove that in the large N

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:13.680
limit to leading order, in N,
in any such kind of correlation

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:39.360
functions, there are
no more than one--

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.400
there's no more--
there are only, maybe.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.260
Let me just say it easier.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:51.350
There are only one particle
intermediate states.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.690
OK?

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.790
So I'm going to show this.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:23.040
So let's consider, say, a three
part-- so by one particle,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.099
I always mean one
particle in this sense.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.339
OK?

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:27.714
So one particle in this sense.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.550
So I read through it a
little bit heuristically.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.690
It's not very precise,
but I think it's rigorous,

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:42.460
but it's not-- but they will not
[? right ?] the precise-- yeah,

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.330
will not [? right ?]
rigorous formulas.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.870
So let's consider,
just as an example,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.395
consider the
three-point scattering,

00:17:52.395 --> 00:17:54.410
three-point functions.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.840
Say I have three operators.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.804
And look at this connected
[INAUDIBLE] function.

00:17:59.804 --> 00:18:00.303
OK?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:11.500
So now, in those places,
we can, in principle,

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.410
insert the complete
set of states.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.390
OK?

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.380
And those can be considered
as intermediate states--

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.260
contribute to this process.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.240
So if I consider a
scattering process,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.370
and then I can insert a
complete set of states here,

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.210
then those states which gives
a nontrivial contribution

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.280
can be considered
as a contribution

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.120
from some intermediate states.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.620
OK?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.470
So for example, let me introduce
a single particle state

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.470
here-- say this O1, O2, O3.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:19:00.640
Suppose I insert a complete
set of-- so I insert a 1 here.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:08.850
This 1, we include the sum of
all possible single particle

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:38.080
states and also include possible
two-particle states, et cetera.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.796
OK?

00:19:42.796 --> 00:19:44.712
And look at the [INAUDIBLE]
equaling function.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.890
OK?

00:19:51.635 --> 00:19:53.260
Yeah, just heuristically,
when I insert

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.820
the complete set
of states, I can

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.100
insert [INAUDIBLE] like that.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.650
So now let's look
at the scaling.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:07.330
So this scale, according to
our general behavior actually

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:11.450
scales as 1 over N. OK?

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.830
So this guy is
indeed scale as 1.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.570
So two-point function still
says 1, N to the power of 0.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.960
And then this guy scales
as N to the power minus 1.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.800
So this term is OK.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.580
So insertion of the single
particle state is OK.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.050
But now, this will give you
a higher order contribution,

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.470
because this scales
as N equal to minus 1.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.810
And this scales as
N equal to minus 2.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.180
So all together,
this contributes to N

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.160
to the minus 3.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.990
OK?

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.560
So the contribution of
the two particle states,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.980
they will be suppressed
compared to the contribution

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.070
of the single particle states.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:03.505
And similarly, with higher--
even higher-- even more

00:21:03.505 --> 00:21:04.821
particle states.

00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:05.320
OK?

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:14.840
So if I draw a diagram, this
process is like the following.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.530
It said I can start with 1.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.880
And then this 1 can,
say, turn into i

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.630
through a two-point function.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.936
And then this i can
go to 2 and a 3.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:31.950
OK?

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.220
So this is a tree-level process.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.790
And this is like the following.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.580
So this is a two-particle state.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.450
So this, if I draw a
diagram, would be like

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.730
if I started with 1.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.260
And then this 1
can split into ij.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.530
And then this ij
combines into 2, 3.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:55.220
OK?

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.260
So this is like a
one-loop process.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:58.800
OK?

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.960
And this, we see,
it's N to the minus 3.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.660
And this is indeed
just N to the minus 1.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.710
So this is suppressed
compared to that.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:13.200
So this is a direct way
to say that, in this kind

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:19.500
of-- to leading order, indeed,
can only tree-level processes.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.660
You can never have
these kind of loops.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.730
Because whenever you have a
loop, then of course one of you

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.500
must have a multi-particle.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.980
You must have multi-particle
intermediate states.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.420
And then they're
[INAUDIBLE] Is it clear?

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:41.230
So this tells you that
all loops are suppressed.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.110
And so abc together--
so this abc together,

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.750
then justify the statement
that to leading order.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:06.190
this scattering amplitude
involving only tree-level.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.430
When you have only a
tree-level scattering,

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.960
then this is like
a classical story.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.260
Only size you land in quantum
field theory in the loops

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.450
can be considered as
quantum fluctuations.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.560
And if you only have
trees, it's essentially

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.080
just a classical process.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.420
So when you solve the
classical equation motion,

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.090
and then what do you get?

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.610
It's the tree-level processes.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.661
OK?

00:23:30.661 --> 00:23:31.160
Yes?

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.797
AUDIENCE: What is the number
of operators [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:34.797 --> 00:23:35.380
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.190
AUDIENCE: What is the number
of operators in the sum?

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.998
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:23:40.998 --> 00:23:42.840
That's a very good question.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:48.230
And essentially, by definition,
such operator only scales.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.320
Essentially, by
definition, such kind

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.800
of so-called single trace
operators and the scale set--

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.690
yeah, there's no--
yeah, just the way

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.330
you can make such
single trace operator

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:12.800
is not proportional
to N. Questions?

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.510
AUDIENCE: What is-- each of
these terms individually small,

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.074
but when you take
summation over them--

00:24:19.074 --> 00:24:19.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.090
Yeah, that's the
question was just asked.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.090
So those operators,
if you count them,

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.690
the number of single trace
operators you can construct

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:38.010
is independent of N. And so so
when you suppress them by N.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:41.480
There is nothing you
can compensate them.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.820
In principle, yeah, there's
nothing can compensate them.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:46.530
Yeah?

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:52.424
AUDIENCE: So how many
operators that are Oi, Oj

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:53.370
can you construct?

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.570
What is the magnitude?

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.570
PROFESSOR: Oh, it's an
infinite number of them.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:57.903
It's an infinite number of them.

00:24:57.903 --> 00:25:03.686
But the key is the
infinite [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:03.686 --> 00:25:05.186
AUDIENCE: It's a
factor of infinite.

00:25:05.186 --> 00:25:05.990
We can just--

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's infinite.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.203
It's infinite.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.846
But compared to the large N
limit, it's still order 1.

00:25:15.846 --> 00:25:17.944
[LAUGHS]

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.380
It's infinite.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.774
It's infinite, but it's
order N to the power 0.

00:25:26.774 --> 00:25:27.736
AUDIENCE: Oh, my gosh.

00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:28.569
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:30.670
PROFESSOR: It's N
to the power of 0.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:40.120
And so they will be suppressed,
by physical process.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.850
So for example,
say this operator--

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.420
say I have some dimension.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:51.540
Say this operator-- suppose this
Particle 1 have some energy.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.090
And a particle has some energy.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.710
And then the process of
this generated this, too.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.700
And when their energy
becomes very large,

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.320
then it's suppressed.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.395
And you have this kind
of physical suppression.

00:26:05.395 --> 00:26:08.090
Of course, if you
include all energies,

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.810
there are an infinite
number of them.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.575
But in fact, if you
can-- if you consider,

00:26:13.575 --> 00:26:15.540
yeah, energy [INAUDIBLE]
this kind of thing.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.496
Then essentially, there's a
finite number of contributes.

00:26:17.496 --> 00:26:18.204
AUDIENCE: Finite.

00:26:18.204 --> 00:26:19.030
OK.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.696
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:19.696 --> 00:26:23.315
But the key is that this is
order N to the power of 0.

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:24.854
AUDIENCE: Maybe one more thing--

00:26:24.854 --> 00:26:25.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.194
AUDIENCE: What if it includes
the loop, closed by itself?

00:26:30.194 --> 00:26:30.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.450
AUDIENCE: Like a closed
fermion loop [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.850
I mean, it doesn't need to
involve [INAUDIBLE] state.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.094
It can just [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:40.094 --> 00:26:41.010
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.800
Loop always involves
particle states.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.975
So any loop, when you cross
it, there's always two states.

00:26:47.975 --> 00:26:51.322
AUDIENCE: Don't they need
to cross it at the end?

00:26:51.322 --> 00:26:53.889
I mean, like a [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:53.889 --> 00:26:55.680
PROFESSOR: Sorry, I
don't quite understand.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.830
Any loop, by definition,
when you cross it,

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.360
there's always two points.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.940
Then that means this is
more than one particle.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.430
AUDIENCE: Just something
like this, don't cross any--

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.680
PROFESSOR: No, no, no, no, no.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.304
You cross here.

00:27:09.304 --> 00:27:10.880
You still have two particles.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.730
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.649
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:14.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you cut at any time.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.356
There's still two particles.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.190
OK.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.350
Let's summarize.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.147
So now let's combine 1, 2, 3.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.910
So we can combine 1, 2, 3.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.620
So this tells us--
so this 1, 2, 3

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:51.400
tells us at leading order
in large N expansion,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.416
we have a series--
a classical series.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:06.080
We essentially just have a
classical series of glueballs.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.370
You just have a
bunch of particles,

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.020
and they interact classically.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.560
There's no quantum fluctuations.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:29.910
And we see interactions
among glueballs, among them,

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:35.970
given by some effective company
which I call g tilde, which

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.870
scales as 1 over N. OK?

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:45.430
Scales as 1 over N.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:50.230
So let me just elaborate this
statement a little bit more.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.320
So this can be
considered as, say,

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.560
when we take a gauge theory--
say, for [INAUDIBLE] theory.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.134
Say QCD.

00:29:00.134 --> 00:29:01.550
You take N goes
to infinity limit.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.839
And you take h bar finite.

00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:08.880
So by definition, when we
talk about this theory,

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.320
h bar is always finite.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.890
But in the N equals
infinity limit,

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:22.190
this is equivalent
to a glueball theory

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:26.150
where h bar tilde goes to 0.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:27.090
OK.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:32.235
So you get the classical
theory and with effective h

00:29:32.235 --> 00:29:35.320
bar tilde, which is controlled,
essentially, by 1 over N

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.380
goes to 0.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.510
OK?

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:47.020
So here, you can do
perturbative expansion 1 over N.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.880
So this is just a leading order.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:58.850
Here, you can do perturbative
expansion in 1 over N.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.660
So in this side,
it's like some kind

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:12.100
of semi-classical
expansion in this h

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:19.000
tilde, which, of course, should
be scaled as 1 over N. OK?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.050
So on this side, when
h bar tilde goes to 0,

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:24.560
you have a classical theory.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.271
But then you can do
expansion h tilde.

00:30:27.271 --> 00:30:28.770
So this is one that
we normally call

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:32.370
a semi-classical expansion.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:32.880
OK?

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.090
So the large N expansion
has been translated

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.859
into some semi-classical
expansion when you translate

00:30:39.859 --> 00:30:41.150
into this glueball [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:48.554
And we're now--
so is this clear?

00:30:48.554 --> 00:30:50.220
Yeah, this is a little
bit small corner.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.565
Is it readable?

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.310
Yeah.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.490
This is a very
important statement.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.742
Maybe I should rewrite it.

00:31:01.742 --> 00:31:05.970
Yeah, let me just rewrite it.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:18.150
So perturbative expansion--
perturbation in N, in 1 over N.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:28.600
So this is equal to
semi-classical expansion

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:38.350
in h bar tilde, which
scales 1 over N. OK.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:59.110
And we will now show that these
guys, this glueball theory,

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:03.340
and this semi-classical
expansion,

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.920
is actually a string theory.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.500
OK?

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.660
No, we will not show that.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.640
I say I will motivate that.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.610
I say that's a string theory.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.251
So before I go that, do
you have any questions?

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.220
Yes?

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.580
AUDIENCE: Just to
clarify, doesn't

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.090
the sort of second
statement-- the fact

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.840
that the perturbation
1 over N corresponds

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.900
with semi-classical
expansion in h bar tilde,

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.910
isn't that just a generalization
of the thing you just wrote?

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:32.942
It's the same statement.

00:32:32.942 --> 00:32:34.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
the same statement.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.850
No, no, no.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.170
This true statement, they are--

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.700
AUDIENCE: Basically the same.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.600
PROFESSOR: They
are not equivalent.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.032
This is talking about
this particular limit.

00:32:45.032 --> 00:32:46.199
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:48.490
PROFESSOR: This is talking
about this particular limit.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:50.600
And then this tells
you what happens

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:57.040
when we'll relax this limit by
including [INAUDIBLE] fact by 1

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.840
over N expansion.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.270
And to make this
identification-- so this

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.560
by itself does not imply that.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.060
AUDIENCE: The other
way does, right?

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:07.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.530
Of course, the other way does.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.030
So this is a stronger statement.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.696
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:33:10.696 --> 00:33:11.696
OK.

00:33:11.696 --> 00:33:14.160
PROFESSOR: Under
this statement, it's

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.110
supported by just looking at
the leading model behavior.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.000
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.455
PROFESSOR: But if you want
to look at this behavior,

00:33:21.455 --> 00:33:23.440
and then you look
at-- then you need

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.740
to look at the sub-reading
terms of 1 over N.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.770
Say, for example, here.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.700
Then you see the
fluctuation is controlled

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.490
by 1 over N. It's like your
fluctuation is controlled

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.590
by h bar.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.280
And similarity,
here, then when you

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.270
include 1 over N
[INAUDIBLE], then you

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.690
will see a single particle.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.750
And the two particle,
multi-particle particle,

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.150
they can mix together
due to fluctuations.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.210
And again, that
amplitude controlled by 1

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.090
over N, et cetera.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:56.520
Yeah, just say this
statement is stronger.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.330
You need to look at sub-reading
corrections carefully,

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.244
and you'll see that fits
into an h bar pattern.

00:34:02.244 --> 00:34:02.910
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:03.576
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.488
Yes?

00:34:07.488 --> 00:34:09.484
AUDIENCE: So instead
of this [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:09.484 --> 00:34:13.481
we consider regular
creation-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:13.481 --> 00:34:14.975
Do we still come
to the conclusion

00:34:14.975 --> 00:34:18.469
that all the loop
diagrams are trace?

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:19.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.620
That's a good point.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:26.199
So in essence, you
can imagine this Oi,

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:32.190
each Oi defines-- this point,
1, is precisely a statement.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.449
So you can imagine
each Oi defines

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:38.489
a creation-- defines
an independent creation

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:42.126
under [INAUDIBLE] operator.

00:34:42.126 --> 00:34:43.040
Yeah.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.889
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
theory [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:46.451
expression of both diagrams.

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:47.159
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:48.783
No, in the original
theory, we are not.

00:34:48.783 --> 00:34:50.305
Only in the large N limit.

00:34:50.305 --> 00:34:53.836
AUDIENCE: So in the original
theory, in the large N limit,

00:34:53.836 --> 00:34:55.306
we do have suppression?

00:34:55.306 --> 00:34:55.889
PROFESSOR: No.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.990
You don't have a
suppression of loop diagram

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.242
in terms of the standard loops.

00:35:00.242 --> 00:35:01.950
You only have the
suppression of the loop

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.230
diagram in terms of
those loops-- in terms

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.475
of loops of glueballs.

00:35:07.475 --> 00:35:09.016
AUDIENCE: But here
we don't specify--

00:35:09.016 --> 00:35:11.890
don't put any restrictions
on what are the operators O.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.534
So why can't we say
just Oi is just psi i?

00:35:16.534 --> 00:35:17.450
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:21.370
O is [INAUDIBLE] operator,
O is composite operator.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.930
O is some composite operator.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.080
So for example, in the
[INAUDIBLE] series,

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.370
so one example is O
can be TrF squared.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.930
So if you look at the
two-point function of O,

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.050
then that's corresponding
to two gluon propagators.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.590
And you have loops here.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.810
But this is not the loop
in terms of the glueballs

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:54.780
here when we talk about loops--
yeah, so let me emphasize.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.780
All loops of glueballs.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.440
Because here-- so the
key of this statement

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.960
is that in a large
N limit-- and if you

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:11.200
can see-- if our thing is
gauge invariant operators,

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.470
then that's a [INAUDIBLE]
that you should consider.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.779
And if you're not worried
about the original stuff.

00:36:16.779 --> 00:36:19.070
And those that have loops,
et cetera, [INAUDIBLE] the h

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.310
bar, et cetera.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.150
But in terms of those
glueballs, then you

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:24.162
have a classical theory.

00:36:24.162 --> 00:36:24.870
There's no loops.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.328
You only have
tree-level scattering

00:36:26.328 --> 00:36:29.310
in the large N limit.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.120
Yes?

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.684
AUDIENCE: So are we
getting a general gauge

00:36:32.684 --> 00:36:34.100
of varying operators
or explicitly

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.900
single trace operators?

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.650
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.690
I have talked about everything.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.750
AUDIENCE: So I mean
like the single--

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:46.784
a single O operator can
be several traces inside?

00:36:46.784 --> 00:36:47.700
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.460
Single O is a single trace.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.570
It's a single trace
that's defined there.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.210
AUDIENCE: What about non-trace
gauge invariance operators?

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.630
PROFESSOR: We don't
consider them.

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.947
Oh, you mean non-trace
gauge invariant operator?

00:36:58.947 --> 00:37:01.363
No, every gauging variance
operator always involves trace.

00:37:01.363 --> 00:37:02.210
AUDIENCE: Always?

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.610
You will be a
famous mathematician

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.420
if you can construct
something invariant which

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.720
does not involve a trace.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.530
Yeah, construct something
about the matrix.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.616
Construct something
using matrices

00:37:17.616 --> 00:37:21.060
which does not involve traces.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:21.560
Yeah.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.640
Even if you do determinant,
and determinant

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.911
can still be written as traces.

00:37:25.911 --> 00:37:26.410
Yeah.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.632
Yeah, just everything
can be written as traces.

00:37:29.632 --> 00:37:31.090
AUDIENCE: So
determinant would just

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.480
have-- if you have a
determinant operator, that

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.580
can just be written as
a product of many Os.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.090
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:36.490
That's right.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:37.031
That's right.

00:37:37.031 --> 00:37:38.151
That's right.

00:37:38.151 --> 00:37:38.650
Good.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.330
Any other questions?

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:40.830
Yes?

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.954
AUDIENCE: Just to clarify,
we've been talking about

00:37:42.954 --> 00:37:45.944
the-- [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:45.944 --> 00:37:46.610
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.690
Here, we are
talking about only--

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.110
every field is
matrix valued fields.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.030
Just every field is
matrix valued fields.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.500
Yes?

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.229
AUDIENCE: I don't
know, I just-- I

00:38:01.229 --> 00:38:05.802
thought there was more
invariance that you

00:38:05.802 --> 00:38:06.970
can construct [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:10.110
Like I was asking
you the other day,

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.260
basically it's all
of the-- each one

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.500
of the coefficients of
the characters [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.890
polynomial of a matrix.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:18.245
PROFESSOR: Yeah, they
can be written as traces.

00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:22.381
Yeah, they can be
written as traces.

00:38:22.381 --> 00:38:23.794
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
didn't know that.

00:38:23.794 --> 00:38:26.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.774
AUDIENCE: Usually we
don't discuss quarks here.

00:38:28.774 --> 00:38:29.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.410
Yeah, here we have--
not as quarks.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.890
And we're going to mention
quarks very briefly at the end.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:35.390
Yeah.

00:38:38.028 --> 00:38:38.861
Any other questions?

00:38:42.455 --> 00:38:42.955
Good.

00:38:42.955 --> 00:38:43.390
Good.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.890
OK.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.416
So now let's talk a little
about string theory.

00:38:48.984 --> 00:38:50.150
Maybe I will leave it there.

00:38:55.988 --> 00:38:57.362
Let me see where
they leave that.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.930
Yeah, let me leave that.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:08.430
OK.

00:40:04.066 --> 00:40:06.325
So first we'll talk a little
bit about the strings.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:13.710
So first, let me
remind you, QFT,

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.480
normally when we
say a QFT, we say

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.250
QFT is a series of particles.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.490
OK?

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.600
So the standard
approach to the QFT--

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.220
say you write down a
field theory Lagrangian,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.680
and then you quantize
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.990
So this is normally called
the second quantized.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:48.050
So the standard
approach is called

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.540
the second quantized approach.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:58.930
So you can quantize
the approach.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.330
OK?

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.485
But there also exists a
first quantized approach.

00:41:11.966 --> 00:41:13.840
There also exists a
first quantized approach.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.130
There also exists a
first quantized approach.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:40.230
Say you directly quantize-- you
just quantize a quantum motion,

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.922
say, over a particle
or particles.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.180
Say this is considered
one particle-- say

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.420
a particle in spacetime.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.540
OK?

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.880
So for example, if you can
see the particle propagate

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:05.240
in spacetime along some
trajectory-- so let's

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.450
parametrized this trajectory
using a parameter by tau, which

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:13.140
labeled a point
along the trajectory,

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:17.340
and then, so this will
give you a mapping.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.370
Say the trajectory will map
out the trajectory-- yeah,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.350
so this will map out the
trajectory in spacetime,

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:26.190
which can be written as
a spacetime coordinate

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.530
as a function of tau.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:28.030
OK?

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:32.265
So this parametrized the
[INAUDIBLE] of the particle.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.100
So this parametrized the
[INAUDIBLE] of the particle.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:49.780
And to quantize the
particle, the simplest way

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:54.650
is to imagine just sum
over all possible paths

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.947
over the particle.

00:42:55.947 --> 00:42:57.780
So essentially, we're
doing a path integral.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.890
Essentially we're
doing a path integral.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:12.694
So you just integrate over all
possible paths of a particle,

00:43:12.694 --> 00:43:14.610
and then this is essentially
a quantum motion.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:18.160
Just quantum mechanically,
it can fluctuate, anyway.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:24.010
And then this particle-- then
this action, for the particle,

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:29.660
essentially it's just the lens.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.090
So suppose the
particle has mass m,

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.127
it's just in the lens
of the particle, dl,

00:43:34.127 --> 00:43:35.002
along the trajectory.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.750
OK?

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.149
And if you include
interactions, then you

00:43:45.149 --> 00:43:46.940
have to include the
trajectories into which

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.870
the particle can split.

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:52.810
Say a line can split in
two lines, et cetera.

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:58.720
So this gives you
interactions, et cetera.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.220
OK?

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.450
And this we need to add by
hand, because the particle

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:13.050
in principle can-- you can draw
infinite ways of particle split

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.630
into more particles, et cetera.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.880
So depend on your
specific theories,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:20.290
you need to specify,
say, the interactions.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.722
So this, you need add by hand.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.480
OK.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.580
So in principle, you can forget
about the standard formulation

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.920
of quantum field theory just to
work with this particle theory.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.840
So the string theory
is a generalization

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.590
of this first
quantized approach.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:03.400
So string theory, as is
currently formulated,

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.022
is formulated in this
first quantized approach.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:26.300
So you just quantize motions
of a string in spacetime.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.630
OK?

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:37.437
So for example,
so particle case,

00:45:37.437 --> 00:45:39.270
you have a [INAUDIBLE]
particle string case,

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.960
you have a closed loop.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.960
So imagine we have
a closed string.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.460
OK?

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.860
You have a closed string.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.420
A string is a
one-dimensional object,

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.320
so let's consider
a closed string.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.430
Then the string can
be parametrized.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.850
So the string itself
can be parametrized

00:45:55.850 --> 00:46:00.130
say by a parameter,
sigma, along the string.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:04.260
But then, then this string
can move in the spacetime.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.940
Then we'll trace
out some trajectory.

00:46:15.904 --> 00:46:18.950
Trace out some trajectory.

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.360
So this gives rise
to worldsheet.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.750
So in the particle case,
you have a [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.780
So in the string case,
you have a worldsheet,

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.030
which we normally call sigma.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.500
And then the sigma
can be, again, written

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.850
in terms of the spacetime
coordinates as a function

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:36.958
of this tau and the sigma.

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:45.070
Now you have two coordinates
to parametrize this worldsheet.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:46.920
So this is essentially
a two-dimensional--

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.720
so essentially, you have
a two-dimensional surface

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.180
in the spacetime,
embedded in spacetime.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:58.010
And the string theory
just quantized--

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.350
you just can see the motion
of all such kind of surfaces.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:02.564
Yes?

00:47:02.564 --> 00:47:04.480
AUDIENCE: So in the case
of a single particle,

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.580
we have a point.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:09.860
Does this action actually--
what does it reproduce exactly?

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.700
Is it capable of reproducing all
of quantum field theory using

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.550
this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in principle.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.370
But it's not convenient.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.060
Yeah, for example, if you
have a scalar particle,

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:23.640
this can certainly easily
reproduce your free scalar

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.600
field theory.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.400
And if you want to
reproduce phi-cubed theory,

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.856
then you need to add this
kind of a split in your--

00:47:31.856 --> 00:47:35.340
when you do your path integral
including the trajectories,

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.864
you need to include these
kind of trajectories.

00:47:37.864 --> 00:47:39.280
Yeah, in principle,
you can do it.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.354
It's not very convenient.

00:47:40.354 --> 00:47:41.020
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.180
OK.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:42.680
Interesting.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:43.305
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:47:43.305 --> 00:47:44.890
AUDIENCE: How do
you add interactions

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.650
by hand in that particle?

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:50.480
PROFESSOR: Oh, well you
just [? recreate. ?]

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:56.060
In the path integral, here,
you integrate all such kind

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.839
of paths, right?

00:47:57.839 --> 00:47:59.130
And then you have prescription.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.730
You say, what kind
of paths to include.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:05.510
And for example, if I have
phi-cubed kind of interaction,

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.994
then you say we should
include this kind of path.

00:48:07.994 --> 00:48:12.700
AUDIENCE: But in case it cannot
be parametrized as a top,

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.184
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:14.184 --> 00:48:14.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:15.349
Yeah.

00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:19.350
Then you have to-- then there
are tactical complications

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.577
in doing these extensions.

00:48:21.577 --> 00:48:22.910
AUDIENCE: So one other question.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.462
Is string theory
formulated in terms

00:48:24.462 --> 00:48:27.800
of-- is it possible to
perform a second quantization?

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:32.220
PROFESSOR: Not right now.

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:35.667
So people have written down
classical string field theory.

00:48:35.667 --> 00:48:37.250
And in principle,
you can quantize it.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.160
But that's a very
complicated thing.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.830
But I think nobody have
successfully quantized it.

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:45.660
Even to write down the
theory is very non-trivial.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.390
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:53.250
So similarly, to do
quantization for string,

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:56.530
you just look at
the-- you just can

00:48:56.530 --> 00:49:05.410
see that the path integral--
so in principle, to do

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:14.170
the quantize of the
string, you can again just

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:19.410
imagine your sum over
all possible worldsheet

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.380
configurations.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:26.280
All possible this
kind of embedding

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.940
of this two-dimensional
surface in spacetime,

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:32.500
then that essentially gives rise
to all kinds of string motions.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.030
OK?

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.460
So weighted by
some string action.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:46.452
So the simplest way to
write down the string action

00:49:46.452 --> 00:49:47.910
is a straightforward
generalization

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:53.013
of this particle case, if I
just integrate over its area.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.540
So here, it's just the
lens of the string.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.480
Here, it's the area.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.580
But here, we also
need to include--

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.560
so here is the particle mass.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.640
So a generation of
the particle mass

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.420
is the so-called string tension.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:17.322
So t, which is normally
written as 2 alpha prime.

00:50:17.322 --> 00:50:18.530
So you introduce a parameter.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:20.650
You introduce a dimensional
parameter alpha prime

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.570
to parametrize this t.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:24.068
And so this is string tension.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:33.280
So this is the mass per unit.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.320
String tension is just
mass per unit length.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.480
OK?

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:47.140
And this is normally called
a Nambu-Goto action, so NG.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:53.926
So this is Nambu-Goto action,
who first wrote it down.

00:50:59.310 --> 00:50:59.810
OK?

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.900
So the A is essentially
just the area

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.350
of the surface in the spacetime.

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:06.950
OK? it's just straight
generalization

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:08.630
of that length of
the trajectory.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:20.340
And yeah, depend
on the worries--

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.950
depend on what kind of
questions you are interested,

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.690
then you try to track those
kind of physical answers

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.370
from this-- say
this path integral.

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.740
OK?

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.061
Any questions so far?

00:51:31.061 --> 00:51:31.560
Yes?

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:34.670
AUDIENCE: Do we allow paths to
contract the string to a point?

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:35.337
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:35.337 --> 00:51:35.836
Yeah.

00:51:35.836 --> 00:51:36.632
I will show you.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:42.248
Yeah?

00:51:42.248 --> 00:51:46.214
AUDIENCE: Is that
2 times variable?

00:51:46.214 --> 00:51:47.130
PROFESSOR: No, single.

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:51.040
No, sigma parametrized
the string itself,

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.010
and the tau, it parametrized
the motion of the string

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.710
along the motion of the string.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:02.122
AUDIENCE: But there is a
time variable in sigma?

00:52:02.122 --> 00:52:03.840
Or it's just a--

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:04.590
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:06.910
Tau is the time.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:09.670
Tau is the internal
time for the string.

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:13.020
And then, there's a time
in here-- in the x0,

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.477
in the spacetime.

00:52:15.477 --> 00:52:17.060
So this can be
considered as some kind

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.220
of proper time for the string--
internal time for the string.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.524
Yeah, just like you parametrized
the trajectory of the particle,

00:52:24.524 --> 00:52:27.190
you have some tau to parametrize
the trajectory of the particle.

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:29.140
This is the same thing.

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.780
AUDIENCE: That means
so any proper time--

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:37.000
isn't a variance-- itself is
four-dimensional spacetime.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.906
Why there is only like one
parameter of tau which does not

00:52:41.906 --> 00:52:45.291
have these four components?

00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:47.795
PROFESSOR: No, I don't
understand what you-- no,

00:52:47.795 --> 00:52:48.920
there's only a single time.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.961
You have a particle, you
have only a single time.

00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:51.750
Right?

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:54.005
Now do you agree here
there's only tau here?

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.088
Now here, I just have a line.

00:52:58.088 --> 00:52:59.254
I've parametrized this line.

00:52:59.254 --> 00:53:00.080
I call it tau.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.039
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah.

00:53:01.039 --> 00:53:03.080
PROFESSOR: Here, I have
a two dimensional-- here,

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.600
I have a string.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.680
And then each point on the
string moves like a particle.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.840
And then my parametrize by tau.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.896
It's the same thing.

00:53:10.896 --> 00:53:11.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:12.330
Yeah.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:13.371
Yeah.

00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:13.996
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.250
AUDIENCE: You go ahead.

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.510
AUDIENCE: What's the
metric on the worldsheet?

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:22.860
Does that make sense to ask?

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.235
Because it's like
minus plus or--

00:53:24.235 --> 00:53:25.867
PROFESSOR: Of course,
it makes sense.

00:53:25.867 --> 00:53:27.492
Of course, on the
worldsheet, it should

00:53:27.492 --> 00:53:33.990
be a Lorentz in-- whatever is
the metric on worldsheet will

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.790
be induced from the spacetime.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.050
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.702
So it would be a minus plus.

00:53:38.702 --> 00:53:39.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, for example.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:40.220
Yeah.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:40.390
Yeah.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:41.100
It's [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.090
Yeah.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.510
Yeah, you can also-- we
can talk about-- yes?

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:45.290
AUDIENCE: So one other question.

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:47.289
So if that should be
interpreted as proper time,

00:53:47.289 --> 00:53:49.030
if I have a string
which is moving

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:51.087
in some weird,
non-uniform way, how

00:53:51.087 --> 00:53:53.670
does it make sense to talk about
the proper time of the string

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.720
when you could imagine the
different points on the string?

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:56.850
Yeah.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.020
Good point.

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:01.240
So often, you cannot
talk about that.

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.420
And this just gives you
a heuristic picture.

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.960
Because in principle,
string can do a highly

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.650
non-classical motion.

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:12.210
And then that's what's
encoded, say integrating over

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:14.440
all such kind of surfaces.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.470
And some of them, you
cannot interpret classically

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:19.580
or semi-classically into
this kind of picture.

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:21.000
You visualize it.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.680
So I will draw some
pictures later.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.760
You will see.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.485
Yes?

00:54:25.485 --> 00:54:27.860
AUDIENCE: This might be a
question without a good answer,

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:32.760
but what is the-- why does
the action take that form?

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.910
What is that
accomplishing physically?

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:36.540
Or I guess maybe
an easier example

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.120
would be up there in the
first quantization approach.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.440
How does that
reproduce [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.810
PROFESSOR: You say why
that produce gravity?

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:46.616
Yeah.

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:48.240
How that reproduces
gravity, of course,

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.970
is a technical
question which you

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:55.560
have to calculate explicitly.

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.580
But the question, you said,
why do we choose that?

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.700
The reason we
choose that is it's

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.720
based on various principles.

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:09.580
So first, that thing,
whatever it is,

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:15.310
should not depend on
how you choose this tau.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:18.380
Because you can parametrize
your trajectory anywhere

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:21.750
you want so that the l-- so
whatever this action should not

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.580
depend on the parametrization.

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:28.560
And also, this action
should be Lorentz invariant,

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.530
and the Lorentz boost
should be translating

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.320
[INAUDIBLE], et cetera.

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.700
And with those conditions,
then essentially uniquely

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.810
determined to be this form.

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:41.312
It's [INAUDIBLE]
unique [INAUDIBLE] Yes?

00:55:41.312 --> 00:55:42.895
AUDIENCE: So I guess
if you were doing

00:55:42.895 --> 00:55:44.719
a quantization of
the bosonic string,

00:55:44.719 --> 00:55:46.635
like if you were deriving
the field equations,

00:55:46.635 --> 00:55:49.424
would you use Nambu-Goto
or would you use Polyakov?

00:55:49.424 --> 00:55:50.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:50.790
Yeah.

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:51.860
That's right.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:55.720
If you really quantize it, you
actually don't use Nambu-Goto.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:59.600
Nambu-Goto, you use it for
the classical description.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.530
Yeah.

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:03.390
I did not mention
the other forms.

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:06.550
It's just for our current
discussion, it's not essential.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:07.110
Yeah.

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.480
Indeed, when you
quantize it, you actually

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.033
use a different
form of this action.

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.010
Any other questions?

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:18.040
Good.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:30.700
So now, for example,
say how you-- so it

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.760
depends on what kind of
questions you are interested,

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:39.180
and you try to extract them,
say, from this kind of path

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.260
integral.

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:45.140
And of course, this is a
highly non-trivial questions.

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.570
And they require, say, some kind
of trial and error, et cetera.

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:55.700
So let me just tell you-- say if
I want to calculate the vacuum

00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:56.710
process.

00:56:56.710 --> 00:57:03.250
Say if I want to calculate
the vacuum energy-- OK?

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:07.110
So let me call this Z string.

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:11.510
So remember, when we talk
about large N gauge series,

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:14.200
and if you want to
calculate the vacuum energy,

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.670
then you calculate the-- you
sum over all possible vacuum

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:17.930
diagrams, et cetera.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:19.080
OK?

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.400
You sum over all
possible vacuum diagrams.

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.500
But suppose we want to calculate
the vacuum energy in the string

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:29.050
theory, and then you
do the similar thing.

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:33.830
You just do the, what do you
want to do for the string?

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:45.810
You say you sum over--
all closed 2D surfaces.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.480
OK?

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.975
So the "closed"
here is essential.

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:57.229
So this is based
on the intuition

00:57:57.229 --> 00:57:59.770
that when we-- in the quantum
field theory, when you sum over

00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:03.100
fermion diagrams, and the
fermion diagrams heuristically

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.210
can be considered as a particle
trajectories, et cetera.

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:13.220
And for the vacuum process, none
of-- there's no external lags.

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.230
So everything coming
out of the vacuum then

00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:17.110
come back to the vacuum.

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:19.960
So that's why-- so if we
want to calculate the vacuum

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.100
energy in the string
theory, and again,

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.840
corresponding to the
virtual string motion.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.410
And again, the
virtual string motion

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:29.890
should correspond into the sum
of all such kind of services

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:32.690
without any external lags.

00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:34.131
So it should be closed surfaces.

00:58:34.131 --> 00:58:34.630
OK?

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:36.324
It should be closed surfaces.

00:58:36.324 --> 00:58:37.990
So it's the analog
of the particle case.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:42.740
So exactly as in the
quantum field theory case,

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.780
it's easier to do this using
the Euclidian-- by going

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:49.600
to the Euclidian
signature, and say

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.749
go to the Euclidian signature.

00:58:51.749 --> 00:58:53.165
It's going to
Euclidian signature.

00:58:55.990 --> 00:59:00.940
So essentially, analytic--
so instead of considering

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:03.300
a surface in the
Lorentzian spacetime,

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.025
you consider-- your
analytics continue

00:59:05.025 --> 00:59:06.600
your spacetime,
the full spacetime

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.640
to the Euclidian signature.

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.410
And then this just
becomes some surface

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:14.000
in some Euclidean space.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.470
And then this is just a much
easier mathematical object

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:17.540
to deal with.

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.040
OK?

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.350
So that's what you get.

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:21.580
And if you have a string,
and then you have this.

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:24.400
OK?

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.740
OK.

00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:29.220
So now, when you sum
over all surfaces,

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.190
now you have a choice.

00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:33.900
First, you can sum
over the topology.

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:37.530
So we talked about before--
or two-dimensional surfaces,

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:41.330
topologies classified
by this genus.

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:47.070
And then, you can sum over
surfaces with a given--

00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:51.620
so you can separate the
sum into sum over topology

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:59.840
and then some surfaces of
a given topology, given h.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.440
OK?

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.862
So this h is the genus.

01:00:02.862 --> 01:00:04.320
So essentially, we
are just summing

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.190
of all possible two-dimensional
closed surfaces.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:10.360
OK?

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.840
Is this point clear?

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.115
This is absolutely key point.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:21.637
And with this, minus SNG.

01:00:21.637 --> 01:00:22.136
OK?

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.490
So now there's a very
important mathematical trick.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:36.740
And this mathematical trick
can be justified vigorously,

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.940
but I will not just put it here.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.900
I will just add it here.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.460
It says now, just in physic,s
whenever you see a discrete sum

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.160
like this, what do you do?

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.880
Or in mathematics, whenever you
see a discrete sum like this,

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.655
what do we do?

01:00:56.872 --> 01:00:57.371
Hm?

01:00:57.371 --> 01:00:59.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.410
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:02.912
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:01:02.912 --> 01:01:05.040
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:06.520
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.640
You add weight.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.460
So here, I will
add a weight here.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.227
So here, I am summing
of O topology.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.867
But now I will add
by hand a weight

01:01:21.867 --> 01:01:23.200
to weigh the different topology.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.430
So lambda is just
some parameter.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:30.478
So lambda is just a parameter
I introduced by hand myself.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.800
OK?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:52.785
So this is just the weight
for a different topology.

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:01.020
So chi is the Euler number.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.740
So lambda is just
some-- so chi is

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:08.260
the Euler number, 2 minus 2h.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:12.410
And the lambda just
can be considered

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:21.680
as some kind of
chemical potential--

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.205
some kind of chemical
potential, say, for topologies.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:28.760
OK?

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.800
Yeah.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.130
Yeah, just like
in the system, say

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:35.070
you have a conservative
charge, then

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:40.320
when you add particles,
different particle number,

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.272
it's convenient to add
a chemical potential.

01:02:42.272 --> 01:02:43.230
So lambda is like that.

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:52.924
So even though I
added by hand now--

01:02:52.924 --> 01:02:55.340
even though I added it by hand
here, but in string theory,

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.370
actually this is--
arises completely natural

01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:01.420
from the string theory.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:05.247
There's a rigorous way one
can show how that arises,

01:03:05.247 --> 01:03:06.330
but I will not do it here.

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:09.070
It's not important
for our purpose.

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:12.030
And I will also introduce
a notation-- say gs

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:14.124
is equal to exponential lambda.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:14.624
OK?

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:29.000
So now, let's look
at the summation.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.790
So here, you sum over--
so at h equal to 0, you

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:41.910
sum over all surface with
the topology of a sphere.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:46.210
And the weight is given
by gs minus 2, which

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:48.890
is expansion minus 2 lambda.

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:50.400
OK?

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.350
Now because the chi-- when h
equal to 0, chi equal to 2.

01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:56.870
So this is just minus 2 lambda.

01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:59.150
And so this is one
over gs squared.

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:00.590
OK?

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:09.650
And then the torus
is h equal to 1.

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:14.260
So this is just the
gs to the power 0.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.196
So order 1.

01:04:16.196 --> 01:04:24.310
If you have genus 2, so
this would be gh equal to 2,

01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:26.105
and it would be gs squared.

01:04:26.105 --> 01:04:26.605
OK?

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:32.863
So here is a remarkable fact.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.290
So here is a remarkable fact.

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:52.860
Here is a remarkable fact.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:28.580
It said summing over topology
automatically includes

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.460
interaction of strings.

01:05:36.811 --> 01:05:37.310
OK?

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:51.814
In fact, this fully specifies
string interactions.

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:01.978
OK?

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:10.065
So let me just elaborate
on this statement.

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:16.910
So we can see this statement
from these sums here.

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:17.892
OK?

01:06:17.892 --> 01:06:19.600
So now let's look at
the physical meaning

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.420
of those diagrams.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.860
So let's first look at
the sphere diagrams.

01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:32.730
So suppose we draw a sphere.

01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:40.070
OK?

01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:42.020
So what I'm describing
to you is heuristic,

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.103
from physical perspective.

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.210
So if you think about the
sphere embedded in the space--

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:52.660
so this is [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:56.291
So if you think from, say,
imagine your time going up.

01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:56.790
OK?

01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:59.180
Imagine your time going up.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.870
So this [INAUDIBLE] you
nucleate an infinitesimal string

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:07.960
at the tip of the sphere, and
then this stream propagates.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.340
So then each time,
you have a string.

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:14.850
And then, at some future time,
then go back to the vacuum.

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:15.770
OK?

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:18.250
And so you just have a
string come in and come out--

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:21.600
a string come out from the
vacuum, and then go back.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.830
And the sphere just described
this kind of virtual process.

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:30.570
So you look at string,
and then disappear.

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:32.540
OK?

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:41.290
Say nucleate string--
string nucleation,

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:42.452
and it then disappears.

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:53.640
OK?

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.140
Yes?

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.290
AUDIENCE: Why did we only
talk about close strings?

01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:00.460
PROFESSOR: Because it's
enough for my purpose now.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.720
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.610
Yeah.

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:06.360
I'm not trying to give
you the full string

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.235
theory at the moment.

01:08:07.235 --> 01:08:10.900
I'm just trying to give you
the bit of string theory

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.250
that's enough to
make that point.

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:16.479
Say large N expansion
is like string theory.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:16.990
Yeah.

01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:19.540
Yeah, because otherwise,
take the whole semester

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.470
to reach the point.

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:32.370
So now, let's look at
this torus diagram.

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:38.372
Because if you want the
sum of all surfaces,

01:08:38.372 --> 01:08:40.330
then you have to sum over
different topologies,

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:42.510
then you have to
sum over the torus.

01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:46.080
Then let's look at what
torus diagram means.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.910
So let me show the torus in
the slightly different way.

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:56.620
OK?

01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:02.370
So the torus, again, if you try
to view the time going up, then

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:04.577
from here, again, you do
create the single string.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:10.436
But now, at this time, then
you actually have two strings.

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:17.310
And then, here, you have
one string back again.

01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:18.599
OK?

01:09:18.599 --> 01:09:20.140
And then the torus
actually describes

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:23.350
such a virtual process, is
that you nucleate a string

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:25.380
from the vacuum.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:32.220
And then this string
splits into two strings.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.210
And then these two
strings come back

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:36.810
to join, again,
into a single string

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:38.439
and then go to the vacuum.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:39.060
OK?

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:45.630
So this is the
nucleation out of vacuum.

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:52.383
And then here, it splits.

01:09:52.383 --> 01:09:56.530
So here, a single string
splits into two string.

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:59.050
And then here, they
join together, join back

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:00.330
into a single string.

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:02.508
And then here, disappear
into the vacuum.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:10.540
OK?

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:15.620
So we find, by including the
torus diagram you automatically

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.490
include this kind
of interaction,

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.760
that the string can
split into two strings,

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.130
and two strings can
join into single string.

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:28.630
And essentially, you
don't have choice.

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:30.890
This is just determined
by the topology.

01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:31.390
OK?

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:32.990
You don't have choice.

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:36.810
Just once you write
down this path integral,

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.390
then this is fully determined.

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:40.570
OK?

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.380
It's fully determined.

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:52.980
And similarly, if you look
at the [INAUDIBLE] process--

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:59.200
so you look at the string split,
join, splits and join again.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.420
So the [INAUDIBLE]
string again can

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:11.280
see that it has such
in the acting process.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:17.550
So now the key-- so now if
we compare the gs dependence

01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:20.980
of these diagrams.

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:26.750
So this one-- so each diagram,
compared to the earlier one,

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:30.660
you increase by gs
to the power squared.

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.600
But whenever you
include a genus,

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.520
essentially [INAUDIBLE]
include such a splitting

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.210
under the joining.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:41.160
So that means you can actually
associate with each process

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.715
to be a factor of g string.

01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:49.650
OK?

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:54.650
So for the sphere, you
have-- say from here.

01:11:54.650 --> 01:12:01.360
Say if you normalize a
sphere to be gs minus 2,

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.610
then now if you
include-- so essentially,

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:12.650
this weight which
we added here is

01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:17.882
to wait for such a splitting
and the joining process.

01:12:17.882 --> 01:12:19.590
So each splitting and
joining essentially

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.910
give you a weight of g string.

01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:23.350
OK?

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:24.700
Weight g string.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:40.180
So in some sense, we concluded
that-- so the basic string

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:48.580
interaction vertex is just a
single string can join into two

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:58.420
string, or two string--
or single string

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:04.360
can split into two
string, or two string

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.370
can join into a single string.

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:11.050
And the weight for each
process is given by g string.

01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:12.170
OK?

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:17.310
So that's effectively what
this mathematical trick does.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.730
So effectively what this
mathematical trick does

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:23.330
is to assign a weight for
each such splitting process.

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:24.189
Yes?

01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:25.605
AUDIENCE: So if
you start the-- so

01:13:25.605 --> 01:13:27.800
you drew it like this
for the two thing.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.532
But if you start the nucleation
from the side rather than

01:13:30.532 --> 01:13:32.620
the bottom, then wouldn't
it split into three

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:35.040
and then back into one?

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.040
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:42.570
Yeah, it's-- because
of the topology,

01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:45.500
you can split in
an arbitrary way.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:51.260
And this just tells you,
using this basic vertex, then

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:55.430
for fixed parameterization--
yeah, this vertex already

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.340
enough.

01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:59.670
And you can-- indeed,
it's a very good question.

01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:04.520
You can try to slice the
diagram in arbitrary way.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.300
Then that may give you some
arbitrary other things.

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:08.260
Then that's fine.

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.730
And then you can assign weight
for some other vertices.

01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:14.616
But they will be
all consistent with

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:15.740
these fundamental vertices.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:24.460
So essentially this
gs, which I called

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.660
to be-- exponential
lambda, it's essentially

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.460
the coupling for the string.

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.120
OK?

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.660
It essentially
determines the strength

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:35.785
of the string interactions.

01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.830
Yeah?

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:44.995
AUDIENCE: Our choice of
weight is not unique, right?

01:14:44.995 --> 01:14:47.700
[INAUDIBLE] something
ugly like [INAUDIBLE] chi

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:51.910
squared and then including that.

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:53.490
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a good point.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.031
Indeed.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:54.530
Indeed.

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:56.840
Yeah.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.570
So here is the simplest choice.

01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:05.710
And it's a choice
which you can-- yeah.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.870
So this is the simplest
choice you can put,

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.860
and then this is a
choice which will also

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.140
arise if you property
quantize string theory.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:16.520
And indeed, you can write
down some other string theory

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.865
with a different power.

01:15:17.865 --> 01:15:20.370
It might be possible.

01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:21.010
Yeah.

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:23.670
I mean just as a mathematical--
say at the mathematical level,

01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:26.910
it doesn't prevent you to add
some arbitrary function of chi.

01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:28.840
And this is just the
simplest way to do it.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.610
And this is the way which
arises out of string theory.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:33.230
Yeah.

01:15:33.230 --> 01:15:34.870
So this process
is not arbitrary.

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:38.747
It's something which you can
derive from string theory.

01:15:38.747 --> 01:15:40.830
Just here, we will not go
through the whole thing.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.273
Any other questions?

01:15:45.273 --> 01:15:47.648
AUDIENCE: Do we have an extra
minus sign in the exponent?

01:15:47.648 --> 01:15:48.529
PROFESSOR: No.

01:15:48.529 --> 01:15:49.070
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:52.170
Because chi goes-- it's more
negative as h increases?

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:52.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.170
AUDIENCE: So the exponent
becomes larger and larger?

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:56.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:56.550
Yeah.

01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:57.050
Yeah.

01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:58.946
Because I can take
g to be small.

01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:04.150
Yeah.

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:06.780
Yeah, the only thing
is I want to be

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.600
consistent with this power.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.149
So now, here is the key.

01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:14.898
So now let's look at
the external strings.

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:22.320
So here, at the
beginning, I was looking

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:28.681
at the-- I was looking
at the vacuum process.

01:16:28.681 --> 01:16:29.430
There was nothing.

01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:31.860
Just everything come
out of the vacuum.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.560
But you also consider,
say, some process.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.093
Say you started
with two strings.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.484
Then you scatter them together,
you get two string back.

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:46.750
So you can also consider
such kind of strings.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:49.970
So you started with actually
two initial strings.

01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:51.930
And then through some
complicated interaction,

01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:53.250
then you have two strings back.

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:53.913
OK?

01:16:53.913 --> 01:16:56.037
So for example, this would
be such kind of process.

01:17:00.314 --> 01:17:01.480
Anything can happen between.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:07.930
I have two initial
strings, but I have

01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:09.230
two final strings come out.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.770
OK?

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:19.098
So this would be some
kind of surfaces.

01:17:19.098 --> 01:17:20.556
So this would--
because when do you

01:17:20.556 --> 01:17:23.310
have your sum of all
possible surfaces which

01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:27.480
four external string-- say,
two coming from minus infinity,

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.330
and two come from
t [INAUDIBLE], two

01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:31.180
come out at t plus infinity.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.900
OK?

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.410
And again, you need to sum
of all possible topology

01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:37.790
in between.

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:41.096
Say you sum over
sphere in between.

01:17:43.832 --> 01:17:48.490
Yeah, let me just save
time, draw it quickly.

01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:57.720
So you can sum over
all spheres in between.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.810
Some spheres.

01:17:58.810 --> 01:18:20.640
Or you sum over
torus, et cetera.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.140
OK?

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:29.694
But now, if you do this weight,
according to this rule-- OK?

01:18:29.694 --> 01:18:31.860
Now if you do the weight
the according to this rule,

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.650
something changed.

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:40.282
Because again, we want you
sum of all possible surfaces

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:43.870
with the same rule as
you do for the vacuum.

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:45.953
But now, there's something
important that changes.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.180
So these are the [INAUDIBLE]
with the boundaries.

01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:59.580
So you want to start with
two initial strings and two

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.490
final strings.

01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:02.950
So each initial string
could use a boundary.

01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:05.440
So now you have four
different boundaries.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.420
So you have four boundaries.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:10.180
And so when you
introduce boundaries

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:15.400
into two-dimensional surfaces,
then the Euler number changes.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.360
So sum of you already may
know this from high school.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.330
2 minus h, and the minus n, and
n is the number of boundaries.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.980
OK?

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.160
Number of boundaries.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.380
And which is the same as the
number of external strings.

01:19:42.568 --> 01:19:44.790
Number of external strings.

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:46.020
OK?

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:50.370
So now, if you use
this rule-- so now

01:19:50.370 --> 01:20:03.200
for the n-string scattering--
for n-string scattering--

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.280
so let me call this n, An.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.530
Then you will, again,
sum over all genuses.

01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:18.350
So now this weight
will translate into gs,

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:24.060
become n minus 2 plus 2h.

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:24.560
OK?

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:31.530
So now, because of this n, so
I have additional power of gs

01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:34.380
to the power n.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:38.346
Say I can write as Fn h.

01:20:38.346 --> 01:20:38.846
OK?

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:58.240
So if you look at the sum,
so this is gs to the power

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.371
n minus 2 come from the sphere.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.740
The sphere, surface,
[INAUDIBLE] surfaces,

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:10.340
which can be considered
as a tree level

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:13.070
from the string point of
view, because the string

01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:16.140
just come out and then nucleate.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:20.270
And then the next order
is gs to the-- gs n.

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:23.810
Then this is the torus topology.

01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:26.900
So this may be considered as
some kind of one-loop process,

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:30.480
and gs n plus 2.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:37.310
So this is genus 2, et cetera.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:40.070
OK?

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:44.700
So now, let's compare with this.

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:47.060
So this also included
in the vacuum.

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:50.525
For the vacuum, it just says
n equal to 0-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:50.525 --> 01:21:52.390
n equal to 0.

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:59.920
So now, we see exactly parallel
with what we see in the large N

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.720
gauge series.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:05.610
In both cases, you have
summing over topology.

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.310
And in both cases,
we'll have summing--

01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:09.310
you have this expansion.

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:38.170
So identical
mathematical structure

01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:43.827
with large N expansion.

01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:57.570
In particular, g string now
corresponds into just 1 over N.

01:22:57.570 --> 01:23:05.670
And these external strings--
say if you have some-- just

01:23:05.670 --> 01:23:11.970
goes 1 into the glueballs,
what we call the glueballs.

01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:13.830
So these kind of
single trace operators.

01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:36.200
And the sum of string-- over
string worksheet of, say,

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:46.850
topology of genus h is
mapped to, say, sum over

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:58.470
Feynman diagrams of genus h.

01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.870
Yeah.

01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:10.870
So you see an exactly parallel
mathematical structure

01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:13.240
between the two.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:17.040
So the question, is
this an accident?

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.535
Or this is something deep?

01:24:18.535 --> 01:24:19.034
OK?

01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:23.738
I think I'm running out of time.

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:31.932
Yeah.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:35.810
OK.

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:37.000
Maybe I will stop here.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.780
Oh, you don't want to stop?

01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:45.083
AUDIENCE: There's only
1 and 1/2 pages left.

01:24:45.083 --> 01:24:45.666
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.930
Yeah.

01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:50.260
Let me just say a few words.

01:24:53.562 --> 01:24:54.520
Let me say a few words.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:04.010
If you look at these two
sums-- this sum and this sum.

01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:06.100
Oh, yeah, let me call this fn.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.790
So that's a distinction.

01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:10.060
Let me call this f.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.530
So that's f.

01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:18.470
So if you look at these two
sums-- so the question is,

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:21.236
can you really physically
identify these two?

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:24.951
OK?

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.532
Let me just say a couple words.

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:42.360
Say fn h, which will appear
in the correlation functions,

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:54.136
essentially just sum over
Feynman diagrams of genus h.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.650
And this is just the
Feynman diagrams--

01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:01.830
the expansion for
the Feynman diagrams.

01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:12.350
And this one, this
fh-- fn h-- So this

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:19.955
is sum over-- this
is path integral,

01:26:19.955 --> 01:26:25.510
say minus SNG of
genus h surfaces.

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:37.070
So now remember one
thing we said before.

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:53.654
We said each Feynman
diagram can be considered

01:26:53.654 --> 01:27:01.533
as a partition of a 2D surface.

01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:06.380
OK?

01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:10.600
So now, if you sum over all
possible Feynman diagrams--

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:13.190
so you can also think
of it geometrically

01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:22.615
as sum of all possible
triangulations of a surface.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.150
So this kind of partition
essentially just

01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:38.080
a triangulation of the surfaces
divided into different parts,

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.610
and with some amplitude--
with some weight.

01:27:41.610 --> 01:27:43.710
So sum of all possible
triangulations

01:27:43.710 --> 01:27:48.210
over the surface, of
course this is precisely

01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:57.240
just a discrete form of
summing over all surfaces.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:10.080
So this just a discrete sum
of summing over all surfaces.

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:16.190
And so this really identified
these two are essentially

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:17.759
the same object.

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.300
So when you're
summing over diagrams,

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:23.190
you're actually summing
[INAUDIBLE] actually summing

01:28:23.190 --> 01:28:27.200
over all possible embeddings
of some surfaces in spacetime.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.660
And the precise nature of
the surface, of course,

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:34.573
depends on the diagram itself.

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:42.690
So this really tells you
that the larger N expansion

01:28:42.690 --> 01:28:47.210
is really just a string theory.

01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:47.710
OK?

01:28:47.710 --> 01:28:50.840
It's really just
a string theory.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:53.040
But from here, you cannot
immediately tell what kind

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.081
of string theory is this.

01:28:54.081 --> 01:28:57.170
Because from famine
Feynman diagram itself--

01:28:57.170 --> 01:29:01.320
so this Nambu-Gotu action,
which I wrote earlier,

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.640
goes 1 into your map,
from some surface--

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.260
embedding of some surface
in some spacetime.

01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:09.880
And that spacetime can be some
arbitrary spacetime, et cetera.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.421
For a different
spacetime, of course,

01:29:11.421 --> 01:29:12.560
you get a different action.

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.616
So the question is, what
does this correspond to?

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:18.700
Say I give you a
field series, and you

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:20.570
have those Feynman diagrams.

01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:23.500
And what Feynman-- and
for each Feynman diagram,

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.850
you can write down
expression for them.

01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:30.190
Just whether this really
corresponding to, say,

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:31.450
some geometric actions.

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:33.075
The Feynman diagrams
[INAUDIBLE] really

01:29:33.075 --> 01:29:36.040
cause some geometric
action describing

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.100
the motion of some
surface in some spacetime.

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.090
Yeah.

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.470
So let me just stop here.

01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:44.020

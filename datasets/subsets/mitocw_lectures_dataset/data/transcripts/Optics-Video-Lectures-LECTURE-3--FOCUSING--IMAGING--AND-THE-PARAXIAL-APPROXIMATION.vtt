00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.070
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK, so
today I would like to cover--

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.070
to start, well, I will
do a lot of things today.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.860
But to begin with, I would
like to solve two applications

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.960
of Fermat's principle.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.800
And the simplest possible thing
that we try to do in optics,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.030
and that is to focus.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.670
So the one focus will
come up again and again.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.440
It basically refers
to the idea--

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.570
hi, Colin.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.150
It refers to the idea that we
have rays, a bundle of rays

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.610
that are propagating.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.840
And focusing means that we try
to force these rays to meet

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.342
at one point.

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:03.300
So this, of course, is
very useful for imaging,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.570
but even simpler, if
you want to collect

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.570
all of the light
energy, for example,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.450
for a solar concentrator,
or a satellite dish,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.998
or something like that.

00:01:14.998 --> 00:01:16.790
Then basically, this
is what you try to do.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.900
You try to get the rays that
are coming from the source,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.880
and focus them into a point.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.970
And this is valid, of
course, in the entire regime

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.390
of electromagnetic waves--

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.040
whether microwaves, or visible
light, or even higher--

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.020
provided that the element
that we use to focus the rays

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.210
is much bigger than
the wavelength.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.850
And here, I'm leaving
it deliberately vague

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.200
how much bigger.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.900
But think about it that is maybe
a few thousand of wavelengths,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.690
or few hundred of wavelengths.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.610
In the microwave case,
that's not exactly true.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.270
The RF wavelength maybe
a couple of centimeters.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.330
The typical satellite
dish is about the meter,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.790
so we're talking about
50 to 100 wavelength.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.480
But anyway, still the
approximations are valid.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.140
So the simplest way to
do this kind of operation

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.700
to focus the light into a
point so it can be detected

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.210
is with a reflector, a mirror
whose surface is curved.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.940
And you know from experience
if you look at the spoon

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.240
that, well, funny things happen
if you look at the spoon.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.850
We will talk about that
perhaps a little bit later.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.085
But you know that the
spoon forms images,

00:02:36.085 --> 00:02:41.380
so this is basically a
simplification or idealization

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.010
of a spoon.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.880
So let's say that we
have this surface.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.170
And for now, even though the
label says parabolic reflector,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.180
I will pretend that I don't
know the shape of the surface.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.740
So s of x is an unknown
to be determined.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.530
And the goal, of
course, is to have

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.030
rays that are coming as parallel
rays onto the parabol line,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.710
onto this unknown shape.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.320
And our goal is to
focus these rays

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.190
into a point on the
axis of the surface.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.750
And what you see.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.047
You see here that I put
the symbol of infinity.

00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:25.880
I will mention that
also a little bit later.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.220
If we have rays that are
parallel, you can think--

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.820
according to Euclidean geometry,
parallel rays never meet.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.820
Or another way to say it is
that parallel rays, if they ever

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.760
meet, that would be at infinity,
at a very, very long distance

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.490
away.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.640
So when the object
of the imaging system

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.320
is very far away, such
as the sun, or a star,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.140
or a really remote source.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.540
Then we can say that
the ray is coming

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.250
from that object
that are parallel,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.020
or that are coming
from infinity.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.070
So the objective here
is, again, to determine

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.940
the shape of the
surface, s of x, such

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.003
that the rays all
focus at a point, f.

00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:08.670
So there's a number
of ways of doing it.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.490
One is for example, I can apply
the law of reflection anywhere

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.120
in the surface.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.920
I have the array appearing here.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.500
I can compute the
normal to the ray--

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.089
I'm sorry, the
normal to the surface

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.980
at that point of
existence of the ray.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.600
And I can apply the
law of reflection.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.383
I can solve the
problem this way.

00:04:24.383 --> 00:04:26.800
But that is actually a very
complicated way of solving it.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.780
Much work.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.500
So being, I guess, lazy.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.630
The best way to
solve this problem

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.000
is to invoke the
Fermat's principle.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.790
And Fermat's principle
says, again, to remind you,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.490
says that rays that
depart from a common point

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.130
and arrive at another point.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.550
They have to follow the
minimum optical path.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.360
A corollary to
that is that if you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.940
have two rays that
start at the same point

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.130
and meet again at
the same point,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.800
then these rays must
follow the same path.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.130
Because if one of those
rays follows a shorter path,

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.800
it means that the other ray
that followed the longer path

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.760
is violating Fermat's principle.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.590
And that cannot happen.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.280
So the way we're
thinking about this here

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.560
is to take, for
example, the center

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.170
ray that is going directly on
axis, that started at infinity.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.340
We go to the reflector.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.440
It will be reflected
exactly backwards,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.070
and will go through
the focal point, f.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.840
If we take another
ray that is away

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.350
from the central axis
of the unknown surface.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.800
Then this ray also
started at infinity.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.340
It gets reflected, and then,
again, meets at that point, f.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.990
So therefore, the pattern
that these two rays followed

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.020
must be the same.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.130
So how do we compute this path?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.290
Well, if you look
at the central ray.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.300
The central ray is
coming from infinity.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.650
I will use the plane passing
through the focal point

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.340
as my reference.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.660
And I will calculate
the path back and forth

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.180
from the focal point to
the reflector and back.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.310
So I basically
calculate this path.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.610
This path obviously
equals 2 times f.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.680
By f, I denote the focal
distance of the reflector.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.730
That is the distance at which
the rays come to a focus.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.500
And the other path
I will compute

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.140
is I will ignore the path of the
ray up to the reference plane.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.600
And then I will compute
this path over here.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.030
So how do you compute this path?

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.390
Well, the shape of the
paraboloid is s of x.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.560
So basically, s of x is the
elevation of the unknown shape

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.920
with respect to the
other reference plane

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.700
that passes through the
bottom of the unknown shape.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.990
So therefore, this
distance here is f minus s,

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.960
because it equals the focal
distance minus the elevation

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.580
of the reflector.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.220
And the other-- this
distance over here.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.720
OK, so let me write it down.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.510
So it is f minus s.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.790
This is the first
segment of the ray part.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.600
And the other is the hypotenuse
of this orthogonal triangle,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:40.400
where one side of the
triangle equals x.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.930
The other side of the
triangle equals f plus s.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.820
And all I have to do is I have
to apply Pythagoras' theorem.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:56.690
OK, so this is the path of
the ray that arrived away

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.340
from the optical axis.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.410
And, of course, this
must equal the path

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.940
of the ray that is exactly on
the axis that equals to 2f.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.940
So now, we can play with
his formula a little bit.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.860
I skip the derivation
in the notes.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.790
Actually, I didn't quite skip
the derivation of the notes.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:20.740
So instead of deriving it
here, I will just animate it.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.350
And if we do the
algebra here, we

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.890
can basically eliminate
one of the focal distances,

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.780
bring that to the other side.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.780
And then do a little bit
more algebraic manipulation.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.679
And after not too much work, we
have this expression over here

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.500
for the elevation of
the unknown shape.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.232
And clearly, what you see
over that is a parabola.

00:08:41.232 --> 00:08:42.940
Of course, it turned
out to be a parabola

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.450
because I did the calculation
in the cross section--

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.600
in one cross section
of the optical element.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.400
In reality, all
of these elements

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.700
are rotationally symmetric
surfaces of revolution.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.560
So the reason I
call it a paraboloid

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.620
and not a parabola is
because I take this shape,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.050
and then I spin it
around the optical axis

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.120
in order to get
the familiar ball

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.070
shape of the paraboloid this.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.570
But to do a little
less math here,

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.330
and to keep my life simple, I
will only do these calculations

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.380
in one plane.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.440
So turns out to be
a simple parabola.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.040
So then this is
your final answer.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.490
This is the shape
of a reflector that

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.630
will take a set
of parallel rays,

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.660
and focus them into a
focal point in front

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.670
of the reflector.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.720
So these are very nice.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.560
And we actually got our
first imaging system.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.110
We managed to compute
its focal length

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.820
as a function of the
shape of the element.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.070
There's a few things that I
would like to remark here.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.420
One is, for example, that
this works very nicely when

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.430
the rays are indeed incident
parallel to the normal

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.720
at the center of
the parabola here.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.530
If you imagine that I take
this set of rays and I tilt it.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.160
Then a little bit of thought
will convince yourself

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.620
that it doesn't work
so nicely anymore.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.030
If you were to then
come in parallel rays,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.150
then the rays will
kind of focus,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:24.020
but they would fail to meet all
at once at the focal point, f.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.020
So this is a perfect
focusing element

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.200
for on axis incident rays.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.880
But it would be not
so perfect anymore

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.690
if the rays are
arriving off axis.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.320
That's one observation
to keep in mind.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.990
This will come up again later.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.740
One thing I would like
to say is that this

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.930
is a very nice element, indeed.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.910
But in some cases,
it is not practical

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.510
because as you can see,
the focus is actually

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.600
in front of the element.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.630
So if you were to
detect the light,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.230
you would have to put,
for example, a photo diode

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.500
or some transducer at
this location, which

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.263
means you are actually
blocking the path of the light.

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:04.680
AUDIENCE: I have
a quick question.

00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:12.560
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I'm
sorry, I can not hear you.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.960
AUDIENCE: I can understand
how the rays have

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.910
a minimal optical path.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.410
But I don't understand
why they have

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.390
to have the same optical path.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.990
For example, you let
it equal to 2f, which

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.150
was at the center distance.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.910
So isn't it possible that the
minimum optical path does not

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.810
equal 2f?

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.240
Or why is that the case?

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:34.750
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Take two rays.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.650
In our case, one ray [INAUDIBLE]
from infinity, and they both

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.280
meet at F. So the rays can
take different optical paths.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.650
One can go like this, the
other can go like this.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.930
And doing our rays in general.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:53.050
So imagine that this has path
l1, and this has path l2.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.980
And imagine, for the
sake of argument,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.450
that l1 is less than l2.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:06.700
Fermat's principle says
that if the ray, number one,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.240
goes through the first
point from the origin

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.890
to the destination.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.570
It follows a certain path.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.700
This path has to be minimal.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.780
But now, look at ray number two.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.090
This ray also goes from the same
origin to the same destination,

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.000
but follows a
longer optical path.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.240
Therefore, the second ray has
to violate Fermat's principle.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.657
So this is what we call
mathematics abduction to--

00:12:32.657 --> 00:12:33.490
what do you call it?

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.020
To absurdum.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.880
That's right,
abduction to absurdum.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.580
In other words, by
assuming that the rays have

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.060
unequal optical
paths, we arrived

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.170
at a conclusion that is
inconsistent with Fermat's

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:46.990
principle.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.990
So therefore, this
has to be discarded.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.110
The only possibility
is that l1 equals l2.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.080
So because the two rays
start at the same origin

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.000
and arrive at the
same destination,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.850
they must have the
same optical path.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.673
Did that make sense?

00:13:06.982 --> 00:13:09.190
AUDIENCE: For example, in
the homework problem, where

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:15.193
you have the swimmer and the
lifeguard, well, I guess--

00:13:15.193 --> 00:13:16.610
I'll think about
it a little more.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:16.820
Yeah, makes sense.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.320
Thanks.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.060
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.840
So for the cases where the
paraboloid is not convenient.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.580
Actually, I should
say for the cases

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.850
where the reflector
is not convenient,

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.520
because of the problem
of blocking the ray

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.760
path at the focal point.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.920
It is perhaps more
convenient to attempt

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.700
to use a refractive optical
element that is a dielectric.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.510
And try to focus the rays using
now, again, a curved surface.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.900
But in this case, it is a curved
surface refractive index n.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.440
And for simplicity,
I will assume

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.380
that the rays are, again,
are coming from free space,

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.790
from vacuum, or from air.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.640
So the index of
refraction is actually

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.090
one on the left
hand side over here.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.910
On the right hand side, it is n.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.450
So in this case, again,
I have the same problem.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:20.390
I have an unknown shape, s
of x, that I should follow,

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.050
that I must somehow
shape my refractor.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.090
And one could assume
that this is anything.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.480
It could be, again, a parabola.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.872
It could be a circle,
I mean, a sphere.

00:14:30.872 --> 00:14:32.580
It could be a number
of different things.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.010
The question, what is it really.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.190
So the question is actually
the same as the question

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.700
that I asked before.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.900
And to answer it, we will
actually follow once again

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.480
the same argument.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.630
We will use Fermat to argue
that since the two rays started

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.860
at the same point, infinity.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.510
And they meet at the same
point, F, at the same target,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.970
F. They must follow
the same optical path.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.130
So in this case, I will apply
Fermat with the reference plane

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:10.850
that is tangential at the
apex of the known refractive--

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.600
I'm sorry, of the
unknown refractor shape.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.080
And I will compute the
path of the own axis

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.550
ray, which is very easy.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.610
So this path, you have to
be a little bit careful now

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.300
when we define the optical path.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.710
If you remember, the
optical path in general.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.830
Optical path length
equals the integral

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:43.390
along the ray trajectory of the
index of refraction times dl.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.790
So what this means
now in our case

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.510
is that the optical path
length for this segment

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.680
of the rays between the
apex and the focal point

00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:01.600
equals f, the distance, times
the index of refraction,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.310
in order to convert it
to proper optical path.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.157
OK, so that's easy.

00:16:06.157 --> 00:16:07.740
Now, we have to
compute the other one.

00:16:11.953 --> 00:16:14.120
So here's, again, I will
exaggerate it a little bit.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:22.160
Here is, again, my
unknown shape, s of x.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:29.810
And here is the ray that is
arriving at some distance, x,

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.270
from the apex.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.260
And this ray, according
to my postulate here,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:41.990
will meet the axis
at distance small f.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.862
To reach the point, uppercase
f, that is the focal point.

00:16:46.862 --> 00:16:49.070
So again, I have to do a
little bit of geometry here.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.980
This distance is s of x.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.610
Because this distance, again, is
the elevation of the refractor

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.920
shape relative to my
reference plane over here.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:09.750
So this equals s plus this
distance, which again, is

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.984
the hypotenuse of a triangle.

00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:13.859
But I have to be, again,
a little bit careful

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:17.930
because this segment
over here now,

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.270
again, is inside the refractor.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.890
So before I do
anything else, again, I

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.390
have to multiply by the
index of refraction.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.930
So it has to be n, the
index of refraction,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.910
times the hypotenuse
length, which

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.353
equals the square
root of the two sides,

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:35.395
of the two sides squared.

00:17:42.743 --> 00:17:43.410
What am I doing?

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.780
I'm sorry.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.840
x squared plus f
minus s squared.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.304
That's the correct expression.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.840
OK, and [INAUDIBLE] in
fact I could see it,

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.423
because my computer
has a preview.

00:18:01.423 --> 00:18:02.840
So I can see the
equation, but I'm

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.290
trying not to see it when
I'm deriving things here.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.170
OK, so that is the
equation, then.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.670
So again, according
to the argument.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.795
Actually, let me repeat it
once again, because this

00:18:11.795 --> 00:18:13.740
is a-- it's a very basic point.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.020
We have two rays here.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.220
One is going on axis.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.650
There is no refraction here,
because it is incident exactly

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.250
normally on the surface.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.390
And then it propagates
at distance, f.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.720
So the optical path length
of this ray equals n times f.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.560
Then I have another ray that
propagated a little bit further

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.840
in there because it arrives
at the elevated portion

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.220
of the refractor.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.410
And then it bends in some
way that we don't know yet.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.680
But what we do know
is that we want,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.310
we demand, we
require, so to speak,

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.050
this ray to go through
the same point, F.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.150
So the fact that the ray goes
through the same point, F.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:58.090
It means that it must follow the
same path as the one axis ray.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.320
If this ray, for example,
had followed a shorter path.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.620
Then there's no reason for
this ray to go this way.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.670
It should have gone
this way as well,

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.280
because if it
hadn't, it would be

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.860
violating Fermat's principle.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.130
That is the argument.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.830
So therefore, there
are two paths.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.530
This path, and this path.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.240
They must be exactly equal.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.930
So this is what this
equation says over that.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.910
OK, this equation now.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.504
Does anybody know what
this equation represents?

00:19:33.203 --> 00:19:35.120
If you have looked at
the notes ahead of time,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.443
you know the answer.

00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:38.360
If you ever looked at
the notes, this equation

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.040
doesn't mean much.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.020
However, it can be manipulated.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.670
And I did not do all the
algebra in the notes.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.790
I skipped a few steps.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.090
So the first thing you
do is you basically try

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.010
to get rid of the square root.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.140
So you bring this
s on that side.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.780
You take squares of both sides.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.300
You do a little bit of algebra.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.530
You bring it to this form.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.170
Then this-- it still
doesn't look very nice.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.870
So what you do is you try
to write it to complete

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.070
the sum of squares here.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.570
So that's a little bit messy.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.210
I will let you do it by
yourselves, if you're

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.217
interested and curious.

00:20:16.217 --> 00:20:18.300
If you get stuck, and you
don't know how to do it,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.600
I will post the complete
derivation on the website.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.030
But anyway, after a
little bit more algebra,

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.470
you get a result
that looks like this.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.480
It looks like a square
of the surface shape, s,

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.570
minus the displacement,
times another square

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.210
of the coordinate x
equals a constant.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.230
And this type of
equation in general,

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.860
an equation of the form
s square over constant,

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:50.610
plus x square over constant
equals another constant, which

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.290
might as well be one.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.650
This equation
represents an ellipse.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.800
It is still not quite like this.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:04.440
It is of the form s minus some
constant square over constant

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.930
plus x square over
constant equals 1.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:11.850
That is still in ellipse, but
a displaced ellipse, right?

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:15.300
What this really means
is that the ellipse

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.120
is centered at this location.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.860
OK, this comes from
the displacement term

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.560
in the square.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.380
And the eccentricity of
the ellipse-- that is,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.130
the size of the minor axis
relative to the major axis--

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.710
is given by the inverse of
this quantity over here.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.430
So it is n minus
1 over n plus 1f.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.310
What is interesting to note
is that the focal point

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.160
is to the right hand side of
the center of the ellipse.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:48.040
And in fact, this happens to be
the focal point of the ellipse.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.600
If you look at the
definition of an ellipse

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.160
in the form of pure
geometry, ellipses

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.610
are characterized
by two focal points.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.660
And it turns out in this
case, the focus of the rays

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.438
is one of the focal
points of the ellipse.

00:22:03.438 --> 00:22:04.980
And that, of course,
is symmetrically

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.630
located on the other side.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:12.420
OK, so this is a bit of
a mathematical trickery.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.640
But what I want to
emphasize, which is actually

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.760
kind of important to know,
is that the focal point

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.910
is actually past the
center of the ellipse.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.340
That's about it, really.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.810
The result of this is sort
of an ideal elliptical shape.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.700
That's something
worth remembering.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:51.860
That if you have a ideal
set of parallel rays coming

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.780
in-- or as we will call
it a little bit later,

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.930
a plane wave--

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.450
and we wish to focus it at
the final distance inside

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.710
of the electric material.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.750
The best possible
shape to achieve

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.333
that is an elliptical shape.

00:23:05.333 --> 00:23:06.500
Now, again, there's caveats.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.410
For example, if I tilt
this incoming ray,

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.940
then the focus will not
be perfect out here.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.230
So this is the same situation
as in the parabol line.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.500
It only works so
nice and so perfectly

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.620
if the incidence
is exactly normal.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.290
Out of curiosity,
can anybody imagine--

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.020
so if you compare this
with a paraboloid,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.580
one obvious advantage
is, of course,

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.770
that I'm not blocking
the light path anymore.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.223
What is a possible disadvantage
of this kind of approach?

00:23:40.223 --> 00:23:41.390
There are several, actually.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.410
Tell me at least one.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:43.730
Yeah.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.646
Push the button.

00:23:46.646 --> 00:23:49.202
AUDIENCE: The detector
is inside the vector.

00:23:49.202 --> 00:23:51.410
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: That's
one obvious disadvantage.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.420
If I wanted to
really use this, I

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.020
would have to put
the detector here.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.250
And, of course, it doesn't
have to be a full ellipse.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.930
I can always clip the
ellipse over here.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.720
The rays have no way of knowing
that this happened to them,

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.250
so I can always stick
the detector over here.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.580
So maybe I can
overcome that problem.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.510
But it is a problem, yeah.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:13.340
What is the second problem
that kind of is sticking out?

00:24:19.143 --> 00:24:20.560
AUDIENCE: In the
case of if you're

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.268
trying to build a
telescope, or something

00:24:22.268 --> 00:24:24.070
where you have to worry
about the structure

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.000
of your optical setup.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
You could think that maybe
a solid element would

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.310
be much more bulky
or hard to abrogate

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.730
than a reflecting
element, like paraboloid?

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.870
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's correct.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.480
If you tried to
make a big element,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.630
a big lens, a big
focusing concentrator,

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.542
like a solid concentrate,
or a satellite dish.

00:24:45.542 --> 00:24:47.250
That's a very inconvenient
shape to have.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.520
It is heavy--
absolutely, I agree.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.319
Tell me a third disadvantage.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:06.190
The paraboloid can go
on a very long distance.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:10.870
This one is a finite shape
because it's an ellipse.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.410
As it curves at some point, it
will reach a derivative equal

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.220
to zero.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.460
It will stop there.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.540
So basically, this element
captures only a finite set

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.880
of rays up to the minor
axis of the ellipse.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.570
It is missing the rest.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.770
Tell me a fourth and final
disadvantage of this setup

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.350
that at least I could think of.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.190
I'll give you a hint.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:43.255
Last time, Piper did a very
nice demonstration with a prism.

00:25:46.447 --> 00:25:48.530
Do you remember something
that his demonstration--

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.060
something about this
demonstration [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.970
AUDIENCE: There can be
total internal reflection.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.168
Like on this

00:26:00.168 --> 00:26:01.585
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:01.585 --> 00:26:04.815
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:04.815 --> 00:26:07.190
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Is there
a possibility for PIR here?

00:26:11.475 --> 00:26:12.850
AUDIENCE: The
index of refraction

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.144
isn't necessarily the
same for all wavelengths?

00:26:16.687 --> 00:26:18.770
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So
first of all, let's answer

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.090
the previous question.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:25.640
Here, you're right to think
about the possibility of PIR.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.440
But if you look at it in
a little bit more detail,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.830
you will see that PIR is
not a problem in this case.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.860
At least for the rays
going up to here,

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.040
there's no problem of PIR.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.520
Because the rays
come from a low index

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.860
medium to a high index medium.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:48.020
And therefore, they will always
refract inside the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.980
What is interesting to
happen to the ray that

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.100
is incident exactly tangential
to the ellipse over here.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.290
It will still be refracted,
if you think about it.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.370
It's Snell's law.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.100
And it will give you sort
of the maximum acceptance

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.840
cone of the interface that
we discussed last week,

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.130
I mean, on Monday in
relation to Snell's law.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.000
So then out of the two demos
that Piper did last week,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.110
the PIR is not the problem.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.330
It is the other one, as
you correctly pointed out.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.890
So you want to repeat?

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:19.840
Who has spoken before?

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.025
Someone mentioned the
index of refraction.

00:27:26.025 --> 00:27:27.400
AUDIENCE: The
index of refraction

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.350
isn't the same for
all wavelengths.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.618
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

00:27:32.618 --> 00:27:33.160
That's right.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.770
So since the index
of refraction is not

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.960
the same for all
wavelengths, what this means

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.590
is that the focal distance
now becomes a function

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.420
of the index of refraction.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.340
And I may tune it.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.630
Basically, what I do is
I manufacture this shape.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.560
So I can manufacture
it for a certain index

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.990
for a standard wavelength.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.990
If the index changes,
this relation

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.400
will not be satisfied
anymore, and therefore

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.690
the refractive element
will become imperfect.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:05.590
How do we call this phenomenon
of dependence of index

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:10.100
of refraction on wavelength?

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.290
Dispersion.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.250
Dispersion.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:18.060
And in the context that
we're discussing here.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.010
OK, it is dispersion.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.410
In the context of
focusing, when we

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:28.070
get imperfect focusing
because of dispersion,

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.050
It has also another
special name.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:35.246
It is called
chromatic aberration.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.480
The term aberration we'll
see again in the next hour.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.940
It generally refers to
failures of optical systems

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.640
to focus light as
they're supposed to.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.380
So this is the first such
failure that we encounter.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.660
The term chromatic, I have
an advantage over you.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.440
I'm Greek.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.640
And this turns out
to be a Greek word.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.780
Chroma in Greek means color.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.630
And this is the Greek spelling.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.090
If you want to spell it out in
Latin so you can pronounce it,

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.400
it is chroma.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.550
And that's where the word
chromatic is derived from.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.010
It literally means
separation due to color.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.680
Any questions on
any of this so far?

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.820
I'm sorry, there's a question.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:42.020
AUDIENCE: If someone thought
of a lenslike element

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.880
in which the
focusing takes place

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.130
on the other side
of the element.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.495
Will it have a
[INAUDIBLE] power surface?

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.880
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's coming up, actually,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.420
in a few slides.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.530
So yeah, I mean, the answer
to your question is generally,

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:04.330
if you want to focus
a point from the left

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.030
to a point on the right, at
the opposite side of element.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.180
You need two hyperbolic surface.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.880
I'll cover that in a second.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.940
Of course, hyperbolas are
difficult to manufacture.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.690
People typically make
spherical surfaces.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.550
You can also have a sphere,
nowadays, by injection molding.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.050
I will go into that also later.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:30.220
But even that is only
perfect for on axis points.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.100
If you move points off
axis, then it fails again.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.910
So it becomes the whole
problem of optical design.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:42.270
OK, so I will switch now
to today's, actually,

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.050
set of lectures.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.830
And you realized that
we were kind of behind

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.090
by almost one lecture.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.340
I think we're beginning
to catch up now.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:01.400
But what I would like to do
today for the rest of the two

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.360
hours that you have is
to go relatively slowly

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:11.100
over a number of
different topics, which

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.780
are also related to focusing.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.610
But as we go along,
we will generalize

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.795
focusing to more and more
complicated situations.

00:31:18.795 --> 00:31:20.670
So I wanted to solve
two cases of-- actually,

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.060
one case of focusing using two
different types of elements,

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.850
a reflector and a refractor.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.700
In order to make this stuff
a little bit more specific,

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.340
let me remind you
of some definitions

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.420
that we discussed a little
bit at the first lecture.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.200
But I would like to remind you
again with a bit more detail.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.780
So what is the concept
of a spherical wave.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.460
So spherical wave
is what you get

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.150
if you have light or
originating at the point source.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:56.085
It is also referred
to as a point object.

00:31:56.085 --> 00:31:57.710
So what happens then
is you get the fan

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.960
of rays that is divergent.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:04.220
And if you plug the normals
to these rays, these normals,

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.200
they look like spheres.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.590
So, of course, the wavefronts
expand as the spherical wave

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.110
propagates.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:17.820
And because these wavefronts
are spherical surfaces,

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.690
that's why we call
it a spherical wave.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.870
Again, very important to
remember by definition.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:27.260
The wavefront is
normal to the rays.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.550
So what I have done here in
principle is I took each ray.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.830
I computed the
normal to the ray.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:38.060
I connected all the normals,
and I get this sphere over here.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.520
I don't know if I did it very
well in my graphic over here,

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.820
but that's what this
is supposed to denote.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.970
OK, you can flip this
situation and create

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:52.040
a convergent spherical
wave, where basically, you

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:57.150
have rays that are
propagating towards the point.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.490
If that is the case, it is
not a point source anymore.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:00.930
You call it a point image.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.870
In most optical systems-- at
least in optical systems that

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.850
we will consider here--

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.860
this is really the goal
of an optical system.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.460
You try to take
rays of light that

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.120
are given to you by some
source that you do not control,

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.530
such as an object, or a
star far out of reach.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.280
And what you try to do is you
try to arrange your optics,

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.130
select your lenses,
space them appropriately,

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.480
and so on and so forth.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.280
So that you can converge
these incoming rays

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.810
into point images.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:42.130
So if you wish this is our
given, or our customer.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.000
And then this is what
the customer wants.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.860
The customer wants
to form point images.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.380
So a good deal of working
the field of optics

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:56.390
has to do with this
problem, how you can image--

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.820
however you can
create point images.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.530
I'll take this out,
because it does not

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:01.880
relate to this discussion.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.850
OK.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.860
So again, the
wavefronts are spherical

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:10.427
here with a common center
at the point image.

00:34:10.427 --> 00:34:12.219
But in this case, of
course, the wavefronts

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.710
are contracting as you go
towards the point image,

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.350
because the rays are converging.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:21.820
And, of course, [AUDIO OUT]
wavefronts ideally collapse

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.010
into a point.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.820
This doesn't sound
very physical.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:31.030
And a little bit later, when we
do the theory of diffraction.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.790
We will see in a bit more detail
what happens at that point.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:38.530
It is not really that the
wavefront ideally collapses.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.659
Something else happens
that we will see.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.330
Within the geometrical
optics approximation,

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.850
let's accept it for now
that this is the case.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.550
That indeed, the rays can
converge to a single point,

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:52.980
and then the wavefront
over there collapses.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:58.750
OK, this is true for pretty
much every case of imaging.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.770
However, in a number
of situations,

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.940
it is very convenient
to take one extreme case

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:10.920
where the point source, or the
point object is very far away.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.530
I mentioned that already
about half an hour ago.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.100
And I called it the
point source of infinity,

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.810
or a point object of infinity.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.570
A very good approximation
for that is a star.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.288
If we look at stars in the night
sky, they look like points.

00:35:25.288 --> 00:35:26.580
Of course, a star is humongous.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.610
It is probably thousands of
times bigger than the earth.

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:33.480
But because it is at a distance
of thousands or millions

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.640
of light years away,
it appears to us

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.340
to be like a point,
a point source.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.640
So again, there's another
important point to emphasize.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.260
When we talk about the
point object at infinity,

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.580
we don't necessarily imply
that it is mathematically

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.560
a point, that is, it
has zero dimension.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.690
What we really mean
is it is so far

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:54.980
away that the angle that
I subtend towards that

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.380
far away point is minimal.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.870
If that is true, if
that assumption is true,

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.610
then I can call it a point.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.620
I mean, I can call it a
point source at infinity.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.100
And what happens if you
really went near that point

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.570
far at infinity, you would
still see divergent rays.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.660
But because these rays propagate
at a very long distance,

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.440
you only get to see the
set of rays near the axis

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.128
that departed from that point.

00:36:20.128 --> 00:36:21.920
And because you're
[INAUDIBLE],, these rays

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.750
are really tightly collapsed
near the central ray over here.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.760
They all look parallel.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.700
So a set of rays that I
propagate and they're parallel.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.070
Like so on here, we
call it a plane wave.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.520
If you go back to your notes
from the first lecture,

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.030
we called it the plane wave,
or the planar wavefront.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.280
But we can also call it--

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.200
parallel [INAUDIBLE]
rays, we can also

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.215
call it an object at infinity.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.230
Of course, because
the rays are parallel.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:03.130
If I draw the normals to
them, they will form planes.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.670
They form ideal planar surfaces.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.830
And that's why this
is called the planar

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.290
wavefront, or a plane wave.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.377
For our purposes, the
two terms are identical.

00:37:14.377 --> 00:37:16.210
And, of course, this
goes the other way too.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:20.650
If I had a planar wave
also propagating like this.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:26.980
I can also claim that I create
a point image at infinity.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.170
Because if I take
parallel lines and I

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.140
propagate them for an
infinitely long distance.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.520
OK, what I'm about to say is
not mathematically correct,

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.850
but in optics, we
say it all the time.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.460
It is that these parallel
rays will meet at infinity.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.040
Of course, parallel
rays never meet.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.810
But you can simply to
justify it in your mind,

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.640
flip to this picture,
and take these rays,

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.300
propagate them backwards.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.003
At a very, very
far away distance,

00:37:51.003 --> 00:37:53.170
you cannot tell the difference,
whether they started

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:57.640
as parallel rays, or they
started as a tightly convergent

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.930
small ray bundle.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:05.560
OK, so this [AUDIO OUT]
because very often,

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.520
it simplifies
calculations and gives

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.590
certain kinds of intuition.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:15.145
And again, we define it in
the geometric optic sense.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.300
When we do diffraction
about a month from now,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.020
we will define it more
rigorously in a way

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.260
that is probably much more
convincing than I do now.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.480
The reason I'm apologizing
for this definition

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.870
is that there's no such thing
as mathematical infinity

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:33.600
in real life.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.380
Even a star, it is a
very long distance away,

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.970
but it is not an
infinite distance away.

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:40.360
So what do I mean by infinity?

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.340
For example, [INAUDIBLE],, who is
sitting here on the front row.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.760
Is he at infinity with
respect to me, or no?

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.620
Well, what about you guys who
are sitting in the cam bridge?

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.610
Well, OK, the surface
of the earth is curved,

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:54.633
so that creates an
obvious problem.

00:38:54.633 --> 00:38:56.300
But suppose I could
draw a straight line

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.120
through the center of the
earth from Singapore to Boston.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.950
Would you guys be at
infinity with respect to me?

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:05.760
OK, it actually depends on
a lot of different things.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.980
It depends on the relative
sizes that I have and you have.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.933
It depends on the wavelength
that the light is propagating.

00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:14.600
And actually, that's
about it, according

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.680
to diffraction theory.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.030
So we will see a rigorous
definition of what is infinity

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.450
when we do diffraction.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:23.930
For now, let's take
it on faith that if I

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.630
have a set of rays that
appear [AUDIO OUT],,

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:32.680
we'll call it image of infinity.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.210
So sometimes, we use
the term collimated.

00:39:38.642 --> 00:39:39.600
That's a better marker.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.550
Collimated rays.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.280
So collimated is from
the word colinear, right?

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.500
Creating parallel to each other.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.850
OK.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:59.610
So I included this slide,
but as a reminder, and that

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.060
as a reference,
because for the next--

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.300
I don't know, for the next
semester really, from now on,

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.850
we'll be using
these terms a lot.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.610
Spherical waves, plane
waves, spherical wavefronts,

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.960
and so on and so forth.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.920
The concept of
infinity applies to

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.810
both convergent and divergent
spherical waves at infinity.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.350
All right.

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:32.780
So the two examples that
we saw at the beginning.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.730
These are basically examples
of imaging sources at infinity.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.620
Because we had
plane waves coming

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.210
into the paraboloidal
reflector and ellipsoidal

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.890
refractor respectively.

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:47.410
And then these two
elements managed

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.660
to convert these plane
waves, these parallel

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:59.690
ray bundles into perfect
converging spherical waves.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:03.290
Therefore, they created
perfect point images

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.810
at the corresponding
focal points.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:07.370
And then wavefronts,
I also put down

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:14.050
the two equations, the
equations of the two elements.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:21.920
Now, let's flip the coin
a little bit, and ask

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.550
how can I create a
point image at infinity?

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:29.910
Now, I start with a point
source that is within my range.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:31.770
Here is my point source.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:33.380
Here is my point source.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.770
And I'm trying to
create an image

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.415
of that source of infinity.

00:41:38.415 --> 00:41:40.790
Well, another way to say it
is that what I'm trying to do

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:46.150
is I'm trying to
collimate the light.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.520
So in the case of
the paraboloid,

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.780
it's actually very simple.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.580
All I have to do is reverse
the paths of the rays.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.190
This may also sound arbitrary,
but in electromagnetics,

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.940
there's a very basic principle
that says that you can do that.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.990
I will not go into
that in detail,

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:11.370
but I can assure you that from
the rigorous electromagnetic

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.560
point of view, this
is permissible.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.190
You can reverse the ray
paths, and you still

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.310
get the value of the
electromagnetic field.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.010
Therefore, a paraboloidal
reflector works both ways.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.620
You can use it
either as a receiver,

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.870
so you can focus a
source at infinity,

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.813
and you can detect it here.

00:42:29.813 --> 00:42:30.730
Or it's a transmitter.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.870
You can have a point source
at this finite distance,

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:38.723
and you can broadcast a number
of cars, but you can beam it.

00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:39.390
That's the word.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:43.320
You can beam it
to a very narrow--

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.810
to a target that is at a
very long distance away.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:58.030
In the case of a refractor,
the answer is not as simple.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:05.390
Because in the process of
reversing the situation,

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:09.950
now, the source is in air.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:14.360
And the collimated light is in
glass, is in the dielectric.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.700
So therefore, the ellipse
doesn't necessarily

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.180
provide the same answer anymore.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.380
So basically, you have to
solve the problem again.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.360
And indeed, we find
that the ellipse is not

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.260
the answer in this case.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.690
The answer is a hyperbola.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:29.010
A hyperboloidal surface.

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.790
Given by this
equation over here.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:32.800
If you compare it with
the case of the ellipse,

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.813
the difference is a minus sign.

00:43:34.813 --> 00:43:36.480
So again, I will not
do this derivation.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.400
I will let you do
it by yourselves

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.740
if you have the inclination.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.570
Or if we have time at the
end today, we might do it.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.870
It's a very similar derivation.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.760
We apply Fermat's principle.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.430
We basically demand
that the path

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:54.660
from here to some reference
point equals the path from here

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.800
to the same reference
plane off axis.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.390
When you apply
this principle, you

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:06.640
end up with this equation after
some algebraic manipulation.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.802
So the word confusion.

00:44:08.802 --> 00:44:11.890
I actually put
together a table that

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.580
contains all the
possible cases of first

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:22.140
of all, reflective versus
refractive focusing elements.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.550
And point sources, or
point images at infinity.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.550
And there's actually
six possible cases.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.700
For the kinds of a reflector,
we saw that it doesn't really

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.450
make a difference.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.390
In both cases, a
paraboloid is the answer.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.320
Because I computed
already the focusing

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.840
of an object at
infinity, which is

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.020
focused at the focal
point of the paraboloid.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.610
And if I reverse the
rays, the same paraboloid

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.880
will take a point source at
F, and image that point source

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.150
at infinity.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.090
So that is very simple.

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:59.740
In the case of a dielectric,
I can do two things.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.820
First of all, I start
with the ellipsoid.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.400
When we derive the
case of the ellipsoid,

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.250
focusing a plane wave
coming from infinity.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:12.720
And we saw that it focuses at
the focal point of the ellipse,

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.400
inside the ellipse.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.050
If I reverse the
array paths, then I

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.570
have this situation where
the light originates

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.030
at the center of the ellipse.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:22.470
And then it gets
collimated as it comes out.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.450
Now, the reason the
ellipse is still the answer

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:28.830
here is because the light
starts at the dielectric.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.420
So really, now, I'm correct.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.400
I can still revise
the optical path,

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.510
and I get the correct answer.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:39.950
So this has led to cases
of objects at infinity,

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.090
and image at infinity.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:48.470
But have to be careful
that the object is in air.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.380
In this case, the object
of infinity is in air.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.810
The focus is inside
the dielectric.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.820
In this case, the
source of the object

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.030
is inside the dielectric,
and the image at infinity

00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.870
is in air.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.540
The other case is
the one that I just

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:07.000
mentioned, and did
not derive, but I

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.840
let you derive by yourselves.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.810
And that is the case
of a source that

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.770
is now at a finite distance.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:17.530
And I wish the image to be at
infinity inside the dielectric.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:22.250
So this case, this is
hyperboloidal surface.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.753
And, of course, you
might ask, well,

00:46:23.753 --> 00:46:25.170
what the heck does
it really mean?

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:29.428
Can I really make an
infinitely large refractor?

00:46:29.428 --> 00:46:31.470
Well, that says you don't
have to, because if any

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.940
of the refractor is cut here.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.770
Since the rays are
coming out normal,

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.860
they do not refract at
all at this interface.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.700
So really, you can
chop the hyperbola,

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:47.890
and then you can still have your
point, your image at infinity.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.090
So that's fine.

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.642
And, of course, you can also
reverse the ray paths here.

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:53.350
And you can create
the opposite situation

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.720
where whenever you have
an object at infinity,

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.820
but inside the dielectric.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.632
And you have a point image
at a finite distance in air.

00:47:01.632 --> 00:47:03.340
And that could also
be hyperbolic, right?

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:08.200
Because this, I derive simply
by flipping the ray paths

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.320
from one case to the next.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.960
OK, any questions about this?

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.540
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.620
If your point sources
within a green lens,

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:31.032
what is the corresponding
index of refraction function?

00:47:31.032 --> 00:47:32.740
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Within a green lens?

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.365
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:36.123 --> 00:47:38.040
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I
will cover green lenses

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.530
in about two weeks.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.170
We will do Hamiltonian
optics, so yeah.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.020
AUDIENCE: I also
have a question.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:54.000
So if you said with the
hyperboloidal refractor,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.560
if you cut off the
back end, the rays

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.390
will continue to
come out parallel.

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.100
Does that work in the
opposite direction?

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.683
Like if you have a lens that's
flat on one end and a hyperbola

00:48:01.683 --> 00:48:04.680
on the other, can you
focus it to a random point?

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.263
Or not random.

00:48:05.263 --> 00:48:06.305
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

00:48:06.305 --> 00:48:08.080
This case, for example,
that would work.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I can't see.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.550
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: If you
have rays coming in, yeah.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.078
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
right, yeah.

00:48:13.078 --> 00:48:14.870
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Of course, the problem

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.680
if you do it this way is
that you have to cut off

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.820
the hyperbol at some point.

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:23.442
So you cannot extend your
incoming bundle infinitely.

00:48:23.442 --> 00:48:24.150
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:48:25.578 --> 00:48:27.120
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Of course, these

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.840
are all very highly idealized
situations, I should emphasize.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:38.301
Any other questions?

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:50.700
OK, so now that you
have seen these,

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:55.440
I would like to say a few
things about wavefronts,

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.360
and what happens
to the wavefronts

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.177
as they go through of these--

00:48:59.177 --> 00:49:01.260
AUDIENCE: George, I think
that's another question.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.000
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.700
Yes.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.950
AUDIENCE: So would the
ellipsoidal reflector

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:08.430
also be more subject to
spherical aberrations

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:11.457
since the focal point is
actually within the optic

00:49:11.457 --> 00:49:12.540
instead of in front of it?

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:16.170
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Say that again?

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.180
If it is in front?

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.355
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's comparing the--

00:49:21.355 --> 00:49:22.980
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
OK, I have not yet

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.790
defined what is
spherical aberration.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.600
Assuming that we know what
spherical aberration is.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.165
All of these are free
of spherical aberration.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.640
By construction, they
focus light perfectly.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.190
However, a spherical aberration
will come in, for example,

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.055
if you--

00:49:41.055 --> 00:49:41.930
let's take this case.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:50.340
Yeah, if you move
the source off axis,

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.530
then the plane wave of
coming out will be aberrated.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:54.390
The same here.

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:56.670
If you tilt this plane wave.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:50:00.840
Again, the point image
will be aberrated.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.710
Actually, it would be
aberrated in more than one way.

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:08.220
It will contain comma
as well as spherical

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.870
So these are free of
aberrations to the degree

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:17.817
that they are also
operated as design.

00:50:17.817 --> 00:50:19.650
But we'll say a little
bit about aberrations

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:20.780
in the coming slides.

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.810
So maybe you can postpone that.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.410
Any other questions?

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.720
So speaking of aberrations,
here they come.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.910
First of all, let me say a few
things about the wavefronts.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:50.960
So by definition, I will
just look at this case,

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.720
and then you can
construct similar diagrams

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.298
for all the six cases that
were in the previous slide.

00:50:57.298 --> 00:50:58.340
I didn't want to do that.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.590
It actually takes a very
long time to do such a slide,

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.210
so I didn't want
to do all of them.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:06.180
But this is pretty
representative.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.840
So it conveys the idea, I think.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.290
So by definition, we have
a plane wave coming in.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:14.960
So you have plane wavefronts
arriving at the interface.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.230
And also by definition,
because by construction

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:23.200
we required all the rays,
all the refractive rays.

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.720
They are required to meet at
the focal point over here.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.570
It means that what
we have inside

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:33.890
the refractor is
converging spherical waves.

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:38.130
And therefore, if you look at
the wavefronts collapsing in

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:42.150
towards the focal point,
they are perfect spheres.

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:46.180
This is all equal section,
so these are perfect spheres

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:49.533
collapsing towards
uppercase F. It's

00:51:49.533 --> 00:51:51.450
kind of interesting to
think what happens here

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:53.170
at the interface.

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:55.900
So [INAUDIBLE] the interface,
you have two things happening.

00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:00.010
You have the ray arriving at
the left, then sort of being

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.178
refracted into the sphere.

00:52:02.178 --> 00:52:03.595
But the wavelength
has to remain--

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.120
well, it has to
remain continuous.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.190
So basically, what
happens is the wavefronts,

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:15.950
they curve in a continuous
fashion, as shown here.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.320
You can think of it basically
as the wave approaches

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.490
from the left toward
the refractor,

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.740
as it starts entering
the refractor, of course,

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.840
it enters first at the apex.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.110
And then the wavefront
starts bulging.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:38.730
It sort of creates this bulge.

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:41.270
And then as it goes
more and more in,

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:49.130
the bulge progresses to create a
segment of a spherical surface.

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:53.860
Now, you can justify that with
a number of different ways.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.190
One is, of course, Fermat's
principle that we just applied.

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.370
The other is if you
think that light actually

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:05.100
propagates slower in this medium
than it propagates in air,

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.770
then you can see why the
wavefront starts bulging here.

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:12.300
Because as soon as the light
enters the medium, it gets

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.230
slowed down.

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:14.730
So now that portion
of the wavefront

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.370
that is still outside
in air is actually

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:20.370
faster than the
portion that is here.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.650
Even if you compare,
let's take this case.

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:25.210
If you compare the portion
of the wavefront that is here

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:28.280
at the apex to the
portion that is here,

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.880
to the portion that is here.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.250
You can see that this one
has traveled the longer

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.020
distance in the medium.

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.330
So that's why it
is further behind.

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:38.760
This one has traveled
slightly less,

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.250
so therefore, it is a
little bit further ahead.

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:45.360
And this one is still in air,
so it is even more ahead.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.010
So this is another
way to explain

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.680
why the wavefronts
are bulging, and they

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.380
become spherical as the
wave enters the medium.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:02.600
Now, of course, they
become exactly spherical.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.480
It's very special to
shape that we chose.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.600
Because we demanded
Fermat to hold,

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.500
the wavefronts that
result from refraction

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.310
of this elliptical interface.

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:18.010
They actually become spherical.

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.260
But you can easily
convince yourself

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.410
that if I chose a
different surface.

00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:25.490
Say, if I chose a
sphere or a hyperbola

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:30.650
in this case, or some crazy
polynomial, quartic, sixth

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:34.460
order, I don't know,
some generalized surface.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.430
Then the wavefronts
that we get here.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:39.640
They might still bulge, because
the light would enter a slower

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.845
middle, but they
wouldn't be spherical.

00:54:42.845 --> 00:54:44.220
Now, the fact that
the wavefronts

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.400
would not be spherical.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:50.430
What it really implies is
that the focus is not perfect

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.160
anymore.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.940
If these surfaces
of the wavefronts,

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:57.420
they deviate from spheres.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.930
Then the rays would not
really all be at [? F, ?]

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.240
but they would cross
at various places.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:08.220
And that is what you
call an aberrated image,

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.920
or an aberrated wavefront.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:20.550
So the two are related, because
if, for example, the wavefront

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:24.300
deviates from a sphere, then you
call it an aberrated wavefront.

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.380
If the image deviates from
the ideal point image, where

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.990
all the rays meet to
a sort of blurry image

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:34.680
where the rays fail to meet,
then that's an aberrated image.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.840
So I will show some
examples of that

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:41.290
later on, today, and also
later during the class.

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:46.470
So there's a special
case when the--

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:48.480
well, let me save that
special case for later.

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:54.730
I will talk about
this in a little bit.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:58.410
What I would like to say next
is why is it so significant to--

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:01.740
why do we try so hard to
create these point images?

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.660
We're surrounded by
objects that are--

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.870
actually, most of the
objects that we see around us

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:17.400
are reflective.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.650
They are opaque.

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:23.760
So light that is entered
in from a light source,

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.640
for example, a light
bulb, or the sunlight when

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.810
we're outdoors.

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:31.270
What happens to the light
as it hits the objects that

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:32.700
are surrounding us.

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:34.350
It scatters.

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:37.320
So scattering really
means that the light

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.660
that is arriving from a source.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.800
Each point in the object, it
creates a highly divergent

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.060
spherical wave.

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.920
So basically, each
point in the object

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:50.160
becomes a secondary
point source.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.600
This is part of a big--

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.540
of another principle
in light propagation

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.640
called the Huygen's principle.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.050
But we're not quite ready
to see that principle yet.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.610
It needs a little bit
more careful definition.

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:06.000
So for now, one way to
justify in your mind

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.040
why this might happen is that
the objects surrounding us.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.210
They are composed of atoms.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:17.190
And each atom, when it
gets hit by the light beam.

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:18.690
It will be set in motion.

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:20.280
And you can imagine
the situation

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:24.120
where the motion of the atom
will irradiate a new light

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:24.900
beam.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.580
So these light beams
that are coming out

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:33.380
of there of the atoms composing
the surfaces surrounding us.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.020
This is what we perceive as--

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:40.047
I should say, what we
receive as scattered light.

00:57:40.047 --> 00:57:41.880
And it sounds a little
bit like hocus pocus,

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.713
but it's actually not
very far from reality.

00:57:43.713 --> 00:57:45.870
You can justify
the argument I just

00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:50.300
made with some very
basic principles.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.883
So it is more or less correct.

00:57:51.883 --> 00:57:53.550
The bottom line is
that the illumination

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:56.880
becomes these divergent
spherical wavefronts.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.980
Now, if you are sitting
here, and you're

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:02.130
observing all the rays
coming from the object.

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:05.610
You can imagine
that it's a mess.

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.310
For example, here, you have
rays coming from this point,

00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.440
and from this point,
and from this point,

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.230
from everywhere, everywhere
inside the object.

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:15.240
You have rays arriving here.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.490
So it is very difficult to
understand what's going on.

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:21.420
All of these rays, they create
kind of a very blurred image,

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:25.450
very similar to what happens to
those of us who have glasses.

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:28.500
When we take off our glasses,
everything appears blurry.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:31.380
Well, it is not as bad as it
would have been in this case.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.390
But the reason things are blurry
in our eyes is because when we

00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:40.330
take our glasses off, we
cannot form that effect--

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:42.480
well, it's never
perfect, but we can not

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:48.842
form good enough quality
images in our eye.

00:58:48.842 --> 00:58:51.300
So what we need in order to
design these kind of situations

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.720
is an optical
system, or a sequence

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.210
of optical elements
that will pick up

00:58:57.210 --> 00:59:00.450
these divergent
spherical wavefronts,

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:03.870
and will convert
them into converging

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:05.730
spherical wavefronts.

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:08.130
And if we can somehow
create an optical system

00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:11.670
that will take each and every
one of these wavefronts.

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:17.040
Now, we're talking, of course,
about an infinitely large

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:22.920
number of point scatterers
that are generated here.

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.530
But if you can somehow take
each and every one of them,

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:31.290
and I can convert it into a
converging spherical wave, then

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:34.840
when I put all these converging
spherical waves together,

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.480
I will actually
get an image, which

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.600
will be as close to
perfect as I could possibly

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.820
want within the limits
of approximation

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:45.240
of geometrical optics.

00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.280
Another way to express
it, which is really

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:50.580
like a fancy mathematical term,
but it is quite appropriate

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:55.130
here is the imaging
system creates a map.

00:59:55.130 --> 01:00:00.820
Creates a map from point
sources in the object space

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:05.090
to point images in
the image space.

01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.970
And this map is, of
course, very desirable.

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:12.860
Because if it fails, if I tried
to detect the image over here

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:17.270
that is before the rays
have come to focus.

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:20.840
Then the map
becomes ill-defined,

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.820
because each point over
here is receiving arrays

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.970
from multiple points
in the object.

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:28.760
This is exactly
the same situation

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.270
I was referring to before,
when we take off our glasses.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.360
Those of us unfortunate
enough to require glasses.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.350
For the rest of you who do not
need glasses in everyday life,

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:41.630
you can, of course,
create that same situation

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:45.350
by putting on a pair of
glasses that you can borrow

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:46.940
from one of your colleagues.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.500
So in both cases,
you can add what

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.360
we call the focus,
which basically

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.680
means that the image is not just
imperfect, but it is blurry.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.290
It is very far from perfect.

01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:01.650
However, from what you
must have gathered already

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:05.100
from the previous discussion,
this is a very difficult task.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.170
In fact, it is an
impossible task.

01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:12.660
Because you saw that even
in the case of a simple,

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.440
ellipsoidal, or hyperboloidal
focusing element.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.830
You could see that the one to
one mapping works only on axis.

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:27.320
If you tried to focus
simultaneously points off axis,

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.220
well, then, of course,
it stops to work.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.390
It is very easy to convince
yourself in geometrical terms.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.170
Even then, there is
some special cases

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:39.110
where you can have an entire
surface that is in focus.

01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:41.300
But we will talk
about this later.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:46.520
So this is actually--

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.060
you could think of it as
a very unfortunate event.

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.920
I think it as a fortunate
event, because it

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.720
keeps people like me,
and Professor Sheppard,

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.680
and a lot of colleagues,
it keeps us employed.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.080
Because this is the
whole reason people

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.140
need optical systems is
they need people like us.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.890
So it is a very fortunate fact.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:11.930
But what I'm trying to say here
is that this job of perfect

01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:14.630
imaging cannot be done exactly.

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.210
So therefore, the
science, or if you wish,

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:19.890
the engineering of
designing optical systems

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:23.150
is to arrive at the best
compromise within the cost,

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:26.630
constraints, the elements
that you have available,

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:30.607
the physics, of course, this
is definitely inviolable.

01:02:30.607 --> 01:02:31.940
You can violate a budget, right?

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.830
You can run a
budget into the red,

01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:37.450
as Wall Street banks discovered
in the last six months.

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.200
But you can certainly
not violate physics.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.540
Even bankers cannot
violate physics.

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.600
So within all these constraints
imposed by physics, economics,

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.270
and so on so forth, how can
you make an imaging system that

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:51.150
does the best job possible?

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:56.100
OK, so let's go back
to this question

01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:00.610
of how can we create good
enough quality images so that we

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.920
can design imaging systems?

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.630
So let's look at a slightly
different case, now.

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:10.520
So far, we saw pairs of
images and sources, where

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.020
one of the tools at infinity.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.930
So objects at infinity,
finite images.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:23.210
I mean, finite distant sources
and images at infinity.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:25.460
We start to deal with this
case, where we have a point

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.750
object and a point image.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:30.350
So both are now at
finite distances.

01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:34.773
Based on what we saw so far,
and assuming that you're not

01:03:34.773 --> 01:03:35.690
looking at your notes.

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.190
The answer is already
in your notes,

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:39.560
if you reach that
page in the notes.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.720
But if you haven't seen that,
then your time to guess.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.780
What would be the ideal
imager for this case that

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:51.780
would take a point object
and focus it perfectly

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:55.140
into a point image on axis?

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.960
Did we not answer
already based on--

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:09.340
AUDIENCE: The concatenation
of two hyperbolic reflectors.

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.020
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.587
So that is not necessarily
one way of doing it,

01:04:13.587 --> 01:04:15.170
but it's certainly
one way of doing it

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:16.900
based on what we learn.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.200
If I put two refractive
surfaces like this,

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.350
I can arrange the first
one to be a hyperbola.

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:27.340
What it will do is
it will collimate.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:32.190
Yeah, it will collimate the
incident divergent wavefront.

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:34.760
And then if I can arrange
for the second one

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:40.000
to be also hyperbola,
then that will focus.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.330
The plane wave that
was propagated here,

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:46.880
it will focus into a
perfect point image.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.120
So this is now, again,
a perfect imager.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.730
But now, it works
for finite distances.

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:54.640
One focal distance in
front of the hyperbola

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.610
to one focal distance
after the hyperbola.

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:03.860
And, well, just for
references, these

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:06.050
are the two questions
of the hyperbola.

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:08.090
I was a little bit
careful here to define

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:10.775
the axis, and the
displacement, and so on,

01:05:10.775 --> 01:05:11.900
so that the question works.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.240
I don't want to belabor that.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.930
I let you go back and convince
yourself that it is correct,

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:19.460
or convince yourself that is
not correct, in which case,

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.140
please let me know so
that I can correct it.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.680
But I think I got it right.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.370
Anyway, so these are the two
equations of the hyperboloids.

01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:30.020
And this is what in
optics is very often

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.880
referred to as an asphere.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.930
Now, this can be
slightly confusing.

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:39.490
So I'm going to say
it a few times here,

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:41.780
and then I'm going to ask
you to go back home, read it

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.260
a few times, then print it out.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.760
Post it in front of
your bathroom mirror

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.320
on top of your bed
and so on, whatever.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.740
So you can see it a few
times, and memorize it.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:57.230
OK, so this type of
element whose surface

01:05:57.230 --> 01:06:02.450
is optimized to give a
desired focus and behavior

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:04.220
is called in asphere.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:06.200
Again, I have a
benefit being Greek.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.220
This A in front of the
sphere means not a sphere.

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.190
Give an example
from everyday life.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.580
I can only think
technical terms,

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.530
and isotropic, aplanatic.

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:23.840
Give me an example of
from everyday life.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.655
AUDIENCE: Atypical?

01:06:24.655 --> 01:06:26.780
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Atypical, there you are, yeah.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.280
Thank you.

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:32.800
OK, so it is atypical
as in asphere.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.250
So another term that
is very commonly used

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.750
is in aspheric lens.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:47.800
Again, I want to emphasize
that this kind of a sphere.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.542
It works perfectly on axis.

01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:52.000
But as you can
imagine, if you were

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.230
to move this point object
off axis, it would go off.

01:06:56.230 --> 01:07:00.440
It could create an image, but
it would be highly aberrated.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:04.865
It would be subject to, well,
definitely spherical and comma

01:07:04.865 --> 01:07:05.365
possibly.

01:07:08.438 --> 01:07:09.480
It's a complicated story.

01:07:14.743 --> 01:07:16.910
You can imagine that this
doesn't happen at the way.

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:20.220
There's probably a range over
here for point sources at that

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:24.110
near enough the axis that this
refractor would work actually

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:25.280
quite well.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.230
So the question is can
I make such an element?

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:33.060
To answer this question,
I should tell you

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:36.690
a little bit about how optical
elements are usually made.

01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:39.480
So what people at
least used to do

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:42.630
in the old days of
expensive optical elements,

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:44.130
is they would take
a piece of glass.

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:47.160
They would mount it
on a rotary stage.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.150
Then they would bring a
diamond tip near the glass.

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:53.700
And they would start
rotating the glass.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:58.785
And they would rotate basically
not at all at the center,

01:07:58.785 --> 01:08:01.860
and they would let the
diamond touch the glass longer

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.345
and longer as they went away
from the tip of the glass.

01:08:06.345 --> 01:08:07.720
The result of that
is, of course,

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.630
that you create a
spherical surface

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:13.050
if you move the diamond
at a fixed velocity.

01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:15.750
So a fixed velocity
was very easy.

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:17.430
Because all you
needed is a model that

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:20.430
moves a diamond tip linearly.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.229
That's pretty easy to do.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:25.770
To make a hyperbola, you have
to plant the path of the diamond

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:31.970
tip in a way that results in
this nonuniform curvature.

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:35.189
So this used to be thought
as a very difficult task.

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.689
Come on in.

01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:36.410
Someone's outside.

01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.910
Come on in.

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:39.404
Don't be shy.

01:08:39.404 --> 01:08:40.279
She changed her mind.

01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:50.359
But in the last 20
years or so, the field

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:53.038
of mechatronics that many of
you are familiar with then

01:08:53.038 --> 01:08:53.830
had advanced a lot.

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:58.310
So people who are able to
design diamond tools that

01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:01.939
could very carefully plan
the path of the diamond tip,

01:09:01.939 --> 01:09:05.580
and actually create aspheric
elements, such as this one.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.140
But it still remains
very expensive.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:10.408
So it could be an order of
magnitude difference in price.

01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:12.200
If you need to compare
a spherical element,

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.040
compare it to an asphere.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:14.540
Another

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:18.140
Major invention that helped this
business is injection molding.

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.330
Instead of actually
making the optical element

01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:22.160
itself, what people
do nowadays is

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.859
they can make a very
expensive negative.

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:28.069
And then they inject
plastic into the negative.

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:30.439
They solidify the plastic,
and then they take it out.

01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:33.319
And they can get any
arbitrary surface they want.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:36.529
That's an OK way to make
a spheric optical element.

01:09:36.529 --> 01:09:39.605
Nevertheless, spherical
elements remain very popular.

01:09:39.605 --> 01:09:42.470
And there's a number of reasons
for these, [INAUDIBLE] spheres.

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:45.500
They can work very
well on axis, but they

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.870
can have other problems
that are perhaps

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:51.500
much more severe when they
go off axis, which is not a--

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.479
it is not a shoe
in, so to speak,

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:57.630
to use aspheric
optical elements.

01:09:57.630 --> 01:10:02.140
So for that reason, we'll
spend quite a bit of time,

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.190
and also, I guess,
because of tradition

01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:09.310
to analyze what happens
to light as it goes

01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:12.947
through spherical surfaces.

01:10:12.947 --> 01:10:14.280
So spherical surface, of course.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.470
If you replace the hyperbolas
here with a sphere.

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:20.800
Let's say I take a sphere.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.050
I need to say this very
clearly, because the terms can

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:24.370
become confusing.

01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:28.960
If I replace the asphere
with a perfect sphere,

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.292
that is, with a ball.

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.500
Then, of course, as you can
imagine, what will happen

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.290
is the wavefront,
even inside the sphere

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:37.100
will not be planar anymore.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.370
You can convince yourself
if you think about it

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:42.940
that because this sphere
actually bends faster

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:46.690
than the hyperbola, the arrays
that are away from the axes.

01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.980
They will bend more.

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:52.323
So you get a slightly focusing
in effect inside the sphere.

01:10:52.323 --> 01:10:53.990
Because, of course,
not a perfect focus.

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:56.312
It is itself very
high aberrated.

01:10:56.312 --> 01:10:57.770
And by the time
they come out, they

01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:59.150
become aberrated even more.

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:03.530
So you get a very poor
quality focus in general.

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:06.010
There is a special case
where this might not happen,

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:07.790
but I will skip that for now.

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:10.020
So in general, you get
an aberrated image.

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.620
So this is what they meant
before by aberration.

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.230
You see that the rays,
they form a blur here.

01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:17.750
They fail to meet at
the perfect focus,

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:20.360
as it would have been required
by the perfect optical system.

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:27.460
And this particular
type of aberration

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:32.020
that occurs when you
use a spherical surface

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:35.650
or axis in this system is
called spherical aberration.

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:37.660
Someone asked earlier
about spherical.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.530
This is spherical.

01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:40.728
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

01:11:40.728 --> 01:11:41.770
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:42.985
AUDIENCE: How do you pick z2?

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.760
Like where do you
choose to pick z2?

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.730
Is it at the focus
of the closest rays,

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:54.070
or the furthest rays?

01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:56.153
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: This
came from the hyperbola.

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.350
z1, z2, they come
from the hyperbola.

01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:20.960
Depending on the curvature
over here, define z1 and z2.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.000
And then I selected
the sphere to match

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.200
the curvature of the
hyperbola near to the axis.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.090
So if you look at
the animation again.

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:36.920
Near the axis, you will see that
they actually perfectly match.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.900
But then, of course,
the sphere carves faster

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:43.165
than the hyperbola.

01:12:43.165 --> 01:12:44.540
AUDIENCE: I think
the question is

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:48.170
in the spherically aberrated
case where you can not

01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:53.698
find all the points meeting,
how can you define the z2?

01:12:53.698 --> 01:12:55.990
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK,
that's a really good question.

01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:58.670
So the way you
defined z2 is you look

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:02.570
at the two rays that are really,
really close to the axis.

01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:04.380
For those two rays
that are propagating

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:08.457
at the very small angle,
then the same z2 applies.

01:13:08.457 --> 01:13:10.040
Then, of course, the
rest of the rays.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.280
They go off very
far from that point.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.180
But anyways, z2 here is exactly
the same as it was before.

01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:23.540
Did that answer your question?

01:13:27.627 --> 01:13:28.210
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:33.970
Long

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:35.950
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Now, if you go off axis,

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:38.405
then other types of
aberrations kick in.

01:13:38.405 --> 01:13:39.780
So we're not
mentioning them now.

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.980
We'll come back to
this topic later,

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:45.420
and we find them in more detail.

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.590
But for now, keep this
in mind, that if you

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:54.110
use a sphere on axis.

01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:55.390
Let me repeat.

01:13:55.390 --> 01:14:01.000
If you use a sphere to
focus a point source on axis

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.460
into a point image, also an
axis at the finite distance,

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:06.370
then you get spherical
aberration in general.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:19.670
Well, that is true, but
if you put it over here.

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:21.990
Just move the axis, yes.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:23.730
Well, yeah.

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:26.310
OK.

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.260
Yeah, thank you.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.880
Let me define what I
mean by the axis here.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.550
So typically, film and
camera is the elements

01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:40.330
that we use in order
to capture images flat.

01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:46.800
So if I put here
either my camera lens.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.480
I should say the tip of
the camera, the camera

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.120
dial, or a film.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.210
That defines an axis that is
perpendicular to the film.

01:14:57.210 --> 01:14:59.700
So Colin is correct, that
if I take a point here,

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.240
and then move it sort of
radially through the sphere.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.660
It will form a perfect
image over here.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:10.420
The fact that I try to detect
the image not at this point,

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.740
but on the plane, means that I
will be subject to aberrations.

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:17.930
This is the proper
definition of aberration.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.310
And, of course, even
the on axis point

01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:25.170
will have spherical aberration,
as I mentioned earlier.

01:15:28.535 --> 01:15:29.660
Did I answer that question?

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:38.610
OK, so let's see how we
deal with the refraction

01:15:38.610 --> 01:15:39.300
from a sphere.

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.200
So [INAUDIBLE],, as
you can imagine,

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.990
is a quite complicated
problem because here

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:51.150
is a ray that is arriving from
some point source on axis.

01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:52.770
It hits the sphere.

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:55.530
And then my job is to find
which direction this ray

01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:58.670
will be refracted
inside the sphere.

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:01.010
So now, again, I can
use one of the tools

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:02.300
that we have in our arsenal.

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:06.230
I can use Fermat's principle,
or I can use Snell's law.

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:08.155
The two are, of
course, identical.

01:16:08.155 --> 01:16:09.780
The fact of the matter
is in this case,

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:13.160
it would be quite
complicated to do.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.200
So we'll do simplification.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.840
First of all, let's
define some notation here.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.340
I will denote as x the
distance of the ray

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.550
intersects the sphere.

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:29.690
I will define as
alpha left the angle

01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:31.730
that the ray makes
with the optical axis

01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:34.860
to the left of the interface.

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:36.910
This is the interface.

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:38.900
And then alpha
right is the angle

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.820
that the ray makes with
respect to the horizontal,

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:47.260
the optical axis the right
hand side of the interface.

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:48.730
OK, that's my notation.

01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:51.710
And now for generality,
I do not assume

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:53.440
that this is air
anymore, I just assume

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.550
that I have two dielectrics.

01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.490
One has index n sub
left, and the other

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:00.850
has index n sub right.

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:03.350
It's a little bit cumbersome
to carry left and right around,

01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:06.650
but it is convenient because we
will leave that for a mnemonic

01:17:06.650 --> 01:17:08.947
later on.

01:17:08.947 --> 01:17:10.280
So how do we solve this problem?

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.680
Well, the way I elected to
solve it is a little bit easier,

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.460
it turns out.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.590
So for the first
time, today I will not

01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:18.940
use Fermat's principle.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.680
I will use Snell's law.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.147
And, of course,
Snell's law follows

01:17:22.147 --> 01:17:23.980
from Fermat's principle,
so I haven't really

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.060
changed anything.

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:29.020
It's just more convenient
to do the math this way.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:32.320
So to apply Snell's law,
I have to figure out

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.070
which way is the
perpendicular to the interface

01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:40.840
at the cross section of the
ray with a spherical surface.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.170
And, of course, if I have
a sphere conveniently,

01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:48.510
the normal to the sphere
goes through the center.

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:50.730
So here is the
normal to the sphere.

01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:54.480
It goes to the center, and
some additional rotation.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.650
I will denote as R, the
radius of the sphere.

01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:04.710
And phi, I will denote the angle
that this particular normal,

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:07.920
this particular radius
makes with, again,

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.840
with a horizontal axis.

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.520
I think this is all the
notation that I needed.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.150
Actually, I'm not done yet.

01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:20.740
So I also to apply Snell's law.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.660
So to apply Snell's law, I
have to look at the angles that

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.370
enter Snell's law.

01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:30.710
So if you recall, apply
Snell relative to the normal

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.150
to the interface.

01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:34.370
So here's the normal,
here is the ray.

01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:36.950
Therefore, this
angle is theta that

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:40.820
will go on the left-hand
side of Snell's law.

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:44.360
And the corresponding
is theta sub right

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:47.990
that will go to the right-hand
side of Snell's law.

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:52.880
So speaking of which,
here is Snell's law--

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.690
n left times the sine of the
angle on the left-hand side

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.870
will equal n to the right
times the sine of the angle

01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:02.390
on the right-hand side.

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:05.890
And now I have to do a
little a bit of geometry.

01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:08.650
So these angles, they
are not known to me yet.

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:12.160
But I can observe
that alpha left

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:15.160
is the same as the angle
from the horizontal

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.270
to the ray over here.

01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:21.880
And the angle from the
horizontal to the radius

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.780
equals 5.

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:27.730
So this means that I have
this property over here--

01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:30.830
theta left equals
alpha left plus 5

01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:34.370
in the corresponding equation
for the right-hand side.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:41.970
And I can also substitute
these two relationships

01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:43.525
into Snell's law.

01:19:43.525 --> 01:19:45.630
I can apply a little
bit of trigonometry

01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:48.540
in order to break
the sign of the sum

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.910
into this rather
complicated-looking expression

01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:51.917
over here.

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:53.250
So I haven't made much progress.

01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:55.650
So all I managed to do is
write a complicated set

01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:59.000
of trigonometric relationships.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.820
In fact, if I were to
do a numerical solution

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:05.690
to this problem, I would
just stop here and feed it

01:20:05.690 --> 01:20:07.640
into a computer and solve.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.890
But I don't want to do that
quite yet, because there's

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:11.840
quite a bit of
intuition to be derived

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:17.315
before we go blindly into a
computer and plug the numerics.

01:20:17.315 --> 01:20:19.190
So of course, the thing
that we do in physics

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:22.460
when we try to derive intuition
from a very complicated formula

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.330
like this one is we
make approximations.

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.500
And the reasonable
approximation to make here

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:32.320
is that the rays that are
arriving to the element

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.200
are limited in a relatively
small angular range.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.480
This turns out to be a
very practical assumption,

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:42.110
because it is a very common
situation in optics to have

01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:49.050
this small angle approximation.

01:20:49.050 --> 01:20:51.830
And it turns out that even when
the small angle approximation

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:53.870
is not exactly
right, you can still

01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:57.080
do a first pass of the
design of an optical system

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.310
with this approximation.

01:20:58.310 --> 01:21:00.020
And then you can
improve it by doing

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:02.562
sort of more complicated
numerical analysis.

01:21:02.562 --> 01:21:04.520
So it's a very good place
to start the analysis

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.210
of an optical system.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:09.320
So the key assumption here is
that alpha sub left, this one,

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.850
is very small.

01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:12.310
If that is true--

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:14.130
and also, I need
one more assumption,

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:16.850
which is that this
distance over here,

01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:20.990
the distance that a ray meets
the spherical interface,

01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:24.080
is much smaller than the
radius of the sphere.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.350
In other words, the
sphere is not very small,

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:30.210
but it is a relatively
small curvature.

01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:30.710
All right?

01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:34.640
It has a relatively
large radius of curvature

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.170
or, equivalently,
a small curvature.

01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:39.740
So the first
answers are correct.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:42.915
It is also reasonable to
assume that alpha right, so

01:21:42.915 --> 01:21:44.290
the right-hand
side of interface,

01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:46.380
is also very small angle.

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.660
And if I make the
set of assumptions,

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:53.660
the entire set is called
the paraxial approximation.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:57.710
So "paraxial" really means
that everything is confined

01:21:57.710 --> 01:22:02.480
to being near the optical axis.

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.480
Very well.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:06.270
So if we do this approximation
now, a lot of this

01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:09.740
gets simplified because
of this Taylor series.

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:13.970
The sine of the angle of a small
angles equals the angle itself.

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:16.990
The cosine of a
small angle equals 1.

01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:21.998
And also, the sine of
this angle 5 is equal x/r.

01:22:21.998 --> 01:22:23.290
I don't have to touch that one.

01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:25.330
This one is actually exact.

01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:29.320
But I can also neglect the
cosine of pi, because--

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.090
well, because,
again, we are making

01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:33.310
the paraxial approximation.

01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:35.750
So if I do that, and I do a
little bit of rearrangement

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.240
here, I arrive at
this explanation

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:41.540
that says that the
index of the right,

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:45.350
the index to the right
time the angle to the right

01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:48.740
equals the index to the
left times the angle

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:53.460
to the left times this
expression over here.

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:54.960
You might wonder a
number of things.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.590
For example, why did I
leave the index here?

01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:58.910
I'm looking for alpha right.

01:22:58.910 --> 01:23:02.570
So why don't I just divide
along and get done with it?

01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:03.350
There is a reason.

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:05.570
And it will become
apparent in the moment.

01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:07.100
But for now, I'm
almost done, right?

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.340
I have managed to
do what I wanted.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.110
I have a pretty
closed-form expression

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:16.980
for the angle of refraction
inside the sphere.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:20.760
Now I'm going to do
something really strange.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.690
I will derive a
similar expression

01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:25.493
for light propagating
in uniform space.

01:23:25.493 --> 01:23:27.160
Now, this sounds
totally useless, right?

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.570
But let me do it anyway.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.490
And bear with me for a while.

01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:34.670
I have a ray which is
propagating in free space.

01:23:34.670 --> 01:23:38.810
For reasons of notation, I will
define two refractive indices

01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:40.070
that are equal.

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:42.050
One is n left, one is n right.

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:45.770
But they're both equal to the
same index of refraction n.

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:50.110
And what I'm interested to do
is I'm interested in relating

01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:55.430
the angle of the ray on the
left-hand side with respect

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:58.880
to this reference plane
over here and the elevation

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:02.450
of the ray with respect to
the same plane with the same

01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:05.770
quantities at the
second reference plane--

01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:09.114
the elevation and the angle
of the right-hand side.

01:24:09.114 --> 01:24:11.090
[? There ?] are other
trivial problem,

01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:15.500
because, for example, Fermat
says that in free space,

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:18.380
the ray must propagate
at a straight line.

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:20.960
So therefore, I can immediately
derive that alpha left

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.770
equals alpha right.

01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:24.110
Not very surprising, right?

01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:26.210
I'm stating the
obvious here, and I'm

01:24:26.210 --> 01:24:27.450
making a big deal out of it.

01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:30.040
But nevertheless, let
me write it like this.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.790
Since the indices are
the same, I can also

01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:34.500
multiply by those indices.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:38.620
And what about the elevations?

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.180
Well, the elevations
satisfy a simple equation

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:46.820
relating the tangent of the
angle of propagation multiplied

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:49.520
by the propagation distance d.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.250
So the elevation to the
right equals the elevation

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:55.520
to the left times this--

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.540
time this quantity.

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:00.547
And then in the spirit of the
paraxial approximation again,

01:25:00.547 --> 01:25:02.630
I'm going to drop the
tangent, because the tangent

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:05.330
of a small angle equals
the angle itself.

01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:10.340
And I arrive at a
set of equations,

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:14.240
x right equals x left
plus d times alpha left.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.670
And this equation
that I got before.

01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:18.290
So now let me put
the two together.

01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:21.360
Let me put the free space
propagation that I just

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.430
derived, and relationship
between the ray elevation

01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:29.060
and the ray angle to the
left and to the right

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:34.510
of a uniform space
of distance d,

01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:37.810
and the equation that
I just derived earlier

01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:44.610
for the refraction of a ray
from a spherical surface,

01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:50.480
spherical refractive
surface, of radius r.

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.250
OK.

01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:54.160
So these are the two sets
of equations that we got.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.780
This is the set of equations
that I got immediately before.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:02.230
And this is the set of equations
that I saw that I got earlier

01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:06.630
when I solved the
refraction problem

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:08.488
at the spherical interface.

01:26:08.488 --> 01:26:10.530
And again, I want to
emphasize that both of these

01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:12.750
are correct in the
paraxial approximation.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:14.850
These are not exact expressions.

01:26:14.850 --> 01:26:16.650
The equal sign is a
bit of an ambiguous

01:26:16.650 --> 01:26:18.420
here, because I've
sort of assumed

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:20.458
that the paraxial
approximation is correct.

01:26:20.458 --> 01:26:22.250
So we're going on with
this assumption now.

01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:25.650
That's why I'm
putting equal signs.

01:26:25.650 --> 01:26:26.440
OK.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.180
And I added one
more equation that I

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:31.840
didn't write before that
says that x to the left

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.017
equals x to the right.

01:26:33.017 --> 01:26:34.850
In this case-- and this
is a trivial thing--

01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:37.610
it says that the
ray is continuous.

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:41.200
It arrives at the interface
at the center point

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.165
and leaves from the same point.

01:26:43.165 --> 01:26:44.290
And that's kind of obvious.

01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:45.850
The ray should not jump.

01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:47.980
So what is remarkable
about these equations

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:51.670
is that they're
both fully there,

01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:53.770
and the relations--
and the quantities

01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:56.050
that they're linear
with respect to

01:26:56.050 --> 01:26:59.020
are these two
elements, the elevation

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.580
and the angle of the ray.

01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:04.970
So you can think of them as
kind of transport equations.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:10.900
They allow you to
transport a ray from two

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.100
very basic optical elements.

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.340
One is free space propagation.

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:18.610
It allows you to transport
a ray through uniform space.

01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:21.370
And the other is a
refractive interface.

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:25.090
Again, it allows you
to transport the ray

01:27:25.090 --> 01:27:28.870
from the left to the right
of a refractive interface.

01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:33.400
And because they're linear,
we can also write them

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.810
in matrix form as follows.

01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:37.090
This is not new.

01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:39.700
I just took these
equations and rewrote them.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:43.780
And I rewrote them in
a slightly funny way.

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:49.240
I kept the index of
refraction times the angle.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.720
Can anybody-- now that
we see it in this form--

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.220
I will go to the
matrix in a moment.

01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.762
But now that you
see it in this form,

01:27:55.762 --> 01:27:58.600
can anybody guess why did I
go through all this trouble

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.870
to keep the index of
refraction in this expression?

01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:04.360
Why don't I just write
the angle by itself?

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:16.990
Is there a case, a
situation that we've

01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:21.420
seen, where this quantity may
be conserved, for example?

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:37.860
AUDIENCE: You have the
dispersion thing again.

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:41.460
Or where it depends-- where you
have different n's, I suppose,

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:45.750
and therefore different angles
depending on your wavelengths.

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:47.500
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.580
Even simpler, actually.

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.060
If you are think
of Snell's law--

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:55.380
yeah, you're on the
right track there.

01:28:55.380 --> 01:29:17.030
If you think of Snell's
law, Snell's law

01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:23.940
says that n left sine
alpha left equals

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:30.240
n right sine alpha right.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.450
And of course, in the
paraxial approximation

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:34.470
I drop the sinusoids.

01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:37.770
So therefore, I arrive
to the conclusion

01:29:37.770 --> 01:29:41.310
that this quantity at the
first element of this vector

01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:44.780
is actually conserved.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:48.300
And [INAUDIBLE] of
course, you can go over it

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:49.880
yourselves and
convince yourselves

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.510
that the equation is correct.

01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:53.510
This is basically just
taking the same equation.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:04.660
And these matrices, we'll
use them in the next lecture

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:05.950
in order to do ray tracing.

01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:08.620
So basically, an optical
element can always

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:12.610
be decomposed in a sequence
of refractive interfaces

01:30:12.610 --> 01:30:16.420
and free space or uniform
space propagation.

01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.820
So the reason the
matrices are convenient--

01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:20.740
sort of jumping
ahead a little bit--

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:25.090
is because if you have a
cascade of optical elements,

01:30:25.090 --> 01:30:28.660
then you can ray trace simply
by multiplying these matrices.

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:32.290
I will do that in detail in
the next lecture next Monday.

01:30:32.290 --> 01:30:34.990
But this is why we went
through all this trouble

01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:37.270
to derive the
paraxial approximation

01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:39.660
and then write it out
in this matrix form,

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:44.460
so that we can use matrix
properties to do ray tracing.

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.290
Then there's one more
thing before we quit.

01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:54.600
Do you see Snell's law in
any of these laws over here?

01:30:54.600 --> 01:31:02.380
You can see Snell's law on the
handwritten slide over here.

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.150
But how about-- what about here?

01:31:04.150 --> 01:31:06.061
Can you see Snell's
law somewhere?

01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:20.750
Another way to ask my question--

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:22.950
these are questions
that I wrote here.

01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:26.270
Can they capture
Snell's law in some way?

01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:27.110
Do they include it?

01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.610
How?

01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:42.000
AUDIENCE: The elevation
doesn't change if we apply it

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.890
at a point the interfaces.

01:31:44.890 --> 01:31:45.890
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: OK.

01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:46.690
That is correct.

01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:47.350
Yeah, that's correct.

01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.590
OK.

01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:48.590
Maybe I should restate--

01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:51.040
I asked the question
in a confusing way.

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:55.490
The Snell's law at
the flat interface--

01:31:55.490 --> 01:31:58.298
the same that I
rewrote over here--

01:31:58.298 --> 01:31:59.965
can I get it somehow
from this equation?

01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:11.930
What is the radius of
curvature of this surface?

01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:13.780
Infinity, right?

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:19.600
So if I plug in infinity, if
I plugged r equals infinity,

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.880
in this case of
course, physically what

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.030
happens is the
interface becomes flat.

01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:28.390
Is the equation over
here, this term goes away.

01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:29.100
And I get what?

01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:44.430
I get-- n left alpha
left, n right alpha right,

01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:46.430
x left, x right.

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:49.970
So you write x left
equals x right,

01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:54.220
but also n left alpha left
equals n right alpha right,

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:58.520
which is actually Snell's law.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:03.530
So this-- again, I'm restating
something that I said before--

01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:06.160
this is the reason why
we put this product

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:13.830
in the top element of the vector
when we write this expression.

01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:14.800
OK.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.940
So we've run out of time.

01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:18.630
So any questions?

01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:19.245
Yeah.

01:33:19.245 --> 01:33:22.640
AUDIENCE: I think [INAUDIBLE]

01:33:26.747 --> 01:33:28.330
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Oh, you're right.

01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:28.830
I'm sorry.

01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:30.650
This would be 1, 0.

01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:31.590
Yeah.

01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:32.720
Yeah.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.040
I'll fix the notes.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.070
There's a typo.

01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:40.013
The first matrix should be 1,
0, and then the rest is correct.

01:33:40.013 --> 01:33:40.680
Yeah, thank you.

01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:45.050
Did everybody hear that?

01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:47.630
There's a typo in the notes.

01:33:47.630 --> 01:33:50.680
The elements of the first row of
this matrix need to be swapped.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:55.080
OK.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:59.090
So I'll see you all next Monday.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.550
REBECCA SAXE: There's a
whole bunch of limitations

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.490
of Haxby-style correlations--

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.900
one of them is that all
the tests are binary.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.420
The answer you get
for anything you test

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.490
is that there is or
is not information

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.070
about that distinction, so
there's no continuous measure

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.570
here.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.780
It's just that two
things are more--

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.830
they are different
from one another

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.360
or they are not different
from one another.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.289
And so once people started
thinking about this method

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.830
it became clear that
this is actually

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.660
just a special case of a much
more general way of thinking

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.930
about fMRI data.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.780
So this particular method--
using spatial correlations--

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.400
is very stable and robust,
but it's a special case

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.540
of a much more general set.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690
And here's the
more general idea.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.020
The more general idea is that
we can think of the response

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.960
pattern to a stimulus in a
set of voxels, for example--

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.210
the voxels in a region--

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.150
we can think of that
response pattern

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.470
as a vector in voxel space.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.570
So every time you
present a stimulus

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.700
you get the response
of all the voxels.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.370
Now, instead of thinking of
that as a spatial pattern,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.650
think of that as a
vector in voxel space.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.040
Every voxel defines a dimension,
and the position in voxel space

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.420
is how much activity in each
of those voxels there was.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.500
Can everybody do that
mental transformation?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.300
This is, like, the key insight
that people had about MVPA--

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.340
is we had been thinking
about everything in space--

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.340
in the space of cortex--

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.030
but instead of thinking of
a spatial pattern on cortex,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.130
treat each voxel as
a dimension of a very

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.782
multi-dimensional space.

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:07.240
Now, the response
to every stimulus

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.610
is one point in voxel space.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.390
OK?

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.830
As soon as you think
of it that way,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.541
then your mental representation
of fMRI data looks like that.

00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.040
Right?

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.789
So your mental
representation of fMRI data

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.150
used to be a BOLD
response, and then

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.580
it was a spatial
pattern of a cortex,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.610
and now it's a point
in voxel space.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.820
And if you can follow those
three transformations then

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.530
you realize that a set of points
in a multi-dimensional space

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.450
is the kind of problem
that all of machine

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.790
learning for the last 20
years has been working on.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.660
Right?

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.990
And so everything that has ever
happened in machine learning

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.080
could now be used
in fMRI, because--

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.740
well, almost-- because
machine learning has just

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.250
absolutely proliferated in
both techniques and problems

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.560
and solutions to those
problems for handling

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.260
data sets where you have no idea
where the dataset came from,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.110
but it's now represented
as multiple points

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.100
in a multidimensional space.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.360
And so that's what happened
about five years ago--

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.920
is that people
realized that we could

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.860
think of fMRI as the
response to every stimulus

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.010
as a point in voxel space.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.490
A set of data is a set
of points in voxel space.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.980
Now, do anything
you want with that.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.080
And the first most
obvious thing to do

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.370
is to think of this as a
classification problem.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.870
OK?

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.020
So we created conditions in
our stimuli or dimensions

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.390
in our stimuli,
so now we can ask,

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.940
can we decode those conditions?

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.842
Can we find clusters?

00:03:35.842 --> 00:03:36.800
Can we find dimensions?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.950
Right?

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.408
All the standard
things that people

00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:42.470
have done when you had points
in multi-dimensional spaces.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.900
And so, again, the most
common thing people

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.630
now do is now that you
think of fMRI data that way,

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.840
try linear classification of
the categories or dimensions

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.729
that you're interested
in, and typically

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.520
using standard machine
learning techniques.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.980
So think of training a
classifier on some of your data

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.819
and testing it on
independent data

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.610
and trying to find the
right classification

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.651
techniques that can identify
whatever distinction

00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:06.800
you're interested in in the
data set that you built.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.850
And so, the way that this one
looks is that you take some--

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.030
now, voxels are on the
y-axis of this heat map,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.220
so we have whatever that is 80,
100 voxels in a region-- maybe

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.550
more, and for every
stimulus you have

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.770
the response in every
voxel to that stimulus.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.270
Right?

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.830
So each of those columns
now is a representation

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.860
of where that stimulus
landed in voxel space,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.194
and you have a whole
bunch of instances.

00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:34.610
And so now what
you're going to do

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.740
is use the training to learn
a potential linear classifier

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.350
that tells you what was
the best way to separate

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.480
the stimuli that
came from one labeled

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.090
set versus the stimuli that came
from some other labeled set.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.510
And the test of that
is going to be--

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.540
take a new stimulus
or new response

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.310
and use the
classification you learned

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.420
to try to decode which
stimulus that that came from,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.870
and measure your accuracy.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.470
And so the new measure of
the information in fMRI

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.480
is going to be
classification accuracy.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.130
Does that makes sense--

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.120
the people with me?

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.390
OK, because that's where a
lot of fMRI is right now--

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.550
is now thinking about
responses to stimuli

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.290
as points in voxel space
and the problem as one

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.030
of classification accuracy
in independent data.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.730
OK.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.240
Here's one experiment
that we did

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.060
where we use classification.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.420
So now, another thing just to
note is that in this context

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.700
you're often trying to
classify a single trial.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.270
Right?

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.740
So in our case,
we're always trying

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.240
to classify a single
trial, so we've

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.290
gone from partitioning
the data to two halves

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.520
and asking about similarity, to
training on some of the data,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.400
and now classifying
single independent trials.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.900
OK.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.160
So here's a case where
we tried to do that,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.944
and it was an
extension of the stuff

00:05:55.944 --> 00:05:57.860
that I just showed you
that you could classify

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.700
seeing versus hearing, and so
we tried to replicate and extend

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.266
that.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:03.890
So we told people's
stories like this--

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.110
there's a background--
so Bella's

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.454
pouring sleeping potion
into Ardwin's soup,

00:06:08.454 --> 00:06:09.870
where her sister,
Jen, is waiting.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.500
They're holding their breath
while he starts to eat.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.980
The conclusion of the story is
always going to be the same.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.949
Bella concludes that
the potion worked,

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.740
and then we tell you
based on what evidence

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.920
she made that conclusion.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.460
Another case here
is going to be--

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.970
Bella stared through the
secret peephole and waited.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.850
In the bright light she saw his
eyes close and his head droop,

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.280
so that her evidence for the
conclusion that the potion

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.610
has worked.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.055
That's OK evidence, and we can
vary that in a bunch of ways.

00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:38.360
So one is we can change
the modality for evidence.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.000
Instead of seeing something,
she can hear something.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.400
So for example, she pressed
her ear against the door

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.180
and waited.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.360
In the quiet she heard the
spoon drop and a soft snore.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.270
So that's similar
content of information,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.020
but arrived at through
a different modality.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.810
Or we can change how
good her evidence is,

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.580
and so in this case
we did it by saying,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.770
she tried to peer through
a crack in the door.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.500
In the dim light she squinted
to see his eyes closed.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.040
OK, so that's less strong
perceptual evidence

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.870
for the conclusion that
the potion has worked.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.770
OK.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.500
And so now what we're
going to ask is--

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.630
if we train on one
set of stories,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.390
on the pattern of activity in
a brain region for stories that

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.100
vary on either of
these dimensions,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.000
one at a time either vary on
modality or vary on quality--

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.670
in a new test set, can
we decode that dimension?

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.800
Yeah, and the first answer
is we can-- both of them.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.440
One thing about this is that
this measure isn't binary

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.000
anymore.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.790
So since we're doing
for every stimulus

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.770
we're asking whether we can
classify that stimulus or not--

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.170
we can get for every
subject, so we can get

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.839
for each item the probability--

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:51.380
for each subject for each item
we get a measure of whether it

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.960
was classified correctly
or not, so across objects,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.957
across items--

00:07:54.957 --> 00:07:56.540
we know for every
item the probability

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.340
of it being correctly
classified or not.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.940
And then we can
ask, is that related

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.115
to other continuous
features of that item?

00:08:04.115 --> 00:08:05.990
So in this case what we
can say, for example,

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.410
is the quality dimension--

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.440
how good your evidence is for
the belief that you conclude--

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.510
that's a continuous metric--

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.250
though it's a
continuous feature.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.530
It can be judged continuously
by human observers,

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.990
so for each item we
can ask, how good is

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.700
the evidence for the conclusion
for this specific story?

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.870
That judgment by human observers
of how good the evidence is,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.049
continuously predicts
the probability

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.330
of that item being
classified as being

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.299
good evidence or
bad evidence-- even

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.179
over above the label
that we gave it.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:44.280
So if you regress out the labels
there's a continuous predictor.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.714
So something, like,
imagine a neural population

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:48.255
that responds-- a
sub population that

00:08:48.255 --> 00:08:51.140
responds more the better
the evidence, continuously,

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.110
so that classification
gets better

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.470
as you get further
out on that dimension.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.091
It's also not redundant
across brain regions,

00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.590
so there's different information
in different brain regions.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.756
And this is just to show
you that in two other brain

00:09:04.756 --> 00:09:06.180
regions--

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.690
so in the right STS we can
decode quality, but not

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.700
modality, and in the
left TPJ we can decode

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.300
modality, but not quality.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.050
And the left TPJ we've
replicated a bunch of times.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:22.070
In the DMPFC we can't
decode modality or quality,

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.710
but we can decode valence,
which is the thing I told you

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.090
the right TPJ doesn't decode.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.030
And then if we go back and look
at valence in this dataset--

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.520
we can only decode
valence in the DMPFC.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.890
So this is, to me, this is
starting to get cool, right?

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.080
Three features of other
people's mental states

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.960
represented differentially
in different brain regions.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.810
This distinction between
the more epistemic stuff--

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.040
like modality and quality which
is represented in the TPJ,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.720
and valence which is
represented in the DMPFC--

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.752
I think is real and
deep and hints at one

00:09:49.752 --> 00:09:52.210
of the really most important
distinctions within our theory

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.350
of mind that I mentioned
at the very beginning--

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.320
between epistemic states and
affective or motivational

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.760
states.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.725
So what's cool about
classification analyzes?

00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:04.100
They have all the
same properties

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.082
as the Haxby-style
analyses in principle,

00:10:06.082 --> 00:10:08.540
because they're actually just
a generalization of the Haxby

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.580
analyses, except that they're
a lot less robust, because what

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.490
you're trying to classify as
single trials are single items.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:21.050
And so noisy data collapses
faster in these classification

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.160
strategies than in
Haxby-style analyses

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.255
where you're averaging.

00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:29.570
But otherwise, those are
the same two techniques.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.070
What's nice about
the classification

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.700
analyses is you can get item
specific outcomes, right?

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.836
So you can say, for
a specific item,

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.210
how likely it is
to be classified

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.707
as one thing or another?

00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:41.540
And this is where I
started the talk before,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.650
which is that in both of these
cases we think of a hypothesis

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.600
and test it sequentially.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.900
And so the representational
similarity matrix

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.250
tests whole hypothesis spaces
instead of single features.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.710
Classification and
Haxby-style stuff

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.580
are ways to think of a
future or dimension that

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.190
might be represented in a
brain region you care about,

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.497
and test whether or
not it's represented.

00:11:06.497 --> 00:11:08.330
So they're a way of
thinking of a hypothesis

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.788
and testing it, and thinking
of hypothesis and testing it--

00:11:10.788 --> 00:11:12.590
and that's what I
mean by sequentially.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.050
So you can think of,
does the right TPJ

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.970
represent the
difference, for example,

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.130
between Grace poisoning
the person knowingly

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.690
and poisoning the
person unknowingly?

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.090
The answer to that
is yes, it does,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.331
but that's one hypothesis.

00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:26.330
And then we can come up
with another hypothesis,

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.892
and then another hypothesis.

00:11:27.892 --> 00:11:30.350
And what's interesting about
representational dissimilarity

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.280
matrices-- one of the versions
of MVPA people use these days--

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.300
is that it takes a
different approach.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.520
So instead of trying to think
of one hypothesis and test it,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.076
it proposes a hypothesis space
and tests the space as a whole,

00:11:44.076 --> 00:11:45.950
and that gives you both
different sensitivity

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.260
and strengths and
different weaknesses.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.630
So I'll work through an
example in which we did this.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.250
I told you that
I would come back

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.500
to thinking about other
people's feelings,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.800
and in this experiment we
took different kinds of things

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.980
that people could feel as one
subspace of theory of mind.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.050
So our stimuli, in this case,
are 200 stories about people

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.480
having an emotional experience.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.820
And we're going to look at--

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.970
what can we understand about
how your brain represents those

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.960
different--

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.420
your knowledge that lets
you sort out people's

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.950
experiences in those cases.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.510
OK, so it's hard
in the abstract,

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.890
let's do it in the concrete.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.130
So in the behavioral
version of this test

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.350
I give you a list of
20 different emotions--

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.450
jealous, disappointed,
devastated, embarrassed,

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.750
disgusted, guilty, impressed,
proud, excited, hopeful,

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.750
joyful, et cetera-- so you
have 20 different choices.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.030
And I'm going to tell you a
single story about a character

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.030
you don't know, and
something they experienced--

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.200
very briefly--

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.110
and what I want you to think to
yourself is, which emotion did

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.650
they experience in that case?

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.150
OK?

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.230
So here's one.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.780
After an 18 hour flight,
Alice arrived at her vacation

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.030
destination to learn that
her baggage, including

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.347
camping gear for her trip,
hadn't made the flight.

00:12:58.347 --> 00:13:00.180
After waiting at the
airport for two nights,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.430
she was informed that the
airline had lost her luggage

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.460
and wouldn't provide
any compensation.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.340
How many people think
she felt joyful?

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.775
How many people think
that she felt annoyed?

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.533
How about furious?

00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:18.830
OK, so furious is
the modal answer

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.200
and annoyed is the most
likely second choice

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.412
answer to that case.

00:13:23.412 --> 00:13:24.370
Here's a different one.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.984
Sarah swore to her roommate that
she would keep her new diet.

00:13:26.984 --> 00:13:28.400
Later, she was in
the kitchen, she

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.680
took a bite of a cake she had
bought for the dinner party.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.304
When her roommates
arrived home to find

00:13:32.304 --> 00:13:34.940
that she'd eaten half the
cake and broken her diet.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.410
How many people think that
she would feel disgusted?

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.760
Terrified?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.030
Embarrassed?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.530
OK.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.850
And just to give
you a sense of how

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.620
fine grained your
knowledge is in this case,

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.786
think about this difference.

00:13:46.786 --> 00:13:49.280
In this case she swore
she would keep her diet

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.242
and then broke it, right?

00:13:51.242 --> 00:13:52.700
What about the
difference between--

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.290
she first ate a cake and then
swore she would keep her diet.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:55.790
Right?

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.470
That's a totally different
texture to the story.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.970
OK.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.230
So we have incredibly
fine grained knowledge

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.810
of how a description
of a situation

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.697
predicts an overall emotion.

00:14:05.697 --> 00:14:07.530
You can see that in a
behavioral experiment,

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.280
so what I'm showing
you here is--

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.490
on the y-axis the emotion
that we intended when we wrote

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.910
the story-- so ten stories for
each category for 200 stories--

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.580
on the x-axis is the
percent of participants

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.080
picking that label.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.320
And so the first thing is
that 65% of the time, people

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.880
pick the label we attend.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.834
If instead, you ask,
take half the subjects

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:29.750
to determine a modal
answer and the other half

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.125
of the subjects as the test
set, you get the same answer.

00:14:32.125 --> 00:14:35.270
There's about 65% agreement
on the right, single label out

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:35.990
of 20.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.510
That's, of course, way
above chance, which is 5%,

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.460
so people are
quite good at this.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.600
And the off-diagonal
is also meaningful,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.090
so that also contains
information--

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.530
the second best answer, right?

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.640
So annoyed as opposed
to furious, for example.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.700
OK, so that's a huge
amount of rich knowledge

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.130
about other people's experiences
from these very brief

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.490
descriptions of events to a
very fine grained classification

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.520
of which emotion
they're experiencing.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.440
And one way to
look at these data

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.920
is to ask, OK, well, that's
knowledge that we have--

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.620
where is that
knowledge in the brain?

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.536
That's sort of a first
question you could ask,

00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:15.810
and you could ask it by just
saying, if we try to use--

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.470
so in this case, we're
going to do train and test.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:23.050
So we train a classifier
on a patch of cortex,

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.800
based on five examples
from each condition,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.410
and then we test on the
remaining half of the data.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.160
And we just ask, based on the
pattern of activity in a patch

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.960
can you get above
chance classification

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.654
in the independent data?

00:15:37.654 --> 00:15:39.820
For every patch where that's
true we put a, sort of,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.010
bright mark, and then
ask, where in the brain

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.050
is the relevant
decoding that would

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.020
let you be above chance
on this distinction?

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.285
The answer is in exactly
the same brain regions

00:15:50.285 --> 00:15:52.160
that I have been talking
about and showed you

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.150
before, that is where there's
above chance classification,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.570
and then overlaid on the
standard belief versus photo

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.950
task in green.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.230
So within the brain
regions involved

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.240
in theory of mind
or social cognition

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.330
are the brain regions that
can above chance classify

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.970
in this 20 way distinction.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.090
And then this is just looking
inside each one of those.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.650
Inside each of the regions--

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.750
that's four of the
regions in that group

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.280
that I showed you before--

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.351
you can do above--

00:16:19.351 --> 00:16:21.850
with using just the pattern of
activity in that brain region

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.820
you can do above chance
classification on this 20 way

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.050
distinction.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.120
And there's a hint
that that information

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.274
is somewhat non-redundant,
because if you combine

00:16:30.274 --> 00:16:31.690
information across
all of them you

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.020
do slightly better than if
you use any one of them alone.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.960
OK, so now the
question is, how can we

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.150
study what knowledge
is represented

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.510
in each of these brain regions?

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.010
Right?

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.790
So we know that there's some
information about that 20 way

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.690
classification, but
can we learn anything

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.540
about the representation of
emotions in those brain regions

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.550
using fMRI?

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.660
And that's where the
representation dissimilarity

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.100
matrices come in as a strategy.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.840
OK, so the question
is, how might you

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.910
represent the
knowledge that you have

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.150
of what Alice is experiencing,
for example, in this story?

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.690
What's a possible hypothesis?

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.130
And the way representational
dissimilarity matrices

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.950
work as a strategy
for fMRI analyses

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.510
is that what you
should do is think

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.170
of multiple different hypotheses
about how that knowledge could

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.880
be represented.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.329
So a first hypothesis, which
is deep in the literature

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.183
on emotions, is that we
represent other people's

00:17:32.183 --> 00:17:36.670
emotional experience in terms
of two fundamental dimensions

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.061
of emotional experience--
valence and arousal.

00:17:39.061 --> 00:17:40.810
Have you guys heard
of valence and arousal

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:41.740
as the two fundamental--

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.250
OK.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.350
So this hypothesis says, when
we think about emotions--

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.750
our own or other people--

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.300
we put emotions in a
two dimensional space,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.450
which is, how good or
bad did it make you feel,

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.900
and how intense was it?

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.400
OK.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.020
So terrified is negative
and very intense.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.610
Lonely is negative,
but not that intense.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.110
Right?

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.820
That's the idea.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.550
Happy is positive
and somewhat intense.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.020
Thrilled is happy
and more intense.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.470
So that idea is that there's
these two basic dimensions

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.260
of emotional experience,
and so one thing we can do

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.880
is have each of
our stories, like

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.709
this one-- we can have
people tell us in that story

00:18:19.709 --> 00:18:21.250
was she feeling
positive or negative?

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.865
How positive or negative,
and how intensely?

00:18:23.865 --> 00:18:25.240
And so, for each
individual story

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.800
we can have a representation
of it as a point in that space.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.967
And if you use just that, you
can classify our 200 stories

00:18:33.967 --> 00:18:35.800
reasonably well-- not
as well as people can,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.430
but still reasonably well.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:40.060
OK, so the 200 stories
do clump into lumps

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.210
in that two dimensional space.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.630
But another idea is
that valence and arousal

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:51.210
seem not to capture the full
texture of the 20 categories

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.210
that we originally have.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.160
It's not that we can't
embed 20 categories

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.690
in two dimensions--
you obviously

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.940
can have 20 clusters in
a two dimensional space.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.626
But we had the intuition that
it's not a two dimensional

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:03.250
space-- that those
two dimensions don't

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.200
capture all the features
that people have

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.370
and know about when
they use the stimuli.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.400
And so, based on
another literature

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.860
called appraisal theory--

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.220
what we tried to do is capture
some of the abstract knowledge

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.460
that people have about these
situations that lets them

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.190
identify which emotion it is.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.680
And we did that by
having them rate

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.770
each of these stories on a bunch
of abstract event features.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.160
So those event features
are things like--

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.630
was this situation
caused by a person

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.106
or some other external force.

00:19:33.106 --> 00:19:34.480
So I hope you guys
have the sense

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.813
that if your luggage gets
lost on your way to the trip--

00:19:36.813 --> 00:19:38.860
it's different if that
was airline incompetence

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.190
versus a tornado, right?

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.270
Does everybody have
that intuition?

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.190
The emotion is different.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.689
OK.

00:19:42.689 --> 00:19:44.440
So that's an important
abstract feature

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.880
of our knowledge
of other people.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.560
Was it caused by you yourself?

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.200
If you left your
luggage at home,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.700
that's different from if airline
incompetence caused you not

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.574
to have your luggage.

00:19:52.574 --> 00:19:54.779
And does it refer to
something in her past?

00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:56.320
Is she interacting
with other people?

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.850
That makes a really big
difference, for example,

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.891
in pride and embarrassment--
whether other people

00:19:59.891 --> 00:20:01.390
are around.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.400
How will it affect her
future relationships?

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.161
So things that potentially cause
harm to future relationships

00:20:06.161 --> 00:20:08.410
feel very different from
things that are just annoying

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.940
right now but will end.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.900
So these are abstract features
and they encapsulate things

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.630
we know about emotion relevant
features of the situations

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.160
people find themselves in.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.440
So we came up with
42 of these and we

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.380
had every story rated on
all of those dimensions.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.080
And of course, we can,
again, classify the stories

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.080
as 20 clusters in a 42
dimensional space, right?

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.730
Again, of course we can.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.310
But the question is
[INAUDIBLE] this is those data.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.060
This is just every set of
10 stories and their average

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.370
rating on our-- oh, 38--

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.510
on our 38 appraisal
features, so that

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.840
creates a 38 dimensional space.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.130
Here the idea is--

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.800
for each category-- like, for
all the stories about being

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.480
jealous--

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.810
you can get-- for, let's
say, for the two dimensions

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.510
of valence and arousal--
the average value of valence

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.414
and the average value
of arousal, right?

00:20:57.414 --> 00:20:59.330
So that's a point in a
two dimensional space--

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.010
the stories about being jealous.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.930
OK.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.210
Then you take the stories
about being terrified.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.320
What's their
valence and arousal?

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.740
So that's another point in
a two dimensional space.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.410
And then you take the
distance between them,

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.750
and that number goes in a
representational dissimilarity

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.600
matrix.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.600
So the further away you
are in a two dimensional

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.044
space, the more dissimilar.

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:21.460
And you could do the same thing
in a 42 dimensional space,

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.334
a 38 dimensional space,
any dimensional space

00:21:23.334 --> 00:21:26.960
you want-- what you need to know
is just how far away you are.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.890
And so what a representational
dissimilarity matrix has in it

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.950
is for every pair.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.910
So the jealous stories
versus the grateful stories--

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.760
the number in that
cell is the distance

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.810
from the mean
position in your space

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.040
of all the jealous stories to
the mean position in your space

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.780
of all the grateful stories.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.660
Does that make sense?

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.390
And that could be true
of any dimensionality.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.310
When you know
these 38 features--

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.990
so this is behavioral data--

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.470
when you know the 38
features of these emotions,

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.280
the green bar is how well you
can classify new items, just

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:00.850
behaviorally.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.800
So if I give you a
new item and all I

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.962
tell you is it's value
in these 38 dimensions,

00:22:05.962 --> 00:22:07.420
how well can you
tell me back which

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.280
emotion category it comes from?

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.310
The best you could
possibly do is 65%,

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.440
because that's what human
observers do in all of our--

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.255
so the reality is
the human observers--

00:22:17.255 --> 00:22:18.880
the features come
from human observers,

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.340
so our ceiling's
going to be 65%,

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.280
and the answer is about 55%.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:23.860
OK.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.330
And you can take that
in two different ways.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.860
One tendency is to
say, wow, we know

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.210
a lot of the key features that
go into emotion attribution.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.040
I think, Amy, who I
did this work with,

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.840
had a tendency to feel that way.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.661
And I think, wow, we
thought of 38 things

00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:42.910
and we still didn't think
of all the important things.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.530
Like, what are
those other things

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.360
that we didn't think
of that explain

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.520
the rest of the variation?

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.895
So you could feel either way
about this, but in any case,

00:22:49.895 --> 00:22:53.020
once you know the position of
one of these stories in the 38

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.120
dimensional space
of these features,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.230
you know a lot about which
emotion category it came from.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.750
And then this is the correlation
to the neural RDM data

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.500
that I showed you.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.083
And so, again, what I showed you
is, so observer's knowledge--

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:08.120
that's everything that we know
that lets us classify a story.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.000
Valence and arousal
is the yellow bar--

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.100
that's just these two
features of the story,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.683
and they're both less good than
this intermediate thing, which

00:23:14.683 --> 00:23:16.330
is the 38 dimensional space.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.980
And one question is,
like, do I really

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.390
think it's 38 dimensions?

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.380
No, definitely not.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.290
That was just the set of all the
things that we could think of.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.480
How many dimensions
is it, really?

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.930
Again, I don't know,
really, but I can tell you

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.570
that the best ten
dimensions capture

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.550
most of the information
from the 38 dimensions.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.730
So what we've
discovered so far is

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.697
ten really important dimensions
of your knowledge of emotion.

00:23:39.697 --> 00:23:42.280
I don't, again, think that means
that our knowledge of emotion

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.450
is ten dimensional.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.090
Lots of this is limited
by the set of stimuli

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.880
that we chose, the resolution
of the data that we have,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.510
and so forth and so on.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.540
But in these data
you need something

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.790
on the order of ten
dimensions to get

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.950
close to human
performance or close

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:03.250
to the genuinely differential
signal in the neural data.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.400
If you take one thing away from
this talk about the methods

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.470
used in representational
dissimilarity matrix--

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.040
really only one thing.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.980
Here's the one thing
I want you to know--

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.990
the dimensionality
of the theory that

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.600
generated your representational
dissimilarity matrix

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.480
does nothing for you in
the fit to your data.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.590
Nothing at all.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.410
It's a parameter-free fit.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.020
OK?

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.800
So anybody to whom those
words mean anything,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.185
this will be important, so I
want you to actually know this.

00:24:30.185 --> 00:24:31.810
Representational
dissimilarity matrices

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.546
provide a parameter-free
fit to the data,

00:24:34.546 --> 00:24:35.920
and therefore,
the dimensionality

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.740
of the theory that generated the
representational dissimilarity

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.224
matrix has nothing to do
with the fit of the data.

00:24:43.224 --> 00:24:45.640
You can probably notice I
should have ordered this better.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.599
Valance has two
dimensions, the observers

00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:48.640
has a lot of dimensions--

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.560
I don't know how many,
but a lot more than 38.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.510
We know that because 38
doesn't explain all their data.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.700
So as you go up in--
and in principle,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.160
having more dimensions
doesn't help in the set.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.740
You can correctly see that they
overfit rather than fitting

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.330
the data, and here's why.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.070
Because the way you build a
representational dissimilarity

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.590
matrix is, out of no matter
how many dimensions you

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.680
have in your data set for
every pair of stimuli,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.280
you take one number, and then a
representational dissimilarity

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.360
matrix encodes the relationships
among those numbers.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.200
OK?

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.280
So jealousy is more similar to
irritation than it is to pride.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.460
By how much?

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.410
OK?

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.250
And those relative
differences is all you have.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.820
You have nothing else, and
so there's no parameters.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.600
Right?

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.810
You have the same
amount of information

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.560
in a representational
dissimilarity matrix

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.851
that you generated from a
one dimensional theory, a two

00:25:44.851 --> 00:25:46.340
dimensional theory,
a 38 dimension

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.145
theory, and an infinite
dimensional theory.

00:25:48.145 --> 00:25:50.270
The size of the theory
doesn't make any difference,

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.720
because what you get in the
end is exactly the same thing--

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.160
the relative distance between
every two points in the set.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.460
There's a few things
to say about--

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.330
so one thing to say about the
representational dissimilarity

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.490
analysis that I
just showed you is

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:11.330
that it tells you that the
38 dimensional theory is

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:12.985
better than the valence theory.

00:26:12.985 --> 00:26:14.360
Like, the event
feature theory is

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.260
better than the valence theory,
but it doesn't tell you why.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:18.860
Right?

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.010
It doesn't tell you whether any
specific one of those features

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.190
is capturing variance in any
specific one of those regions.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.010
It tells you that that
whole set was better

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.020
than this other whole
set, and maybe this

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.144
is where you're getting at.

00:26:31.144 --> 00:26:35.000
It's much less good for trying
post-hoc things for saying,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.630
but why?

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.390
Which aspect of that
theory was better

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.460
than the valence and arousal?

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.650
It gives you an all
things considered answer,

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.020
not a dimension specific answer.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.780
That's one thing that is
a limit in the way you

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.960
should use representational
dissimilarity analyses.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.890
There's two key
problems that I think

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:02.120
bear reflecting on about
MVPA, and one of them

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.070
is a catastrophe
and the other one

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.304
is an incredibly deep puzzle.

00:27:07.304 --> 00:27:08.720
And I think I
should just say them

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.885
right away before you get
too excited, because all

00:27:10.885 --> 00:27:12.260
of this stuff was
really exciting

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.970
and now I'm going to tell you
a catastrophe and a puzzle.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.060
Here's the catastrophe.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.880
The catastrophe
is that you can't

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.700
make anything of null results.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.560
OK, now, here's why.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.660
Because when I say that
you can decode something

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.400
from an MVPA
analysis, what I mean

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.050
is that at the scale
of voxels, there's

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.850
some signal in terms
of which voxels

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.700
relatively higher or
relatively lower in response

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.340
to the stimuli.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:35.840
Right?

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.750
So in voxel space or in spatial
space, whichever one of those

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.010
you find helpful--

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.820
if that at the level of voxels
we could cluster these stimuli.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.800
And what that says is
that they are something

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.500
like distinct populations
in this region,

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.819
responding across that
feature dimension,

00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:53.360
and they're spatially segregated
enough that we could pick up

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.145
on them with fMRI.

00:27:55.145 --> 00:27:57.020
But who cares if they're
spatially segregated

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.353
enough that we could pick up
with them with fMRI, right?

00:27:59.353 --> 00:28:01.550
fMRI is the scale
of a millimeter.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.340
And there could be
many, many, many things

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.290
that are represented by
populations of neurons

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.800
within a region that are
not spatially organized

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.220
at the scale of a millimeter.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.620
Not only could there be--

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.032
there absolutely,
definitely are.

00:28:13.032 --> 00:28:14.990
There's a whole bunch of
things that we already

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.420
know are really
important properties

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.619
of neural representations
of things we care about,

00:28:19.619 --> 00:28:21.410
and we know that their
spatial scale is not

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.599
high enough that they can
be picked up on with fMRI.

00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:25.640
So two cases that I'll
tell you about because you

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.940
should care about them--

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.160
one is face responses in
the middle temporal region

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.090
that Doris and Winrich study
for face representations

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.130
in monkeys.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.085
It's one of the middle ones.

00:28:39.085 --> 00:28:41.210
In that one there's face
features that can tell you

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.370
how far apart the
pupils are, how high

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.130
the eyebrows are-- did Winrich
show you this amazing data?

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.700
Totally, amazing, beautiful,
feature space of face identity

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.780
representation?

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.150
One of the most strikingly
beautiful things I've

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.170
ever seen.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.360
And he already knows--

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.620
he and Doris already know--

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.960
that there's no
spatial relationship

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.740
at all between the property
that one neuron signals

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.330
and it's distance
from other neurons

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.538
that signal other properties.

00:29:06.538 --> 00:29:08.352
There's no spatial
organization at all.

00:29:08.352 --> 00:29:10.310
So if you know that right
here is a neuron that

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:14.150
responds to eye width, you know
nothing more about the neuron

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.490
next to its preferred
property than a neuron

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:17.390
a centimeter away.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.165
There's no spatial structure to
which feature I give a neuron

00:29:21.165 --> 00:29:24.890
response to, which means
that you absolutely could not

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.930
and cannot pick up on that in
fMRI, which Doris has shown.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.320
This feature structure
information cannot be picked up

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.491
on with fMRI, even though it
is there and really important.

00:29:34.491 --> 00:29:36.740
Another example is valence
and coding in the amygdala.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.364
The amygdala contains
some neurons that

00:29:38.364 --> 00:29:39.980
respond to positively
valenced events

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.530
and other neurons that respond
to negatively valenced events,

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.510
and they are as
spatially interleaved

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:47.130
as physically possible-- that's
what Kay Tye's data shows.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:49.130
You couldn't get them
more spatially interleaved

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.750
than they are.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.090
They are as close together as
the size of the neurons allow.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.430
So you absolutely will
never be able to decode

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.890
with fMRI in those population--
the amygdala-- that there

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.098
are different populations
for positive and negatively

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:02.120
valenced events, but there are.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:02.750
OK.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:05.900
So that means that when you see
something in fMRI it's probably

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.790
there, but when you
don't see it in fMRI

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.410
you don't know that
it's not there.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.715
And the reason why that's
a total catastrophe

00:30:11.715 --> 00:30:14.180
is if it means that when I
tell you that a region codes

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.420
A and not B--

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.130
I don't know that
it doesn't code B.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.440
And when I tell you the
region that this thing is

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.935
coded in region A and it's
not coded in region B--

00:30:22.935 --> 00:30:25.290
I don't know that it's
not coded in region B.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.340
So I can never show you
a double dissociation.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.131
I can never show you
a single dissociation.

00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:30.930
I can never show you
a dissociation at all.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.780
All I can say for sure
is that the spatial scale

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.000
of the information is different
between one region and another,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.434
or between one piece of
information and another,

00:30:39.434 --> 00:30:41.850
and we have no reason to believe
that that matters at all.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:42.349
Right?

00:30:42.349 --> 00:30:44.970
Really important things are
encoded at very fine spatial

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:45.748
scales.

00:30:45.748 --> 00:30:47.956
And so any time I tell you--
which I told you a bunch

00:30:47.956 --> 00:30:49.770
of times because I
think it's really cool--

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.920
that there's a difference in
what feature is encoded where,

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.390
you have no reason
to believe me.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:55.910
And that's the catastrophe.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:56.980
It's a total catastrophe.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.510
If you can't make distinctions,
you can't make any conclusions

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.680
at all.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.810
I'll just briefly
say the other thing

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.490
that's a problem
with this, which

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.500
is that this idea of
similarity space--

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.310
the idea that you should think
of a concept, like jealous,

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.349
as a point in a
multidimensional space,

00:31:13.349 --> 00:31:15.390
and what it means to think
of somebody as jealous

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.670
is to think of them
as a certain distance

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.550
from irritated and angry
and proud and impressed--

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.520
that idea has been
thoroughly undermined

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.180
in psychology and psychophysics
and computational cognition.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.150
It's really a bad
theory of concepts.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.930
It can't do any of the work that
concepts are supposed to do.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.520
One of the most important
things they can't do

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.353
is compositionality.

00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:38.440
It can't explain the
way concepts compose,

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.110
which is absolutely critical
to the way that we think

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.790
and even more critical
to the way that we think

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.950
about other people's minds,
because every thought you have

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:45.510
about somebody
else's mental state

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.480
is a composition of an agent,
a mental state, and a content.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.650
And so, this whole way of
thinking about concepts

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.350
as points in
multi-dimensional spaces

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.560
works, but shouldn't work.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.800
And that's the other problem
with this whole endeavor.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.890
OK.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.390
There's a bunch of
things that we're

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.459
doing with this that I
will just briefly mention

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:10.750
in case people want to think
about it or know about it.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.480
The two things I'm really
excited about-- one

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.040
is adding temporal
information, so looking

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.410
at the change in information
in brain regions over time,

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.100
and how they
influence one another.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.480
And that's my post-doc
Stefano Anzellotti's project.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.849
And another thing that I'm
excited about is that--

00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:25.890
to the degree that you
take these positive claims

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.389
as something interesting, which
I actually still do in spite

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:31.099
of all my end of
the world talk--

00:32:31.099 --> 00:32:32.640
one thing that I
think is really neat

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.380
is the idea of increasingly
differentiable representational

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.070
spaces.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.240
So two sets of stimuli
that produce clusters

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.920
that are not separable--

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.080
for example, in voxel
or neural space--

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.180
and making them
increasingly distinct.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.890
So Jim DiCarlo calls this
unfolding a manifold.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:51.390
Right?

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.880
That idea, which is
Jim DiCarlo's model

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.030
of the successive processing
in stages from V1 to V2

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.034
to V4 to IT--

00:32:59.034 --> 00:33:00.450
I think that's a
really cool model

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.870
of conceptual development.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.570
That what you might
have is originally

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.640
neural responses that
can't separate stimuli

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.530
along some interesting
dimension-- that

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:10.200
unfold that
representational space

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.560
to make them more dissimilar
as you get that concept more--

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.140
or that dimension or
feature of the stimuli

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.060
more distinctively represented.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.680
And so we've tried
a first version

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.170
of this with justification--

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.660
so kids between age seven
and 12 get better and better

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.284
at distinguishing
people's beliefs that

00:33:26.284 --> 00:33:27.630
have good and bad evidence.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.490
And we've shown that
that's correlated

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.950
with a neural signature
in the right TPJ getting

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.880
more and more distinct over that
same time and those same kids.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.660
And so I think thinking of
representational dissimilarity

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.840
as a model of conceptual
change, while certainly wrong,

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.369
is probably really powerful,
and I'm very excited about it.

00:33:46.369 --> 00:33:47.910
And the last thing
I will do is thank

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.210
the people who did the work,
especially everybody in my lab,

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.760
and two PhD students--

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.600
Jorie Koster-Hale and
Amy Skerry and you guys.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.470
Thank you.

DENIS GOROKHOV: So I
work at Morgan Stanley.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.630
I run corporate treasury
strategies at Morgan Stanley.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.580
So corporate treasury
is the business unit

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.195
that is responsible for
issuing and risk management

00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:35.500
of Morgan Stanley debt.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.770
I also run desk strategies own
the New York inflation desk.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.100
That's the business which is
a part of the global interest

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.970
rate business, which is
responsible for trading

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.870
derivatives linked to inflation.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.560
And today, I'm going to
talk about the HJM model.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.600
So HJM model-- the abbreviation
stands for Heath-Jarrow-Morton,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.730
these three individuals who
discovered this framework

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.620
in the beginning of 1990s.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.580
And this is a very
general framework

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.180
for pricing derivatives to
interest rates and to credit.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.290
So on Wall Street, big banks
make a substantial amount

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.090
of money by trading all
kinds of exotic products,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.190
exotic derivatives.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.130
And big banks like
Morgan Stanley,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.130
like Goldman, JP Morgan--
trades thousands and thousands

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.670
of different types of
exotic derivatives.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.440
So a typical problem
which the business faces

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.570
is that new types of
derivatives arrive all the time.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.470
So you need to be able
to respond quickly

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.030
to the demand from the clients.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.360
And you need to be
able not just to tell

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.700
the price of derivative.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.240
You need to be able also to
risk manage this derivative.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.280
Because let's say if
you sold an option,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.090
you've got some
premium, if something

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.990
goes not in your favor,
you need to pay in the end.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.550
So you need to be able to hedge.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.590
And you can think
about the HJM model,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.890
like this kind of
framework, as something

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.590
which is similar to theoretical
physics in a way, right?

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.000
So you get beautiful models--
it's like a solvable model.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.600
For example, let's
say the hydrogen atom

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.430
in quantum mechanics.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.890
So it's relatively
straightforward to solve it,

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.660
right?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.810
So we have an equation,
which can be exactly solved.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.975
And we can find energy
levels and understand this

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:43.600
fairly quickly.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.330
But if you start going into more
complex problems-- for example,

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.970
you add one more
electron and you

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.090
have a helium atom-- it's
already much more complicated.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.170
And then if you have complicated
atoms or even molecules,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.620
it's unclear what to do.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.540
So people came up
with approximate kind

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.150
of methods, which allow
nevertheless solve everything

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.070
very accurately numerically.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.400
And HJM is a similar framework.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.050
So you can-- it allows
to price all kinds

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.920
of [INAUDIBLE] derivatives.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.150
And so it's very general.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.450
It's very flexible to
incorporate new payoffs,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.010
all kinds of correlation between
products and so on, so forth.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.130
And this HJM model--
[INAUDIBLE] natural [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.830
more general framework like
Monte Carlo simulation.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.135
And before actually
going into details

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:49.610
of pricing exotic interest
rates and credit derivatives,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.190
let me just first explain
how this framework appears

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.420
in the most common type
of derivatives, basically

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.400
equity-linked product.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.610
So like a very, very
simple example, right?

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.580
So let's say if we have a
derivatives desk at some firm,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.680
and they sell all
kinds of products.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.720
Of course, ideally,
let's say there's

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.740
a client who wants to
buy something from you.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.480
Of course, the easiest approach
would be to find the client

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.790
and do an opposite transaction
with him, so that you're market

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.695
neutral, at least in theory.

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.070
So if you don't
take into account

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.290
counterparties and so on.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.740
However, it's rather
difficult in general,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.590
so the portfolios
are very complicated.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.170
And there's always
some residual risk.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.700
So this is the cause
of dynamic hedging.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.660
So for this example,
very simple example,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.350
a dealer just sold a
call option on a stock.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.800
And if you do this,
then in principle,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.050
the amount of money which
you can lose is unlimited.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.010
So you need to be able
to hedge dynamically

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.980
by trading underlying,
for example, in this case.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.460
So just a brief
illustration of the stock

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:14.110
markets, you see how random it
has been for the last 20 years

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.800
or so.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.150
So first of all, this
year, some kind of--

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.790
from beginnings of the
1990s to around 2000,

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.500
we see really very
sharp increase.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.950
And then we have dot-com
bubble, and then we

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.470
have the bank
[INAUDIBLE] of 2008.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.820
And if you trade derivatives
whose payoff depends,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.476
for example, on
the FTSE 100 index,

00:05:38.476 --> 00:05:39.600
you should be very careful.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.100
All right?

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.250
Because market can drop,
and you need to be hedged.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.370
So you need to be able to come
with some kind of good models

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.380
which can recalibrate
to the markets

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:59.920
and which can truly risk
manage your position.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.970
So the so the general idea
of pricing derivatives

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:14.460
is that one starts from
some stochastic process.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:23.240
So in this example here, it's
probably like the simplest

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.140
possible-- nevertheless a
very instructive-- model,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.050
which is essentially like
these [INAUDIBLE] Black-Scholes

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:39.710
formalism, which is where we
have the stock, which follows

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.390
the log-normal dynamics.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.370
I have a question.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.350
Do you have a pointer
somewhere, or not?

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.950
It's just easier-- OK, OK.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.900
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.830
There's also a pen here,
where you can use this.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.300
DENIS GOROKHOV: Oh, I see.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.020
PROFESSOR: Have you
used this before?

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.210
You press the color here
that you want to use, say,

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.138
and then you can draw.

00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:18.697
You press on the screen.

00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:19.780
DENIS GOROKHOV: Oh, I see.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.400
Excellent.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.320
That's even better.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:30.070
OK, so it seems like the
market is very random.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.750
We need to be able to come up
with some kind of dynamics.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.460
And it turns out that
the log-normal dynamics

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.630
is a very reasonable
first approximation

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.150
for the actual dynamics.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.180
So in this example, we have
stochastic differential

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.300
equation for the stock price.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.390
And it consists-- it's
the sum of two terms.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.040
This is a drift, it's some
kind of deterministic part

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.380
of the stock price dynamics.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.750
And here, also,
we have diffusion.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:10.940
So here, dB is the Brownian
motion driving the stock,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.540
and S is the price
of the stock here.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.780
Mu is the drift.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.710
And sigma is the
volatility of the stock.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.660
Particularly, it
shows the randomness.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.050
And it's the randomness
impact on the stock price.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:37.539
And using this model, one
can derive the Black-Scholes

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.090
formula.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.510
And the Black-Scholes
formula shows

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:47.990
how to price derivatives
whose payoff depends

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.950
on the price of the stock.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.420
So here, if you look at
this differential equation,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.840
then you can answer
the question.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.260
Let's say if you started
from some initial value

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.290
for the stock at time t.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:11.440
And then we started the clock.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.730
Which are now to be
at time capital T.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:21.167
And given that time T,
then stock price is S_T.

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:22.750
So what's the
probability distribution

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.200
for the stock at time T?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:33.820
So this kind of equation
can be very easily solved.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:42.130
And one can obtain analytically
the probability distribution

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.530
function at any
[INAUDIBLE] moment of time.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.010
So I mean, I just think
I'll write a few equations,

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.180
because it's very important
to understand this.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.650
So I'm sure you probably
have seen something like this

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.630
already, but let me just
show you the main ideas

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.280
beyond this formula.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.060
So if you have a
random process--

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.200
let's say A is some process,
stochastic process, which

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:10.890
is normal.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.290
So it follows some drift.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:18.831
Plus some volatility term.

00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:19.330
Right?

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.610
So the difference
between this equation

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.370
is that I don't multiply
by A here and A here.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:31.330
Especially, it's much
simpler to solve.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.720
So the solution
for this equation

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.930
is very straightforward.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:39.604
So at any moment of time T,
if you start at moment 0,

00:10:39.604 --> 00:10:42.020
the solution of the equation
would be something like this.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.603
Drift-- right?

00:10:42.603 --> 00:10:44.150
I'm simply integrating.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:51.450
Plus-- and I assume that B of
t is standard Brownian motion,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.950
so at time 0, it's 0.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:01.680
And then it's very
easy to see now that...

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.690
is equal to the Brownian motion.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.100
But this is nothing else.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:21.420
It's some random number,
which is normally distributed,

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.280
times square root of time.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.561
So epsilon is
proportional to it.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.570
OK, so basically, this
means that this is normally

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.750
distributed.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:41.730
And its-- and probability
distribution for this quantity

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.240
is equal to-- we know
it's exactly, right,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.975
because this is like a
standard Gaussian distribution.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:58.410
And if you simply
substitute A into here,

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:02.520
then you will obtain the
probability distribution

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.260
for the actual quantity.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.420
And I'll just write it
for the completeness.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.770
So basically, we obtain
probability distribution

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:25.020
for the standard variable.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.390
So this is straightforward.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.910
So the only difference between
the case I'm doing here

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.100
is that the dynamics is
assumed to be log-normal.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.600
Right?

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.660
And the interpretation
is very simple.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.190
If it's normal, then
the price of the stock

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.912
can become negative.

00:12:39.912 --> 00:12:41.370
Which is just a
financial nonsense.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.470
So the [INAUDIBLE]
log-normal dynamics basically

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:48.570
is a good first approximation.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.040
And in this case, what
helps as a result is just

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.740
known as Ito's lemma.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.595
So I just first of all
write it, and then I

00:12:54.595 --> 00:12:57.590
will explain how
you can obtain it.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.590
And if you look
at this equation--

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:07.030
let me write it once again--
which is basically the drift

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:17.780
plus-- then it turns out
that, of course, since--- it--

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:26.080
intuitively it's clear that the
dynamics of logarithm of S is--

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:32.010
dynamic of logarithm
of S is normal.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.654
So essentially, we obtain
something like this.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:51.360
So if you now substitute
this into this,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.035
you locked in a
very simple formula.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.540
OK, so here, I used
the result, which

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.230
is known as Ito's lemma, which
I'm going to explain right now.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:17.290
Like how it was
obtained-- basically,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:22.580
it tells us that when we
differentiate the function

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.240
of a stochastic variable.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.800
Then besides the trivial
term, which is basically

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.145
the first derivative
times dS, there's

00:14:29.145 --> 00:14:31.200
an additional term,
which is proportional

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.740
to the second derivative.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.280
And it's non-stochastic, so
I'll explain why it's this.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.300
But if you do it-- if you
look at this equation,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.190
then you see essentially
this formula.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.560
It's very, very similar
to this formula.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.580
The only difference now is that
alpha is just mu minus one half

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.060
of sigma squared.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.520
So that's a how, if you
iteratively use this solution,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.390
and simply substitute
A by log S,

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.150
you will come to this equation.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.860
So this is very important.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:15.447
So it's a very important
effect, like-- yes?

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:17.322
AUDIENCE: The fact that
it can't be negative,

00:15:17.322 --> 00:15:21.120
does that exclude
certain possibilities?

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.810
When there's a normal Gaussian,
can go negative or positive?

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:30.094
DENIS GOROKHOV: Yes, but stock--
from a financial point of view,

00:15:30.094 --> 00:15:31.260
stock cannot be a liability.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:31.990
Right?

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.170
You buy a stock.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.110
This means basically,
you pay some money.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.250
And you have basically
some sort of, say, option

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.750
on the profit of the company.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.950
So they can't charge
you by default.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.034
So it can't go
negative for the stock.

00:15:47.034 --> 00:15:48.450
Also, in principle,
there might be

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:53.070
derivatives, which can be both
positive or negative payoff,

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.375
but not the stock.

00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:58.260
So it's fundamental
financial restriction.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.230
So very important thing.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.930
So if you talk about the stock
dynamics and Black-Scholes

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.455
formalism, it's very
important that the probability

00:16:07.455 --> 00:16:10.520
distribution for the stock
can be found exactly.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.632
And I'll just
[INAUDIBLE] very briefly

00:16:12.632 --> 00:16:14.590
go, again, through the
Black-Scholes formalism,

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.140
it's very important
just for understanding.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.640
And I believe there are a couple
of things which, at least when

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.040
I was studying this, it
was not very clear to me,

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.340
so I want to go to
some more detail.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:32.840
So basically, here,
this derivation

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.160
is almost like every textbook.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.300
So the idea is that there
is a very fundamental result

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.490
in stochastic calculus.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.900
That if you have a
stochastic function, function

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.240
of stochastic variable
S and time, then

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.950
its differential can be
written as the following form.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.660
So this is all
very clear, right?

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.250
This is standard calculus?

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.960
It's straightforward.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.450
But there is an additional term
that looks a bit suspicious.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.990
And I will explain
what it actually

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.550
means on the next slide.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.640
So a very important thing is
that when you calculate dC,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.310
then you will obtain
deterministic term which

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.869
is proportional to
the second derivative.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:21.416
And you see, there is no-- the
fact is that you have here dt,

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.790
basically this looks like it's
an additional contribution

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.869
to the drift.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.750
We view this as drift,
and this is a drift.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.937
And there is no, any
more, stochasticity.

00:17:29.937 --> 00:17:30.770
It's very important.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.980
This is like a crucial fact
beyond the Black-Scholes

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:38.030
formalism and the Monte
Carlo method in finance.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.090
And then, the idea, you
can read, for example,

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.990
in Hull's book,
its standard proof.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:53.050
So if we issue an option,
then we hedge it--

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:57.090
by having a certain
position in the underlying.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.370
So the idea is like this.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.860
Let's say I sold a call
option of the stock.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.500
So when the stock market
goes, up I make some money.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.820
And then, in the same
time, I short the stock,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.520
so I lose money on my hedge.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.290
And wherever the market goes,
I don't make or lose money.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.750
So that's the idea,
basically, beyond hedging.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.830
And basically, what
happens if I calculate

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.990
the change in my
portfolio, then since there

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.380
is no risk involved, I
assume I am perfectly hedged.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.420
Then I simply obtain
the risk-free return.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.820
So r here is the
risk-free interest rate.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:48.450
So if you simply
look at this equation

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.150
and substitute the
Ito's lemma result here,

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.830
then you obtain like a
very simple equation,

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.710
which is basically
Black-Scholes differential

00:18:55.710 --> 00:19:00.490
equation for the stock--
for the price of the option.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.650
So this equation is
very fundamental.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.160
And it's very elegant.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.790
So you can see although
originally, right,

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.986
if you started from something
with some arbitrary risk,

00:19:17.986 --> 00:19:20.190
with some arbitrary drift mu.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.690
Right?

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.440
Which is basically--
it could be anything.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:28.370
Which is that this drift mu
drops out of the equation.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:33.120
And it depends on
the interest rate.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.350
And this is a very
interesting fact.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:49.040
So and this very interesting
fact has to do with hedging.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.910
Again, you have
position in an option,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.610
and you have an opposite
position in underlying.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.350
And that's how the
drift disappears.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.710
If you look at the movement
of both the positions,

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.670
then you see that there that
the drift will disappear.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.500
So it's a very important
and striking fact.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:14.700
And the second thing,
which is truly a miracle,

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.670
is that risk is
eliminated completely.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.170
So this equation has
absolutely no stochasticity.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.410
So you can just solve it.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.290
If you specify
the option payoff,

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.630
and if you know your
volatility, which

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:33.480
is a measure of your-- basically
often how the stock fluctuates.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.700
And if you know the
risk-free interest rate,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.000
you can just price the options.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.750
And this is a true
miracle that occurs.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.180
And when I was studying
this, I couldn't really

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.890
understand this--
maybe because I

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.600
was coming from
theoretical physics,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:51.690
and all this result called
Ito's lemma is buried somewhere

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.605
in stochastic calculus.

00:20:55.605 --> 00:20:57.855
And I would just try to
understand in [INAUDIBLE] what

00:20:57.855 --> 00:20:59.070
it all means.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.890
And let them just
explain here, basically

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.920
how one can understand
this result, Ito's lemma,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.941
in a very simple term.

00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:09.690
[INAUDIBLE] terms.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.370
So let me just write--
let me remind you.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.220
So Ito's lemma basically tells
the following-- once again,

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:19.040
so if C is the function
of stochastic variables,

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.360
of stochastic variable
S, then its differential

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.060
is not just equal to some
standard result from calculus.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:33.890
But we also get some kind
of very exotic term, which

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:39.770
is basically very nontrivial.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.050
And let me just try to explain
to you how actually it appears.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.900
So just to understand
this, I recommend everybody

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.760
after this lecture,
look at this derivation,

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.510
because it really explains
what this Ito's lemma means.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.710
So the idea is very simple.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.560
So let's start from electrons
for the first principles.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.765
And let's say we have
an interval of time,

00:22:01.765 --> 00:22:03.330
with length dt.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.240
And let's say we divide
it into n intervals,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.522
and each interval
length is dt prime.

00:22:10.522 --> 00:22:11.750
Right?

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:17.410
And I assume that the
ratio of dt over dt prime

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.240
is sufficiently large.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:26.310
So first, we know that
our stock, as we know,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.290
follows the log-normal dynamics.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:39.010
So this means that if I go from
from time i to time i plus 1,

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.010
here you need to
exchange i and i minus 1.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.881
So then, you can always
[INAUDIBLE] the following form,

00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:46.380
right?

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:51.660
So S at time i plus
1 minus S at time i

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.004
is equal to the
drift term-- right?

00:22:56.004 --> 00:22:58.420
Which is a discrete version
of the stochastic differential

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.230
equation.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.840
Plus the randomness.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.630
So here again,
sigma is volatility.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.880
It's the measure of how
the stock fluctuates,

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.070
which is the stock price,
which is square root of dt,

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.780
because Brownian
motion fluctuation is

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.530
proportional to the time.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:18.990
And also here, we have
epsilon, and epsilon

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.680
is a standard normal variable.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.630
Then-- OK, so we have this.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.440
This is pretty straightforward.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.730
Basically, I just throw
stochastic differential

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.010
equation on the latest.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.850
And I go from point
i to point i plus 1.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:41.750
Now, let's see what it means
for the price of the option.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:46.140
So again, so C is the
price of the option.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:53.580
At time T, when the stock
price is equal to S_(i+1).

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.060
So the change in
the option price

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.110
is equal to-- like
the first term, just

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.450
something very standard,
standard calculus.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:07.260
Plus the first derivatives and
the difference in the stock

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.260
price, plus I take
the second-order term,

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.890
this is the second
derivative, and I

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:18.840
have here S times i plus
1, minus S times i squared.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.950
So this is approximate, because
I'm taking only the main terms.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.410
Or the other terms, given that
both times dt and dt prime

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.600
are very small, they
can be neglected.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.640
So you can check it carefully
at home if you want to.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:36.100
But I guarantee that
there is no miracle here.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.720
Everything we need is here.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.150
Now let's do the following.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.274
So we have this equation.

00:24:43.274 --> 00:24:44.440
And let's look at this term.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.780
So this term, basically, is the
cornerstone of the Ito's lemma.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:53.940
So let's take this
equation for the difference

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.270
and substitute into here.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.860
And you see here, again, you
can look-- what is important,

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.100
against the time scales.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.950
So dt prime is very small.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:09.841
Therefore, the term, which
is random, dominates here.

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:10.340
Right?

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.923
Because [INAUDIBLE]
square root of dt.

00:25:11.923 --> 00:25:15.220
And square root for small
times is much bigger

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.070
than the linear function.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:22.250
Therefore, we simply neglect
this term compared this term.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:27.480
And with linear
accuracy in dt prime,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.760
we can approximate
this just by this term.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.800
Now, what to do-- so again,
we wrote the same equation,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.100
that latest difference
for the option price

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.980
of two neighboring points.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.400
And what I'm doing right now,
I have all this equation,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.560
and I will simply sum them--
basically from 0 to N.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.010
So let's say I have all these
equations from 0 to N minus 1,

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.630
and I sum them.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.340
And again, it's
very straightforward

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.610
and obtains the full equation.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:03.160
And again, what is very
interesting is that we will

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.600
obtain-- you look at this term.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.290
So this term is
very complicated.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.780
It's essentially
stochastic right?

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.390
Because-- it looks
like very stochastic.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.250
And because--
remember that this is

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.000
the standard normal variable.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.890
And all of them are independent.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:26.030
So in principle, we
have the sum of N

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.630
independent normal
variables squared.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:33.570
And it turns out-- it's really
a very beautiful result,

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.050
and I recommend everybody
also do it at home,

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.180
I try to show you right
now on the blackboard--

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.130
that if you sum up all
this epsilon squared,

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.550
that in the limit when
N goes to infinity,

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.960
this term becomes deterministic.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.900
So let me just
show you basically

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.180
what exactly is meant.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:04.930
So what I mean by deterministic
is that of course,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:14.890
if I have epsilon squared,
then it's-- there is some

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.440
probability distribution, right?

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.250
It's distributed between
0 and infinity, right?

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.270
So this is some
kind of function.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:29.500
But my claim is
that once I start

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:37.220
adding more and more numbers--
and so on, and so on-- then

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:42.170
this function will become
more and more and more narrow.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:46.060
So it behaves like a
deterministic random--

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.430
like a completely deterministic
variable in the large N limit.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:55.850
And to do this, let me
just write a very simple--

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:57.260
write explicitly of what I mean.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:04.521
So essentially, remember that
we have the sum of variables.

00:28:04.521 --> 00:28:05.020
Right?

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:16.010
And for us to show that
it's become deterministic,

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.830
we need to show
that it squared--

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:33.790
The width of the distribution,
which I defined as-- let's say

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.170
you have a variable, right?

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:40.340
And if I defined the dispersion
in the following way,

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.730
now I define here the dispersion
for this random variable which

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.695
is equal to the sum
of epsilon squared.

00:28:47.695 --> 00:29:00.080
So if I write it here,
then it turns out

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.210
that each term in
this equation is

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.520
proportional to N
squared, which is natural.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.870
But it turns out that the
difference in the large N limit

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:17.220
is proportional only
to N. Therefore,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:23.640
if you have this variable,
which-- if you sum up

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.180
more and more terms, then
we'll have a variable.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.470
We have a distribution
for this variable, which

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.080
is moving in this direction.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.280
And of course it
moves this direction,

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.960
but it becomes more and more
and more narrow, basically.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.910
So as the limit of
N tends to infinity,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:51.200
it becomes a deterministic.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.370
So I'd recommend
everybody at home just do

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.960
this very simple exercise.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:05.840
And you will see that
essentially, the sum behaves

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.000
as a deterministic quantity.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:20.740
So just to do this,
you need to you

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.330
need to know the very
simple properties

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.190
of the standard
normal distribution.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:31.970
First of all, the average
expected value of epsilon

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.970
is equal to 1, right?

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:35.380
For a standard normal variable.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.650
And also, you need to know
that the fourth moment

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:42.050
of the normal variable
is equal to 3.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.710
So if you have this, then
you can calculate this,

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.590
which is trivial to calculate.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:55.217
And then you can come to this
property that, once again,

00:30:55.217 --> 00:30:57.550
probability distribution
function, in the large N limit,

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.760
behaves deterministic.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.270
It essentially becomes
like a delta function.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.025
So this is a very
interesting result,

00:31:04.025 --> 00:31:09.460
because it basically explains
why in the Black-Scholes

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:15.950
equation, we have this very
weird by deterministic term.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:21.170
And that's why the option
pricing is possible.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.520
Because if you started
pricing options--

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.870
like if you don't know
anything about Black-Scholes,

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.780
it might be that there's
no price for the option,

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.630
because it might be that
although you do hedge,

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.420
you still cannot eliminate
your randomness completely.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:40.570
Maybe hedge helps you with just
too narrow the distribution

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.150
of your outcome, but we're
just not guaranteed at all.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:51.167
So it's really very-- Ito's
Lemma, which is usually

00:31:51.167 --> 00:31:52.750
in every book on
derivatives, probably

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:58.210
like the first
equation ever written,

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.890
basically is given
without any proof.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:04.710
But this-- in reality, it's
a very interesting limit.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:12.530
So it can be realized only if
you have two different time

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.300
scales.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.070
So the small time
scale, which is dt prime

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:19.410
is-- in the business
sense, it corresponds

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.180
to your hedging frequency.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.150
It's when you rebalance
your hedging portfolio.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.110
And the time dt, there's
a time scale dt, which

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.710
is much bigger than dt prime.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:35.210
It's at the time at which
you look at your portfolio.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:40.390
So only in this very weird
limit, when dt over dt prime

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:44.190
goes to infinity, you
strictly have Ito's Lemma.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.805
So actually, if you look
even like is most famous book

00:32:46.805 --> 00:32:48.050
on derivatives.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.510
If you look at this edition,
you will see actually

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.540
that the proof
actually isn't correct.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:58.720
So just look at it and
find what's wrong there.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] normal?

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.265
DENIS GOROKHOV: Sorry?

00:33:03.265 --> 00:33:04.610
AUDIENCE: That's what it is?

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.160
DENIS GOROKHOV: Yeah, this
is what [INAUDIBLE] means.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.350
So if you use these
two results here,

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:17.630
you will see that your
it's proportional only

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.480
to N, not to N squared.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:27.280
So that's why your distribution
becomes more and more narrow.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.950
Because when you sum
up, what it means

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.404
is you sum up more
and more variables.

00:33:35.404 --> 00:33:37.320
Each of them was like
random normal variables.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.650
So the average--
average goes like N.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:44.110
But the dispersion--
the dispersion, right?

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.540
That's the standard
deviation, right?

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.640
You have a square
root of N. That's

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.130
why basically, square
root of N over N is small.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.190
So by increasing
N, basically you

00:33:56.190 --> 00:34:03.100
become more and more
and more deterministic.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.541
So that's the main fact
beyond Ito's lemma.

00:34:06.541 --> 00:34:07.540
So that's it's obtained.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.956
So I recommend everybody just
look in detail, because this

00:34:09.956 --> 00:34:12.590
is the cornerstone of
derivatives pricing theory,

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.795
but at many books it's
not really well-written.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.370
So when I was studying,
it was like I couldn't

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.510
understand for a while.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.989
So it took me a time
just to understand.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:27.730
What else?

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.219
And a very interesting
thing now is

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.650
that remember that
we used Ito's lemma--

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:36.620
and basically, we are able
to obtain this equation.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:46.120
And this equation is very
well known in literature.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.860
It's very similar to
the heat equation.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.929
And heat equation can be
solved using standard methods.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.467
And I don't want to write
any derivation here,

00:34:55.467 --> 00:34:56.800
it's relatively straightforward.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.190
Maybe a bit cumbersome
but straightforward.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:04.987
And if payoff of your
option at maturity

00:35:04.987 --> 00:35:07.570
is given by some function, which
is not really important here.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.650
Because you can write a
very general solution.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:17.270
So what is here is
essentially Green's function

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.960
of this equation.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.230
And this Green's function,
if you look at this equation,

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:29.200
is very similar to the
probability distribution

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.000
function, which we have on this
slide in the very beginning.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.500
So this function is
identical to this function,

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:45.550
and the only difference
is that the drift of stock

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.000
in the real world disappears.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.960
And we are left only
with the interest rate.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:36:01.240
And so this equation, which
is again, also very important

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.940
for the derivatives
pricing, is how

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:10.050
we come up with the whole idea
of Monte Carlo simulation.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:13.490
So this is nothing else as
a Green's function, which

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:17.090
basically tells us
how the stock evolves

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.080
in the risk-neutral space.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.320
Risk-neutral space is
essentially some kind

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.610
of imaginary world,
like [INAUDIBLE] world,

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:39.102
where all the assets' drift is
just the interest rate and not

00:36:39.102 --> 00:36:39.810
the actual drift.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.230
So it's very fundamental.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.180
So it's very important things
that the drift in real world

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.732
drops out of all the equations.

00:36:46.732 --> 00:36:49.190
So the only parameter which
actually does matter for option

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.992
pricing is volatility.

00:36:50.992 --> 00:36:53.450
So this parameter's relatively
easier to understand, right?

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:57.720
Because that's how much money
your deterministic investment

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.900
basically makes.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.190
So [INAUDIBLE] is the
[INAUDIBLE] parameter.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:10.140
So naively, you could
expect I need both mu-- let

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.622
me just remind you what mu is.

00:37:12.622 --> 00:37:14.330
Mu and sigma, two
independent parameters.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.663
But it turns out mu completely
drops out of the picture.

00:37:16.663 --> 00:37:18.390
And this is because
of dynamic hedging,

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.360
because we hedged the position.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:26.556
And so now this
equation-- since this

00:37:26.556 --> 00:37:28.680
is basically Green's
function, and Green's function

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:38.910
tells us what's the
probability density

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.380
of the stock at some
time in the future,

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:47.890
if the stock were at
some point initially,

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:56.720
then basically this means
that we can simulate the stock

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.570
dynamics.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.400
And we can price
derivatives, like,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.020
using a very simple framework.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.210
So what do we do?

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.540
We simply write the
equation for the stock

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.040
in the risk-neutral world.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.600
Remember, the difference is
that instead of the actual drift

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.369
of the stock, mu, we substitute
here by the interest rate.

00:38:17.369 --> 00:38:19.660
And this is basically how
much money, roughly speaking,

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.280
the bank account makes.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:30.000
And what we do-- we start from
some stock value at time 0,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.432
and then we simulate stock
along different paths.

00:38:35.432 --> 00:38:36.890
So there are like
three paths here.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.180
There could be like thousands.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.070
So now-- and you
know, now, let's

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.840
say we know the stock
payoff at maturity.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.760
And what you do-- then the price
of derivative is very simple.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.130
Essentially, you take the
average of this payoff,

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.047
over the distribution.

00:38:52.047 --> 00:38:53.838
And you know distribution,
because you just

00:38:53.838 --> 00:38:55.060
simulated the stock price.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:00.249
And you just discount it
with the interest rate.

00:39:00.249 --> 00:39:01.290
So it's extremely simple.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:04.720
So in principle,
implementing this--

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.850
I'd say if you have
package like MATLAB,

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:11.290
it probably takes like
maybe one hour at most,

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:17.840
implement let's say pricing
of Black-Scholes formula

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.930
via a Monte Carlo simulation.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.930
So maybe if you have
time, you can try this

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:28.060
and see how your Monte
Carlo solution converges

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:32.650
to the exact result which was
first obtained by Black-Scholes

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:33.900
and Merton.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.420
So basically, this is a
super powerful framework,

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.560
which basically tells
us something like this.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.190
So it's not applicable
just to the stock prices,

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:46.130
but it's also applicable to
interest rate derivatives,

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:49.460
credit derivatives, and
foreign exchange derivatives,

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.670
so on and so forth.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.190
Basically, the
idea is like this.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.280
You have some-- the
payoff of your derivative

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.600
depends on various
financial variables.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.670
And you simply simulate all of
them in the risk-neutral world.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.170
Right?

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.810
So you simulate all
of them, and then you

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.310
could calculate the
average of the payoff.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:09.582
And you just discount it.

00:40:09.582 --> 00:40:11.290
And that's how you
can price derivatives.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:16.340
So in principle, if you have
a flexible IT infrastructure,

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:20.090
like a financial institution,
so you can implement it.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.910
And then you can price
pretty much everything.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.790
That's basically how
exotic derivatives

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:33.310
are priced, whose prices
are not easy to obtain

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.450
using analytical methods.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:41.970
Which is the case for a
large amount of derivatives.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.570
So this is the
whole idea, right?

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:50.270
So Monte Carlo simulation is
a very fundamental concept.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.700
So we do the simulation
in the risk-neutral world,

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.315
and there are certain rules
how to write these equations

00:40:56.315 --> 00:40:58.440
for different asset classes--
could be stock again,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.500
could be foreign exchange,
could be credit, could be rates,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.250
whatever.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:07.530
And then you do some kind of
sampling, you find average,

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.270
and then basically you are done.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.970
So this is how it
works with the stock,

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.390
and let me just explain
how to generalize

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:18.030
all these ideas for the case
of interest rates and credit

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.900
derivatives.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:24.160
So and-- let me just start from
the very basics of the interest

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.750
rate derivatives.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:31.490
So of course the whole
point of these derivatives

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:39.700
is to allow financial
institutions or individuals

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.780
to manage their interest
rate risk better.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:49.060
So businesses need money
to run their business.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.590
So big institutions,
big corporations,

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.420
have billions, [INAUDIBLE]
hundreds of billions of dollars

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.645
of debt, and they know
how to risk manage

00:41:57.645 --> 00:41:59.570
it, [INAUDIBLE] efficiently.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:04.474
And just to make money, and
not even necessarily financial

00:42:04.474 --> 00:42:05.015
institutions.

00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:14.730
So of course if
you borrow money,

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.430
then you need to
pay some interest.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.429
So you can think about
interest rate derivatives

00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:21.620
as some kind of option on
the stochastic interest,

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.660
because let's say say today,
you can borrow money at 5%.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.340
But tomorrow, this
rate can change.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:33.800
So in order to control
this uncertainty,

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.470
you need to be able to
buy some derivatives,

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.305
just to hedge your
exposure, for example.

00:42:41.305 --> 00:42:42.430
Or it might just speculate.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.040
Maybe you just have some view
that rates will go up or down.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.740
So it depends on the type
of investor or speculator,

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.809
whatever.

00:42:49.809 --> 00:42:51.600
And so I mean this is
a very simple concept

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.880
of present value of money.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.290
If I have dollar
today, it's definitely

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.800
better than the dollar
one year from now.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.130
Let's say I have
a dollar, right?

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:11.610
But I will get it only
in one year from now.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.150
So how much does it cost?

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.720
It's clear that if the
interest rate is 5%,

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.850
it roughly costs $0.95.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:17.700
Right?

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.400
Because what do I do?

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:25.430
If the interest rate is
5%, then I take $0.95,

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:28.510
and I'd put it into bank
account, and I'd make 5%.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:33.260
So I will get like $1
in one year from now.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.150
So there exists very important
concept of the present value.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.740
Or like time value of money.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:43.080
Depending on where
in the future you

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.480
are, how much money
it costs today.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.305
And people talk about-- it's
very often a fundamental notion

00:43:51.305 --> 00:43:55.100
of the fixed income derivative,
is the discount factor.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.290
So it essentially
tell you that OK,

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.720
if you have one dollar
today, it costs one dollar.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.820
But if you have one
dollar in the future,

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.900
basically it costs
something else.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:14.640
So this is a very important
notion in finance.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.750
So I'll tell a little
bit more how [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:20.270
them together, this
functional [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.740
So another very important
thing in the interest rate

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.660
derivatives is the forward rate.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.917
So remember, okay, so
we have discount factor.

00:44:27.917 --> 00:44:30.000
And the very important
thing about discount factor

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.270
is it should start at 1.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.440
Because a dollar
today is a dollar.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.600
There is no uncertainty, right?

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.250
Thus it's clear
that this function

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.870
should be decaying, or at least
non-increasing, with time.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.750
So that's why it's
very convenient

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:51.600
to parametrize this kind of
function with forward rates.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.270
So this is some
positive forward rates.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.430
And [INAUDIBLE] very convenient.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.170
And remember, let's
say, in the example

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:09.500
below, like on this page,
if all maturities earn 5%,

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.320
then this is simply 5% a year.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:22.510
So for this example, basically
your forward rate is just flat.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.330
OK, so if this is an
example-- and when

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.038
you talk about interest
rate derivatives,

00:45:26.038 --> 00:45:31.030
it's very convenient
to model the dynamics

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.990
of the forward rates.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:38.690
So again, it's very
different from the stock,

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:41.150
because it's got an
additional dimension.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.060
So if you model
the stock dynamics,

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:45.170
it's just a point process.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.670
Right?

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:49.710
Let's say it's $100 today,
and then you start modeling.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.620
Next, they'll go to $95, could
go to $105, so on and so forth.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:59.240
But interest rates,
it's more about curve.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.990
So it has an extra dimension--
it's a one-dimensional object.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.239
And the reason is very simple.

00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:06.340
In general, let's say if you
borrow money for one year,

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:09.840
then let's say you
pay one percent.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.550
But if you borrow
for two years, it

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:16.010
might be that you borrow
it for 2%, and so on.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.120
So there's a concept
of the yield curve.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.650
And here basically tells us how
much different maturities make.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:24.754
So in a typical situation,
with your curve,

00:46:24.754 --> 00:46:26.170
if you don't have
some [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.524
of recession, which
sometimes happens,

00:46:28.524 --> 00:46:29.690
it's usually upward sloping.

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:33.170
This basically means if you
borrow money for longer term,

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:34.730
you pay higher interest.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.430
You can see it very easily.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.750
Like for those who have
mortgages right there,

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:45.460
it's always like 15-year
mortgage rate is lower

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.660
than 30-year mortgage rate.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.369
And just here I just
show-- to give you

00:46:51.369 --> 00:46:53.910
a [INAUDIBLE], of where we are
right now in terms of interest

00:46:53.910 --> 00:47:01.127
rates, basically I just show
you the yield of a 10-year US

00:47:01.127 --> 00:47:01.710
Treasury note.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.360
So what is 10-year
Treasury note?

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.660
Basically, the US
government borrows money

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.320
to finance its activities.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.570
And then it works like this.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.190
Let's say I'm an investor.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.860
I'm giving the US
government $100.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.440
And then every year, like
for the next 10 years--

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.320
more exactly, like
twice a year--

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.460
let's say they are
paying me some coupon.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.360
Let's say if the interest
rate per year is 5%,

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.490
this means that if I give
the US government $100,

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:34.550
then the government pays
me $2.50 every half a year.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:38.550
And at the very end,
in 10 years from now,

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:43.330
they must return
$100, the notional.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:46.500
And basically, if you look again
how stochastic the rates are

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.120
right and what
kind of environment

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.710
we are in right now, you can
see that over the last about 50

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.010
years, we see very
interesting picture.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:02.070
From about '60s
to about '80, '82,

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:05.320
we can see a tremendous
increase in interest rates.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.290
And this is something which
looks very unbelievable right

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:10.140
now.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.030
So this problem nowadays.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:21.330
If one takes, let's
say a mortgage,

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:25.790
now a 30-year mortgage is
maybe 4%, 4.5% nowadays.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:30.670
But let's say here,
about 30 years ago, it

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:33.140
was like a [INAUDIBLE] interest
rate-- very high inflation.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.780
And mortgage rates
were in double digits.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.940
It was not uncommon
to pay like 15%

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.790
if you would take
mortgage somewhere here.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.490
So the rates were increasing.

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:44.520
But since then, we live in a
very different environment,

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.110
when interest rates
gradually go and go down.

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:51.180
So essentially, here,
basically it shows in 1980,

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.540
the US Government
would pay 12% a year

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:58.020
each year to borrow
money for 10 years.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:02.990
So at the end of 2012, it
paid less than 2%-- just 1.7%.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:06.300
So there like a very
clear trend, you know?

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.870
Something's going down.

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:12.100
So in recent years, there
is some kind of uptick here.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:16.840
But you know, we always get
some kind of situation here.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.820
So where are we going?

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.440
Nobody knows.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.810
But really, we're in this
situation where interest rates

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.272
are extremely low.

00:49:24.272 --> 00:49:25.730
It was nothing like
this, basically

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.520
for the last 50 years.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.801
So it's very unusual, and you
have these very low interest

00:49:33.801 --> 00:49:34.300
rates.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.180
This means that the
economy is very weak,

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:39.790
because this means there's
not much demand on borrowing,

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.340
right?

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.840
Because corporations,
like individuals,

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:48.350
they don't want to borrow a lot,
because once [INAUDIBLE] again,

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:49.940
like supply-demand, right?

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.210
Because if you want to
borrow, basically you're

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.580
willing to pay higher rate.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:59.280
So also, of course
another reason for this

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:03.060
is because-- we live in a
very unusual environment,

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:07.430
because the government
interferes a lot on the market.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:11.820
So they're trying to make
the rates as low as possible,

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.760
just to make the interest
rates burden for corporations,

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.620
for private individuals
as small as possible.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.600
And hopefully, we'll go
out of this recession.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.470
But as I said, this
is very singular, very

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:26.900
unusual environment-- just to
understand what's going on.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.935
And there a whole world
of interest rate-- yes?

00:50:30.935 --> 00:50:33.410
AUDIENCE: But it pays to invest
in a non-productive access,

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.300
like real estate,
which are expected

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.874
to rise with time, without,
for example, [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.825
Doesn't it skew
whatever investment

00:50:45.825 --> 00:50:50.686
is made toward assets which
are expected to rise with time?

00:50:50.686 --> 00:50:52.390
It may not be
productive access--

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.910
DENIS GOROKHOV: Yes,
yes, but right now, I

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:59.290
mean I think even right
now, lots of people

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:00.900
are just scared to
buy real estate.

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.360
You never know what's
going on, right?

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.960
Because prices are
still pretty high, so

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.254
who knows what will happen?

00:51:10.254 --> 00:51:10.920
So you're right.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.240
There is some kind of
psychology [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.040
But many people who bought like
2006, whatever-- like before,

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.890
they basically
lost tons of money.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:21.910
You never know.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.860
So it's like when
you buy some assets,

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.140
you've got some finance.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.560
Let's say fixed rate finance.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.268
So you know how much
you're going to pay,

00:51:29.268 --> 00:51:32.630
but where is the
guarantee that, you know--

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:37.120
I mean, long term, it
goes up, of course,

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.940
but long-term basically
means tens of years.

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.884
But if you look at the real
estate prices, for the last,

00:51:43.884 --> 00:51:44.800
whatever, seven years.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.880
We are going up right now, but
still, we didn't go through

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.840
for the minimum.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.750
Like the [INAUDIBLE] maximum,
which you had before,

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:55.360
basically.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.190
So you never know.

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:05.041
Yes, and so there's a whole
world of interest rate

00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:05.540
derivatives.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.530
So I'm just very briefly
explaining what it all means.

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:12.230
So usually-- here I mentioned
it's all about Treasury.

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:14.380
So it's all like
government-- it's

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:17.440
kind of yield implied
from the government bonds.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.510
But usually, all the derivatives
are linked to another

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.750
very famous rate,
which is called LIBOR.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.310
And LIBOR-- roughly
speaking, it's

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:29.190
a short-term rate at which
financial institutions

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:34.160
in London borrow money from each
other on an unsecured basis.

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.540
So there's a lot of caveats
here on this definition,

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.590
but that's roughly
what that means.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:43.170
And there is like a fundamental
derivative in the interest rate

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:45.000
world is a LIBOR swap.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.250
So the standard USD LIBOR
swap is something like this,

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:47.750
basically.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:51.520
It's paying-- once
a three months,

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.980
it's paying three
months LIBOR rate.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.500
And so this is
stochastic, right?

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:02.550
So basically, every day, there
is this certain procedure,

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:06.390
which tells us what this LIBOR,
this short-term borrowing rate

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.580
is.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.030
And in exchange
for this, if you're

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:14.000
paying out this LIBOR
swap, this LIBOR rate,

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.634
you are receiving the fixed
rate, which is diminished.

00:53:16.634 --> 00:53:18.800
So this is like fundamental
interest rate basically.

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.302
It's like, essentially, if you
believe that rates will go up

00:53:21.302 --> 00:53:23.010
and you just want to
speculate, basically

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:25.780
you're trying to be long
LIBOR and short fixed rate,

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.330
and vice versa.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:31.290
So this is a very important
instrument for pricing.

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:33.420
And it's all kinds
of derivatives

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.980
linked to this LIBOR rate.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:40.360
For example, you can
talk about a swaption.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.160
What is a swaption?

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.450
Swaption is a derivative
to enter an interest rate

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:46.192
swap in the future.

00:53:46.192 --> 00:53:47.900
Remember like in the
equity option world,

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:51.110
let's say if I have a call
option on a stock, that's

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:54.070
the right to buy
a stock at a fixed

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:57.580
price-- it's fixed today-- like
at some time in the future.

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.310
Here, this is basically
the same idea.

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:02.140
If you're here today, at
sometime in the future

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.980
you can enter a swap,
a kind of contract,

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.450
which pays various
legs and there

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.150
is some price given for today.

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:13.600
And there are also all
kinds of false derivatives.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.490
You can talk about rates.

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:20.080
Basically you can buy or sell
options on a particular LIBOR

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.370
rate.

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:23.730
Or there's also
cancel-able swaps,

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.460
which basically are
you can enter a swap,

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:29.490
but if you don't want to pay,
like, let's say, high rate

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:30.690
anymore, you can cancel it.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.350
Of course, it's affecting
the price so on and so forth.

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:36.700
So, very important idea if
you think about all these

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.500
that it turns out that when you
price all these derivatives,

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:45.280
they all depend-- Their price
depends on these discount

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.550
factors.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:49.299
And the discount factors
depend on these forward rates,

00:54:49.299 --> 00:54:51.090
which is basically
trivial parametrization.

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:53.915
But it's very important,
very convenient, to work

00:54:53.915 --> 00:54:55.380
with these forward rates.

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:59.170
And when we model interest rate
derivatives, using Monte Carlo

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:02.140
simulations, and there are no
analytical models available,

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:05.950
then [INAUDIBLE] model of
dynamics of forward rates.

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:09.700
And you can ask a question.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:16.060
So how can we get, basically,
this curve in practice,

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.190
or this curve?

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:26.350
And it turns out that
the swap market tells us

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:27.860
how to obtain this curve.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:33.290
So here I show some
quotes, real market quotes,

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:35.610
for interest rate swap
of different maturities.

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:37.600
Let's say two years,
three years, four years,

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.010
and so on and so forth.

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:42.420
And then if you add this
number and this number,

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.970
then you obtain the swap rate.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:53.470
So if you take these
swap rates, then it

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:58.290
turns out that you can show
very easily that if you

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:00.220
know all these
numbers, then you will

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:07.200
be able to obtain this curve
in a pretty unique way.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.940
So because of this
market of swaps--

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:15.560
so once again, if you add
these two numbers here,

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:21.420
then basically it tells
you that, for example,

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.580
for this instrument,
let's say, five years.

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:26.180
For the next five years,
I'm going to pay roughly

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:31.760
like 0.75% a year.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.260
Right.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.110
So these two
payments, basically,

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:38.720
correspond to like 0.75% in
exchange for the LIBOR payment,

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:39.220
right?

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.770
So if I enter a swap--
so I know that the I will

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:44.380
be paying fixed--
but I'll receive

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.970
floating, which is
random, because we

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:50.380
don't know what it is.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:55.340
And [INAUDIBLE] is a
pretty complicated concept.

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:03.360
The idea is very simple.

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.460
So basically the
swap market allows

00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:10.970
you to obtain this
discount factor-- basically

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:15.900
this function-- which tells
you how much your dollar

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:19.530
in the future is today.

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.400
So if you know how
much a dollar is,

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.600
then you know how much C
dollars, basically, cost.

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:30.490
Then basically, let's
say you have C dollars.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:33.380
Then you simply multiply
them by the discount factor,

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.220
and that's what the present
value of your fixed rate

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:37.900
payment is.

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.400
So remember that
finance [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.430
very important things.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:43.885
In finance, at least in
the derivative world,

00:57:43.885 --> 00:57:49.285
we typically-- what is called
PV or present value of all

00:57:49.285 --> 00:57:50.910
our future payments, right?

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:53.840
So we have some future
liability, which

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.252
is something very complicated.

00:57:55.252 --> 00:57:57.210
I say, I'll pay you
something very complicated,

00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:59.260
pay off in 10 years from now.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.120
But we are trying to understand
how much it's worth today.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.620
Because idea for this business
is clients come to the bank.

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.530
And they say, I want
this derivative.

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:08.680
You sell this derivative.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.360
You charge the money
right now, and you

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.825
spend this money on hedging.

00:58:11.825 --> 00:58:13.950
Of course, you try to charge
them a little bit more

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.650
because you need to
still make living.

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:18.780
But in [INAUDIBLE] basically
is like you've spent

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:20.530
most of your money on hedging.

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.975
But you to try to come
up with a number today.

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:31.730
Here's, again, a
very simple example.

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:38.150
So if you know, once again,
how much your dollar is

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:41.640
in the future, then
you can present

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.720
value, PV, every payment.

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:47.900
So let's say in 10 years
from now, d is equal to 0.5,

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:52.450
then if you payoff's $1,000, the
present value is equal to $500.

00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:55.090
Because, again, the argument
is very simple, right?

00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:59.200
You take $500 today and
invest for 10 years,

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.060
and you get $1,000
in the future.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.180
This is the
replication argument.

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:06.378
Another very
important thing here,

00:59:06.378 --> 00:59:07.877
is that if you have
an interest rate

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:14.910
swap, which is paying LIBOR.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:17.060
And let's say on a notional.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:21.060
Let's say I pay you LIBOR,
which is some rate which

00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.910
is measured in percent.

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.630
LIBOR is like a 1%
a year, for example.

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:27.920
Then notional of the
swap is $1 million

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:33.640
which means that the floating
rate payment is based on $1

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:37.630
million times 1% is $10,000.

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:40.880
So it turns out that
very interesting thing

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:53.020
is that if you pay
LIBOR rate and if you

00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.010
pay the notional
at the very end,

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:59.880
then the present value of
this is equal to the notional.

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.120
So it's the beauty of
floating rate is security.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:12.380
[INAUDIBLE] is basically that
if you pay the current market

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:16.030
rate all the time, then
the price of your security

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.535
is always equal to the notional.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.670
It's very nice fact which
is also fundamental here.

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.524
And very interesting
thing would happen

01:00:25.524 --> 01:00:27.690
after crisis is that all
the derivatives have become

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.217
what's called collateralized.

01:00:29.217 --> 01:00:31.050
So you need to post
some money all the time.

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:32.966
So there's another concept
of OIS discounting,

01:00:32.966 --> 01:00:35.292
which I don't talk about here.

01:00:35.292 --> 01:00:37.250
The main idea which you
need to understand here

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.090
is that we have this function,
like discount function, which

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:44.690
shows us again how much the
dollar is worth in the future.

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:48.630
And using this function, we
can price all kinds of swaps.

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:55.490
So we can PV the value of
the swap today using this.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:59.120
So the idea of interest
rate derivatives

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.510
it's all about dynamics
of the yield curve.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:04.510
It's basically how
your discount function

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:10.480
or how your yields,
future yields, evolve.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:14.100
The whole idea is
similar to the stock.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:20.640
So again, at time 0 you
start from some curve.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.220
For example, something
like this, right?

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.740
From some curve
which is shown here.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.130
And then it stopped
evolving and you

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:32.340
want to be able to model
it mathematically and price

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.820
all kinds of derivatives.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:37.800
So there is like a very
interesting difference

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:45.720
between stock options
and interest rate options

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.000
because for the stock options,
we know the price today.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.760
If it's a liquid
stock, it's just known.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.440
We know what it's
trading right now.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.110
But for the yield
curve, it's different.

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:58.550
We first need to take
the swap markets quotes

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.690
and do what is
called bootstrapping

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:02.330
to get the function d of t.

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:03.940
The next step, we
need to specify

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.720
the volatility of different
forward rates in the future

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.570
and we need to come up
with some kind of dynamics

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:15.790
which describes the future
dynamics of forward rates.

01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:17.590
And then once we
have this, we can

01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:21.500
use the Monte Carlo framework to
price all kinds of derivatives.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.435
So before I start talking
about the HJM framework here,

01:02:25.435 --> 01:02:26.810
I just want to
mention that there

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:33.100
are some other more simple
models which are historically

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.175
appear before the HJM model
which basically describe

01:02:36.175 --> 01:02:39.285
the dynamics of the short rate.

01:02:39.285 --> 01:02:42.750
And so the most famous
ones are the Ho-Lee model,

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:46.250
Hull-White model, and
so-called CIR model.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.890
And basically, the
idea is that if you

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:54.070
have this function for forward
rates-- which I wrote here.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:57.480
So they describe dynamics,
instantaneous dynamics,

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.950
of this rate.

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:02.270
So instead of modeling
the whole curve,

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:06.570
you model only just this
short rate and so on.

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:09.620
So some of these models
are particular case

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.960
of the HJM model.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.350
Some of them are not.

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:17.410
But just to mention.

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:27.130
And basically the idea, then, of
the interest rate derivatives,

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:30.870
for example, let's say I want
to price an option that in five

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:33.080
years from now, I enter a
particular interest rate

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.740
swap which pays 5% on the
fixed leg and receives LIBOR.

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:44.180
So I need to model the
dynamic of future yields.

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:49.050
And remember, it's a very
important thing that, again,

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:57.710
because we have
the curve, now we

01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:00.090
have two different times here.

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:02.620
For the stock derivatives, we
just basically write dynamics,

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.320
d of S_t is equal to something.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.380
And t is just basically
instantaneous time.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:12.470
Here t stands for
instantaneous time.

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:20.940
And T, capital T, stands
for the future time.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.560
Here.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.450
So essentially if
you're here, you're

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:26.459
looking at the forward
rate somewhere here.

01:04:26.459 --> 01:04:28.375
And then you basically
describe with dynamics.

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.030
I don't want to go into
details, but again,

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:38.520
using this very fundamental
result in pricing theory

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:45.510
like Ito's Lemma, you can derive
the equation for this drift.

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.910
So the problem is it
turns out it's always

01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:51.090
the case in the Monte
Carlo simulation.

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:55.290
So you [INAUDIBLE] some time
equation and you have drift

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:56.980
and you have volatility.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.390
So it turns out that
this drift, the real time

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:03.500
drift, because you hedge,
drops out of your equation.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.520
And it turns out that
for the interest rate,

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.035
there is some complication.

01:05:07.035 --> 01:05:11.980
In the risk-neutral world, this
real-world drift [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:16.160
by some equation which
depends on sigma.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.140
So if you do the
calculation, then you

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:24.140
will see that in the
risk-neutral world,

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.910
if you [INAUDIBLE]
of following form,

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.150
which is some
non-local equation.

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:29.500
But it is what it is.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.830
So it's very straightforward.

01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:34.750
I encourage you just to, if you
have time, to go through this

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:38.740
and really understand
how it works.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:44.130
But now once we have this,
the model for interest rate

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:46.450
derivatives is very simple.

01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:50.176
And remember that
in the stock world--

01:05:50.176 --> 01:05:54.872
let me go back just
to this equation.

01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:56.830
So we started from some
stochastic differential

01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:58.040
equation.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.890
And then we simulate
different paths.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:05.260
And then basically we
average over the pay-off

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:08.170
here at maturity
of the derivative,

01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:10.990
when actually we do the payment.

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:14.300
And here the situation
is very similar.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:19.090
So we have some
initial curve which we

01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:21.310
obtain from the market today.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:27.580
And this curve dynamics is
described by this equation.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.290
Then we have distribution
of this curve in the future,

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:32.600
and then you can price
all kinds of derivatives.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.270
So again, it's a very
fundamental framework.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.060
So very general.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:42.160
So once the curve and
the volatility are known,

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.000
you simply run this simulation
and you get your pay-off.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.200
So basically that's
how it works.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:58.280
And now another example,
which is basically--

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:04.190
of this HJM model, is
basically credit derivatives.

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:07.220
So I don't have
much time, but just

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:13.210
mention-- I'll go very
briefly what's going on.

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:17.090
So if you give money
just to someone,

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:19.630
like to the
corporations, then there

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:24.510
is a probability that you
won't get your money back.

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:27.255
So corporations issue
bonds, financial instruments

01:07:27.255 --> 01:07:28.460
to raise capital.

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:31.110
It's, again, very similar
to the US treasuries.

01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:34.390
And so you give them $100 and
they pay you 5% < every year.

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:37.430
And then let's say in 10
years, if it's a 10 year bond,

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:39.377
they are supposed to
give your money back.

01:07:39.377 --> 01:07:40.460
But this might not happen.

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.340
Corporations default because
they make their own decisions.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.400
Like something went
wrong with economy,

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.820
and so on and so forth.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:47.940
It happens.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:51.360
So there is some risk
which is indicated here.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.020
We just call it default risk.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:55.870
So corporations or
private individuals,

01:07:55.870 --> 01:08:00.710
they have a right to
default. So they can default.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:06.650
And this is reflected in
the coupons which they pay.

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:09.910
So for the US government
at the end of 2012.

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:15.210
A 10 year bond would
pay just 1.7% a year.

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:18.000
Again, we are in extremely
low environment which

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.630
looks like almost nothing.

01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:26.069
And remember that even if
you're an investor and if you

01:08:26.069 --> 01:08:29.895
buy this bond, then you
get your 1% interest

01:08:29.895 --> 01:08:31.770
but then you need to
pay taxes on the profit.

01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:34.890
So the return is
really very small.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:39.060
So then, of course, if
you're an investor, then OK.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:43.020
The US government securities
are assumed to be risk-free,

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.819
so you won't be
able to lose money.

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:47.859
So this is a very
important benchmark.

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:50.365
But then you can buy
bonds of corporations.

01:08:50.365 --> 01:08:53.840
But, of course, to compensate
for possible default,

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.460
they pay higher coupon.

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.160
For example, at the end of
2012, Morgan Stanley bonds

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.189
would pay around,
let's say 5% a year.

01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:03.140
Significantly higher.

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:08.852
Some governments
are right now very

01:09:08.852 --> 01:09:11.210
close to default.
So some time ago,

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:14.380
for example, when Morgan Stanley
bonds would pay 5% a year.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:17.560
But say, Greece bonds
would pay 25%, 30% a year.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:23.359
Because nobody knows what's
going to happen there.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:26.880
It's clear that the economy
is not in good shape

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.610
and it all depends
on the bailouts.

01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:32.939
Or these bailouts are
conditioned, for example,

01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:36.080
that the right
government-- if you'll

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.429
be in power and the
[INAUDIBLE] is unclear.

01:09:38.429 --> 01:09:39.720
So there's lots of uncertainty.

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:47.300
Such uncertainties, that's
why, essentially, the yield--

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:50.689
investors tell you would
require very high yield.

01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:56.210
And in the credit derivatives,
the fundamental instrument,

01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:58.490
is credit default swap.

01:09:58.490 --> 01:10:03.340
So if you have a risky
bond, then in order

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:07.500
to protect from default you
can go, let's say to a bank,

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.160
and buy a credit default swap.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.000
It basically means
that if you hold

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.010
a bond and default happens, then
the seller of this protection

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.780
will compensate
you for the loss.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:23.270
For example, let's say
you bought a bond at $100.

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:26.330
And then, let's say, in one
year the corporation defaults.

01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:29.200
And then what happens
in this event?

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.342
Then court.

01:10:31.342 --> 01:10:32.450
Court happens.

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:35.710
And the judge decides how
much money is recovered.

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:38.550
And this money is distributed
to the bond investors.

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:41.530
They're first in the queue.

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:46.930
And then if, let's say, $0.70
on the dollar were recovered,

01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:54.600
then the default swap will
pay you $32 which you lost.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:03.100
And very fundamental concept in
the world of credit derivatives

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:07.580
is market implied
survival probability.

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:12.990
So in principle,
credit default swaps

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.570
are available for
different entities.

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:16.830
Let's say like Morgan Stanley.

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:19.360
It could be Verizon.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.580
Could be AT&T and
so on and so forth.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:29.244
And [INAUDIBLE] require
different payments.

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:30.910
For example, let's
say if credit default

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:32.930
swap for Morgan
Stanley, probably

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:36.020
is like 5 year maturity, you
pay around 100 basis points.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:39.140
And if there is
some-- like Greece,

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:43.162
probably, you pay like 500,
maybe 1,000 basis points

01:11:43.162 --> 01:11:44.120
or something like this.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.000
So market differentiates.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.360
And based on this, you can then
do a very simple calculation.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:00.060
And you consider, it's very
easy to come with a concept

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.450
of the survival probability.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:07.580
Roughly speaking if, let's
say, default protection

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:11.840
on some reference entity
is worth 1% a year.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.640
And then what do we see?

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.940
Then with probability 99% a
year, you will get your money.

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:23.350
If probability 1% per
year, you will get nothing.

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:25.190
So you can think
about it like this.

01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:29.010
This means you can say
the probability to default

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:33.200
is roughly 1% a
year, in this case.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:39.390
And then we could talk about
survival probabilities,

01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:40.960
which is basically
one [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.240
default probability.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.994
And you can then come
up with the concept

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:47.910
of survival probabilities,
which you can again

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:53.530
parametrize with forward rates
which are called hazard rates.

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:56.026
So credit derivatives,
in a sense,

01:12:56.026 --> 01:12:57.900
they're similar to
interest rate derivatives.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.260
Remember, in the case of
interest rate derivatives,

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:04.250
we were talking about
discount factors.

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.540
So this is like
the present value.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.419
Present value of money.

01:13:08.419 --> 01:13:10.710
In terms of world of credit
derivatives-- besides this,

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:13.536
because of course
interest rates are also

01:13:13.536 --> 01:13:15.160
very important for
credit derivatives--

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.110
we talk about
survival probability.

01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:21.030
Today it's equal to
1, but then it decays.

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:23.530
And let's say if you
have a US government,

01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:25.670
basically it always stay at one.

01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:27.900
And let's say if it's
like Morgan Stanley,

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.520
it goes like this.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:32.305
If it's some distressed
European sovereign,

01:13:32.305 --> 01:13:33.857
it will go like this.

01:13:33.857 --> 01:13:35.690
So basically it's
market-implied probability

01:13:35.690 --> 01:13:40.470
of default based on the
credit default swap market.

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:44.060
And the idea of the HJM model
for the credit derivatives

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:49.795
is that-- similar to the dynamic
of forward rates in interest

01:13:49.795 --> 01:13:54.320
rate case-- you simply describe
the dynamics of hazard rates

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.300
which parametrize your
survival probabilities.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:05.040
And now let me see.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.390
Let me show an example of very
important type of derivatives,

01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:13.250
which are priced
using credit models.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:17.980
Let's talk about the
corporate callable bonds.

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:25.880
So it's a very
simple instrument.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.240
Again, I'm a corporation.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.820
I borrow $100 from you.

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:33.240
And let's say I'm paying
you 5% every year.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:39.040
But I have the
right at any time--

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:45.460
or, let's say, once in three
months-- return you this $100,

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:46.940
and basically close the deal.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.200
So why is that so valuable
for the corporations?

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.470
Because today's
environment is such

01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:54.030
that I borrow at
a very high rate.

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:58.320
In this example, let's
say I am paying 5% a year.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.770
And I issued a 10 year bond and
there's $100 million notional.

01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:06.400
So basically this means
that every year, I

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.180
am paying to the investor 5%.

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.640
$5 million.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.780
But let's say I'm paying 5%.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.800
I need this money to run
my business and so on.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.270
So it's some burden, but
usually all the corporations

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:21.580
have significant amount of debt.

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:24.620
So it's good to have debt if
you know how to manage it.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.530
Now let's say in three years
from now, situation changed.

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:32.100
So now I can borrow
money for seven years,

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:35.800
because initially I issued
the bond for 10 years.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:37.920
And now I have seven
years remaining,

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:45.450
but it turns out I
can issue just a 3%.

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:46.870
Basically this
means if I do this,

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:51.980
if I exercise my call option,
then I will save 5 minus 3--

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.690
2%-- times $100 million
times seven years.

01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:57.660
So it's $14 million.

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:02.350
So that's kind of why callable
debt, it's good to issue it,

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.414
because you can save money.

01:16:04.414 --> 01:16:06.580
It's very similar to what's
happening right now also

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:08.670
for private individuals.

01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:13.760
Because in recent year
or couple of years,

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.240
there was lot of refinancing
activity in the US.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.640
Remember rates are at
historical low right now.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.450
So rates are going
down, down, down.

01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:26.630
So let's say if you took
out a mortgage here at 6%,

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:30.030
it was like you could
refinance at here, for example,

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:31.170
the same mortgage.

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.570
You could [INAUDIBLE]
like at 3.5%.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:36.630
So the same [INAUDIBLE] has
happened to corporations.

01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:44.330
So in the US, by default,
all mortgages are callable.

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:46.330
And basically by
default, everybody

01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:48.010
has a right to refinance.

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:50.330
So it's not like you
issue a 30 year bond

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:53.010
and then even you're
paying a huge coupon,

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:54.950
even you can refinance
lower percent-- which

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:56.866
might be the case for
corporation, by the way.

01:16:56.866 --> 01:17:05.880
But by law in the US, all the
mortgages can be refinanced.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.130
So basically, that's the idea.

01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:16.882
So if you price this kind of
instrument as callable bond

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:18.340
then you need to
take into account,

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:23.380
of course, the interest
rate risk because you need

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:26.770
to understand what is the
current level of interest rate

01:17:26.770 --> 01:17:27.840
you can charge.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.860
And also you need
to take into account

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:35.060
the quality of the issuer.

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.130
So if, let's say again, Greece.

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:40.960
Or, let's say, Morgan
Stanley issue debt right now,

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.060
then Morgan Stanley would
pay significantly less.

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:50.030
It's all [INAUDIBLE]
on the fair market.

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:51.950
[INAUDIBLE] result
and subsidies.

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:54.870
And, of course, Morgan Stanley
would pay significantly less

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.090
in the interest because
for the case of Greece,

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:01.570
it is a much higher
default risk.

01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:06.750
And as I mentioned,
the idea is that you,

01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:11.500
in the world of
credit derivatives,

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.400
there is the concept
of hazard rates

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.500
which, again, some curve which
shows how risky the issuer is

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.590
at some point in the future.

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:27.110
And here I show the dynamics
for the forward rates,

01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:30.270
and here is the dynamics
of hazard rates.

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:33.270
It shows you, basically,
how risky the issuer is.

01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:45.160
And then using similar
approach-- I show, give you

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.610
as an exercise-- you
can prove again--

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:53.030
it turns out if you know the
volatility of hazard rates,

01:18:53.030 --> 01:19:01.270
then you know how to simulate
the dynamics of hazard rates.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:06.300
So essentially, it's the
dynamics of all this.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:11.150
So again, it's the idea-- let
me go back just to the stock

01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:13.750
case-- again, it's the
idea, it's very simple.

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:18.550
So you have all the
dynamic variables

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:20.900
like rates and
[INAUDIBLE], in this case.

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:24.100
Then what you do, you simulate
that in risk-neutral world.

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.690
You have different path.

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:27.760
And then you simply
average over the pay-off.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.449
So this is the beauty of
the risk-neutral pricing.

01:19:32.449 --> 01:19:34.865
There is a visual framework
which is basically implemented

01:19:34.865 --> 01:19:36.500
at all the major banks.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.890
Which is really like
the right approach

01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:42.010
to price very exotic
derivatives for which

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:46.830
it's very hard to find the
exact analytical formulas.

01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:56.800
And let me show you one
example of securities

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:00.400
which are issued by big banks.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:05.840
And that's where this HJM model
and Monte Carlo simulation

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:08.612
are used all the time
because the pay-offs are

01:20:08.612 --> 01:20:09.320
very complicated.

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:17.744
And example of such a product
is called structured note.

01:20:17.744 --> 01:20:18.910
So what's a structured note?

01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:27.480
It's-- again, corporations need
to raise money just to run this

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.380
business.

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:32.459
But, of course, I cannot
just get this money for free.

01:20:32.459 --> 01:20:33.625
I need to pay some interest.

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:42.620
And again, if you look at
what happened last year.

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:47.285
Again, at the end of last year,
for example a US 20 year bond

01:20:47.285 --> 01:20:49.260
would pay 1.7%.

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:51.840
And if you also
pay all the taxes,

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.050
then you probably get
something like 1.1%.

01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:58.010
And this might be even
lower than inflation.

01:20:58.010 --> 01:21:00.790
So investors, especially
long-term investors,

01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:04.730
they are not interested in
investing in the US treasuries

01:21:04.730 --> 01:21:10.240
because although it's risk
free, but there's no return.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.900
So you want to
generate some money.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.570
So what can you do, then?

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:17.350
OK, so you don't want to
invest into treasuries.

01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:22.420
So then you can try to
find some corporate bonds.

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:29.670
Again, corporates are risky
compared to the United States

01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:30.170
government.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:41.390
So typical coupon paid
by the corporate bonds

01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:42.920
would be higher.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:48.551
So let's say 5% for a
non-distressed typical US

01:21:48.551 --> 01:21:49.050
corporation.

01:21:52.170 --> 01:21:53.670
But again, 5%.

01:21:53.670 --> 01:22:00.380
Then you need to pay, let's
say, 30% tax top of this.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.290
So you're left 3.3%.

01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:05.660
There's inflation and
so on and so forth.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:09.380
So it still looks
like a low return.

01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:11.250
Of course,
[INAUDIBLE] below, you

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:18.850
can buy some distressed bonds,
say from Greece or maybe

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:21.690
from some distressed
corporations, which

01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:23.070
is a much higher.

01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:25.820
But it becomes
more like gambling.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.250
There's so much
uncertainties there,

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:32.440
so it's more like you
can get very high return,

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:39.040
but you can lose everything
because basically you're

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.730
bearing very high credit risk.

01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:43.160
So what to do in this situation?

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:48.110
Turns out that banks issue
very special securities called

01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:55.850
structured notes which are very
attractive to some investors.

01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:59.170
So let's say Morgan
Stanley-- but instead

01:22:59.170 --> 01:23:02.950
of issuing vanilla bond,
I am issuing-- and at 5%,

01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:07.720
let's say for 10 years-- I issue
a bond which pays 10% a year.

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.860
So much higher coupon.

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:13.800
But I pay you 10% only if
certain market conditions

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.290
are satisfied.

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:18.770
So let's say market
condition like this.

01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:21.740
30 year swap rate is higher
than two year swap rate.

01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:29.230
Let's go back to the
picture which I drew.

01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:35.650
So essentially this means
that if you borrow money, then

01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:38.240
the short term borrowing
rate is smaller

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.480
than the long term
borrowing rate, which

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.420
usually is the case.

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:45.820
So basically, let's assume
I pay you 10% percent

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.580
if two conditions are satisfied.

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:51.810
1% is the 30 year borrowing
rate in the economy right

01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:54.650
now is higher than
two year borrowing

01:23:54.650 --> 01:23:56.630
rate, which is this condition.

01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:58.520
Plus this second condition.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.210
S&P 500 index is
higher than 880.

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:08.430
So now if these
conditions are satisfied,

01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:11.320
then the investor will get 10%.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.190
If one of these
conditions breaks down,

01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:15.950
the investor would get nothing.

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.570
So there are many
investors who would

01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:21.270
like to bear this kind
of risk because they

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:26.870
have certain view on how
the economy would develop.

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:29.600
Because right now, for
example, S&P 500 index

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:36.780
is pretty close to 2,000.

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.990
So it's very unlikely
that it'll go down

01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:45.250
by the factor of
two, which is 880.

01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:46.920
So it's very low probability.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.570
And then also investor believes
that this will never happen.

01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:55.170
So we always will
be in the economy

01:24:55.170 --> 01:25:01.770
where it's still more
expensive to borrow long-term

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:03.420
than short term.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:06.030
So in this case, it
turns out that the coupon

01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:07.290
can be enhanced.

01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:09.950
This is a whole idea
of the structured note.

01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:14.390
So instead of setting
like a plain coupon, 5%,

01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:17.190
I am selling [INAUDIBLE]
the derivative.

01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:19.810
And if investors like
it, it's kind of gambling

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:23.870
but in educated
way because there's

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:27.370
certain economic meaning
of these conditions.

01:25:27.370 --> 01:25:29.300
But this can get high return.

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:35.319
And this is a very popular way
of financing because it turns

01:25:35.319 --> 01:25:37.610
out that investors are buying
this kind of instruments,

01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:38.651
but they are very unique.

01:25:41.927 --> 01:25:43.010
There's a lot very liquid.

01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:45.230
Therefore when issue
this kind of instrument,

01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:48.920
even if you price it correctly
using all the models,

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.140
the bank or
financial institution

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:55.570
which issues these instruments
can make some extra money.

01:25:55.570 --> 01:26:00.140
So effectively it's cheaper
to issue these instruments

01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:02.330
than to issue vanilla bonds.

01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:05.300
And all of these big banks,
they have all the machinery

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.110
to risk manage this kind
of [INAUDIBLE] derivatives.

01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:11.070
So they know what
they are doing.

01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:13.160
So they sell this
kind of product,

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.910
and they're hedging
their exposure.

01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:18.540
And they realize some
profit because you

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.480
can't identify how much
[INAUDIBLE] instrument is.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:22.439
So it's good for banks.

01:26:22.439 --> 01:26:24.313
And it's also good for
investors because they

01:26:24.313 --> 01:26:26.360
are looking for this kind
of yield enhancement.

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.400
They want to have
a higher yield.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.600
And they are
taking-- and they're

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.730
willing to take this risk.

01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:39.300
But again, it's an
educated risk because like,

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.310
this condition, for
example, here, they

01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:43.170
have a very clear
economical meaning.

01:26:43.170 --> 01:26:45.710
So if an investor
understands what's going on,

01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:48.889
then it's a reasonable risk.

01:26:48.889 --> 01:26:50.680
And, of course, what
do you do in this case

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.450
if you want to model
something like this?

01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:55.510
Then it's very
complicated to find

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:58.100
any kind of analytic
approximations

01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:00.360
here in the real world.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.120
So what do we do?

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.560
We simulate the
stock market price.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:11.170
We simulate the 30 year
yield and 10 year yield.

01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:14.570
And we simulate Morgan
Stanley's credit spread.

01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:17.020
And we do it all simultaneously,
at the same time.

01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:20.620
And then we see in the
Monte Carlo simulation

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:24.420
if this condition is satisfied
for every coupon date,

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:27.140
then we're paying 10%.

01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:29.630
If something is broken,
then we are paying 0.

01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:31.660
So if we simulate many,
many paths like this

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:34.920
and then we calculate
the average value of it.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.630
And then we come
up with the price

01:27:36.630 --> 01:27:39.520
and then we quote this
price to the investor.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.961
And again, I say, these
products are very nonstandard.

01:27:41.961 --> 01:27:42.460
That's fine.

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:46.070
You can make some extra money.

01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:50.240
And as a firm, you
save money because it's

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.420
cheaper than to issue
plain vanilla bonds.

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:57.020
And just to give
you the idea where

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:58.550
we are in terms of numbers.

01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:05.430
So here there is a
graph of difference

01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:08.600
between 30 year borrowing
rate and two year borrowing

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:14.060
rate for the last decade.

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:17.070
So you see, this
difference always positive.

01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:22.260
It was negative only very
shortly for some time

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:25.640
around 2005, 2006.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.380
So it's very interesting thing.

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:34.975
So when you price
derivative, then there's

01:28:34.975 --> 01:28:38.100
a notion of
market-implied numbers.

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:42.235
It turns out if you look at
how different instruments are

01:28:42.235 --> 01:28:44.210
priced on the market,
then the probability--

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.600
Then you can ask
a question: What

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:56.200
is the probability
that this-- Let's

01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.530
say if I run, for example, this
stochastically for the last 10

01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:05.720
years, then how--
what the probability

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:10.929
that this difference
is positive.

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:12.637
And then it turns out
probability is only

01:29:12.637 --> 01:29:13.720
80% percent.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.010
Whereas in reality, it was
realized only for a few days.

01:29:18.010 --> 01:29:21.280
So it's significantly lower.

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:24.420
So basically, then, the
investor says like this.

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:27.810
So market give me the
discount, like 80%.

01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:30.950
But I know that this almost
never happen in the past.

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:34.860
Therefore I believe that it
will not happen in the future.

01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:37.680
Maybe it will happen,
but I will still

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.530
make some extra money
because of this.

01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:43.420
So basically we have [INAUDIBLE]
enhancement by a factor 1

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:44.540
divided by 0.8.

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:47.690
1.25%.

01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:49.830
Second thing is about S&P 500.

01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:53.720
If you look at the history of
this index, which is basically

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.960
the main US market
index, then you

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:07.300
see that it was historically
above 880 level for 94 days out

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:08.930
of 100 days.

01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:10.750
So very, very high probability.

01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:16.194
But the market implies this will
be the case only in 75% case.

01:30:16.194 --> 01:30:17.860
The credit investor
would say like this.

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:22.890
OK, now S&P 500 is around 1,800.

01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:26.340
So what the probability it's
going to drop below 880?

01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:27.890
Of course there is
some probability,

01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:30.360
but if it's going to
happen because it will mean

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.570
a very serious
recession, and it looks

01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:34.640
like the economy is improving.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:36.880
The market might
drop down, but maybe

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:40.890
to the level of 1,500, 1,400.

01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:42.130
But not that low.

01:30:42.130 --> 01:30:48.570
Therefore the investor believes
that he, by taking this risk,

01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:52.640
he will again get
a higher coupon.

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:54.960
So [INAUDIBLE] very popular
instruments which are

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:58.754
solely price by Monte Carlo
simulation, which-- we have

01:30:58.754 --> 01:30:59.920
big businesses, for example,

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:04.200
like Morgan Stanley, whose
goal is to raise capital

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.680
by selling these exotic
products and hedging them using

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:11.170
the Monte Carlo framework.

01:31:11.170 --> 01:31:13.900
And if the interest rates
are crucial for dynamics,

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:18.260
then we use the HJM model for
simulating interest rates.

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:21.210
So that's everything
I wanted to tell you

01:31:21.210 --> 01:31:23.790
about today, so
thank you very much.

01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:25.770
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:28.245 --> 01:31:29.730
DENIS GOROKHOV: Yeah?

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:31.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
simulation.

01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:34.927
Is there some choice-- you
might make certain choices

01:31:34.927 --> 01:31:36.560
based on historical precedence?

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.310
DENIS GOROKHOV: It's
a very good question.

01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:40.200
So, in reality.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.930
So here's what happens.

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:48.140
So let's go to a very
simple case of stock prices.

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:53.710
So again, r here basically
is just the borrowing rate.

01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:55.960
It's like, let's say, whatever
the bank account gives.

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:56.960
Which is known.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.210
So the only parameter which
isn't known is volatility.

01:31:59.210 --> 01:32:04.170
So usually, you have
liquid stocks, for example.

01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:06.020
Like IBM, Apple.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:10.650
Then there are a lot
of derivatives traded,

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.180
which are very liquid.

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:18.902
This means that you can imply
this sigma from the price

01:32:18.902 --> 01:32:21.030
of liquid derivatives.

01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:24.630
Because you know, for example,
that this particular option--

01:32:24.630 --> 01:32:27.580
let's say today
Apple traded at 600--

01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:31.750
and you know that at the money
option, so option with a strike

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:35.320
600, in one year now, for
example, it's worth whatever.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.250
Like $50, for example.

01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:40.420
By knowing this, you
can imply this sigma.

01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.170
So the whole idea is like this.

01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:45.540
So you take very liquid
derivatives, like standard call

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:49.340
options, and you
imply this sigma.

01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:51.240
And then you use
this model to price

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:53.561
really truly exotic derivatives,
which are not vitally

01:32:53.561 --> 01:32:54.060
available.

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.393
That's how big banks make money.

01:32:55.393 --> 01:32:56.910
Because we know
how to price them.

01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:58.830
We have clients come in.

01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:03.060
And we see the prices of
very liquid instruments

01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:04.550
and we buy them to hedge.

01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:07.770
So very often what we do is
that we do some very complicated

01:33:07.770 --> 01:33:11.190
deal, but we have an
ability to off-load it

01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:14.514
into simpler contracts,
which we know how to price.

01:33:14.514 --> 01:33:15.180
That's the idea.

01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:18.470
And the same is true for
all the other derivatives,

01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:20.670
from credit derivatives or
[INAUDIBLE] derivatives.

01:33:20.670 --> 01:33:23.510
So you try to imply the
sigma from the market.

01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:26.280
If there is no way
to do this-- which

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:29.424
is very often the case for
credit derivatives because

01:33:29.424 --> 01:33:31.090
for the credit
derivatives, credit vol--

01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:36.780
is not very liquid,
not liquidly traded.

01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:39.350
Then the best thing
that you can do

01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:42.450
is to take historical estimates.

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:46.750
So we also do this.

01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:49.134
There is nothing else.

01:33:49.134 --> 01:33:49.990
Yeah.

01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.506
Yeah?

01:33:50.506 --> 01:33:51.922
AUDIENCE: On your
last slide where

01:33:51.922 --> 01:33:56.028
you talked about the implied
frequency of the S&P 500

01:33:56.028 --> 01:33:57.966
being lower than 880?

01:33:57.966 --> 01:33:58.840
DENIS GOROKHOV: Yeah.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.548
AUDIENCE: Was that
from historical quotes

01:34:00.548 --> 01:34:02.380
or current quotes?

01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:06.640
DENIS GOROKHOV:
OK This number, I

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:17.180
think, if you go to the end
of 2012 and go back to 2002.

01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:18.580
10 years into the past.

01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:28.250
Then I think it was
above 880 in 94% of case.

01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:29.630
We can go back.

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:33.240
So remember, just to the slide
I showed in the very beginning.

01:34:36.459 --> 01:34:37.250
Here it was, right.

01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:40.290
So 880 is somewhere here.

01:34:40.290 --> 01:34:42.290
2012 is here.

01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:45.630
You go back 2002.

01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:52.550
It was below 880 around
2000, internet bubble.

01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:59.380
And around, say, 2008, 2009 when
we had major banking crisis.

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:00.490
[INAUDIBLE] just now.

01:35:00.490 --> 01:35:04.340
So you can see
probability is not

01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.820
very high based on historicals.

01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:07.778
These kind of people
believe that in the future

01:35:07.778 --> 01:35:09.780
it might happen,
but then the stock

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:12.760
will go back again because
the government will intervene

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:13.720
and so on and so forth.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:15.770
That's the way of thinking
of these investors

01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:18.140
who invest into structured
notes like this.

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.980
AUDIENCE: So for the
implied frequency,

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.180
that's from the current--

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:23.540
DENIS GOROKHOV: Exactly.

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.300
AUDIENCE: --option prices--

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:25.280
DENIS GOROKHOV: Exactly.

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:25.750
Exactly.

01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:26.250
Exactly.

01:35:26.250 --> 01:35:28.580
Exactly.

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:31.950
So now that's how
historical was obtained.

01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:33.672
Ah, let me see.

01:35:40.462 --> 01:35:40.962
[INAUDIBLE]

01:35:46.690 --> 01:35:47.190
Yeah.

01:35:47.190 --> 01:35:48.654
Well, let me see.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:55.590
So, yes.

01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:56.470
So it's like this.

01:35:56.470 --> 01:36:02.840
So you're today and you
have your Monte Carlo model.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.800
And you simulated going
forward for 10 years

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:13.050
and you see what the
probability to be below 880.

01:36:13.050 --> 01:36:15.190
And actually, much
higher because usually

01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:21.770
the market is
extremely risk-averse.

01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:24.980
So if you're buying a deep
out of the money option

01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:28.690
you usually-- there is--
everybody requires premium.

01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:32.220
Because if this happens,
if you don't really like

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:36.020
charge enough money, basically
that you're out of business.

01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:38.200
That is how I obtain
this number, what, 75%.

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:41.340
Whatever.

01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:42.753
OK.

01:36:42.753 --> 01:36:44.637
Yeah?

01:36:44.637 --> 01:36:49.710
AUDIENCE: So is the pricing
of these more exotic products

01:36:49.710 --> 01:36:52.030
totally reliant
upon Monte Carlo,

01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:54.240
or are there other techniques?

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.090
DENIS GOROKHOV: I mean,
usually it's Monte Carlo.

01:36:57.090 --> 01:37:02.010
So there are some derivatives
where analytical approximations

01:37:02.010 --> 01:37:02.940
are available.

01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:06.880
For example, for
interest rate derivative.

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.910
Swaps are like a very
simple linear product.

01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:12.170
To price them, you
need discount function.

01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:13.560
So it's just arithmetic.

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.040
Of course, it's all done,
just simple arithmetic.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.630
For swaptions,
standard swaptions,

01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:20.690
there is a model
called SABR model which

01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:22.670
allows some kind of
semi-analytical solutions,

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:25.900
which are approximate
but of high quality.

01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:27.140
Then you can do it.

01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:29.170
But there are different
schools of thought.

01:37:29.170 --> 01:37:32.380
Because with some
approximations,

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:35.070
which might fail for some
if maturity is very long,

01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:38.430
or it's very-- very deep
out of the money option.

01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:43.120
So very often what traders do,
even if their official numbers

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.520
are only-- more simplified
models which kind of has

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.150
some formula, they still round
the Monte Carlo simulation

01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:52.260
for the whole
portfolio to understand

01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:56.994
what the most complicated
model, like in terms

01:37:56.994 --> 01:37:58.660
of your present value
of your portfolio,

01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.182
in terms of the risk.

01:38:00.182 --> 01:38:01.640
But, of course,
this kind of double

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.730
range accruals, which
are just [INAUDIBLE].

01:38:04.730 --> 01:38:07.240
It's impossible to build any
meaningful analytical model.

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:11.230
You can do something,
but you won't

01:38:11.230 --> 01:38:12.540
be able to be competitive.

01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:16.392
It's just all Monte
Carlo simulation.

01:38:16.392 --> 01:38:19.380
AUDIENCE: So you said
usually this whole simulation

01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:22.190
process takes an hour
on a MATLAB program?

01:38:24.389 --> 01:38:25.180
DENIS GOROKHOV: No.

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:26.040
No.

01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.770
It takes probably
like one hour just

01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:30.580
to write the whole program,
because it's very simple.

01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.450
So what you do, you
have Brownian motion.

01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:34.260
But what you do.

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.170
MATLAB generates
Brownian motion.

01:38:36.170 --> 01:38:37.660
So you just do it.

01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:41.060
And then you write the
change in your price

01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:43.470
is equal to your
drift, which you know,

01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:44.720
plus some random number.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:47.510
And you basically just
simulate different path.

01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:49.600
And then if you
price a call option,

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:54.920
you know the distribution
of your stock prices,

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.920
let's say, in one year
from now with maturities.

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:57.919
And you just do average.

01:38:57.919 --> 01:39:00.270
So it might take
someone 15 minutes

01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:01.910
to write this kind of program.

01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:05.350
This is so you can verify
numerically the accuracy

01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:08.810
of the-- verify numerically
Black-Scholes formula,

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:09.750
for example.

01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:11.745
But the idea fits
very simple here.

01:39:11.745 --> 01:39:13.620
But, of course, for
these complicated models,

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.920
which you-- for term
structure process like HJM,

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:19.890
because it's already
one-dimensional object.

01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:23.070
And, of course, it's
much more complicated

01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:26.200
because besides
pricing, you need

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.400
to have this idea of
calibration as you mentioned,

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.180
because these volatilities are
not just usually historical.

01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:34.467
They're implied from
other instruments.

01:39:34.467 --> 01:39:36.050
So what you do in
practice, like this.

01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:38.510
So if you have liquid
instruments, liquid options,

01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:40.370
you have the model.

01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:42.210
But the model has
unknown parameters.

01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:43.890
First, we do the calibration.

01:39:43.890 --> 01:39:45.870
So we make sure that
our model prices all

01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:47.260
the simple instruments.

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.950
And then we take the
derivative whose price

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:55.660
is unknown because it's just
something very complicated.

01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:57.580
And then we just price
it, but our model's

01:39:57.580 --> 01:39:59.180
calibrated to
simple derivatives.

01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:01.510
And this tells us--
then this model,

01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:04.290
after pricing it and
running sensitivity

01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:05.730
with respect to
market parameters,

01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:08.580
tells us how to hedge it.

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:11.149
That's the idea.

01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:12.940
AUDIENCE: You ought to
do post-hoc analyses

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:17.615
to see how the models did in
the past so you can adjust them.

01:40:17.615 --> 01:40:18.490
DENIS GOROKHOV: Yeah.

01:40:18.490 --> 01:40:19.556
Yeah.

01:40:19.556 --> 01:40:21.722
AUDIENCE: Is that a big
part of what you have to do?

01:40:25.874 --> 01:40:27.540
DENIS GOROKHOV: I
will say in general we

01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:29.110
are moving to this direction.

01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:35.020
In general, of course, for Monte
Carlo-- from the [INAUDIBLE]

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.630
point of view for complicated
Monte Carlo model,

01:40:37.630 --> 01:40:40.070
it's very difficult
to do technically.

01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:42.500
It's very difficult.
But if you do it,

01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:46.240
you cannot afford simple models
like for swaps and so on.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.674
AUDIENCE: --historical
experience

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:50.439
with the projection
that you made.

01:40:50.439 --> 01:40:51.230
DENIS GOROKHOV: No.

01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:53.160
But the situation,
it's very different.

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.730
So we don't make any
predictions here, remember.

01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:57.090
It's risk-neutral pricing.

01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:58.980
Just no prediction here.

01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.460
What we do here is like this.

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.110
If we are a bank
and we want to trade

01:41:07.110 --> 01:41:09.110
all kinds of very
exotic derivatives

01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:13.440
which nobody knows
how to price but

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.910
we have clients who want to buy
them with different reasons.

01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:19.170
Might want to
speculate or they want

01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:23.650
to manage their risk exposure
and so on and so forth.

01:41:23.650 --> 01:41:26.990
So nobody knows except
for like 10, 20 banks,

01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.740
how to price them.

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:29.345
Because this is like, you
need to have infrastructure.

01:41:29.345 --> 01:41:31.160
You need to know how to do this.

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:34.070
Then you need to have
some business channels,

01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:35.500
how to off-load this risk.

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:38.110
So this is some very
exotic products.

01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:41.330
So now the idea of dynamic
hedging is like this.

01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:43.520
Remember, in the case
of Black-Scholes.

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:51.480
You buy an option
and then you hedge it

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.240
by holding a certain
amount of the underlying.

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.120
So you don't make any money.

01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:04.170
But you want to make sure that
whatever happens to the market,

01:42:04.170 --> 01:42:05.110
you're fully hedged.

01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:07.680
So the market moves here,
you don't make any money.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:13.070
The market moves down,
you don't make any money.

01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:16.210
So the way how you make money
in this situation, basically

01:42:16.210 --> 01:42:20.930
this Black-Scholes formula,
in this case, the price which

01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:24.740
you charge for the
option is the price

01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.560
of executing the
hedging strategy.

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.500
So if you charge
a little bit more,

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:31.850
this is extra money
which you can make.

01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:32.980
So it's very different.

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:36.500
So what you just mentioned
is like proprietary business.

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:39.710
Big banks, they are not
supposed to do this.

01:42:39.710 --> 01:42:41.944
It's more like a
hedge fund world.

01:42:41.944 --> 01:42:42.860
Very different models.

01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:48.220
What we do, we try to manage
big portfolios of derivatives,

01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:50.010
all kinds of derivatives.

01:42:50.010 --> 01:42:56.010
And we try to price them and
charge a little bit extra so

01:42:56.010 --> 01:42:57.510
that we can make our living.

01:42:57.510 --> 01:43:00.420
But on the other hand,
we don't take any risk.

01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:02.300
That's the idea.

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.170
[INAUDIBLE] just models.

01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:07.090
So from point of view in
terms of testing historically,

01:43:07.090 --> 01:43:08.470
you can still ask a question.

01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:13.930
Let's say if I go back 10 years.

01:43:13.930 --> 01:43:16.080
And let's say 10 years
ago, I would sell,

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.840
for example, this stock option.

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.320
And for the next 10 years,
using historical data,

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:26.170
I see basically
how-- my model then

01:43:26.170 --> 01:43:29.790
tells me what my Greeks or
like what my sensitivity

01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:32.716
with respect to the
underlying-- what

01:43:32.716 --> 01:43:34.590
my sensitivity with
respect to underlying is.

01:43:34.590 --> 01:43:36.860
And then you can ask a question.

01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:40.950
How was this delta H
performing historically?

01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:44.730
Which is a reasonable
question because maybe you

01:43:44.730 --> 01:43:47.730
assume that the model
pretty much continuous.

01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:50.110
But maybe if your
dynamics is very jerky,

01:43:50.110 --> 01:43:53.120
then you can just lose money
because you just don't take

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.030
into account these effects.

01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:57.494
This is an example of historical
analysis which we may run,

01:43:57.494 --> 01:43:59.410
but it has nothing to
do with prediction here.

01:43:59.410 --> 01:44:00.743
So it's a whole different world.

01:44:00.743 --> 01:44:02.480
So it's risk-neutral pricing.

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.680
So we don't take any risk.

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:04.751
That's the whole idea.

01:44:04.751 --> 01:44:07.000
But due to the fact that
derivatives are very complex,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.690
even in this case, still
banks bear some residual risk,

01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:16.430
because remember we cannot
exactly off-load it, the risk.

01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.730
So we still have
some assumptions

01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:22.520
that we can re-balance our
position dynamically and move

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:25.820
forward, basically,
and not lose money.

01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:28.206
That's the idea of it.

01:44:28.206 --> 01:44:33.970
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the Monte Carlo pricing.

01:44:33.970 --> 01:44:37.460
You can set up the Monte
Carlo using implied parameters

01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:39.685
from current prices
of various derivatives

01:44:39.685 --> 01:44:43.672
in the market, which gives
you a good baseline price.

01:44:43.672 --> 01:44:46.395
I'm wondering what
other Monte Carlos

01:44:46.395 --> 01:44:53.200
do you do to have a robust
estimate of pricing, hedging

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:55.690
cost.

01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:58.310
I would think that there
would be, I don't know,

01:44:58.310 --> 01:45:04.846
maybe some stress scenarios
in the market or alternatives.

01:45:04.846 --> 01:45:08.480
You probably don't
just do one Monte Carlo

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:10.850
study with current parameters.

01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:13.040
You probably have
different sets.

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.950
And I'm wondering how
extensive is that?

01:45:17.255 --> 01:45:18.380
DENIS GOROKHOV: Absolutely.

01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:18.963
You are right.

01:45:18.963 --> 01:45:21.020
So if you just do
the Monte Carlo,

01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:23.140
then you just know the price.

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:27.115
But price is nothing,
because dynamic hedging,

01:45:27.115 --> 01:45:28.490
all this business
of derivatives,

01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:30.550
it's not just about how
much it's right now,

01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:33.380
but what to do if the
market behaves this way.

01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:36.120
So of course you could
collate all your Greeks.

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.140
That's very important.

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:41.160
But Greeks is like,
say, your delta.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.340
It's all about linear terms.

01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:44.460
So of course it's a
very important thing.

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.160
What happen to the
portfolio, let's

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.960
say, if there is a very
sharp, for example,

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.180
jump in interest rate.

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:55.950
So let's say, what happens
if rates jump forward by 1%.

01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:57.590
Or if they jump down.

01:45:57.590 --> 01:46:02.390
What happens if volatility
in a particular time,

01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:04.320
region, for example, blows up.

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.040
You run all these
kind of analyses.

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:09.380
So it's big departments
at the banks who

01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:10.685
look at all this kind of risks.

01:46:10.685 --> 01:46:15.919
So it all comes to
one business unit

01:46:15.919 --> 01:46:17.710
which looks all kinds
of risks of the firm.

01:46:20.490 --> 01:46:27.150
It's a very big
thing for the bank.

01:46:27.150 --> 01:46:29.190
This notion of stress test.

01:46:29.190 --> 01:46:31.780
Basically right now,
all of the banks

01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:33.980
are very heavily regulated
by the government.

01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:36.210
So the government can
tell us what happens.

01:46:36.210 --> 01:46:38.060
For example, for
the whole bank--

01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.477
not just for a particular
desk which trades,

01:46:40.477 --> 01:46:41.310
whatever, swaptions.

01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:44.800
What happens to all your bank,
to all kinds of cash flows

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.430
which you can have
if, let's say,

01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:49.110
interest rates jump
by 100% percent.

01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:54.870
We have a huge group of people,
quants, IT, risk managers,

01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:56.870
who are looking at all
these numbers trying

01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:57.900
to understand it.

01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:02.340
And for a big bank, very
non-trivial problem, actually.

01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:04.195
So it's very good point.

01:47:04.195 --> 01:47:08.190
But, of course, we
do as good as we can.

01:47:08.190 --> 01:47:10.022
Yeah.

01:47:10.022 --> 01:47:11.347
AUDIENCE: Well, thanks again.

01:47:11.347 --> 01:47:12.930
And for a little
time afterwards for--

01:47:12.930 --> 01:47:13.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:47:13.530 --> 01:47:14.723
DENIS GOROKHOV: Thank you.

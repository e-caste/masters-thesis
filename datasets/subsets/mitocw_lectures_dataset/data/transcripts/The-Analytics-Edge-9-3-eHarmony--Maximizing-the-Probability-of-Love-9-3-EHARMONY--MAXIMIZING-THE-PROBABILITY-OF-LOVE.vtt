00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.350
In the optimization
problem, we assumed

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.480
the compatibility
scores were data

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.890
that we could input directly
into the optimization model.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.150
But where do these
scores come from?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.240
In the words of the founder--
Neil Clark Warren --opposites

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.320
attract, then they attack.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.180
eHarmony's compatibility
match score

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.070
is based on similarity
between users' answers

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.340
to the questionnaire.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.370
Let us attempt to
demonstrate an approach

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.750
to develop compatibility scores.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.320
We utilize public data from
eHarmony containing features

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.060
for 275,000 users and
binary compatibility.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.070
Feature names and
exact values are

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.920
masked to protect
users' privacy.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.260
Correspondingly we won't be
able to directly interpret

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.400
which features are
important as we do not

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.250
know the identity
of these features.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.030
We used logistic regression
on pairs of users' differences

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.080
to predict compatibility.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520
To reduce the size
of the problem,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.260
we filtered the data to include
only users in the Boston area

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.710
who have compatibility scores
listed in the data set.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.020
We computed absolute difference
in features for these 1,475

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.930
pairs and trained a
logistic regression model

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.450
on these differences.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.200
Let us observe the results
of this experiment.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.340
If we use a low threshold in
the logistic regression model,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.930
we predict more false
positives but also get

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.140
more true positives.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.100
For example, the
classification matrix

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.759
for threshold equal
to 0.2 is as follows.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.580
Note that we found 1,030
pairs that are not compatible

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.090
and 92 pairs that are
compatible correctly.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.900
Note that 92 out of 319--
which is 227 plus 92 --of these

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.780
were correctly identified.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.480
That is, 29% percent of
the matches we recommend

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.440
would be successful, a very high
success rate for online dating.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.160
Clearly, there is a
potential for using

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.170
many other analytic methods.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.079
Specifically trees,
which are especially

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.890
useful for predicting
compatibility

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.730
if there are nonlinear
relationships

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.090
between variables.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.160
Clustering is another
potential approach

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.390
with the idea of
segmenting the users.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.660
Finally, text analytics
is yet another approach

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.100
with the idea of analyzing
the text of users' profiles.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.150
Of course, many other
techniques are possible.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.630
To give some intuition
of various features,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.220
let us see how the
probability of a match

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.000
changes with the distance
between the two adults.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.430
It is interesting to note
that the probability drops

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.770
with distance, and then
for a very long distance,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.900
the probability increases again.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.190
Also interesting
is this graph that

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.890
shows that if the attractiveness
is too high or too low,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.160
the probability of a
successful match decreases.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.530
Finally, if the difference in
height is too high or too low,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.000
the probability of
the match also drops.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.480
It seems the sweet spot
is a difference in height

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.370
between four and eight inches.

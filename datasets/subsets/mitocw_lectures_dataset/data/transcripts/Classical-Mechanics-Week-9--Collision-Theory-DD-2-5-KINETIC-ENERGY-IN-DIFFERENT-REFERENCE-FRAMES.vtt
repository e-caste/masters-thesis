00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.850
Let's compare kinetic
energies in a two particle

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.190
one-dimensional collision in
different reference frames.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.040
So we could have
one reference frame

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.870
in which particle 1 is
coming in and particle 2 is

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.370
moving like that.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.750
And in particular-- so we can
call this the ground frame.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.850
And now let's consider
the center of mass frame.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.780
And in the center
of mass frame, let's

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.670
remind you that when we have
two different reference frames,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.510
the velocity-- we'll call
this the ground frame

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.900
g-- in the ground frame is equal
to the velocity of the object--

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.990
we'll actually write it
this way, just unprime,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.890
V1-- the velocity in the
center of mass frame--

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.560
so this is the velocity
in the cm frame--

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.770
plus the relative velocities
between the frames.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.290
And that's why that's the
velocity of the center of mass.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.080
So this was our
rule for describing

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.077
how velocities change in
different reference frames.

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:08.910
And so we can draw the
picture in the center

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:17.400
of mass frame, V1 initial
prime and V2 initial prime.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.650
Now let's compare
kinetic energies

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.460
in these different frames.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.600
So we know that
the kinetic energy

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.690
in the center of mass frame is
just 1/2 m1 V1 initial squared

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.650
prime-- put the prime
there-- plus 1/2

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.150
V2 initial prime
squared, kinetic energy

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.680
in the center of mass frame.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.789
How do we calculate the kinetic
energy in the lab frame?

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.190
Well, that's a little
bit more complicated.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.710
And we'll need a little
algebra to start that.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.640
So let's put kinetic
energy in the ground frame.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.230
We know is 1/2 m1
V1 initial squared

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.370
plus 1/2 m2 V2 initial squared.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.978
Now what I have to do is use the
law, the velocity relationship.

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:13.620
And this is going to take
a little bit algebra.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.900
We have m1-- I'll write
V1 prime plus Vcm.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.300
And remember that any quantity
squared is the dot product,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.130
V dot V. So I'm going
to dot this with itself.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.960
V1 initial prime plus
the center of mass.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.579
And I have the second
term which looks

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.320
identical to this first term.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.820
I'll write it all
the way down here.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.240
1/2 m2 V2 initial
prime plus Vcm.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:59.810
Vector dot scalar dot product
of V2 initial prime plus Vcm.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.300
Now when you take a
dot product, remember

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.860
there's four terms here.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.050
There's V1 prime dot V1 prime,
which is just V1 prime squared.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.422
There's V center of mass
dot V center of mass.

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:13.880
So that's V center
of mass squared.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.620
And then there's the cross term.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.290
And because they're identical,
there's a factor of 2.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.690
And it will be repeated below.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:28.340
So the kinetic energy in
the ground frame is 1/2 m1.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.760
So we'll take v1 i prime
dotted with itself.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.940
That's V1 i prime squared.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.890
We have the cross
term, which is a factor

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.050
of 2, which will cancel this.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.810
So the cross term is . m1.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.990
That canceled the factor of 2.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:54.720
V1 i prime dot Vcm plus
the Vcm with itself.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.980
So that's 1/2 m1 Vcm squared.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.769
Now I have exactly the
same thing on the next one.

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:02.810
So we'll write that down.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:11.240
1/2 V2 i prime squared
plus m2 V2i prime dot Vcm.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.050
That's the same in both.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.420
Plus 1/2 m2 Vcm squared.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.260
Now let's look
carefully at what we.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.260
Have 1/2 m1 V1 prime squared.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.050
This is an m2.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.960
1/2 m2 V2 i prime squared.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.010
So we have 1/2 m1
V1i prime squared

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.722
plus 1/2 m2 V2i prime squared.

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:41.930
And you're already noticing
that's the kinetic energy

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.090
in the center of mass frame.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:52.159
We have the total mass,
1/2 m1 plus m2 Vcm squared.

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.530
I can just put a
little check to show

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.659
which terms I've done so far.

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.850
And now here's the
interesting one.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:12.710
We have m1 V1i prime plus
m2 V2i prime dot Vcm.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.920
That represents this term
and this term added together.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.360
But recall that the center
of mass reference frame

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.280
is defined by the condition
that the total momentum

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.190
in that frame is zero.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.800
So this term is zero.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.640
And thus, we get that the
kinetic energy in the ground

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.780
frame is equal to
the kinetic energy

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:49.280
in the center of mass frame
plus 1/2 m1 plus m2 times Vcm

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.050
squared.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.120
And that's how kinetic energy is
in different reference frames.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.620
And the next thing
we'll look at is

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.810
how that changes when
we have a collision.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.470
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.230
Let's dive right into education.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
And, you know, this is the
other side of the innovation

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.620
equation, right?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.870
We've talked in
terms of institutions

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.150
and linking and
connecting institutions,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.810
and we've talked a lot about
R&D and the R&D system,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.060
but you know, from
the first class on,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.950
Romer taught us
that the talent base

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.070
is a very critical
consideration in innovation.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.440
And how do you build
up the talent base?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.090
That's essentially our
set of tests today.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.500
So, first, Norm Augustine.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.440
I wanted to acquaint
you with Norm Augustine,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.560
because in the science
and technology community,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.170
he's known as St. Augustine.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.030
And he is just an
incredible stand-up figure

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.350
on issues like the importance
of federal R&D investment.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.210
He was chairman for
a lengthy period

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.930
of time of Lockheed Martin.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.390
He won the President's
Medal of Technology.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.090
Just a noted innovator,
himself, but also a true expert

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.700
on R&D issues, R&D policies.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.740
Unfailingly helpful and willing
to volunteer for whatever task

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.920
the National Academies
or in many cases MIT,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.970
or other organizations kind
of need help and advice

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.360
from a real senior
statesman, Augustine

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.360
has always been willing
to step up to the plate.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.360
So he's kind of a
remarkable figure.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.300
He led the rising against
the Gathering Storm report

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.780
back in 2000--

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.300
around the early
2000s timetable--

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.830
along with people
like Chuck Vest,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.080
and a really noted
community of other experts,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.760
that made the argument for a
very significant R&D increase

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.710
for the physical
science agencies.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.640
Around that time, we
had been doubling NIH.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.830
This report made the
case for doubling

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.010
the physical science-based
R&D areas, as well.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.820
And it was a very influential
and important report.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.160
He was one of the
real leaders of it,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.530
and he played an important
role, along with Chuck Vest,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.050
in helping persuade the
latest Bush administration--

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.400
hi, Karen-- to adopt
its recommendations.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.350
So there was a period
of time of ongoing R&D

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.950
increases for the
physical science agencies.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.760
So the report had a result.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.180
In addition, he came back
and wrote this 2007 report

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.000
that just kind of
summarized the trouble

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.930
the US has got on the Science
and Technology education front.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.080
So it's a 2007
snapshot, but it's still

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.137
a great little
collection of key points.

00:03:17.137 --> 00:03:18.970
I'm just going to
summarize it very briefly.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.690
Key finding number one was
that US children are not

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.570
prepared for the
21st century jobs,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.760
and he has data
sets, as you know,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.840
to back all these points up.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.670
Children in school
are being taught

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.600
by teachers that are not
trained in the fields of math

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.220
and science that
they're teaching in,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.300
which is a major underlying
problem in those students

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.390
picking up those fields.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.960
US children are falling
behind their foreign peers

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.530
and counterparts in science
and technology areas.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.780
The US K through 12
system just is not

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.000
performing in a way that's
comparable to many other

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.650
systems in the world.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.500
And then, kind of a fourth point
is that US secondary education

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.157
isn't preparing students--

00:04:16.157 --> 00:04:17.490
aside from the teacher problem--

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.860
for math, science, or
engineering majors,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.170
and too few students--

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.310
this is the key point--

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.890
are majoring in
those disciplines

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.120
to yield the talent
base that we need

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.305
for technology-related careers.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.650
And just to underscore
that, the US

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.710
ranks 17th among developed
nations in the proportion

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.990
of college students
receiving degrees in science

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.040
and engineering, and it
fell from third place

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.500
30 years before.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.730
So these are dilemmas that the
US K through 12 system has.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.890
So that's the K
through 12 story.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.250
Then we shift to our
friend Paul Romer,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.710
who we visited at the
outset of this class.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.360
And as you know, he
taught at Stanford,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.250
and then has been
teaching at NYU.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.700
He's now chief economist
to the World Bank,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.850
where he's been a fascinating
critic of economics and changes

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.140
and reforms that field
needs to go through.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.400
But he came up with prospector
theory, and in a way,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.960
what he's playing out here in
this pretty noted critique from

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.790
2000-- which is still
quite widely read--

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.470
his critique is, what
happened to the supply?

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.480
What are our supply breakdowns?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.440
And then he's identified
those supply breakdowns

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.230
with higher education
institutions.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.490
What are they
failing to deliver?

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.040
So the issue is that
the federal government

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.990
policies in science
and technology

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.470
tend to subsidize demand.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.710
So in the private sector,
it's primarily tax incentives,

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.880
R&D tax credits.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.700
And you promote
demand to encourage

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.230
science and engineering talent.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.070
That policy approach, which
is astronomically expensive--

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.940
those are very
expensive policies--

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.610
that policy approach
doesn't inquire

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.640
about the supply response
that hopefully those subsidies

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.510
elicit.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.860
And he goes back and argues that
the institutional arrangements

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.210
in universities, which are the
key institutions on the supply

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.270
side, are geared to meeting
the needs in a variety of ways.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.270
So there needs to be
a new incentive system

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.570
to start to turn
around the supply side

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.890
because the current demand-based
tax incentive system just

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.720
isn't doing that.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.480
So that's his overall frame.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.140
In the 20th century, he argues,
rapid technological progress

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.690
drove unprecedented growth.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.170
We know that argument.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.740
And that was fostered by a
publicly supported system

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.170
of education.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.410
So a steady flow
of trained talent,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.850
trained in the
scientific method,

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.540
was a core policy that
evolved over time,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:40.800
but that public policy approach
ignored the structures that

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.710
were supposed to deliver
that talent base,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.690
i.e. the higher
education system,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.060
and the incentives
and disincentives

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.510
within that higher education
structure that make that supply

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.250
side problematic.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.620
So he would argue that
a governmental-- set

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.180
of governmental programs
to speed up innovation

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.860
gets thwarted by the
supply side problem,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.770
in particular by the
higher education structure.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.690
So government programs
focused on the demand and not

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.010
the supply side are going
to undermine the innovation

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.300
capabilities that we need.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.230
Then he steps back and kind of
makes the innovation argument

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.250
for us.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.323
He argues that
speeding up growth

00:08:28.323 --> 00:08:29.740
is really the only
way we're going

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.720
to be able to cope with
the oncoming demographics

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.990
that we talked about when
we discuss the health care

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.450
innovation system.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.289
He says that a conservative
estimate of the return on R&D

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:47.280
spending would be a 25% return.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.670
There's arguments that that's
low, that it's well over 50%,

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.910
but let's accept his 25%.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.320
His argument is that if you--

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.510
in theory, that if you
increased R&D spending

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:04.530
by 2% of GDP, voila, we'd
get a half percentage

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.650
point of growth.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.150
Right?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.660
In an economy that has
0.7% growth at the moment,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.610
this is not a minor concept.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.660
Right?

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.660
And the data would tend to--

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.100
it at least in
theory-- bear him out.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.290
But then you run into
the barrier, right?

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.490
You have to look
at the full system,

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.310
and that means also
looking at the talent.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:33.240
So just increasing the
R&D spending per se

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:39.230
doesn't address what he
calls the supply side,

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.770
and if the total number of
scientists and engineers

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.130
is fixed, then you limit--

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.770
and this is pure
prospector's theory,

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.900
as you remember from
our first class--

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.050
then you limit the biggest
input into innovation, and thus

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.600
into growth.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.680
So by not expanding its supply
of scientists and engineers,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.810
i.e. the talent
base, then the US

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.350
is limiting its growth capacity
by a pretty significant amount,

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.060
he argues, in economic terms.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.630
So what's broken down?

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.940
What what's the heart
of the problem, here?

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:24.860
And this is a deep critique
of higher education, which

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.460
was highly controversial when
this came out and occasioned

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.920
a lot of criticism of Romer, but
it's hard to dispute his data,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.170
and you will probably see
this from your own experiences

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:43.250
or the experiences of colleagues
in other universities.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:48.020
So what's broken down on
the talent supply side?

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.780
He argues that universities
measure themselves

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:56.025
by their ability to select
top SAT scoring students.

00:10:56.025 --> 00:10:57.650
In other words, they
measure themselves

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.560
by the quality input
they're able to attract,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.380
not by their output.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.965
There's no output
measures in this system.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.340
They're competing
with each other

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.710
in things like US
News and World Report

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:15.800
on the students they attract,
not on the student outcomes

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.520
that they're creating.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.630
So the traditional liberal
arts university, he argues,

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.980
faces little pressure to
respond to skills needs.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.280
That economic messaging
that's inherent in the system

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.580
doesn't get translated back to
the higher education system.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:39.170
So, meanwhile, the university
has a fixed investment

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.050
in its faculty that are
teaching in many areas--

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.310
including the sciences, but
obviously outside the sciences.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.460
There is internal
pressure to maintain

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.580
the relative size of those
departments, which are--

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.710
they have invested in.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.572
And that, in turn--

00:11:57.572 --> 00:11:59.030
and we'll discuss
why in a minute--

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.700
but makes it more
difficult for students

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.970
to get science degrees.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.460
So the science
faculties, he argues,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.610
are happy to do what
they call "maintain

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:20.030
professional standards," i.e.
have a lot of lower grades.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:24.050
And effectively what that does
is force out of the system

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.480
a tremendous amount of talent
because, again, they've

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.580
got fixed faculty sizes that
aren't coordinated with what

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.860
national talent
supply and needs may

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.630
be in science and technology.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.940
There's no pressure
on universities

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.870
to address those
corresponding faculty

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.530
sizes to what the national
need may or may not be,

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.500
and therefore what's
happened is essentially

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.390
a bifurcated education system,
where sciences and engineering

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.580
students have one
grading system--

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.890
and as you all know, it's
a tougher grading system

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:05.510
at liberal arts universities
than other majors

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.730
in the social sciences
and humanities.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.450
And you know, we know that there
is significant grade inflation

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.340
in the non-science,
non-engineering fields,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.890
and that there is limited if any
grade inflation in the tougher

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.640
technical fields.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.010
So that's what he's
talking about, here.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.530
We maintain essentially
two grading standards,

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.980
the net effect of which is
to substantially discourage

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.510
entry of talent.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.750
Now this is not in this report,
but the National Academy

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.590
of Engineering has
explored extensively

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:42.290
whether the people dropping
out of majors in engineering

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.870
are stronger or weaker
students than those staying in,

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.120
and they can't find any
basis for concluding

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.965
that they are any weaker.

00:13:48.965 --> 00:13:50.840
In other words, we're
just driving talent out

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.780
of the system through
these mechanisms,

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.670
is Romer's argument.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.850
So the supply problem--

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.420
by running this
bifurcating grading system

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.870
to drive out talent, to
maintain class size numbers

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.350
and make sure you don't have
to advise too many people--

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:14.300
the supply problem, in turn,
drives graduate school numbers,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.820
because of course, undergraduate
degrees are prerequisites.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.040
So how does US industry
cope with this?

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.600
Essentially what it's done--

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.430
and this is not bad--

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.310
it's encouraged
wholesale immigration

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.520
from all over the world
to fill the gap, which

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.470
it's done very systematically.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.030
And that's why, for
example, industry

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.720
is so concerned about this
H-1B visa set of proposals

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.630
that the new administration
has recently proposed.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.070
What are the
ramifications of that

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.710
in terms of access to
this talent supply?

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.630
Obviously, worldwide talent,
as we've talked about before,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.390
is a very important
competitive advantage

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.800
for the United States.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.870
But here we're in a
circumstance where

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:59.870
we're not creating parallel
opportunities for folks

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.610
in the US.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.110
Moving on with Romer's
indictment of higher education,

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.560
because that's
really what it is,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:21.770
he argues that PhD
programs train graduates

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:31.960
for the academy, but as all of
us in this room know, there's--

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.650
there's a complete oversupply
of PhDs in terms of what

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.090
the academy itself--

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.300
in other words, university
teaching-- actually requires.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.710
So then we have to invent new
mechanisms to keep this talent

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.490
base around.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:51.880
So we invent long, endless,
seven or eight-year graduate

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.280
programs.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.520
England somehow manages to get
its PhDs done in three years.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.600
Are they worse?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.750
I don't know.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.360
But we have a seven or
eight year old graduate--

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.480
eight year long graduate
education program,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.780
and then we invent this
whole class of essentially

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.950
apprentices that
we call post-docs--

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.495
another substantial
army of people--

00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:16.120
because there's no
space in the academy

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.130
to accommodate these people.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.230
And yet the training
system is not

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.900
geared to the
location where there

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.470
are extensive opportunities--

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.600
whether in established
firms or startups-- which

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.050
is for industry because the
training system is really

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:38.540
geared for entering the academy,
not for entering industry.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.350
And obviously, it tends to
focus more on basic than applied

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.540
for obvious reasons.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.680
So this-- we're just
multiplying the problems here,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.600
because the core input
institutions, i.e. higher

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.550
education, are not organized
around the skills problem

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.470
society has got.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.490
That's Romer's indictment.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:08.650
I had the privilege of working
with him on legislation,

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.900
and when this piece of
legislation came out,

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.960
there was considerable
interest on Capitol Hill,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.640
and we're hearing all the time
on Capitol Hill in this era

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.000
about, we've got a
talent base problem,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.019
and there was considerable
interest in the critiques

00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:28.569
that Romer had
made of the system,

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.820
and how do you
change the system?

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.600
So, like other
senior staffers, I

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.297
read his stuff and
thought gee, how are we

00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:38.380
going to turn this around?

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.070
We're going to have to
spend a fortune on creating

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:49.480
a massive new kind of fellowship
program across the country,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.090
on top of what we already
have to encourage science

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.180
and engineering education.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.420
We'll have to significantly
increase that--

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.050
maybe by a factor
of two or more.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.780
How are we going to afford this?

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.590
Where's that money come from?

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:09.750
So I had a conversation
with Romer, and he said,

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.470
Bill, you have to think
like an economist here.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.360
You have to bribe
the gatekeepers.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.790
Right?

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.610
So I-- what are
you talking about?

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.340
And he said, look, figure
out who the gatekeepers are

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.960
in this entire
system and you bribe

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.510
them to make them turn
around their behavior.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:33.450
So in this case, it's the
departments and the colleges

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.950
and universities as a whole--

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.590
it's their administrations.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.350
Bribe them to get them
to change their numbers

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.140
because if they're not producing
enough scientists and engineers

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.230
net, then pay them to do this.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.040
And by the way, bribery
is a heck of a lot

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.370
cheaper than creating a massive
new national fellowship,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.480
and much more efficient.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.513
So obviously, bribery is
not the apt term here,

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.930
but we ended up creating a
program at the National Science

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.650
Foundation, which Congress
passed, called The Step

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.930
Education Program,
which essentially

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:11.700
offers very significant
funding to departments

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.160
that guarantee they're going
to turn their numbers around,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.840
and then present pathways by
which they're going to do so.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.430
In other words, maybe
they offer much more one

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.260
on one kind of
tutorial attention

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.440
to keep students in
science and engineering.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.180
Maybe they offer
fellowships with industry,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.830
so you're guaranteed
summer employment

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.588
in an interesting,
relevant, applied field.

00:19:35.588 --> 00:19:37.380
In other words, there
may be a whole slew--

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:38.460
and there turned
out to be a lot--

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.830
of ideas on how to begin to
turn those numbers around.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.570
AUDIENCE: Are you talking
at the undergraduate level?

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.302
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'm talking
at the undergraduate level.

00:19:44.302 --> 00:19:45.540
AUDIENCE: I'm--

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.260
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Go ahead, Max.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.635
AUDIENCE: I'm kind of confused
how you can simultaneously

00:19:48.635 --> 00:19:51.390
have a problem where you don't
have enough science engineering

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.490
workers but you also have
this army of post docs

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.690
that you don't know
what to do with.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.010
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well, I mean
that's kind of the next stage

00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.640
of the problem.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.320
So his next piece, Max,
is innovation and graduate

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.600
education training.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.120
So in other words, create
curricula that are relevant

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.060
not only to training
for the academy,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.480
but curricula that are also
relevant to training for entry

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.900
in the industry,
and we're obviously

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.840
starting to see some of
these things materialize.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.780
So a school like MIT-- but
it's by no means alone--

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:30.920
has a massive entrepreneurship
curriculum now available

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.958
in all of its schools.

00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:33.750
This is not just a
business school program,

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.400
this is available
across the board,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.352
and as you undergraduates know,
it's really quite accessible.

00:20:39.352 --> 00:20:41.310
There's a substantial
number of business majors

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.560
who do a lot of
entrepreneurship--

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.920
business minors-- who do a
lot of entrepreneurship-esque

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.290
features in their education.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.060
That's now much
better understood

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.940
by students going
to universities

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.420
as an option for what
their route ahead might be

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.472
than it was even 10 years ago.

00:20:59.472 --> 00:21:00.930
So there has been
some change here,

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.370
but that's another
change he would make,

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.340
is to make the training
much more relevant to entry

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.500
into established firms
and to startup firms

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.580
at the graduate school level.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.740
So overall, he would attempt to
use some federal funding here

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.960
to, in effect, redress the
imbalance in federal demand

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.910
and supply programs to
create an input of support

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.650
on the federal side--

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.640
on the supply side.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.832
All right, so that's
two of our three.

00:21:37.832 --> 00:21:38.790
You want to pause here?

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.820
Because this one's so
nicely controversial

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.420
that we could discuss it, and
you all can disagree with Romer

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.620
or indicate how correct he is.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.270
Shall we do a quick pause?

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.098
Who's got this one?

00:21:52.098 --> 00:21:52.890
You've got it, Max?

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.515
Do you want to quickly
summarize Romer?

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:55.678
Let's do Augustine, too.

00:21:55.678 --> 00:21:56.220
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.303
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Great.

00:21:57.303 --> 00:21:59.850
AUDIENCE: All right, so
Augustine talks about how,

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.610
while as a lot of us know,
education in the United States

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.500
isn't great before
the university level.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.290
So he gives a lot
of statistics, how

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.430
we're doing pretty poorly
in math and science

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.490
when compared to other
countries, how, for whatever

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.880
reason, it seems
that as people stay

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.460
within the American system,
the longer they stay in,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.170
the poorer their ability to
compete with other countries

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.560
is.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.930
So actually, I found
out one of the things--

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:35.010
some of the-- so America
has, in the past few decades,

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.380
been famous for the
concept of a brain drain,

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.370
where it would take the best and
brightest from other countries,

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.297
like India and China--

00:22:42.297 --> 00:22:44.130
they would come over
here for our university

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.470
system, which is nice.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.340
It's great for us.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.460
It's not great for them,
but apparently this trend

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.450
is slowing as we find
out in this article,

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.993
because of some of our
more isolationist policies.

00:22:54.993 --> 00:22:56.910
And I really appreciated
that he mentioned it,

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:01.140
because often a lot of
people tried to talk about,

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.640
isolationism is bad
because we are the world,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.910
but this actually
gives a more concrete

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.700
reason for why
isolationism actually

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.400
causes some significant problems
to our innovation system

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.610
and to our economy.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.460
So one of the questions
that I wanted to pose

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.540
is, how have all of our
educational institutions

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.790
at the university level
managed to maintain

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.990
their stature and their quality
despite the fact that lower--

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.080
lower level institutions
like high school and below

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.320
have been so sub par?

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.430
And can we implement some
of these characteristics

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.450
at these other levels?

00:23:42.632 --> 00:23:43.340
Yeah, that's all.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.230
AUDIENCE: I think
some of the answer

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:48.840
to that comes from just
the inequality across I

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.290
through 12 schools.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.640
The US does have some
fantastic schools,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.830
it's just who has
access to them,

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.900
and that tends to favor
certain groups over others,

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.340
and so instead of
being able to tap

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.550
into the full potential
talent pool that we have,

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.080
we're getting the
ones who happen

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.288
to live in a neighborhood
that goes to a good school,

00:24:07.288 --> 00:24:10.670
or they have a nice magnet
school in their county.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.620
So I think you could
also pose the question,

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.540
how much better could
American universities

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.420
be if they had their full
talent pool to choose from?

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.760
AUDIENCE: That's fair.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
like that point a lot,

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.450
because there are--

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:27.830
I mean, we definitely have
institutions-- higher parable

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.110
learning institutions,
universities-- in the United

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.230
States that are extremely
famous, extremely well known,

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.670
and extremely well respected.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.080
You all are at one.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.170
But there, if you look--

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.870
that doesn't mean that every
single university in the United

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.730
States is internationally
respected.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.610
There's this huge spectrum
of the level of education

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.280
or the quality of education that
you can get at the university

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.380
level, and I think you're
exactly right-- that's

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.080
the same for K through 12.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.520
It's just there's a huge span.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.790
You just don't necessarily hear
about the really bad university

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.750
level educations.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.992
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:00.992 --> 00:25:01.770
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:02.270
So--

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.145
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:03.145 --> 00:25:05.130
AUDIENCE: So following
up on that, then,

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.755
I've heard that one
of the main reasons

00:25:06.755 --> 00:25:10.220
that we-- that, at least for
the K through 12 system, people

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.600
are-- or governments--
are unable to support

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.880
the schools that
are doing very well

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.168
and punish the ones
that are doing poorly.

00:25:19.168 --> 00:25:20.960
Is there a way that we
could implement this

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.770
without jeopardizing the
educations of the people who

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.410
are already in these systems?

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.440
Because schools can't be treated
exactly like a free market,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.810
because in a free
market, the worst case

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.130
is you buy a Zune instead
of an iPhone or iPod

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.940
and well, OK, that
kind of sucks.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.040
But it doesn't
suck nearly as much

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.500
as it does for the
kid who has to go

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.570
through a year
with a bad teacher,

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.842
and sure, maybe the
teacher gets fired after,

00:25:46.842 --> 00:25:48.800
but that's still a year
that this kid has lost,

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.990
and that sets them
behind, and those--

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.940
that impact can last for the
rest of this person's life.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:59.600
So-- that was a really
long question, I'm sorry.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.790
So to phrase that more
simply, how can we

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.990
implement some sort
of free market style

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:17.540
without that inherent
impact on a kid's life?

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.480
AUDIENCE: Well, I think just
to reorganize the question

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.310
and some decision making,
why are you assuming it's

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.357
the teacher's fault that,
in a central city school,

00:26:26.357 --> 00:26:27.440
they don't do well, right?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.340
Usually it's people who
really, really care,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.430
but the students
aren't ready to learn.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.130
Because like-- I
forget the quote,

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.075
but it's combined as
like a parachute that

00:26:35.075 --> 00:26:37.523
needs to be opened to
receive information.

00:26:37.523 --> 00:26:39.190
So I think it's a
more complex issue, is

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.180
the point I'm trying to make.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:40.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the first time

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.932
I've looked into this, because
there's a special class called

00:26:43.932 --> 00:26:46.358
by Tom Malone, and
I think we're going

00:26:46.358 --> 00:26:47.900
to be talking about
the future of war

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.490
next week where he
talks a lot about,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.550
now we're in a distributed
kind of network system.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.310
And we kind of get
through hierarchy systems.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.053
And so like in that
class, we posited like,

00:26:58.053 --> 00:26:59.720
you know like YouTube
has all the videos

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.275
and is created by
a ton of people.

00:27:01.275 --> 00:27:03.650
We talked about like what if
somebody made like a YouTube

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.750
for education, where the best
teachers would get the most

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.333
views.

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:08.000
And you could quantify
that and pay them

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.200
really high salaries, right?

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.460
So you'd get like NBA,
and NBA player salaries

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.160
for doing really great
content and a lot of people

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:16.950
would access it.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.710
And pretty much the
whole population

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.280
would be taught by the best
teachers in the country

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.310
or in the world.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.860
And then you'd have
the personal touch,

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.190
like Khan Academy, where it's
like online for some subjects

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.940
or like [INAUDIBLE]
in a really good way.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.060
And then in the
actual class system,

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.970
you are going through the
kind of like the issues

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:36.740
and figuring out
what your errors are

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.460
so you can learn better.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.820
So I think that's an
interesting incentive.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.380
The thing though is
like I think this

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.965
is more of the
dynamics of the market

00:27:44.965 --> 00:27:48.920
but the gatekeepers problem than
it is like an education problem

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.050
or even like the
pipeline issues.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.360
If our incentive system
is to get the best people

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.490
to the school and
not care what happens

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.630
after, that's kind of like
a screwed up system, right?

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.570
It's like if your whole-- yeah.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.758
Like we're not
focusing on making

00:28:04.758 --> 00:28:06.050
the best students in the world.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.910
We're focusing on finding
the smartest people up

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.160
to that point that they become
students at our university.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.702
And our reputation is based on
getting the smartest people up

00:28:12.702 --> 00:28:13.280
to here.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.590
So it doesn't matter if you
have a screwed up economy.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.280
There's always going
to be a really top 1%.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.030
Like, it doesn't matter,
because like most

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.280
of the people at the school will
come from all different kinds

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.090
of backgrounds.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.590
And they will never
say, most likely

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.182
it was because of their school.

00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:27.890
Like if they come from
a poor background,

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.310
they're going to say, you
know, I just went online,

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.160
or went to the library, or I
learned from the best people

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.785
in their books.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.930
That was even like a response.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.840
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well, you
introduced the online idea.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.560
And we're going to jump on that
kind at the end of the class.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.490
So we should come
back to that Martin.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.050
AUDIENCE: Which I definitely
think is an interesting idea.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.677
I think it's easy
to frame the access.

00:28:51.677 --> 00:28:53.260
All you need is an
internet connection

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.310
and basically everyone
has a cell phone.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.200
AUDIENCE: You know,
we'll get to is later.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.700
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And there
are pros and cons on this too.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.750
AUDIENCE: It's also
overdone, right?

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.540
There's like a ton of businesses
and a ton of organizations

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.562
I've seen try to do it.

00:29:03.562 --> 00:29:05.270
And like why haven't
they figured it out.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.478
It's probably like a policy,
incentives, power issue.

00:29:12.683 --> 00:29:14.600
AUDIENCE: Yes, I think,
just thinking about it

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.610
from like also an
international perspective,

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.820
I think a problem in the US
is also like the whole respect

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.050
thing for teachers.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.270
Like I think especially
at the middle school

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.790
or the high school, like the
public education system, maybe

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.100
there's not as much respect
for being a teacher.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.630
Whereas like maybe in
Sweden, or like China,

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.030
like being a
professor, a teacher

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:35.120
is really well respected and
considered a really prestigious

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.680
job.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.850
So I think that's like
some systemic issue that's

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.820
also kind of preventing maybe
the top talent from going

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.660
into teaching, not necessarily
at the higher education level.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.030
I think there is a lot of
really intelligent academics

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:48.060
in that space.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.240
But definitely,
towards the beginning

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.460
where children are like
really starting out

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.860
their educational careers,
and that's the fundamental.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.140
And also from what I
know like in Europe,

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.500
they start kind of
specializing pretty early

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.110
on in like high school
into what kind of track

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.790
they want to pursue later on.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.510
So I feel like that could be
an interesting way that they're

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.210
kind of promoting, for
example, engineering

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:15.920
or math or STEM related
technical expertise.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.040
Like they're really fostering
that from early stage.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.400
So that really helps
and sets up the students

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.350
to advance later on.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.190
Whereas like a lot
of students here

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.290
they get like kind of basic
introduction to everything.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.450
But then once they get
to engineering classes,

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.885
some people aren't
very prepared.

00:30:34.885 --> 00:30:37.010
AUDIENCE: Actually regarding
the first part of what

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:38.870
you said about the
teachers and trying

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.997
to incentivize the best
talent in our country

00:30:41.997 --> 00:30:44.330
to become a teacher, that's
actually my second question.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.330
I was going to ask, well,
how could we incentivize them

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.290
outside of pay?

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:52.130
Because I've heard that
the US education system

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.770
is at an all time high for
paying, for the amount of money

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.900
that we spend per
student in the classroom.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.900
So clearly just throwing money
at this problem is not enough.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.892
So what can we do?

00:31:02.892 --> 00:31:04.850
Is there a way we can
either change the culture

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.817
or some other aspect?

00:31:07.817 --> 00:31:10.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think one of
the problems with the US system

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.800
is that it's kind of punitive.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.080
Where there's like
mass or firing, sorry,

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.860
mass firing things,
whereas teachers

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.897
that are not like performing up
to a grade just be like let go.

00:31:21.897 --> 00:31:23.480
And that's kind of
bad on the students

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.160
because there's a
lot of turnover.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.550
But I think in other, we can
maybe borrow from another model

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.400
where other cities, I
think what comes to mind

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.720
is Shanghai has this program
where a lot of teachers

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.670
or professors that are
not performing as well

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.090
are partnered with an educator
that has more experience

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.840
or has better understanding
of how to reach the students.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.450
And they have this kind of
like collaborative model,

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.370
where they bring up
the teachers instead

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.712
of trying to just fire
them or like dock their pay

00:31:51.712 --> 00:31:52.610
or something.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.022
Which I think is
probably something

00:31:55.022 --> 00:31:57.230
that would be ultimately
better for like the students

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.240
in general as well.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.570
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So Max, why
don't we move on now to Grover.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:03.700
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, sure.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.800
That most anybody is going
to be closing points here.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.175
AUDIENCE: I just
want to bring up

00:32:08.175 --> 00:32:10.050
the point that was made
in one of the papers,

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.530
I forget if it's this one,
about having access to looking

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.898
at like seeing engineers.

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:16.190
Yeah, like, if you're in a
community where you've never

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.290
got to interact with engineers
or somebody who does STEM,

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:19.190
you're going to see
it a certain way,

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.780
especially since when
you look at the subject,

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.150
it's so dry in the classroom
versus what you actually

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.440
end up doing.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.290
I think that's also
a big component,

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.790
especially once you structure
who you want to become, right?

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.207
Because at that
age, you're trying

00:32:30.207 --> 00:32:32.670
to figure out where you
want to be a role model.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.310
Yeah, like an
example, Steve Jobs

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.242
got to work when
he was 12 at HP.

00:32:36.242 --> 00:32:37.700
And he said that
was the thing that

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.040
led him to work on tech,
because his whole background,

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.320
his dad was a mechanic.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.820
It also made him realize what
a good company was, because he

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.112
saw how the employees are
treated and it made them see,

00:32:46.112 --> 00:32:49.040
oh, this is why having the
right company culture matters.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.140
That's a lesson he
learned at 12 that led him

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.630
to change how he saw his life.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:56.870
AUDIENCE: I think on my
end in terms of Augustine,

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.450
there is a point he made
about American exceptionalism

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:03.080
and our focus on finding
spectacular talent,

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.440
not just on good talent.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.080
And so, I remember
a few weeks ago,

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.070
I mentioned the
quote where the good

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.640
becomes the enemy of the great.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.780
And maybe in the
education system,

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.890
the great is the
enemy of the good.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.550
And perhaps we're sort of
not doing a good enough job

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.970
of supporting people who
do a fine job at pursuing

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.370
engineering and
science because we're

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:25.560
focused on finding the
innovators, the Edisons,

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.930
the Jobs, the
Gates of the world.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.990
So to create a support
infrastructure,

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.510
people who might do a
fine job at carrying out

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.580
their functions I
think is ultimately

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.320
the task of the education
system at the lower level.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.790
And then at the university
level of cultivating that talent

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:43.160
to really create
spectacular innovation.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, to
add on to that point,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.730
I think, yeah, they
definitely prefer the Edisons,

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:47.760
but I think that was
more in the paper

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.633
already talked about
breakthrough ideas.

00:33:49.633 --> 00:33:51.050
I think this paper
was more about,

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.592
we have a pipeline issue that
we need these kind of employees

00:33:53.592 --> 00:33:55.370
so that these fields
stay in the US.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.320
And they weren't
looking for Edisons.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.112
They were looking for
niche, like you know,

00:33:58.112 --> 00:34:01.758
you want to discipline and can
move ahead and get that job.

00:34:01.758 --> 00:34:03.800
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
let's shift over to Romer.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.802
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:34:05.802 --> 00:34:06.760
you're just like, oh,--

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:07.980
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well,
we're leading into it.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.030
So we might as well.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.460
That's your pipeline boy.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.110
Yeah, so regarding
the pipeline, Romer

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:18.380
decided to focus mostly on
the undergraduate and graduate

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.139
institutions and
trying to figure out

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:25.909
how you can increase the supply
of the talented scientists

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:29.960
and engineers that exist in
the American innovation system.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.530
So one of the
questions that I saw

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.580
was posed pretty interesting,
someone was asking

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.770
what metrics or
measures could you

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:46.790
use to actually evaluate these
new scientists and engineers

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.409
as they're coming
into these fields

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:51.980
and how can you train
them to come into,

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.727
to be prepared to go into
either industry or academia.

00:34:57.203 --> 00:34:59.370
AUDIENCE: I mean, the first
thing that comes to mind

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.220
is like professional engineer
exams that exist already.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.690
That's kind of
like the standard.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:04.910
AUDIENCE: Those aren't
required, are they?

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.000
AUDIENCE: No, not usually.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.042
Well some companies will
require you to get them.

00:35:08.042 --> 00:35:09.340
It's generally just like a--

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.650
AUDIENCE: It's a nice little--

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.270
AUDIENCE: Thing you can check.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.728
But like, I don't
think it's very like,

00:35:14.728 --> 00:35:16.770
before I came to MIT, I'd
never even heard of it.

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:18.960
So I don't know if
that's something

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.690
that carries a ton of weight.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.490
But I don't know.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.000
I don't really like the idea
of using standardized tests

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.840
as a measure of competency.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.600
But I mean if you're
trying to talk

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.510
about a large group of people
there is no feasible way

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.868
to do it other than that.

00:35:34.868 --> 00:35:36.660
If you want to talk
about all the engineers

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.170
that are entering the
workforce, like, unfortunately,

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.128
numbers are kind of like
the only way to do it.

00:35:42.128 --> 00:35:43.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you
can't [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.640
recommendation letters.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.950
Just like everyone can find
someone that likes them.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.350
Yes.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.660
AUDIENCE: Might
there be a reason why

00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.130
such extensive licensing exams
exist in the medical field

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.067
and not in the engineering
or life sciences fields?

00:36:03.067 --> 00:36:04.900
AUDIENCE: I mean, it's
because it's probably

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.067
easy to mess up costs a lot
of money if you mess up.

00:36:07.067 --> 00:36:08.830
So you don't want
people to mess up.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.220
But it's pretty easy to
mess up in engineering.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:10.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but people don't
die and don't get lawsuits.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.820
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.180
AUDIENCE: I mean, to
the personal engineering

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.150
exams, to what extent does
accreditation of universities

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.500
already attempt to fill
that role that you know,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.010
if you're accepted
into and graduate

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:32.170
from an accredited
engineering program,

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.265
you already have that
check mark, that like, OK.

00:36:34.265 --> 00:36:34.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:38.000
So the PE exam is basically
just a feather in your cap.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.720
It doesn't really-- or I
don't know, a little stamp

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.320
on your resume.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.558
Doesn't really--

00:36:43.558 --> 00:36:45.350
AUDIENCE: But is there
a fault with the way

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.866
that we give that accreditation
to things right now?

00:36:49.866 --> 00:36:52.040
Is it becoming more meaningless?

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.620
If we're graduating maybe
an engineer from one school

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.780
that is far more capable
than another school

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.337
that has the same like stand?

00:37:00.337 --> 00:37:02.420
AUDIENCE: I mean, you could
make the same argument

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.753
with like any profession, right?

00:37:03.753 --> 00:37:07.880
Like, to go into Stephanie
as example of medicine.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.440
So if you have someone who
comes from the Harvard vs. name

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.240
somewhere you don't
like, Harvard.

00:37:17.892 --> 00:37:19.850
Yeah, then you can see
a difference in quality.

00:37:26.543 --> 00:37:28.960
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let me
raise a question, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.150
It's harder for you
folks at MIT to see this

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:34.450
because it's obviously
predominantly science

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.040
and engineering.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.110
But let me ask Sanam
and Steph, how much

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:43.400
do you see the great
inflation in a classic,

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.360
you know, high quality,
liberal arts school

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.210
between social science,
humanities kinds

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:52.270
of majors and science
and engineering majors?

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.790
And Lily, you came from
one of those institutions.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.480
Please join in.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.260
Is this real?

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.140
Is the problem that
Romer is seeing here,

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.290
is this a real issue?

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] econ
major at Wellesley College.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.670
AUDIENCE: Not at
Wellesley, there

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.623
is a definite sense of
grade inflation there.

00:38:08.623 --> 00:38:09.790
AUDIENCE: It is not a sense.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:10.490
It is a policy.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:11.698
AUDIENCE: Yes, it's a policy.

00:38:11.698 --> 00:38:12.730
It's an actual policy.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.500
Instituted, grade inflation.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.500
But in terms of the disparity
between the humanities,

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:24.700
social sciences and STEM fields,
I think there is definitely--

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.850
generally, there's the idea
that like the STEM fields are

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:34.030
more difficult. So recently
we had this policy where

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:37.330
the first semester of your
college year shadow graded,

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:39.040
so you're not
actually given grades.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.830
And that kind of resulted
in a lot of people

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.230
entering the STEM
fields [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.240
And that was something
that obviously

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.220
the humanities professors
and social sciences

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:48.970
were very against.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.130
Because if the
students coming in

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.770
were automatically going
to anything outside

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.570
of their department,
they kind of ended up

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.430
staying there because
the faculty are great.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.410
So they would continue
in that program.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.240
So that was kind of
an imbalance that

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.765
occurred in the recent years.

00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:05.640
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
in a way, exactly what

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.320
Romer's talking about.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.000
Interesting.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.200
Lily, what was your point?

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.820
AUDIENCE: I was a science major.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.110
And I made A's in
every single class

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.350
I took outside of my own major.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.292
And not As.

00:39:20.142 --> 00:39:22.184
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: What
were you thinking, Lily?

00:39:22.184 --> 00:39:23.040
[LAUGHING]

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.882
AUDIENCE: We started--

00:39:24.882 --> 00:39:27.510
I wanted to do science.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.970
We started out with
almost 600 students

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.790
in the first semester
chemistry course.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.890
And by the second
semester chemistry,

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.610
so this is chemistry majors,
biology majors, and engineering

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.170
majors, all have to take that.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.420
They also have to take a
second semester of chemistry.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.040
And there were
probably less than 400

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.340
by the second semester.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.840
So it was a huge weed out class.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.798
AUDIENCE: How many were
there in the beginning?

00:39:50.798 --> 00:39:53.363
AUDIENCE: Over
600, just over six.

00:39:53.363 --> 00:39:55.530
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Most
schools have notorious weed

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.260
out classes that
essentially frustrate

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.830
the ambitions of
a lot of students,

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.030
particularly in the premed area.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.430
Obviously notorious, shall
we say organic chemistry is

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.290
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:13.560
So this is a dilemma when
you've got a societal need

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.630
and you've got the
institutions that

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.940
are supposed to deliver
your talent base

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.670
just operating off a completely
different set of incentives

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.050
than what the society may be.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.240
That's the core of
Romer's argument here.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.560
And another part of his argument
is, the numbers are not that

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.350
far off.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.225
In other words, if we
just got the people who

00:40:31.225 --> 00:40:35.400
wanted to major in science,
engineering, and mathematics

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.030
to stay in the field, you know,
lots of the numbers problems

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.620
get a heck of a lot better.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.410
But that 40% or
more dropout rate

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.860
out of those fields
that typically

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:50.070
occurs at the undergraduate
level is highly problematic.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.390
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.932
AUDIENCE: I think they've been
waiting longer if you want to.

00:40:53.932 --> 00:40:55.950
AUDIENCE: Oh, I
couldn't see your hands.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:58.333
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I started
to wonder about a couple

00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:00.375
of these choke points,
like where actually people

00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:02.250
are starting to drop out of
these science and engineering

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:02.750
fields.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:06.170
I know we identified kind
of these weed out classes.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:10.140
And I think kind of looking from
like who declares, who ends up

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.440
finishing, I think
you could probably,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.950
as a whole identify kind of
gradient deflation in a couple

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.190
of these classes is like very
complicated, kind of weed out

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.830
classes as reasons why
people start to kind of leave

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.480
the field and migrate out.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.450
And I think it might
be indicative to sort

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:30.378
of each institution kind of
where these dropout points are.

00:41:30.378 --> 00:41:31.920
But I think en masse,
you can kind of

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.750
take these like first year
classes as kind of places

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.220
where students
start to fall off.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.140
And then, is it actually--

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.580
so is it part of kind of this
college exploratory process,

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.497
like kind of figuring
out what you want to do?

00:41:46.497 --> 00:41:48.980
It's like how you phrase it.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.748
As like, you started
as a chemistry major.

00:41:50.748 --> 00:41:53.040
But maybe you end up gravitating
towards social science

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.440
because you don't really like
the way that weed out class

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.130
is structured?

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.650
Or is it part of this
indicative problem that we have,

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:00.990
where like we can't
graduate and sustain

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:04.270
the people who are actually
interested in these fields?

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.440
And so I wonder if like, you
know, just because you know,

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.940
we're not graduating
enough, is it

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.793
because these
classes are actually

00:42:10.793 --> 00:42:12.960
structured in a way that
prevents people graduating?

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.057
Or is it like part of this--

00:42:15.057 --> 00:42:17.265
kind of the way that we
brand your college experience

00:42:17.265 --> 00:42:18.840
is like you're supposed
to be able to explore

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.715
and kind of transition
in and out, especially

00:42:20.715 --> 00:42:23.990
in that first year
and experience things.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:27.030
And my second point
was like, there's

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.530
a little bit of a
difference I would

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:33.030
say in kind of STEM fields,
even in that first year.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.280
Because I know a lot of
colleges offer the opportunity

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.850
to use high school
classes to sort

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:42.030
of test out of those first
year, maybe even those weed

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.590
out classes.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.285
And then, it's sort
of an added bonus

00:42:45.285 --> 00:42:47.660
as well, because you end up
testing out of these classes,

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.300
so you use up less semesters
to finish your degree.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.520
And so I know that can
be like a big reason

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.982
and incentive for
students to sort of choose

00:42:55.982 --> 00:42:57.690
other universities,
because they're like,

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.970
oh, I'll only be in this
school for three years

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.430
if I go to maybe the
state school over here,

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.500
rather than staying in
school for four years

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.720
at a different university.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.030
And like, is there
a way to identify

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:12.780
sort of the relative
quality of education

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.690
in kind of testing out of
that first year of engineering

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:18.235
classes and then finishing in
three versus going for four.

00:43:18.235 --> 00:43:19.860
Because I feel like
if you can graduate

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.920
a whole bunch of people, maybe
in that three year time span

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.823
without like a marginal decrease
in quality of education,

00:43:25.823 --> 00:43:27.990
we can start looking more
to those programs as well.

00:43:30.655 --> 00:43:32.530
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Max,
how about a close up

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:33.540
point on the Romer.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:40.730
AUDIENCE: So evidently,
Romer is evidence

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:45.902
that the education problem
is unbelievably complicated.

00:43:45.902 --> 00:43:47.360
Throwing money at
the issue has not

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.760
been sufficient to
actually solve it.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.290
And there are issues
with the quality,

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:58.490
as was being talked about, the
weed out courses that exist,

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:01.950
grade inflation and
deflation, standardizing.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.045
So, such an issue will take--

00:44:05.045 --> 00:44:06.920
it's going to take a
very long time to solve.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.552
But all of the issues
that he has pointed out,

00:44:09.552 --> 00:44:10.760
they are definitely solvable.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:19.580
I'd say the main barrier
between us and now and a future

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.580
where these issues are
solved would be the--

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.260
would be just
politics, just trying

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.900
to get people to agree to
these different programs that

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.760
would focus more
on the education

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.470
and less on the incentives
of those teaching.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.220
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I
think part of what's

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.100
interesting about
Romer's argument

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.540
is that he takes the theory that
we've got a talent supply, set

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.850
of talent supply
issues, and then he

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:48.400
attempts to figure out what
are the more specific barriers

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.460
to that supply, and then do an
institutional analysis of why

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:56.090
these barriers are in effect
created at the higher education

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:56.870
system.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.760
And then interestingly,
he attempts

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:03.252
to take three or four
public policy fixes that

00:45:03.252 --> 00:45:04.460
could actually address these.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:09.140
And I do think that both
his article and the Step

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.900
Program from the National
Science Foundation

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:16.430
created based on the
legislation that he

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:18.410
recommended that
Congress passed,

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.270
and that NSF implemented.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:22.520
It was never implemented
with the funding

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.170
scale that was really needed to
make a significant difference.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:28.610
But it started to send a
different set of signals

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:32.510
about supply of science
and technology talent

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.310
to the university
system and did I

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:36.800
think have an effect over time.

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.080
But these issues are
obviously still with us.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.150
So let me move
quickly from Romer

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:47.320
to our next reading
with Richard Freeman.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.390
And he kind of takes
us to the next level

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:51.530
of the supply problem.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:55.100
Richard Freeman is a quite
famous labor economist

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.170
at the school up the street.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:02.900
And he's famous for his wide
range and variety of hats.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.960
As you can see, he has
a wonderful collection.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.230
So he looks at a
different problem.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:14.460
You know does globalization
threaten the--

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.310
and its movement in
science and engineering,

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:20.330
threaten US economic leadership?

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:21.650
And you know, his--

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:26.810
I'll kind of summarize
his four key points here.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:31.880
You know, the
underlying issue is

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.270
that changes in the global
job market for science

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:38.570
and engineering, science and
entering workers, S&E workers

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:42.980
are eroding US dominance in
science and engineering, which

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:47.180
in turn diminishes a strong
comparative advantage

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.280
that the US historically held
since the end of World War II

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.610
as we've been talking
about in the past.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.500
And he makes four
underlying points

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.550
in kind of looking
at this dimension.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.270
In other words, we have
Augustine's critique of K

00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.900
through 12.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.710
We have Romer's critique of
the higher education system.

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:06.410
And then Richard
Freeman kind of tells us

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.840
what the economic
implications are

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:13.400
of failing to maintain that
leadership base in science

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.870
and engineering talent.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:18.110
So his point is that the
share of the world science

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:24.290
and engineering graduates
in the US is in decline.

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:26.360
And look, others are
understanding this model

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.080
and moving to fill it.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.450
Second, that the job
market has worsened

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:35.120
for younger workers in
science and engineering fields

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.660
relative to many
other high level

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.690
occupations, which
in turn discourages

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.710
US students in those fields.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.420
Now he's writing
this at the time when

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.845
a startling proportion
of MIT students

00:47:50.845 --> 00:47:52.220
and other science
and engineering

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.740
graduates in other
schools were going

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.870
into the financial sector,
financial services,

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:58.610
and consulting.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.770
Some of that since he
wrote has turned around.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:03.870
In other words, there
has been an emergence

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:09.050
at MIT of interest in
startups and entrepreneurship,

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:15.200
to the tune that some 20%
to 25% of those of you

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.300
when you graduate, your
graduating classmates

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.670
will go into those
fields in a way

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:21.830
that community moved out
of financial services

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:27.170
post 2008 crash and
moved over to what

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:30.170
may be a really important
kind of career shift

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:31.880
in terms of the
country's future.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:37.850
But that hadn't occurred yet
by the time he's writing this.

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:41.690
So in other words,
the extremely high pay

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:44.180
available to those
entering financial services

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.170
and consulting drained
talent out of the system

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.720
is his point within the US.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:56.780
And then, you know, countries
like China and India

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:01.970
found that they could compete
with the US in high tech

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:05.600
by starting to train
substantial numbers of science

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.910
and engineering specialists.

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:11.810
In other words, they could
leapfrog, right, and in effect

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:14.720
go to substantial parts
of their economy being

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:19.310
quite high tech, even while
they were working on bringing up

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:22.670
what's in effect a developing
world economy in the meantime.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.393
So they hit on this model.

00:49:24.393 --> 00:49:25.810
And it's a really
important model.

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:29.810
But that in turn had an
effect on kind of US dominance

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:30.420
in this field.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.795
I mean, it's not a bad thing
for the world to get better,

00:49:32.795 --> 00:49:37.290
but it doesn't have an effect
on the US comparative advantage.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:42.680
So to ease the adjustment
to a less dominant position

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.710
in science and engineering
with the corresponding economic

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:50.220
ramifications for US economic
growth and competitiveness,

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.810
the US is going to
have to develop,

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:55.910
he argues, new labor
market and R&D policies

00:49:55.910 --> 00:50:00.220
that start to try to change the
science and engineering talent

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.333
numbers.

00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:03.500
So we're going to have to
step into the marketplace.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.540
And you know, this is
where Romer's thinking

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.470
would come to bear.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:12.170
So let me let me move
to Goldin and Katz

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:19.410
and they further talk about the
societal ramifications for what

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:22.248
we're doing in higher
education, right?

00:50:22.248 --> 00:50:23.790
We've talked a bit
about this before.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.710
And they also teach
up the street.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:35.700
And their book, The Race
Between Education and Technology

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.730
was really a quite
important one.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.530
I think it's held up well
since it came out in 2009.

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:44.310
But I had you read a short
version, a Milken Institute

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:47.910
review piece that came out
before they put their book out.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:51.450
But I do recommend
the book to you.

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:55.230
The gap between wages of
educated and less well educated

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:58.890
workers has been
growing since 1980,

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.740
and this expanding
wage inequality

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.720
has characterized the
US since that time.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.440
So we're becoming a much
more polarized society

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.150
and the lines are drawn
on education lines, right?

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.040
And this is, we've
talked about this before,

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.760
but this is David
Otter's barbell problem,

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.370
that our society is increasingly
looking like a barbell.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.760
And we've got on
one bell, a growing

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.140
and successful upper middle
class that has the education

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.520
and is able to
use that education

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.750
to capture that wealth,
a thinning middle,

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:39.830
and a growing lower end
services economy that's

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:42.050
less well-paid
and less well off,

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.120
to which substantial
portions of the middle

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.410
are now being shunted.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:48.740
And we can start to see this
polarization in our economy

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:51.980
in pretty sharp terms.

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:56.960
And that's what Katz and
Goldin are writing about.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.410
The wage inequality narrowed
in the United States

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:04.640
significantly from about
1910 through the 1950s.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.260
Then it stabilized
until about the 1980s.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:12.920
And then it's grown
since that time.

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.780
Why?

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.660
And they argue--

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:21.650
I'll attempt to just
paint you a quick picture.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:28.070
But they argue that there
is a race between education

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:33.080
and technology, and that
what happened in the US

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.850
was that there is an
ever-growing curve

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:42.045
of technology knowledge since
the Industrial Revolution.

00:52:42.045 --> 00:52:43.670
And we've talked
about this previously,

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:46.220
but I'll reiterate it.

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.500
That an economy
requires, in other words,

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:50.600
it requires an
ever-growing level

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:54.580
of technological sophistication.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:59.500
And the genius of
the US system was

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:04.515
to create mass higher
education, which we did,

00:53:04.515 --> 00:53:05.890
first through the
Land Grant Act.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:07.510
Of course that created MIT.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:10.470
That was the big
enabler for MIT.

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:12.310
It had initial funding in 1861.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.500
Its graduating class marched
off to the Civil War.

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.360
There was no revenue base.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.675
In 1862, Congress passed
the Land Grant College Act

00:53:20.675 --> 00:53:22.300
and suddenly there
was a revenue stream

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.900
to make up for the loss of
talent, loss of the tuition

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.400
base.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.210
So that saved MIT.

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:31.540
But created public
higher education

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:34.780
really across the country
in every state at the time

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.730
extended to new ones.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:40.280
So we created that system of
mass higher education, really

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.400
through the Land Grant
College Act in 1862.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.490
No other country had
done anything like that.

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:50.710
So we created a talent
base that stayed ahead

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:53.620
of the technological
curve, right?

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:56.050
And that's what you want.

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:59.080
You want your talent
base to stay ahead

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:03.400
of the increased sophistication
of technology in the economy,

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:07.920
so that that talent base can
keep moving that curve up,

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:08.590
right?

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:11.110
And that they
benefit each other.

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:14.080
And then, what Katz
and Goldin point out,

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:19.810
is that in the mid
'70s, we level that off.

00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:22.300
AUDIENCE: Was there something
that caused it in particular?

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.925
Let me get to that
in a minute, Martin.

00:54:23.925 --> 00:54:25.930
But we do need to
come back to that.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:27.400
I don't think we
fully understand

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.525
the dimensions of what was
happening at that point.

00:54:29.525 --> 00:54:31.120
But there are some thoughts.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:35.140
So what happened was
that the people that

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:39.460
continue to ride
this curve, they

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:43.300
stayed up with the
technology curve.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.680
Those that fell off
fell behind the curve

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.010
and their incomes
correspondingly suffered.

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:54.630
That's the case
that they're making.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.280
and that these people
got left off the curve

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.760
and couldn't keep riding
up to take advantage

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.680
of the economic gains.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.840
So you've got a smaller
number of people you know,

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.160
riding this curve up.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.670
They get the gains.

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:13.960
Whereas in this period of
time between 1910 and 1950,

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.540
everybody at least, a very
large part of the population

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.620
was riding that curve
and able to benefit.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:21.910
So that's the great creation
of this mass middle class

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:24.220
in the United States.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:27.760
And the data tends
to bear this out.

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:33.130
So that's their essential
equation here on what happened.

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.380
Again, they argue that
technological advance

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.350
is the key to growth.

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:40.000
We know that from this class.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.670
And that the ebb and flow of
wage equality and inequality

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:48.190
is very much
related to the skill

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:51.010
set you've got to keep riding
that technological curve.

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:55.360
Now look, if anything the growth
in that technological curve

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.100
has just gotten steeper
with the development of all

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:02.040
these information technologies.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.760
You know heaven forbid,
a next generation

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.970
if you don't have
coding skills, right?

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:09.460
With the entry of
significant amount

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:12.370
of artificial intelligence
in the economy.

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:15.160
If you're going to stay up, you
really need that skill base.

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.950
Otherwise you're going
to get left behind.

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:23.860
So, you know, that's
essentially their picture

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.630
of what's been going on here.

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:33.930
Let me-- that stagnation of
education levels around '73

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:42.760
or so coincides with the
period of economic challenge

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.270
from Japan that we talked about
in the second manufacturing

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:47.530
class.

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:51.250
That's the period where
the Rust Belt gets created.

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.250
So the US had been on an
ever rising economic curve.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:58.180
Suddenly its growth rate
fell to the 2% range

00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:05.340
from its historic 3% range
and its productivity rate

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.340
strides growth as
we've talked about,

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:11.290
its productivity rate
fell to the 1% range.

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:14.050
So that means there's less
real wealth in the economy.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.530
And that may, Martin, in
answer to your question, that

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.720
may have had something
to do with our ability

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:23.510
to keep financing
ever-growing education.

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:29.440
Remember that the public
universities provide

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.780
80% of higher education.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:35.052
That's the key
component of the system.

00:57:35.052 --> 00:57:37.260
You know, places like MIT
are all very well and good,

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:40.000
but that's a 20% share.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.640
The core talent base are getting
trained in public universities.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.140
And other things
have been happening

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.190
to those public universities.

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:51.310
So they're competing
at the state level

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:55.740
for funding with
two major factors.

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.330
One is Medicaid,
which the states bear

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:00.860
a very large portion of
and the other is prisons.

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.290
Because we have a
massive prison growth.

00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:05.983
And the annual cost
of prisoners is

00:58:05.983 --> 00:58:08.150
much higher than putting
people in higher education.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.025
You begin to wonder
where your priorities are

00:58:10.025 --> 00:58:12.260
when you think about that.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.060
So there have been
increased pressure

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:17.300
on state budgets that
correspond with that '73

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:21.680
to like 1990 and 1991, kind of
economic decline period that

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.880
may account for it.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.080
Now the Obama administration
understood this curve well.

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:31.820
And Obama was fluent with
Katz and Goldin's work.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:36.590
And they made a major effort
to increase Pell grants

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:40.550
and increase the availability
of higher education funding.

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:44.068
So interestingly, there was an
improvement in the last decade

00:58:44.068 --> 00:58:45.110
in some of these numbers.

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:48.170
Some of that was
driven by the fact

00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:51.480
that jobs are a disaster
in 2007 and 2008.

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.610
So people tended to spend that
time if they could afford it

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:57.740
in higher education locations.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.300
So that was some
of that going on.

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.540
But overall, the
Administration made an attempt

00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:03.290
to try and get those
numbers turned around

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:05.520
and they're a bit better.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.150
And the public
universities themselves

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:10.490
understood their
mission and realized

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:13.340
that they're going to have to
increase their employment base

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:16.760
in order to accomplish this.

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:18.470
All right, so that's
Katz and Goldin.

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:21.050
I mean there's other important
points there, but that's key.

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:23.270
And then I want to do--

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:25.970
you know, we've talked
about higher education

00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:28.610
as though it's
the only way here.

00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:32.510
But I wanted to introduce some
controversy into the debate.

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:39.530
So William Baumol, very noted
economist, taught at Princeton,

00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:43.810
more recent years have been
teaching at NYU, you know,

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:45.230
a remarkable analyst.

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:51.750
And he's written in
many different kind

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:54.630
of economics fields.

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:58.770
Baumol does this
NBER, National Bureau

00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:04.110
of Economic Research
kind of work paper

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:07.940
that just nails
the whole system.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.970
So I thought we'd introduce
a little controversy

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:15.810
in today's class by putting
his piece in front of us.

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:17.480
He argues that
breakthrough innovation

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.920
comes from independent
inventors and entrepreneurs,

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.430
that large firms concentrate
on incremental innovation.

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:28.280
We've talked about
this bit before.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.070
And this conclusion
is what is startling.

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:34.480
Education for the mastery
of science knowledge

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:40.500
aids incremental advance,
doesn't necessarily

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:44.640
prepare you for doing
the breakthrough,

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.780
entrepreneurial side.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:53.640
So his point then, is that kind
of standard science education

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.530
may actually impede
breakthrough thinking.

01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:00.600
And that large firm R&D requires
scientists and engineers

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.330
that are educated
in the established

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:06.540
fields and the established
analytical methods

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:11.370
and that successful innovators
and entrepreneurs often

01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:15.670
lack that standard preparation.

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:17.490
And that that may get
them out of the box

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:21.390
of incremental advance into
kind of new territories.

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:26.170
And he points out that
we don't have a system

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:31.630
and we don't understand
breakthrough learning.

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:33.490
How do we educate
for innovation?

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:39.080
We have no real clue
on how to do that.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.080
And that procedures for
incremental learning

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.800
do seem to work.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.810
But we don't know how to educate
for the innovation side--

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.760
of the innovation
system, who's got what.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.520
He points out the Proctor &
Gamble with 7,500 scientists,

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.560
1,250 PhDs, I mean, these
kinds of totals start

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:01.010
to dwarf the size of faculties
at MIT and Harvard and Stanford

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:03.650
and so forth.

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:05.500
You know, with 22
research centers,

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.260
P&G has in 12 different
nations, that's

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.920
a pretty amazing talent base.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.770
What are they up to?

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:21.520
Remember that when you look
at R&D combined, industry

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.090
spans about 70% of the total
spending on R&D. Of course,

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:29.740
we know that that's
D, not R, right?

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.890
But industry has got
about a 70% share.

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:39.220
The federal government,
about 30% share, that's R.

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.310
So that gives us an idea
of the different size

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.950
of the establishments
in the R&D side.

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:49.540
So we know that industry
employs some 64%

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.150
of scientists and
engineers, right?

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:56.050
So industry has got
that talent base.

01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:59.830
And he notes that
critical breakthrough

01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:03.930
historical innovator figures
like Watt, Whitney, Fulton,

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:08.200
Morris, Edison, the Wright
brothers, Wozniak, Jobs, Gates,

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.540
Dell, have no college
degrees, and frankly,

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.280
limited scientific training.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.030
AUDIENCE: Wait, Jobs
had a college degree.

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.072
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes,
he had a college degree.

01:03:19.072 --> 01:03:20.170
No, he didn't finish Reed.

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:21.290
AUDIENCE: No, he left
in the first year.

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:22.270
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, he left.

01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:23.330
He left after a year or two.

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:24.100
AUDIENCE: I thought he
went somewhere else.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:24.933
AUDIENCE: He stayed.

01:03:24.933 --> 01:03:27.360
He stayed with Reed and
just dropped in on classes,

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.110
but it wouldn't count
as getting a degree.

01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:29.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
He was studying things

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:31.360
like calligraphy that
actually turned out

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.960
to be incredibly
important for him.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.752
AUDIENCE: I mean, that's
the quote example,

01:03:34.752 --> 01:03:36.505
he went a lot of
classes [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:36.505 --> 01:03:39.090
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.423
And he spent a year in India.

01:03:40.423 --> 01:03:42.548
AUDIENCE: Yeah, he did a
lot of interesting things.

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:49.900
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So Baumol's
point is progress requires--

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.640
we shouldn't underestimate this.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.710
It's not that one side is bad.

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:58.090
Progress requires both
breakthrough radical advance

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:00.100
and incremental advance.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.190
And an example, which I've
used before with you all, you

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:06.220
know, if you're flying
across the Atlantic Ocean,

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.520
the Wright brothers,
you know, motorized kite

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.070
is a terrific, radical
break through advance.

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:15.070
But I'd rather take
the 787, product

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:17.560
of 10 decades worth of
incremental advances when

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.300
I go across the ocean.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.520
So both are really
important here.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.215
You've got to do both pieces.

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:30.370
But, a disproportionate
share of the breakthroughs do

01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:35.140
seem to come from kind
of independent inventors

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:36.160
or entrepreneurs.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.947
And large firms tend to
specialize on the incremental,

01:04:39.947 --> 01:04:42.280
in part because they want to
break up their own business

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.050
models, right?

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:44.717
They've got established
business models.

01:04:44.717 --> 01:04:46.780
They want to contribute
to those business models

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.990
rather than wreck their
existing business model.

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:52.240
So that's part of the
economic motivation here.

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:58.990
But education for
incremental advance

01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:02.110
may well be different as Baumol
points out, than education

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:05.770
for the novel advance.

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:07.650
And incremental
improvement may well

01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:10.930
require a much greater
mastery of demanding

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:14.650
science and technology
information than the novel

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:16.360
idea.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.440
So both are essential.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.700
But then he posts the
critical question,

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.920
how do you educate for the
original and novel idea

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.510
generation?

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:33.223
So we've got three new
stories on the table here.

01:05:33.223 --> 01:05:35.140
And let's start off
discussion, and then we'll

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.610
take a break in a bit.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:38.330
First, we've got
Richard Freeman.

01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:39.790
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.190
I wanted to make
some strides actually

01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:45.940
on a point to that Baumol made
in our conversation of three

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.543
months since Baumol was
the one who cited P&G

01:05:49.543 --> 01:05:51.460
as an innovative research
and development firm

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.360
with a lot of PhDs.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.100
One of you posed the
question about Freeman.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.540
This paper lauds
the relationship

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.690
in the United States between
firms and university research.

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:03.970
For multi-national
companies, what incentives

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:06.850
do they have to promote US
innovation leadership, even

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:09.010
when they may be based in
the US when they operate

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:10.750
in so many different countries?

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.340
So at the heart of
this question is,

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:16.030
why do we need to
invest in America

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:19.450
if it is that the private
sector is not investing and has

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:22.240
no rational self
interest to invest in us

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.370
from an economic perspective?

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:27.650
That is the implication
of this question.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.108
AUDIENCE: I don't
think it's like--

01:06:29.108 --> 01:06:31.130
I think that we look at
it one dimensionally.

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:32.710
You have to look at it,
like, think about it

01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:33.340
like an individual, right?

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.340
Like you're going to be a baby.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.715
There's a whole
gestation period.

01:06:35.715 --> 01:06:37.678
Then there's a time
period where you're trying

01:06:37.678 --> 01:06:38.720
to grow as an individual.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.178
And then there's one when you're
ready to get to it, right?

01:06:41.178 --> 01:06:43.410
And like you're very useful.

01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.080
So for industry like,
they can't really

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.130
handle this whole
gestation period,

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.740
you know, one to 18
years old period.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.890
But they can handle
it after, when

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:54.930
you're ready to go and do
a little ramp up skills.

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:58.930
But to do a whole thing
is pretty difficult.

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:01.140
AUDIENCE: That's an
interesting answer.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.930
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'd add too
that the US has an extremely

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:06.390
decentralized labor market.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:10.110
So there is a huge disincentive
for employers in the United

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.960
States to offer training.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:18.510
Because they offer training,
which can be quite expensive,

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:23.070
investing in you, that in
turn equips you to move on.

01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:27.390
So often another
employer will buy you out

01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:30.210
for a lower margin with
the educational costs.

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:32.640
But the employer who
invested in your education

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.420
won't be able to
match that increment.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.080
So why should they
invest in employees

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.540
if the talent is
going to go elsewhere?

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.390
And countries like Germany have
a much more established set

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:49.380
of apprenticeship rules and
much more heavily unionized,

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:53.040
80% unionized in the
manufacturing sector.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:56.130
They have been able to create
an apprenticeship system that's

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:58.800
much more enduring
and employer tied.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.770
That creates tremendous
encouragement for employers

01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:06.060
to provide lots of skills
training to its employees.

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.700
Indeed, it's really a part of
the German education system.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.470
We have never really
been able, because we

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:14.550
have such a decentralized and
almost laissez faire labor

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:18.899
market, we've never
been able to create

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:22.460
significant incentives for
employers to provide education.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:24.797
It's a deep structural
problem in our system.

01:08:24.797 --> 01:08:26.880
And you know it's one we're
going to probably have

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.172
to figure out how to deal with.

01:08:28.172 --> 01:08:31.270
We have created a whole
system of community colleges.

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:32.850
But the burden is
on the employee

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:34.470
to go back and get
that education.

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:37.170
We make that pretty inexpensive.

01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:39.470
AUDIENCE: Going back here
about the gatekeeper thing.

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.143
Couldn't we just bribe them?

01:08:42.143 --> 01:08:43.810
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Bribe the employees?

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:44.109
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:44.520
Oh, no.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.180
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Bribe the employers?

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:45.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:46.319
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Right, we could.

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:47.970
AUDIENCE: The education,
how much is it?

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I'm
sure it's not cheap, right?

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.109
AUDIENCE: Damn it.

01:08:50.109 --> 01:08:50.880
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
But in other words,

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.460
could we create an
incentive for employers

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:57.450
to provide the education
system, even if they weren't

01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:59.729
able to retain their workers.

01:08:59.729 --> 01:09:01.590
And what would that cost?

01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:03.600
So maybe the feds would
pick up that cost.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.569
So in a way, the
community college system

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:08.939
is a way of the
government picking up that

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:13.720
Cost and share it
with the employee.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:17.560
Because employers can't
take the risk mitigating.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.411
I kind of jumped into
the discussion here.

01:09:20.411 --> 01:09:21.953
I want to give it
back to you, Steph.

01:09:21.953 --> 01:09:23.569
Get me out of this.

01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:26.529
AUDIENCE: I think that's--
who posed this question?

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:27.970
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:31.330
I mean it really gets at the
heart of all three readings.

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:33.580
And I think, in
particular, let me

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:38.920
see if I can parse for a quote
here from one of the readings.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.229
Actually it was in Freeman's
reading, when he quoted

01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:43.979
Derek Bok, who is the founder--

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:44.640
I think--

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.550
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
President of Harvard.

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:46.859
AUDIENCE: President of Harvard.

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:49.240
And now the graduate school
of education at Harvard

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.720
has a center for innovative
learning named after Derek Bok.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.750
And he claimed towards
the end of the piece,

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:58.330
or rather he was cited
towards the end of the piece

01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:01.690
as saying that other countries
are facilitating our enterprise

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:02.660
model.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:07.350
And if, I think it's really
meritous of consideration,

01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:09.880
that if our education
system is not supporting

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.030
the production of scientists
and engineers, and firms are you

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:15.070
know sort of ready and
happy to get employees

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:17.440
from other countries or to
move to other countries,

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.840
that we're effectively
shooting ourself in a foot,

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.810
by participating in free market
principles for education.

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:24.618
Because we can't
provide the labor force

01:10:24.618 --> 01:10:26.410
and we can't support
the labor force and we

01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:28.540
can't support
incentives financially.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:32.470
So at the end of the day,
we're preventing ourselves

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:34.570
on all fronts from
innovating, which

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:38.260
I think is a really important
consideration that merits sort

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.880
of being honest with ourselves,
as not only a society,

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.430
but also as you know
a political economy.

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:47.050
AUDIENCE: Something
throughout all the readings

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:48.640
that I have not understood.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.790
How is it that we're spending
so much on education,

01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:54.840
like so much money per
student, yet teachers

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.240
are not getting any
of it and the students

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.940
don't have very high
quality educations.

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:00.940
Where's the money going?

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
Max, I think that

01:11:02.315 --> 01:11:04.210
was addressed by Norman
Augustine's piece

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:06.610
very slightly when he talked
about the appropriation

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.590
of funds and where
spending goes.

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:11.110
Specifically Augustine
cited that 61%

01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:13.120
of education budgets
in schools tend

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.920
to go to education
spending sort of broadly.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.890
And that it actually
tends to trend downward

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:19.390
for a lot of school
districts who

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:22.570
focus on other extracurricular
activities like sports.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.880
And I think he made
that very brief note

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.020
about the role of
American culture

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.780
in those funding priorities.

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:35.050
And I think that also
was a consideration

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:37.900
of mine in reading this
piece in conjunction

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.010
with the Freeman piece.

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:43.480
Like, what is the role that
our own vision of ourselves

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.300
and how we want to
educate our children

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:51.550
informs our policy decisions
and spending down the line.

01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:54.430
And you brought the
point earlier that

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:56.200
how is it that we
don't have-- or that we

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.750
have too many jobs that
we don't have enough jobs

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:02.290
but have too many PhDs, but
then not have enough PhDs.

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:05.170
And I think that the point
that Bill was trying to make

01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:08.350
is that we have
too many PhDs who

01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:10.750
are trying to go into academia,
but not enough PhDs who

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:14.380
are prepared for industry
and not enough PhDs generally

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.970
to go into industry.

01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:17.620
Does that clear
things up a little?

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.203
AUDIENCE: That clears
things up a lot.

01:12:19.203 --> 01:12:20.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:20.770
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, I think I'd

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:22.080
add an additional point there.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.840
And this is a complex one that
you are free to disagree with.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:31.570
But, when we created the higher
education system in the US,

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:35.230
obviously it occurred over
the process of centuries.

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:38.980
And when the federal government,
during and following World War

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:41.230
II, came into a very
significant support

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:45.010
role for that system in
addition to the states,

01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:50.170
that was already a quite
competitive system.

01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:52.870
And as someone who has spent
substantial amount of time

01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:56.860
with MIT's top
administrators, I can tell you

01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:01.220
that MIT and other universities
do exactly the same thing,

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.320
they watched their university
competitors like hawks.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.120
They know exactly
what they're up to.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.340
They know exactly what
they're spending on what.

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.220
They know exactly what their
competition models are.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:17.080
They're looking very hard at how
MIT will compete all the time.

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.350
It is an extremely
competitive model.

01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:26.170
It drives a tremendous search
for talent at the faculty level

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:27.670
as well as the student level.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:31.660
And that talent base is
very well compensated.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.380
And that is a core way by
which you compete for talent

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.330
in a competitive system.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:43.090
We don't really have a
competitive system in the K-12

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:44.270
public education system.

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:46.660
It's essentially a
monopoly-based socialist model

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.010
frankly.

01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:52.570
And you know part of the entry
of charter school legislation

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:55.840
was to introduce a
competitive model into the K

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.010
through 12 system.

01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:59.630
Now there's a big debate as
to how well that's worked.

01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:01.990
But I think it's
fair to say overall,

01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:04.820
it's added a significant dose
of competition into that system.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:07.660
And

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.970
You could look at
competition in health care.

01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:12.150
And you could
competition and you

01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:15.010
know other large government
supported systems too.

01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:17.560
But you know, when we
came out of World War II,

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.200
we created a socialist model
for caring for veterans

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.750
in federally owned hospitals.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:27.790
And we fit into what was
already a competitive space

01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:31.390
by supporting students, who
in turn were given funding

01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:32.200
and they could go.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.700
They could take the
money with them.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.140
Didn't go to the
universities to fund them.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:39.250
So it's introduction of
more competitive models

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:42.280
here may have something
to do with improvements

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.400
in higher education.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.760
At least that was the
concept behind introducing

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.200
charter schools.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.820
AUDIENCE: Could I
ask you a followup?

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.160
I know that other countries
have normal schools which

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.075
are schools meant to train--

01:14:52.075 --> 01:14:54.340
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah, other
countries have socialist models

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.470
and make them work.

01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:58.110
But we're just not
as good at that.

01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:00.130
AUDIENCE: What prevented
the United States

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:03.452
from developing normal schools
or incorporating normal schools

01:15:03.452 --> 01:15:04.160
into their model?

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.310
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I don't want to claim

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:10.680
to be an expert on the
creation of normal schools.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.340
But in the 19th
century, the US did

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:19.970
create both the institutions
for mass higher education, i.e.

01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:23.730
the public universities,
and high school education

01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:26.250
in a very short period of time.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:28.200
And communities were
essentially realizing

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.600
that they had to
upgrade the skills

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.420
for an industrial economy
as their population shifted

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:39.950
from farming to working in
manufacturing firms primarily.

01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:42.750
And they understood the need
for upgraded skill sets.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:45.780
And there was an effort
across the country

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.040
to create high schools.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.640
Now some regions, particularly
New England, had them.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.030
But the rest of the country,
including the American South,

01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:58.920
is pretty quick to
replicate a high school

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.850
model as a fix for
a needed skill set.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:05.660
So that is a massive
social policy

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:09.018
that was done in a remarkably
short period of decades

01:16:09.018 --> 01:16:09.810
across the country.

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:12.648
So the country is capable of
making really major changes.

01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:19.200
I don't think I
answered your question.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.120
AUDIENCE: That's OK.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:26.330
I just certainly think it's
important to consider the--

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:28.740
as it was highlighted
I think in several

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.710
of the readings, the
role of teachers,

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:34.580
one, moving forward
in the future, two,

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:38.360
how teachers are currently
being educated, three,

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:43.460
teachers are being compensated
and sustained within the model.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.220
They seem to be sort of an
undercurrent of what we're

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:48.770
talking about, but not something
that any of the readings

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:51.950
are willing to address
specifically, and perhaps

01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:54.910
strategically for
political reasons.

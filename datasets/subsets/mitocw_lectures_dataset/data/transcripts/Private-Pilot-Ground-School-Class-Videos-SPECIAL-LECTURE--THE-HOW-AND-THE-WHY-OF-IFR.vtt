WEBVTT

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.580
TINA SRISVASTAVA: OK, so when
we were talking about radar,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.870
we had a great reminder
about how the origins of that

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.280
came right here at MIT.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.840
And in fact,
physically right here,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.240
where the Stata
building is located.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.880
Well, when we're talking
about instrument flying,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.080
there is also a very strong
connection here to MIT.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.170
So does anyone know the
story of Jimmy Dolittle

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.360
and his first blind flight?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.704
Yes, do you want to share?

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:41.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.620
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
Yes, you're right.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.805
He has a lot of good stories.

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:45.055
AUDIENCE: Takeoff and
landing [? just on ?]

00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:45.847
flight instruments.

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:47.388
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
Takeoff and landing

00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:48.950
just on flight instruments, yes.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.314
Good, that's exactly right.

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:53.210
AUDIENCE: He also
got a doctorate here.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.830
TINA SRISVASTAVA: He also
got his doctorate here,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.372
that's right.

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:58.530
You have a good
understanding of him.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.919
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.110
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
So Jimmy Dolittle,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.170
before he came to MIT, was
flying in the military.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.230
And he was doing
a lot of things.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.470
He's known for flying across the
country in a very short period

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.890
of time and encountering a
lot of storms and weather.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.580
And being one of the first
people to really rely

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.280
on the instruments
inside your planes--

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.050
all your flight controls--

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.720
when you're not able to
look outside the airplane.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.350
And just as you
said, he studied here

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.450
and got his graduate
degree here.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.150
But even after
that, he continued

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.480
to study how a
pilot could fly when

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.690
the visibility outside the
airplane was very difficult--

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.220
and really pioneered the concept
that in a very foggy weather

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.710
condition, for example,
you can still successfully

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.080
fly an airplane by relying
on the flight instruments.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.790
And in particular, one of
the most significant flight

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.910
instruments is what's called
an artificial horizon.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.090
So Philip already introduced
that flight instrument.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.300
We'll talk about it.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.020
And when we've discussed
the six-pack, where

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.169
you have these six circle
flight instruments,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.180
it's the one in the
middle on the top.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.770
And we'll look in
that in particular.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.130
So that artificial horizon
with a little airplane on it

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.810
is basically supposed to replace
looking outside your windshield

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.910
and seeing the real horizon.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.240
And so it's a good
thing to rely on.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.960
One of the most important
instruments when you're flying.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.390
So basically,
instrument flying is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.720
how you can rely
on the technologies

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.560
inside your airplane
to avoid hitting things

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.100
and to land without being able
to see outside your airplane.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.420
And IFR stands for
Instrument Flight Rules.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.770
And so that means that you
have to follow a set of rules

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.780
when there are clouds outside.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.360
Now, because pilots
really need to make

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.550
sure to practice
and stay current,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.460
we have a situation where
most of the time that people

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.040
are practicing that
instrument flights

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.170
might be a condition
where actually it is quite

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.350
sunny and beautiful outside.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.640
But they're just practicing.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.260
So the way that
we distinguish it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.580
is when it's actually
very foggy, very cloudy,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.380
you can't see outside--

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.120
that is described by IMC,
or Instrument Meteorological

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.810
Conditions--

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.230
IMC conditions.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.070
So that's when you actually
have the condition where

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.930
you can't see
outside the airplane

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.880
and then you follow your IFR,
your Instrument Flight Rules.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.020
And so the goal of
this whole process

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.060
is to be able to fly
safely, even when

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.800
you can't see out the window.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.040
So why would you want
to be flying when you

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.270
can't see outside the window?

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.810
There are a lot of
reasons for that.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.240
I've been spending a lot
of time in California.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.550
And here's a familiar
sight in California.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.330
If you see a lot of
clouds, a lot of fog--

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.430
fog is a daily
occurrence, depending

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.520
on where you are, especially
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.910
And so a VFR pilot
won't be able to really

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.282
fly in those conditions at all.

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:12.260
PHILIP GREENSPUN: It's
important to remember,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.810
it's beautiful
right above the fog.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.290
So you could be flying in
the clouds for a minute

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.700
and then you proceed to your
destination in the desert

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.492
or wherever it is.

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:23.700
TINA SRISVASTAVA: Absolutely.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.590
So Philip was just talking
about a condition just shown

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.450
in this picture
here, where it might

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.300
be the case that there's
a thin layer of clouds

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.250
or fog at a low altitude.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.590
But if you were to go
through that, above it,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.860
it's really beautiful
up above the clouds.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.410
And sometimes this
is called VFR On Top.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.700
So you have Visual Flight
Rules up on top of the clouds.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.690
It's not that you're
flying in the clouds,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.670
but you have a cloud
cover below you.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.600
And so if you have your
instrument flight rating,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.030
then you can fly right
through that thin layer

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.080
of clouds or fog and be flying
in a beautiful day above that.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.080
I'd also like to point out
that instrument flying makes

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.580
you a better pilot.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.280
So I know this personally-- if
you remember from yesterday,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.010
I talked about how
after my private,

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.080
basically one of the
first things I did

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.050
was start on my
instrument flight rating.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.840
And you actually start
with just learning

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.910
how to be a better pilot.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.140
You start sticking to your
altitude a little better.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.657
When you're a VFR
pilot, a lot of times

00:05:27.657 --> 00:05:29.490
when we talked about
the different airspace,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.160
there isn't a very strict
restriction on what altitude

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.910
you need to be at.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.560
You're not really
filing a flight plan.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.210
You could be
changing your heading

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.250
and wandering over one way and
wandering over another way.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.760
But when you start training
for your instrument,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.730
you start learning more
precisely what it takes

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.910
to trim your aircraft's
configuration correctly,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.700
how to stay at 3,000 feet,
1-8-0 heading, whatever it is--

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.830
and actually maintain
that while you're

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.500
doing a number of other
operations in your plane.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.600
And not getting
distracted in such a way

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.960
that causes you to change
your heading or your altitude.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.670
So that just makes you a
better pilot altogether,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.350
even in visual
flight conditions.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.460
The reason, of course, that you
have to learn how to fly more

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.600
precisely is because when
you are in an actual IMC

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.940
condition with
clouds and you can't

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.530
see outside your
airplane, you're

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.630
relying on the air
traffic controllers

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.610
to sequence the airplanes
and make sure they

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.060
don't come near each other.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.120
And so the air
traffic controller

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.460
is going to want to
know that if they

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.670
tell you to stay on a particular
vector-- so an altitude

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.295
heading.

00:06:37.295 --> 00:06:39.420
And they want to make sure
you actually stay there,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.128
because if you start
drifting off-course,

00:06:41.128 --> 00:06:43.470
you could drift into the
course of another airplane

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.000
that they have flying in
a different direction.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.790
So you actually
are required to do

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.070
some amount of
instrument training,

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.930
even for your private pilot--

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.590
about three hours.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.790
So that means that
you have to go flying

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.720
and rely purely on the
instruments in order to fly.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.640
So it would be great
if there is a day that

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.300
has fog without an
adverse weather situation

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.140
so you could actually fly
in true IMC conditions,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.320
where your instructor is
really taking control there

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.510
but allowing you
to experience it.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.500
But if that doesn't happen, you
can use a view-limiting device,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.010
such as foggles.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.070
So these are basically
glasses you put on

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.580
that fog out where you would
see outside the window and only

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.100
are visible looking
at your controls.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.340
Or a hood that basically
blocks your view of everything

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.420
except the instruments.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.410
So we've already talked
about radar and ATC

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.450
and working with those
air traffic controllers.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.070
So those air traffic
controllers are

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.170
responsible for the
separation of the airplanes.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.950
And they will assign
specific altitudes, headings,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.200
and different routes
and clearances.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.600
Navaids is short for
navigational aids,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.300
like radio and GPS.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.110
And then we've already discussed
just now about a transponder.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.260
So that xpdr just
stands for transponder.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.710
And that's just basically
saying that if the radar itself

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.980
is unable to provide the
accurate altitude of the plane,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.120
you can add on the transponder
to help with the radar return.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.280
We've also discussed
briefly the ADS-B--

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.530
and we will get into, when
we talk about weather data,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.780
how you can build your
own device to receive

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.790
that ADS-B data.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.720
So let's talk about the
different phases of an IFR

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.350
flight.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.150
So there's a little
bit more you need to do

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.530
in the flight planning stage.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.809
You also do need to
file a flight plan,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.892
which we discussed isn't
required for your VFR flights.

00:08:40.892 --> 00:08:42.309
And then some more
things you need

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.910
to do once you depart,
when you're en route,

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.040
and then your
approach to landing.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.350
So what Philip
helped me pass out

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.780
are what's called
approach plates.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.860
So you'll hear that--

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.980
so it's different information
that talks about--

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.980
when you're landing, they're
different specific procedures.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.140
Because, again, you can't
see outside the airplane,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.685
so they will create a
path that you fly on that

00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:09.130
are specifically designed
to avoid terrain and allow

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.860
you to come in and land
at the airport safely.

00:09:18.845 --> 00:09:20.970
Although I passed out the
physical piece of paper--

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.550
and a lot of people have
physical pieces of paper

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.930
for those approach plates--

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.710
I've also pulled up an airport.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.620
I used Bedford,
my local airport.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.900
And you can go
down on ForeFlight

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.148
to approach and see all the
different approach procedures.

00:09:37.148 --> 00:09:38.190
So I'll pass this around.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.060
And basically you can click on
different approach procedures.

00:09:48.742 --> 00:09:51.200
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Let me also
add that all these plates are

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.460
available free online.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.390
If you go to any source,
like SkyVector or AirNav.com,

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.970
you can go to the airport and
see a list of the procedures

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.992
and just grab the
PDF on your device.

00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:03.200
TINA SRISVASTAVA: Absolutely.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.280
They're all free online.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.530
And you want to make sure
you have the updated ones,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.435
because sometimes
they do change.

00:10:08.435 --> 00:10:09.920
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, I meant
just here for the lecture.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.337
If you just want to have it
in front of you on your phone.

00:10:12.337 --> 00:10:15.600
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.210
Pre-flight planning is
just really important.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.760
As much as we just talked
about meteorology and different

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.920
adverse weather
conditions-- so just

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.980
because you have the ability to
fly in the clouds doesn't mean

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.360
it's a good idea.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.850
If there is anything
like thunderstorms,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.580
icing conditions, something
that could impair your ability

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.190
to fly safely, then it doesn't
mean you should go flying.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.130
And it's really
important to understand

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.600
where all the adverse conditions
are and look at all that data.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.820
So when you're doing
your pre-flight planning,

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.530
there's certain
information about when

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.850
you need to have an alternate.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.680
So the time and hour before--

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.810
an hour after your
estimated time of arrival.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.930
Your ceiling-- so
what's a ceiling again?

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.400
That's when you
have cloud cover--

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.185
so either broken
or overcast clouds.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:01.560
So they're saying
if that ceiling

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.300
is less than 2,000 feet.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.360
And then your visibility--
so how far out you can see--

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.950
three miles.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.430
And one of the biggest rules
of thumb to keep in mind

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.530
is that when you're
doing this planning,

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.523
you don't want a situation where
you take off from an airport

00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:20.190
and you plan it such
that the weather is

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.040
going to get so bad that you
can't return to that airport.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.740
So a good, safe rule
of thumb is make sure

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.560
that you can get back to the
airport you're taking off from,

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.200
in case there's any issue
with your airplane or travel.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.880
You want to be able
to safely get back

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.410
from where you took off from.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.895
And even though with
your IFR rating,

00:11:39.895 --> 00:11:41.270
you can fly through
clouds, there

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.850
are still specific
visibility requirements

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.970
for every single
approach and airport

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:47.970
that you're coming into.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.240
It can't be a completely dense
fog all the way to the ground.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.410
There is a altitude where
even the big, major commercial

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.428
jets have to be able to identify
certain runway indicators

00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:00.720
before they're allowed to land.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.310
And if they're not
able to, they have

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.770
to go around or find
an alternate airport.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.750
And all that
specific information

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.680
is on those approach plates that
we'll talk about in a moment.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.780
So you can actually file
a flight plan directly

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:19.398
on the computer or with an
app, such as ForeFlight.

00:12:19.398 --> 00:12:21.190
This is what I was
discussing a moment ago.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.010
This is your six-pack, again--

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.080
your flight controls.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.830
And the one right in
the center at the top

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.170
is that artificial horizon.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.690
And just as Jimmy Dolittle did--

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.570
found that as a very
important reference point.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.070
That's really what
you want to spend

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:36.750
most of your time
looking at when

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.010
you're flying the instrument.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.892
Just like when
you're flying VFR,

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:41.850
you want to spend most
of your time looking out

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.910
the window at the actual
horizon and what's out there.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.570
You want to look at this to
make sure you haven't started

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.340
turning and not realized it.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.322
So we're going to get into
human factors this afternoon.

00:12:53.322 --> 00:12:55.530
But just like we talked
about when we were discussing

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.410
aerodynamics, your
body can't really

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.710
feel the difference between
gravity and acceleration.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.570
And so if you start a turn
but then you basically

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.890
have even doubt in
your flying level,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.840
your body will not notice
that you're tilted.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.970
And so that's why
it's really important

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.670
to keep an eye on this
artificial horizon

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.530
and make sure you're
in fact flying straight

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.905
and level when
you think you are.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.590
So we're going to talk about
a lot of different safety

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.050
considerations.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.450
We talk a lot about
minimums with regard

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.000
to what are the FAA
regulations or your flight

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.973
school might impose--

00:13:36.973 --> 00:13:39.140
the place you're renting
your aircraft might impose.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.330
Certain minimums--
that they don't

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.480
want you to take the plane
unless the ceiling is

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.860
above 2,000 feet, for example.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.520
But there is also this
concept of personal minimums.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.980
And Philip and I will
spend a chunk of time

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.770
at the end of the course talking
about our personal minimums

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.840
and sharing them
with you, that you

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.710
might want to set your own
restrictions-- that, hey,

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.600
if certain things are occurring
and you don't feel comfortable,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.017
you don't think
it's safe, you set

00:14:05.017 --> 00:14:06.620
those restrictions to yourself.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.710
So that way, on a particular
day that you're planning to fly,

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.530
you don't get the
get-there-itis, where you just

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.050
really want to go
and you decide you're

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.370
going to do whatever it takes.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.500
You can refer to your personal
minimums and say, hey,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.470
I have previously decided
that this wasn't a good idea.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.720
So let's stick to my judgment
at that time and not fly.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.110
We're also going to discuss
how, even though the FAA might

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.140
require only a single
pilot in command,

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.080
you can actually have a
different person sitting next

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.780
to you, whether they're a pilot,
whether they're just a friend,

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.780
you can put that person
to work to help you out

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.540
in managing your cockpit
and helping with some

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.950
of the navigation, for example.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.690
So let's talk a little bit
about the approach plate.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.860
So does everybody have
an approach plate,

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.560
either on their computer or
a physical piece of paper?

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.810
Is anyone missing one?

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.480
OK, so there's a
lot of information

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.070
on an approach plate.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.220
And you don't need to know any
of this for your private pilot.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.050
But just so you
get oriented, I'm

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.270
just going to give you a
high level of what kind

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.120
of information is on
this approach plate

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.590
and what we're talking about.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.530
So again, this is
a situation where

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.760
there could be cloud cover
or you're flying in fog

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.510
and so you can't see
outside your airplane

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.340
or you can't see
the airport, but you

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.720
have to safely arrive
at the airport.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.160
So the approach plate
provides a flight path for you

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.360
to fly on to safely enter
the airport's vicinity,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.940
enter the final approach,
and then to a point where

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.550
you can visually identify
certain runway markings

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.470
and land safely.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.320
So the very top of
the approach plate

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.660
tells you a lot of information.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.070
So the top right corner,
where it says RNAV GPS--

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.130
that's identifying the type
of approach that it is.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.930
So usually, it'll
tell you whether it's

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.240
a precision approach or
a non-precision approach.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.890
So there are different types
of instruments on your plane.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.580
You'll see, as that iPad's
being passed around,

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.580
with the different ones
you can click on-- there

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.630
are certain instruments
in your plane

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.020
and at the airport that will
tell you how you can land.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.880
So an ILS, for example--

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.620
an Instrument Landing System.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.160
If that is available, it
can be a very precise way

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.800
to land at an airport, whereas
if you don't have exactly

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.000
those things available, you
might use a GPS or a VOR,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.037
which are different types
of approaches you can fly.

00:16:31.037 --> 00:16:33.370
It'll also tell you the runway,
which is very important.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.700
Runway 16-- so that's the
runway you're trying to land at.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.690
And then just below
it is the airport.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.020
So this one in
particular is Port Smith,

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.440
which is an airport
that's basically--

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.680
if you drive to the
coast from here.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.100
So it's at the border between
Maine and New Hampshire,

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.510
right along the coastline.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.870
And people refer to
this airport as Pease.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.740
You also see a lot of very
specific information-- a lot

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.700
of numbers and things there.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:07.670
So we've discussed a few
times the concept of ADAS.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.869
So you see that ADAS-- so that's
the frequency you can dial into

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:14.812
to get the weather
information at that airport.

00:17:14.812 --> 00:17:16.520
And you'll need to
get the latest weather

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.119
information before you enter
and start doing the procedure.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.630
You also see the air
traffic controller here

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:29.360
is Boston approach, who you'll
be talking to on 125.05.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.780
You see the Pease tower,
or Portsmouth tower--

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.580
128.4.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.610
And then after you land,
here's the ground controller

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.698
that you talk to.

00:17:38.698 --> 00:17:40.490
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Tina,
do we have to worry

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.450
about those other numbers?

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.950
Like 269?

00:17:44.437 --> 00:17:46.020
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
Let's make it simple

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.560
and say, no, you
don't have to worry

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.825
about those other numbers.

00:17:48.825 --> 00:17:50.050
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK,
those are for the military.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.030
That's UHF.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.960
And you won't have that
in your rental Piper.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.960
TINA SRISVASTAVA: Another
really important thing

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.750
to pay attention to is
at the top right corner

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.580
is a missed approach.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.110
So if you were not able
to complete the landing--

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.050
maybe you had to go around
or something didn't feel safe

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.930
or you lost communications
when you were coming in--

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.810
and you are not able
to execute the landing,

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.610
then you fly a missed approach.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.040
So it tells you what to do
if you weren't able to land.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.030
So it says climb to
3,000-- so 3,000 feet--

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.740
direct-- and it says
this TTATT is the name

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.760
of a particular location.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.060
So, TTATT.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.620
And then it says, and
on track 165 degrees--

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.940
so that's the heading--

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.510
to IDEED and hold.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.820
So it basically says that
if you weren't able to land,

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.140
then you're supposed to continue
straight, climb to 3,000 feet,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.990
to this TTATT location.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.050
And then on the
track 165 degrees,

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.360
to continue on to
IDEED and hold.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.883
So now the middle of
the approach plate

00:18:58.883 --> 00:19:00.050
really tells you what to do.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.560
There a couple different points
that are really interesting.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.024
So IAF-- does anyone
know what IAF stands for?

00:19:08.024 --> 00:19:10.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Approach Fix.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.080
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
Initial Approach Fix.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.900
So these are places where
you can enter this pattern.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.920
So IAF-- you can
enter here at ITAWT.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.980
There are a couple
others here as well.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.950
So what it's saying is if
you entered here at ITAWT,

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.130
you're flying at
3,000 feet on heading

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:35.670
118 degrees to this
holding pattern right here.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.280
And every time it has
these weird letters

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.440
is representing another point.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.950
And then you continue
straight towards the airport,

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.750
to this other spot.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.340
And then here is
the actual airport--

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.083
it says runway 16, where
you could land right here.

00:19:51.083 --> 00:19:52.500
And if you have a
missed approach,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.820
remember it said to
continue straight to TTATT

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.050
and then to continue on to
IDEED and you can do a hold over

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.220
here.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.820
So aviators are not
without a sense of humor.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.800
So let's just go through
what that would be.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.370
What are the names of
the points along the way?

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:21.370
You start with ITAWT,
ITAWA, PUDYE, TTATT--

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:21.870
IDEED.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.150
So I'm getting a
lot of chuckles.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.150
In case you missed that, it's
I thought I saw a putty-tat.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.280
I did, I did see a putty-tat.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.460
Anyway, good cartoon
for you there.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.430
So that shows you a
little bit of humor

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.090
in this particular
approach plate.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.820
The bottom of the approach
plate shows the same thing,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.750
but a profile view.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.080
So this shows the
altitudes as you're going.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.390
So you start at 3,000.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:54.800
This is your heading, you're
going along into ITAWA.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.340
And then you go down,
you're descending to PUDYE.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.190
And then all the way
here, where you land.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.270
And if you have to
execute a missed approach,

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.090
then it pictorially describes
that missed approach, which

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.120
is you continue
straight at 3,000 feet,

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:19.500
climb to 3,000 to TTATT and
then on heading 165 to IDEED.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.480
And then here on
the left, of course,

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.160
is a picture of that runway.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.470
And it tells you what
the runway looks like,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.060
the taxiways around
it, the length

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.102
of the runway, et cetera.

00:21:28.102 --> 00:21:29.768
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
What are the minimums?

00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:32.020
How low can you go
before seeing the runway?

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.490
TINA SRISVASTAVA: The minimums
depend on the type of aircraft

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.870
that you have.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.360
I was skipping over it because
it's fairly complicated.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.630
But this whole thing
down here basically

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.280
indicates the minimums in
terms of your visibility

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.060
as you're landing.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.460
So where it says category,
it's the different types

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.470
of categories of aircraft.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.610
Circling means that if you were
planning to land at one runway,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.190
but you circle to land
at another runway.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.920
And then it has a lot
of specifics depending

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.905
on the actual type of aircraft.

00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:06.230
PHILIP GREENSPUN: What
about in a CIRRUS?

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.263
A modern CIRRUS?

00:22:07.263 --> 00:22:09.055
TINA SRISVASTAVA: You
can go ahead, Philip.

00:22:09.055 --> 00:22:09.930
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.470
So that top one is LPV.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.810
That's essentially a precision
approach using the GPS.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.670
So if you have a WAAS GPS,
which is the modern kind,

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.940
as of about 10 years ago,
you can go down to 300 feet.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.300
So if you don't see some
indication of the airport

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.020
environment, the runway
leaving lights or something,

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.890
then you can't go
below 300 feet.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.420
It is time to do a missed.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.985
And it also tells you you
need 2,400 feet of visibility.

00:22:36.985 --> 00:22:38.860
TINA SRISVASTAVA: In
this case, that 300 feet

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.520
is regardless of the category,
whether it's a, b, c, d, or e--

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.770
they all show that same amount.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.370
And when Philip is talking
about depending on the type--

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.590
whether you're reading here
the LPV, LNAV, et cetera,

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.380
on the left.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.797
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, like
the LNAV approach down there,

00:22:56.797 --> 00:23:00.367
towards the bottom, that would
be for an older non-WAAS GPS.

00:23:00.367 --> 00:23:01.950
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
So there's obviously

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.960
a lot more information
on this approach plate.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.168
But those are some of the
key highlights so you don't

00:23:06.168 --> 00:23:07.560
get afraid when you see these.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.250
Any questions before we
move past this topic?

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:11.828
Yes.

00:23:11.828 --> 00:23:13.328
AUDIENCE: This is
a stupid question,

00:23:13.328 --> 00:23:16.080
but I've actually looked at
this approach plate before

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.800
and I didn't get that joke.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.195
Is there somewhere you can
look up why they named them

00:23:20.195 --> 00:23:20.778
what they are?

00:23:20.778 --> 00:23:21.657
Or who named them?

00:23:21.657 --> 00:23:23.740
TINA SRISVASTAVA: Oh yeah,
that's a good question.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.205
So basically, if you
missed the joke--

00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:28.500
the I taught I taw
a puddy-tat joke.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.000
Is there a place
you can look it up?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.630
I'm not sure.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.160
But I know a couple
of people that

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.190
write different
articles about aviation.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.920
It'd be a good exercise to
see if we can Google and find

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.642
a couple of those articles and
share where they figure out

00:23:41.642 --> 00:23:43.350
how they name all
these different points.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.830
OK, so if you want to learn--

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.890
yes, go ahead.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.492
AUDIENCE: What are the speeds?

00:23:51.492 --> 00:23:52.700
TINA SRISVASTAVA: The speeds.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.610
Yeah, absolutely--
so what speed do

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:59.043
you have to be as you're flying
these different approaches?

00:23:59.043 --> 00:24:00.085
Do you want to tackle it?

00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:01.160
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah,
I'll just talk about that.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.618
If you're in a
really busy airport,

00:24:02.618 --> 00:24:06.160
they may tell you to keep your
speed up so that you don't

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.650
clog up the works for the jet.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.420
And also autopilots
don't work that well

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.220
if you're going really slowly.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.670
So it's probably conventional
in something like a CIRRUS

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.750
to be going around
120 knots before you

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.430
get to the final approach fix.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.000
You're going to put in one
notch of flaps just before.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.790
And 120 knots is the limitation
on an older CIRRUS, for flaps.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.610
So you'll slow down
to maybe 105 as you're

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.982
going down the glide slope.

00:24:32.982 --> 00:24:35.860
And then once you break
out of the clouds--

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.940
let's say at 500 feet
above the runway--

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.480
although, the minimum there
was 300 above sea level, which

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.670
is 200 feet above the runway.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.170
You put in the full
flaps and you'll

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.780
slow down to your final approach
speed of 75 or 80 knots.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.588
So those would be the typical
speeds on a precision approach.

00:24:52.588 --> 00:24:54.880
TINA SRISVASTAVA: And if
you're practicing, you're new,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.310
it's OK to go a little slower.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.390
They'll tell you if there
are other people behind you.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.930
Holds are a good time--

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.460
the whole point is to basically
take time and slow down.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.580
They're trying to get you
to wait for some reason.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.252
So you might want
to go 90 knots.

00:25:08.252 --> 00:25:10.210
The reason you don't want
to go much below that

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:13.000
is, of course, you are doing
so many things in the airplane

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.003
to get prepared
for the approach,

00:25:15.003 --> 00:25:17.170
you don't want to get down
into very slow air speeds

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.427
where you could stall as well.

00:25:18.427 --> 00:25:19.510
That could be a big issue.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.220
So now just talking
about how you go on

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.320
to get your instrument
flight rating.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.690
There's some good resources
here to point out.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.580
And this talks a little
bit about the time--

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.180
that XC just stands
for Cross-Country Time.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.810
Then you actually need time
and in actual IMC conditions

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.110
or in simulated.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.200
So that's where you're
wearing your goggles

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.250
or your foggles or your hood.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:50.410
And again, you can actually do
a little bit of simulated flight

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.410
training as well.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.410
So some places have
a red bird simulator

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.420
or other types of
simulator where you can

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.460
do some simulated flight time.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.200
Sometimes that'll
save you a little bit

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.710
of money, because you don't
have to spend the engine

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.590
hours to fly out to wherever
you're doing the approach.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.480
And you can just
restart very quickly.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.630
So there could be some
advantages of that.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.970
And then, Philip, you
have some advice here

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.030
on how you get your IFR rating.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.530
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, I think
if you're going to do this--

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.822
once you finish your private--
these higher performance

00:26:19.822 --> 00:26:21.880
airplanes aren't
great for training.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.060
The little Pipers and
Cessnas are probably better,

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.470
just because they're slower.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:31.460
But as soon as you're going to
work on the instrument rating

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.230
and do transportation, then
it's time to get into the CIRRUS

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.810
or get into the Bonanza
that you're intending to use

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.070
for family transportation.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.490
Time and type and realistic--
going with an instructor

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.620
on the trips that you're
actually going to do--

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.810
is invaluable for safety.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:51.658
I think one good way to do it
is do a big cross-country trip

00:26:51.658 --> 00:26:52.450
with an instructor.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.780
Or just go to Florida, go
to California, go to Alaska.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.430
And do an approach every hour.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.970
So then you go through
a lot of weather systems

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.400
and you get very comfortable
with getting the weather

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.760
information, filing flight
plans, working with controllers

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.022
in different situations.

00:27:10.022 --> 00:27:11.980
TINA SRISVASTAVA: One
other thing I would add--

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.830
it's a cool trick you
might not have heard of.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.460
So whenever you're
getting an instruction,

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.680
you have to pay not only
for the aircraft rental,

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.550
but for the time
of your instructor.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.163
Well, if you take an instrument
flight and you practice

00:27:25.163 --> 00:27:27.580
an approach and then you just
want to practice it a couple

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.300
of times yourself, you
can actually go up without

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.820
your instructor-- without
any view-limiting devices,

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.513
of course--

00:27:34.513 --> 00:27:36.430
where you can fully look
outside the airplane.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.222
And you can keep flying
that same approach.

00:27:38.222 --> 00:27:40.690
So you can actually
fly practice approaches

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.060
without actually being in
an instrument condition

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.180
or with view-limiting devices,
to just practice the mechanics

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.200
of the whole thing.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.682
How you deal with
airspeed, who's

00:27:48.682 --> 00:27:50.140
going to start
talking to you next,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.470
what do you need to do next.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.540
And I find that
to be very useful.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.420
You'll also find on that--

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.920
you heard from
Sebastian yesterday

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.870
about the MIT Flying Club.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:04.220
So there's an email list--
flying-pilots@mit.edu.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.210
So once you become a pilot,
it's great to be on that list

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.090
because instrument-rated
pilots have to keep

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.710
practicing their approaches.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.020
And so they need somebody
to sit next to them

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.480
to look out the airplane
for other aircraft

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.450
while they're wearing their
view-limiting devices.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.280
And that person is
called a safety pilot.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.953
So as long as you have
your private pilot license,

00:28:23.953 --> 00:28:25.870
even if you don't have
your instrument rating,

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.520
you can serve as a safety pilot.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.800
So it's a great way--

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.000
and cheap way-- to
get a lot of practice

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.810
in and see an
instrument pilot at work

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.130
trying to do an approach.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.725
And you can sit there
and learn and look out.

00:28:38.725 --> 00:28:41.350
PHILIP GREENSPUN: And you get to
log that time as safety pilot,

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.900
as if you had been flying.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.335
So it's a good way to
build up flying experience.

00:28:44.335 --> 00:28:45.490
TINA SRISVASTAVA: Yeah,
highly recommended.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.650
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Here's
a question for you guys.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.670
So the safety pilot--
you heard about

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.530
the medical certification.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.110
Let's say the person
practicing the approach

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.340
has a first class medical.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.770
So they're very
healthy and the FAA

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.980
thinks the pilot is unlikely
to have a heart attack and keel

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.860
over while under the hood.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.740
Does the safety pilot need
to have a current medical

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.555
to serve as safety pilot?

00:29:12.555 --> 00:29:15.129
What do you guys think?

00:29:15.129 --> 00:29:16.973
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:16.973 --> 00:29:18.390
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
It's ridiculous.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.720
That person has a heart
attack, the regular pilot

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.255
can just take off
the hood and fly.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.420
The safety pilot shouldn't
need a medical, right?

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:35.060
As long as their last words
are, you have the controls.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.820
But in fact, the safety pilot
is a required crew member

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.170
for that operation.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:45.220
So the Feds say that he or she
must have a current medical.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.442
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
And just that joke

00:29:47.442 --> 00:29:49.400
that Philip said about--
you have the controls.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.817
I'll just take a
moment to explain

00:29:50.817 --> 00:29:51.980
what he's talking about.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.927
When you hand over control,
you take the controls,

00:29:54.927 --> 00:29:57.260
it's important to have what's
called a positive exchange

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.200
of controls.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.950
So if I'm flying
the airplane and I'm

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.807
giving the controls to Philip,
I'll say, you have controls.

00:30:03.807 --> 00:30:05.390
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I
have the controls.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:06.890
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
You have controls.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.920
So that reconfirming--
make sure that you

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.420
know who's flying
the airplane so

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.920
that you don't
result in a situation

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.880
where no one's flying.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.240
Yes.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.330
AUDIENCE: When do
your hands come off

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:16.580
the controls in that exchange?

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.122
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
I usually keep them

00:30:18.122 --> 00:30:20.600
on up until I really know
that he knows what he's doing.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.760
So I actually keep
it on a little bit

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.600
longer to make sure he knows
and he doesn't start turning

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.840
in some other direction.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.920
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I
think on that third one.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.962
TINA SRISVASTAVA: The
final, "You have controls."

00:30:31.962 --> 00:30:32.935
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Especially
important in a helicopter.

00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:33.920
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
That's when you let go.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.880
PHILIP GREENSPUN: The
good thing about airplanes

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.670
is you can take your hands off
and the airplane just keeps

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:38.900
doing whatever it was doing.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.790
But the helicopter is
inherently unstable.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:47.000
So yeah, it's important that
you don't take your hands off

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.130
until you hear that
third acknowledgment.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.490
TINA SRISVASTAVA: Yes.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:51.323
AUDIENCE: How long does
a cross-country trip

00:30:51.323 --> 00:30:53.785
take, from here to California?

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:55.160
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
So the question

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.740
was how long does it take to
fly from here to California?

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.230
The answer really depends
on which type of aircraft

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.040
you're flying.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.980
So a little Cessna 172
would take a long time,

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:09.920
because it basically is
twice as fast as a car.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.450
And it's as the crow flies.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:13.820
But if you're flying
a fancy CIRRUS,

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.705
you can get much faster.

00:31:15.705 --> 00:31:18.230
PHILIP GREENSPUN: You get a
headwind going west, generally.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.660
So it's probably going
to take about 15 hours

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.890
to get to California,
maybe a little over 20

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.120
in a Cessna or a Piper.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.060
And then you'll get a little
speed boost on the way back.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.240
There are various companies
that offer 10 day instrument

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:35.780
ratings.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.130
And they fly around a lot.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.320
So a couple of weeks to
get to California and back

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.630
is reasonably comfortable
while doing flight training

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.115
along the way.

00:31:43.115 --> 00:31:45.240
TINA SRISVASTAVA: One of
the biggest things that'll

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.282
slow you down is not how
fast your plane can fly,

00:31:47.282 --> 00:31:49.650
but also your own
fatigue, which we'll

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.847
talk about in human factors.

00:31:52.847 --> 00:31:54.430
All right are there
any more questions

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.190
on instrument
flight or instrument

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.840
meteorological conditions?

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:02.228
Yes.

00:32:02.228 --> 00:32:04.100
AUDIENCE: What's your
opinion on the steam

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.545
gauge versus the glass
cockpit for [INAUDIBLE]??

00:32:06.545 --> 00:32:07.920
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
So the question

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.640
was what's our opinion on steam
gauge versus a glass cockpit?

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.280
I think we know
Philip's opinion here.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.720
I've actually flown both.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.610
I think that with the G1000,
or glass cockpit, what's nice

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.400
is you can load the
approach and it'll actually

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.330
show the full flight
plan that you're supposed

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.805
to fly for a given approach.

00:32:28.805 --> 00:32:30.680
And you can actually
have a whole flight plan

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.370
where you have multiple
approaches, one

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.600
after the other.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.120
And it puts it up there
and it makes it very easy.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.540
But I will say
that to learn it--

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.430
I've actually done
instrument training

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.230
on both the steam gauge
and the glass cockpit.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:46.290
And I think that steam
gauge obviously keeps you

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:47.670
on your toes a lot more.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.110
You really know
what's happening.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.600
You're using your
heading bug to do

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.460
a lot more, because
you can't enter some

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.940
of these things in advance.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.000
And so I think
it's really helpful

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.960
to learn how to do that, just
like I think, for example,

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.217
your autopilot is amazing.

00:33:02.217 --> 00:33:04.050
You should have an
autopilot if you're going

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.490
to fly across the country.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.673
But you shouldn't
use your autopilot

00:33:07.673 --> 00:33:09.090
when you're doing
flight training,

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.048
because the first thing
Mark Nathanson, the FAA

00:33:11.048 --> 00:33:14.070
examiner will do, will be,
oh, look, your autopilot died.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.740
Now you have to learn
how to fly without it.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.310
So I think for flight
training, I recommend both.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.900
The other reason I continue to
fly both steam gauge and G1000

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.535
is that I fly with a
lot of other friends.

00:33:27.535 --> 00:33:29.160
So we talked about
the MIT Flying Club,

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.330
you fly with your peers.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.357
There's also a group
of women pilots--

00:33:32.357 --> 00:33:34.440
we call ourselves The Women
Pilots of New England.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.090
We basically bumped
into each other

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:39.010
in the parking lots of
airports and now get together.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.350
We're actually having a
dinner tonight at 6:00 PM,

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:45.130
so if any women pilots
want to join, please do.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.152
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Or pilots
who identify as women.

00:33:48.152 --> 00:33:49.110
TINA SRISVASTAVA: Sure.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.620
And these groups that you
fly with on these fly-outs,

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.420
it's often the
case that you want

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.410
to have two pilots flying
in a given airplane.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.030
And one flies there.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.160
And one's PIC there and
one's PIC on the way back.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.550
And so if you have
a lot of friends

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.520
that fly the steam gauges,
which are cheaper to rent,

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.070
you want to make sure you're
current in that airplane

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.343
if you want to fly with them.

00:34:12.343 --> 00:34:14.760
And if you fly a G1000, you
want to make sure your friends

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.940
that you fly with
also fly G1000s.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.489
So I fly both, because I
have friends that fly both.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:22.620
And we want to make sure
that we can fly together

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.383
on these fly-outs.

00:34:23.383 --> 00:34:25.800
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, so
despite the fact that I usually

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.310
fly glass cockpit aircraft, I
do fly instrument approaches

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:34.219
in R44 helicopter
instrument trainers.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:38.159
And those are more challenging,
because there's no autopilot.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.429
And the machine is
inherently much less stable

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:43.110
than the airplane.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.159
So that's steam gauges.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.560
So I wouldn't say
there's a big difference.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.080
Really, the world of
instrument flying--

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.540
if you transfer your skills
from the visual flying

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.677
world to the instrument world--
and they do transfer very well.

00:34:54.677 --> 00:34:56.969
When you're flying visually,
you're spending about 80%,

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:00.690
90% of your time looking out the
window at the natural horizon.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.610
When you transfer
that to instrument,

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.440
you're spending 80%
or 90% of your time

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.190
looking at the artificial
horizon, or attitude indicator.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.283
And if you hold a
constant attitude,

00:35:10.283 --> 00:35:12.450
the rest of the instruments
take care of themselves.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.070
The experienced
instrument instructors

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.650
will often cover up all five
of the other instruments, which

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.160
gets a little harder
from the glass cockpit--

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.320
a lot of Post-Its.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:29.070
And have the IFR student try
to hold the constant attitude

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.810
as best they can.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:35.220
And then remove the Post-Its
after, say, two minutes.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.310
And you'll find that you've only
gained a couple hundred feet

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:42.270
and you've only lost maybe
10 degrees of heading.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.130
The FAA has terrible
advice about how

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:45.540
to be an instrument pilot.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.110
They say scan the six-pack.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.260
So spend, essentially,
one sixth of the time.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.100
You used to spend 90% of your
time looking at the attitude

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:53.760
indicator?

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.550
Now, let's spend
1/6 of your time.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.050
Or spend half of your time--
look at the attitude indicator,

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.290
look at these other things.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:03.030
But if you actually study
high-time instrument pilots

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.550
or jet pilots, you'll
find that they're really

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.840
focusing on the attitude
indicator 80%, 90% of the time,

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.070
like I said.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.930
And if they don't do that--

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.460
I actually once flew with a guy.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.920
He was an MIT grad--

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.290
he was an MIT PhD.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:22.770
The FAA told him to scan
like this, so he does.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.900
And that airplane
was all over the sky,

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.970
but he was constantly
recorrecting it.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.880
And he was right within
the ACS standards

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.702
of about plus or
minus 100 feet and--

00:36:31.702 --> 00:36:33.660
I don't know, maybe it's
10 degrees of heading.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.100
But we were in actual
conditions a Piper Arrow

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.670
with pretty limited
backup facilities.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:43.170
So that was truly terrifying,
because he's somebody actually

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:47.250
doing what the FAA says to do.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.750
The other thing
about glass cockpits

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.560
that I do like is
it's great for night

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.370
flying, because the
illumination is very uniform.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:59.940
So one problem with steam
gauges is that, at night,

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.910
some of the instruments
can be dimmer or brighter

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:03.810
than the others.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.520
I actually had a
Diamond Star, a DA40--

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.533
and the attitude indicator--

00:37:08.533 --> 00:37:10.450
which is the thing that
you want to be using--

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.730
was the dimmest
instrument in the panel.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:13.990
And that was very annoying.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.012
They were back-lit--
the instruments

00:37:16.012 --> 00:37:17.470
themselves had the
lights in there.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.918
So there was really
no way to adjust it.

00:37:19.918 --> 00:37:22.210
I think you're going to find
that glass panel is what's

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.750
in almost every aircraft
within five or 10 years,

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.410
because it's just getting
too expensive to maintain

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.490
these mechanical gyros.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.920
If you send out a mechanical
attitude indicator

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.410
to be overhauled, that's $2,000.

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.170
And the glass
cockpit replacement

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.983
might only be $3,000 or $4,000.

00:37:39.983 --> 00:37:41.650
And you'll never have
to touch it again.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.670
TINA SRISVASTAVA:
When we polled earlier

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.930
in terms of people who've
gone flying before--

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.600
so I'm going to
ask three things.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.730
Did you fly in a
steam gauge airplane?

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.160
Did you find in a
G1000, or glass cockpit?

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.930
Or have you flown in both?

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:03.020
So, steam gauge.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.220
About half of you.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.210
And then G1000,
or glass cockpit.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:11.090
Oh, only two or three.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.680
And then if you've done both.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.580
Only a handful.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.220
So actually, it looks like the--

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.330
well, and of course,
there are a bunch of you

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.413
that haven't flown at all.

00:38:21.413 --> 00:38:23.510
But the ones that have,
it looks like primarily

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.622
in the steam gauges.

00:38:24.622 --> 00:38:25.580
So that's good to know.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.470
AUDIENCE: 30 years ago,
they hadn't been invented.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.887
TINA SRISVASTAVA: 30 years
ago, they hadn't been invented.

00:38:29.887 --> 00:38:31.190
All right, that's true.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.317
Well, this was great.

00:38:32.317 --> 00:38:34.400
And Philip talked a little
bit about night flying.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.233
We're going to have a
whole section on night

00:38:36.233 --> 00:38:37.307
flying tomorrow.

00:38:37.307 --> 00:38:39.140
But now we're going to
do a break for lunch.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.410
We'll give you about
45 minutes to get food.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.290
Please come back a little
bit before the hour and we'll

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.790
get started right at 1 o'clock.

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.340
Thanks.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.510
MICHAEL SHORT: So since
I know series decay is

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.050
a difficult topic to jump into,
I wanted to quickly re-go over

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.900
the derivation today and
then specifically go over

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.110
the case of nuclear activation
analysis, which reminds me,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.680
did you guys bring in your
skin flakes and food pieces?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.222
We have time.

00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:40.555
So if you didn't remember,
start thinking about what you

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:41.933
want to bring in, what you got.

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:42.760
AUDIENCE: Aluminum foil.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.890
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so
you've got aluminum foil.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.410
You want to see what in it
is not aluminum-- excellent.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.102
Well, what else
did folks bring in?

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:49.102
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:50.560
MICHAEL SHORT: OK,
rubber stopper--

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.140
sound perfect.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.040
Anyone else bring something in?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.970
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so tell you
what, when you bring stuff in,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.742
bring it in a little
plastic baggie.

00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:03.450
I can supply those if
you don't have them

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.580
with your name on them just so
we know whose samples are what

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.290
because that's going to be
the basis for another one

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.530
of your homeworks
where are you going

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.350
to use the stuff that
we're learning today

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.870
to determine which impurities
and how much are in whatever

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.290
thing that you looked at.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.180
And, of course, you're not
going to get all the impurities

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.555
because in order
to do that, we'd

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.170
have to do a long nuclear
activation analysis,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.873
irradiate for days, and
count for a longer time.

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:26.790
So you'll just be
responsible for the isotopes

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.390
on the shortlist, which we've
posted on the learning module

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.410
site.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.840
So again, bring
in your whatever,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.480
as long as it's not hair
because, apparently, that's

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.350
a pain to deal with or salty
because the sodium activates

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.800
like crazy or fissionable, which
you shouldn't have, anyway.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.890
I hope none of you have
fissionable material at home.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.230
So let's get back
into series decay.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.430
We very quickly went over
the definition of activity

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.460
which is just the decay constant
times the amount of stuff

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.200
that there is, the
decay constants,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.160
and units of 1 over second.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.600
The amount of
stuff-- let's call it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.780
a number density-- could be like
an atoms per centimeter cubed,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.970
for example.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.670
So the activity would
give you the amount of,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.845
let's say decays, per
centimeter cubed per second.

00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:25.470
If you wanted to do this for an
absolute amount of a substance,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.020
like you knew how much of
the substance there was,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.180
you just ditched the volume.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.360
And you end up with the
activity in decays per second.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.260
That unit is better known
as becquerels or BQ,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.180
named after Henri
Becquerel, though I don't

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.080
know if I'm saying that right.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.700
But my wife's
probably going to yell

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.860
at me when she sees this video.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.090
But so becquerel is simple.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.550
It's simply 1 decay
per second, and there's

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.180
another unit called the curie,
which is just a whole lot more

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.080
decays per second.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.690
It's a more manageable
unit of the case

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.630
because becquerel-- the activity
of many things in becquerels

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.540
tends to be in the millions
or billions or trillions

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.290
or much, much more for something
that's really radioactive.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.040
And it gets annoying
writing all the zeros

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.130
or all the scientific notation.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.470
And so last time we looked
at a simple situation--

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.800
let's say you have
some isotope N1 which

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.620
decays with the k
constant lambda 1

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.970
to isotope N2, which decays with
the k constant lambda 2 and N3.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.130
And we decided to
set up our equations

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.040
in the form of change.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.220
Everyone is just a change
equals a production

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.130
minus a destruction
for all cases.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.240
So let's forget the
activation part.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.240
For now, we're just going
to assume that we have

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.060
some amount of isotope, N1.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.790
We'll say we have
N1 0 at t equals 0.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.910
And it decays to
N2 and decays N3.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.830
So what are the
differential equations

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.520
describing the rate of change
of each of these isotopes?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.825
So how about N1?

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:12.200
Is there any method
of production

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.220
of isotope N1 in this scenario?

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.860
No, we just started
off with some N1,

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.048
but we do have destruction
of N1 via radioactive decay.

00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:23.590
And so the amount
of changes is going

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.230
to be equal to
negative the activity.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.800
So for every decay of
N1, we lose an N1 atom.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.850
So we just put
minus lambda 1 N1.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.810
For every N1 atom that
decays, it produces an N2.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.020
So N2 has an equal but
different sign production term

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.030
and has a similar
looking destruction term.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.000
Meanwhile, since
N2 becomes N3, then

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.103
we just have this
simple term right there,

00:04:57.103 --> 00:04:58.770
and these are the
differential equations

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.390
which we want to solve.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.750
We knew from last time that
the solution to this equation

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.665
is pretty simple.

00:05:07.665 --> 00:05:09.540
I'm not going to re-go
through the derivation

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.290
there since I think that's
kind of an easy one.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.355
And N3, we know
is pretty simple.

00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:17.730
We used the
conservation equation

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.660
to say that the total amount
of all atoms in the system

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.830
has to be equal to N10 or N10.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.170
So we know we have N10
equals and N1 plus N2

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.930
plus N3 for all time.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.170
So we don't really have to
solve for N3 because we can just

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.020
deal with it later.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.610
The last thing that
we need to derive

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.960
is what is the solution to N2.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.570
And I want to correct
a mistake that I

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.360
made because I'm going to
chalk that up to exhaustion

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.310
assuming that integrating
factor was zero.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.240
It's not zero, so I want to
show you why it's not now.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.220
So how do we go
about solving this?

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.270
What method did we use?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.130
We chose the integration
factor method

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.080
because it's a nice clean one.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.500
So we rewrite this equation
in terms of let's just

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.550
say N2 prime--

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.570
I'm sorry-- plus lambda
2 N2 minus lambda 1 N1.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.080
And we don't necessarily
want to have an N1 in there

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.330
because we want to
have one variable only.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.080
So instead of N1, we can
substitute this whole thing

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.830
in there.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.250
So N10 e to the minus
lambda 1t equals zero.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.670
And let's just draw a
little thing around here

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.710
to help visually separate.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.460
We know how to solve this
type of differential equation

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.340
because we can define
some integrating factor mu

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.690
equals e to the minus whatever
is in front of the N2.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.460
That's not too hard.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.100
I'm sorry, just e
to the integral, not

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.870
minus, of lambda 2 dt.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.610
We're just equal to
just e lambda 2t.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.290
And we multiply every
term in this equation

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.760
by mu because we're going to
make sure that the stuff here--

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.840
after we multiply
by mu and mu and nu

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.900
and mu for completeness--

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.060
that stuff in here should
be something that looks

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.470
like the end of a product rule.

00:07:27.273 --> 00:07:28.690
So if we multiply
that through, we

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:35.350
get N2 prime e to
the lambda 2t plus,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.670
let's see, mu times
lambda 2 e to the lambda

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:49.360
2t times n2 minus e to
the lambda 2t lambda 1 n10

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.640
e to the minus lambda
1t equals zero.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.670
And indeed, we've
got right here what

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.430
looks like the end result
of the product rule

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.610
where we have something,
let's say, one function times

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.130
the derivative of another
plus the derivative

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.310
of that function times the
original other function.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:17.720
So to compact that up, we
can call that, let's say, N2

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.780
e to the lambda t--

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.980
sorry, lambda 2t prime minus--

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.920
and I'm going to combine these
two exponents right here.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:39.950
So we'll have minus
lambda 1 and 10e to the--

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:49.400
let's see, is it lambda 2
minus lambda 1t equals zero.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.920
Just going to take this
term to the other side

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.625
of the equals sign, so I'll just
do that, integrate both sides.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:09.550
And we get N2 e to
the lambda 2t equals--

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:17.920
let's see, that'll be lambda 1
N10 over lambda 2 minus lambda

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.375
1 times all that stuff.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.010
I'm going to divide each
side of the equation by--

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.740
I'll use a different color
for that intermediate step--

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.850
e to the lambda 2t.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.510
And that cancels these out.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.570
That cancels these out.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.520
And I forgot that integrating
factor again, didn't I?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.700
Yeah, so there's going to
be a plus C somewhere here.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.360
And we're just going to
absorb this e to the lambda 2t

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.840
into this integrating
constant because it's

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840
an integrating constant.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.280
We haven't defined it yet.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.380
Did someone have a
question I thought I saw?

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.650
OK, and so now this is
where I went wrong last time

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.410
because I think I was exhausted
and commuted in from Columbus.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.630
I just assumed right
away that C equals zero,

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.190
but it's not the case.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:27.010
So if we plug-in the
condition at t equals 0--

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.723
and two should equal 0--

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:30.640
let's see what we get.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.400
That would become a zero.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.270
That t would be a zero,
which means that we just

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:48.570
end up with the
equation lambda 1 N10

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:53.790
over lambda 2 minus
lambda 1 plus c equals

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.430
zero so obviously the
integration constant

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.050
is not like we thought it was.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:14.590
So then C equals
negative that stuff.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.980
That make more sense.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.490
So you guys see why the
integrating constants not zero.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.348
So in the end--

00:11:24.348 --> 00:11:26.640
I'm going t5o skip ahead a
little of the math because I

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.560
want to get into nuclear
activation analysis--

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.360
we end up with N2
should equal, let's see,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.760
lambda 1 N10 over lambda
1 minus lambda 1 times--

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.450
did I write that twice?

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.180
I think I did--

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.410
times e to the--

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.860
let's see, e to the
minus lambda 1t minus e

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.780
to the minus lambda 2t.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.910
And so since we know
N1, we've found N10.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.640
We know N3 from this
conservation equation.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.260
We've now fully
determined what is

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.780
the concentration
of every isotope

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.000
in this system for all time.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.150
And because the solution to
this is not that intuitive--

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.900
like I can't picture what the
function looks like in my head.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.440
I don't know about you guys.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.700
Anyone?

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.200
No?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.770
OK, I can't either.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.340
I coded them up in this handy
graphing calculator where

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.420
you can play around with the eye
of the concentration N10, which

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.610
is just a multiplier
for everything,

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:39.083
and the relative half lives
lambda 1 and lambda 2.

00:12:39.083 --> 00:12:40.500
And I'll share
this with you guys,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.810
so you can actually see
generally how this works.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.580
So let's start looking
at a couple of cases--

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.560
move this a little over
so we can see the axes.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.100
Let's say don't worry about
anything before T equals zero.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.360
That's kind of an invalid
part of the solution.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.320
So I'll just shrink
us over there.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.530
And so I've coded up all
three of these equations.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.410
There is the solution to
N1 highlighted right there.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.420
That's as you'd expect
simple exponential decay.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.660
All N1 knows is
that it's decaying

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.890
according to its own half life
or exponential decay equation.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:18.970
And two, here in the blue,
which expands, of course,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.370
looks a little more complicated.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:26.280
So what we notice here is
that N2 is tied directly

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.090
to the slope of N1.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.130
That should follow
pretty intuitively

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.650
from the differential
equations because if you

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.520
look at the slope of N2,
well, it depends directly

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.410
on the value of N1.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.380
For very, very
short times, this is

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.110
the sort of limiting behavior in
the and the graphical guidance.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.943
I want to give you two
solve questions like,

00:13:47.943 --> 00:13:51.690
what's on the exam or how to do
a nuclear activation analysis.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.570
Is everyone comfortable with me
hiding this board right here?

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.070
OK.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:03.180
So let's say at time
is approximately zero,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:09.570
we know that there's going to be
N1 is going to equal about N10.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.580
What's the value of N2
going to be very, very

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.574
close to 2 equals 0?

00:14:13.574 --> 00:14:14.460
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.780
MICHAEL SHORT: Zero.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.800
So N2 is going to equal 0.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.080
But what's the slope
of N2 going to be?

00:14:28.387 --> 00:14:29.970
This is how we can
get started solving

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.920
these graphically
without even knowing

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.930
what the real forms are.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.810
So we've already said
that at a very short time,

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.640
N2 is approximately 0.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.670
So if that's zero,
then that whole term

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.520
is zero, which means
that the slope of N2

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.970
is approximately lambda 1
N1, just the activity of N1.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.137
And hopefully, that
follows intuitively

00:14:55.137 --> 00:14:56.720
because it says for
really short times

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:04.820
before you get any
buildup, the slope of N1

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.520
determines the value of N2.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.460
So if we were to
start graphing these--

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.490
let's just start looking at some
limiting behavior-- that's t,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.575
and we're going to need
some colors for this.

00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:19.200
Let's stick with the
ones on the board.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.720
Oh, hey, awesome.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:30.180
Make N1 red, N2
blue, and N3 green.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.240
So let's start drawing
some limiting behavior.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.430
So we know that N1
starts here at N10.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.280
And we know it's going to
start decaying exponentially.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.200
So the slope here
is just going to be

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.740
minus lambda 1 and N1,
which is going to be

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.840
the negative slope of N2--

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.840
looks pretty
similar, doesn't it?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.930
So we know N2 for
very short times

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.720
is going to start growing at the
same rate that N1 is shrinking.

00:16:14.442 --> 00:16:16.150
So we already know
what sort of direction

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.428
these curves are
starting to go in.

00:16:18.428 --> 00:16:18.970
How about N3?

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.215
What's the value of N3
for very short times?

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.240
Anyone call it out.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.820
Well, we've got kind of
a solution right here.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.150
If we know that N2 is about
zero for very short times,

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.020
what would the value
of n' three have to be?

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.510
Also zero.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.220
And what about the slope of N3?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.300
Also, about zero.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.510
If there's no N2 built up, then
there's nothing to create N3.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.310
So we know that our
end three curve is

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.910
going to start out pretty flat.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.490
Now how do we find some
other limiting behavior?

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.270
Let's now take the case--

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.665
let's see, I want to rewrite
that a little closer here,

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:21.540
so we have some room.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.110
So that's at t
equals about zero.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:37.340
And at t equals infinity,
what sort of limiting behavior

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.190
do you think we'll have?

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.880
What's the value of N1 going
to be at infinite time?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.350
Zero-- it will have
all decayed away,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.840
will equal zero at
t equals infinity.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.050
How about N2?

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:52.910
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.920
MICHAEL SHORT: Zero.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.205
How about N3?

00:17:56.205 --> 00:17:57.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.230
MICHAEL SHORT: N10-- correct.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.000
Because of that conservation
equation right here.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.450
So we know for limiting cases,
N1 one is going to be 0.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.180
N2 is going to be 0.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.900
And N3, it's going to be N0.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.900
So we've now filled in all
the four corners of the graph

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.025
just intuitively without solving
the differential equations.

00:18:22.025 --> 00:18:23.900
Now let's start to fill
in some middle parts.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.860
What other sorts
of things can we

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.780
determine, like, for example,
where H2 has a maximum?

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.720
That shouldn't be too hard.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.300
So let's make another
separation here.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:48.687
So what if we want to find out
when does the N2 dt equal 0?

00:18:48.687 --> 00:18:49.520
What do we do there?

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.430
Anyone have an idea?

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.820
Using the equations
we have up here.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.497
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:06.497 --> 00:19:08.080
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
well, we can just

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.370
take this equation right here.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.680
We can figure that
out in terms of N1.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.200
So if D and 2D
equals zero, then we

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.560
know that lambda 1 N1 is
going to equal lambda 2 N2.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.470
What this says intuitively is
that the rate of production

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:28.510
of N2 by decaying on 1 equals
the rate of destruction of N2

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.190
by its own decay.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:37.650
So at some point, the N2 is
going to have to level off.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.920
When that point is depends
on the relative differences

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.960
between those half lives.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.290
So we already know if we were
to just kind of fill in smoothly

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.750
what's going to
happen, N2 is probably

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:53.910
going to follow something
roughly looking like this.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.620
We already know
the solution to N1.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.050
I think we can figure
that out graphically.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.535
It's simply exponential decay.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.100
The only trick now is
how does N3 shape up?

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.320
What do you guys think?

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.590
How would we go
about graphically

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.730
plotting these solutions
without solving them?

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.820
I don't think yet I've
given you the full form.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.190
It's kind of ugly, and I
doubt that if you looked at it

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.880
you'd be able to tell me
exactly what it would do.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.220
So this is just the
mathematical expression

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.590
of N10 minus N1 minus N2.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.790
So how do we figure out
all the stuff about N3?

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:45.150
Yeah.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.340
AUDIENCE: You could
just draw a curve

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.760
so that you get all
three curves and always

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.017
add it to the same number.

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:52.850
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:54.797
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:54.797 --> 00:20:56.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Absolutely,
that's totally correct.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.630
Yeah, if you just take
N10 minus N1 and N2,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.520
that gives you the value of N3.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.160
That's completely correct.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.410
So you could do that sort
of one point at a time

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:11.028
and say, well, maybe around
there, maybe around there.

00:21:11.028 --> 00:21:12.570
It might take a
little while, though.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.570
So I want to think what's
another intuitive way?

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.070
What would the value or
the slope of N3 track--

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.700
what other variable
in the system?

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.995
Or in other words, how
are they directly related?

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:27.998
Yeah.

00:21:27.998 --> 00:21:31.407
AUDIENCE: The slope
of n2 are they equal?

00:21:31.407 --> 00:21:32.240
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.970
The slope of n3 depends
directly on the value

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.040
of n2 and nothing else.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:43.640
So initially, you can see
the value of n2 is almost 0,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.790
so the slope of n3 is almost 0.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:52.610
As the value of n2 picks up,
so should the slope of n3

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.510
until we reach here.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.112
What happens at that point?

00:21:57.112 --> 00:21:59.633
AUDIENCE: N2 decreases.

00:21:59.633 --> 00:22:00.425
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:22:00.425 --> 00:22:03.740
The rate of production of n2
decreases because the val--

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.410
I'm sorry-- yeah, the
rate of production of n3

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.200
decreases because the
rate of production of n3

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.650
is just dependent directly
on the value of n2.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.895
So the maximum slope
of n3 has to be

00:22:15.895 --> 00:22:17.270
right there at
which point it has

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:23.850
to start leveling off and
eventually reaching 0.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.670
You're going to see this kind
of problem on the homework.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.580
You're going to see this
kind of problem on the exam.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.860
I guarantee you.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.990
But it's not going to
have this exact form.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.650
But what I'll want
you to be able to do

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.810
is follow this example.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.140
Let's say I pose you a small
set of these first order

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:41.760
differential equations.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.120
Can you use any method that you
want-- intuitive, graphical,

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.260
mathematical--

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.250
to predict what the values
and slopes of these isotopes

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.410
are going to be as
a function of time?

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.600
So in order to get nuclear
activation analysis right

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.580
you need to be able to do this.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:02.730
In nuclear activation
analysis it's just one twist.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.605
I'm going to move this
over to add the twist.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:13.390
You're also producing isotope
n1 with a reaction rate.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.120
By some either isotope and not
what you put in the reactor.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.630
So if you want to know what
your impurities and naught were

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.900
to undergo what's called
nuclear activation analysis,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.360
then you can figure out,
depending on which one you

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.700
count, what they could be.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.740
So this right here.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.823
Let's look at the units of
this versus the units of this.

00:23:39.823 --> 00:23:41.240
First of all, if
we're adding them

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.220
together they'd better be
in the same units, right?

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.060
So we already talked about the
units of this decay equation.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.113
It's like number of
decays per second.

00:23:51.113 --> 00:23:52.530
So this reaction
right here better

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.770
give us a number of atoms
produced per second,

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.380
or we're kind of
messed up in the units.

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.740
So anyone remember
what is the units of--

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.680
I'll make a little
extra piece right here--

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.640
what's the units of microscopic
cross sections or barns?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.190
What is that in some
sort of SI unit?

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.190
AUDIENCE: Centimeter squared.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.070
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.870
It's like a centimeter squared.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.030
And what about flux?

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.940
This one you may not
know, but it definitely

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.470
depends on the
number of neutrons

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.022
or the number of
particles that are there.

00:24:30.022 --> 00:24:32.943
AUDIENCE: Is it
barns [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:32.943 --> 00:24:33.860
MICHAEL SHORT: Almost.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.930
So the flux describes
how many particles

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.940
pass through a surface
in a given time.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.180
So we have how many
particles per unit

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.010
surface, per unit time.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.070
Ends up being neutrons per
centimeter squared per second.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.770
Just like the flux of
photons through a space

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.950
or the flux of any
particle through anywhere,

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.000
it describes how
many particles go

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.400
through a space
in a certain time.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.400
And then there's the number
of particles that are there.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.740
If we're going with
atoms, it's just atoms.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.660
These are all
multiplied together.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.270
The centimeter squared cancel.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:19.360
And we end up with some sort
of a atoms per second produced.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.930
We can put in a little hidden
unit in the cross section.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:27.180
If there is a reaction going
on where in goes a neutron

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.610
and out goes an
atom or something,

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.680
that should cancel
all things out.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.340
Let's not get into that now.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.340
The whole point is we
have the same sort of unit

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.190
going on here, which is some
number of atoms produced

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.610
per second.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.553
Same thing as number of
atoms decayed per second.

00:25:45.553 --> 00:25:46.970
So it's the
production-destruction

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.180
equivalent of each other.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.400
So, in that way, we can have a
reaction rate that we impose,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.020
something artificial,
by sticking

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.320
something in the reactor and
controlling its power level.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.630
And then follow
the decay process

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.920
which is a natural
radioactivity event.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.890
And this is one of
the simplest governing

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.740
equations for nuclear
activation analysis.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.290
Now, one, I might give
this to you on an exam

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.870
and say OK now draw the
curves for nuclear activation

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.030
analysis.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.530
And maybe calculate what's the
impurity level if you measure

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.110
this many counts of something.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.350
Then you just work
backward through the math.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.350
But I want to get you
guys thinking conceptually

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.880
right now.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.300
What are the real equations for
nuclear activation analysis?

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.600
Let's just do these in
terms of n1, n2, n3.

00:26:45.586 --> 00:26:48.490
That's dt, d, and 3dt.

00:26:51.525 --> 00:26:52.900
We'll start with
the stuff that's

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.140
up there minus lambda 1 n1.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.740
Plus some cross section times
the flux times some other atom

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.240
n0.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.410
What other things
are we missing?

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.110
Are there any other methods
of production or destruction

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.270
of isotope n1 that
we need to consider?

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.300
Well, we've got isotope
n1 in a reactor.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:25.430
It can decay, or it can absorb
one of the neutrons nearby.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.830
So how do we write that
term-- that destruction term?

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:32.450
Yep.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:37.116
AUDIENCE: Flux times the
absorption cross section

00:27:37.116 --> 00:27:38.847
times n0.

00:27:38.847 --> 00:27:39.680
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.440
So let's say that's the
absorption of atom 1 times

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.722
n what did you say?

00:27:43.722 --> 00:27:44.430
AUDIENCE: Naught.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.200
MICHAEL SHORT: And would
it be n0 or would it be n1?

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.508
If you want to know how
quick is n1 being destroyed--

00:27:50.508 --> 00:27:51.050
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.280
MICHAEL SHORT: --By
absorbing neutrons.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.630
So then let's call
this absorption of n0.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.830
And is it a plus or a minus?

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.205
If it's a destruction rate.

00:28:01.205 --> 00:28:02.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.247
MICHAEL SHORT: It's a minus.

00:28:03.247 --> 00:28:03.870
Yep.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.270
So what's really
going on here is

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.430
you've got some precursor
isotope, whatever

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:12.810
impurity you want to
measure n0, producing n1.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.560
And you're looking at n1's decay
signature, like its activity,

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.910
to determine how much was there.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.340
But you also have to
account for the fact

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.550
that isotope n1 can be
burned in the reactor.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.020
So this is like producing.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.850
This is decaying.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.630
And this is we'll
call it being burned.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.510
This isn't burned in the
sense of creating of fuel--

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.660
creating energy
by burning fuel--

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.310
but we will refer
to this sort of in--

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.710
colloquially too burning--
because we're then

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.610
absorbing neutrons by
n1 and removing that

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.250
from the available
decay signature.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.030
How about n2?

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.640
How do we modify our
equation to account correctly

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.610
for the production
and destruction of n2?

00:29:01.555 --> 00:29:03.180
And by the way this
is not in the book,

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.434
so I don't expect you to know
it off the top of your head.

00:29:06.434 --> 00:29:08.588
AUDIENCE: It's the same
type of thing, flux.

00:29:08.588 --> 00:29:10.630
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep So
let's first take every term

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.190
that we have up there.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:17.630
We have lambda 1 n1
minus lambda 2 n2.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.370
And what else do we
have to account for?

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.340
Yep.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.780
AUDIENCE: N2 also being burnt.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.290
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.940
So n2 is also being
burned so we'll

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:35.500
have a minus, a flux times the
absorption cross section for n2

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.760
times the amount of n2.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.380
How about n3?

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.880
We'll start with
what we had there.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.760
Lambda 2 n2.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.100
And, just like before,
we've got to account

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.810
for the burning of n3.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.810
So then we'll have minus
flux times the absorption

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.530
cross section of 3 times n3.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.830
And these equations hold
true only for the time

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.030
that your material
is in the reactor.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.228
What happens when you take the
material out of the reactor?

00:30:10.228 --> 00:30:12.180
AUDIENCE: You go right
back to zero readings.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.630
MICHAEL SHORT: You do.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.130
Yep.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:19.075
When you come out of the reactor
all of the fluxes go to zero.

00:30:19.075 --> 00:30:20.200
And that's the end of that.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.405
Yeah.

00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:26.030
AUDIENCE: Why don't you account
for the production of n2 and n3

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:30.330
in the burn rate?

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.037
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah, so did
I necessarily specify--

00:30:33.037 --> 00:30:35.370
the question was why don't
we account for the production

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.590
of n2 and n3 by the burning.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.835
Right?

00:30:38.835 --> 00:30:39.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.610
MICHAEL SHORT: Did we specify
that absorbing a neutron

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.498
is the way to make n2?

00:30:44.498 --> 00:30:45.040
AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.930
MICHAEL SHORT:
Oftentimes it's not.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:51.730
So if you burn n1 by
absorbing a neutron,

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.780
then you will make
another isotope

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.890
that has the same proton
number and one more neutron.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.680
And it may decay by some other
crazy way, or it may be stable.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.790
Who knows.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:07.090
But by decay-- this could
be by beta, positron, alpha,

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.362
spontaneous fission--

00:31:08.362 --> 00:31:09.820
not gamma because
then you wouldn't

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.170
have a different isotope.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.970
But oftentimes you won't have--

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.180
the burning process won't
produce the same isotopes

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.650
as the decay.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.320
So the situation we looked at
on Friday when we said let's

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.590
escalate things.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.410
That was a purely
hypothetical situation

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.220
where isotope n2 could
be burned to make n0.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.470
I'm not saying it can't
happen, but it's not likely.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:31.850
But still we can model it.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.595
We can model anything.

00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:35.220
That just wasn't a
realistic situation.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.540
This is.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.790
This is what you guys are
going to have to look at

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.470
to understand how
much impurities there

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.180
are in each of your materials.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.630
So this I would say is
the complete description

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.535
of nuclear activation
analysis in the reactor.

00:31:53.535 --> 00:31:55.160
At which point you
then have to account

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.510
for what happens when
you turn the reactor off.

00:32:01.882 --> 00:32:02.590
So what actually?

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.840
What physically happens when
you turn the reactor off?

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.520
Yep.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.093
Oh Yeah.

00:32:11.093 --> 00:32:12.010
You've answered a lot.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:12.840
So Chris, yeah.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.946
CHRIS: Well, you try to--
you put your control rods all

00:32:15.946 --> 00:32:17.810
the way in and try to
stop as many neutrons

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.300
as you can to stop
the chain reaction.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.460
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.120
So normally to shut
down the reactor

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.690
you'd put the control rods
in and shut down the reactor.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.163
Or the easier thing is
just pull the rabbit out.

00:32:28.163 --> 00:32:29.830
Remember those little
polyethylene tubes

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.000
I showed you?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.120
This way we can keep the reactor
on and remove your samples

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.240
without changing anything.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.630
So it makes the reactor folks--

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.520
angry would be an
understatement--

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.660
to constantly change the
power level of the reactor.

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.120
Reactors, especially power
reactors and research reactors,

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.270
they're kind of
like Mack trucks.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.598
If they're moving they
want to stay moving,

00:32:51.598 --> 00:32:53.890
and if they're not moving
they don't want to be moving.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.040
And it takes an awful lot
of effort to change that.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.710
It also happens to
screw up experiments.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.550
If you are irradiating something
like I was a couple months ago

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.340
for 30 days, you want
to have a constant flux

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.020
so that your
calculations are easy.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.810
You don't want 15 students
to come in and turn the knobs

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.250
all up and down,
and then you have

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:14.920
to account for
that in your data.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.090
Which has happened.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.640
So you guys are going to
be manipulating the reactor

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.060
power when the experiments are
out, and it's at low power.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.700
So you're won't be infuriating
anyone else on campus

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.790
like we did last year.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.290
So if you didn't account for
that, but they still let us in.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.190
So they're bad.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.870
Whatever.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:31.570
[LAUGHING]

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:32.350
Yeah.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:35.050
So after you either
shut down the reactor

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.750
or pull the rabbit out
of the reactor then

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.390
the production and destruction
by neutrons is over

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.460
but the decay keeps going.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.890
Which means if you wait
too long, like for some

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:48.170
of those short isotopes, if
you wait more than a day or so,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.080
you'll have so
little activity left

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.160
that you won't be
able to measure it.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.880
So what we're going to be
doing is sticking your samples

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.730
into the reactor for
maybe an hour or so,

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.920
pulling them out, and
immediately running them over

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.498
to the detector, so that we get
the most signal per unit time.

00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:06.040
Because the things are going to
be the hottest when they come

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.219
right out of the reactor,
and every second you lose

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:11.020
from there you lose signal.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.090
Which means you have
to account for longer

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.980
to get the same
amount of information

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.397
with the same certainty.

00:34:16.397 --> 00:34:17.980
This is a nice segue
way to what we'll

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.130
be talking about Thursday
which is statistics, certainty,

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:22.270
and precision.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.639
How long do you have
to count something

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:27.760
to be confident
within some interval

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.000
that you've got the
correct activity?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.730
For background counts-- who here
is made a NSC Geiger counter?

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.080
Hopefully almost all of you.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.580
Maybe you guys
remember how long you

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.980
had to count to be 95% sure
that your background rate was

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.870
accurate.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.510
It ends up being about 67
minutes or over an hour,

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.040
and the reason is because
the count rate is very low.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.460
So I'll do a little
flash forward to Thursday

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.380
since we're talking about it.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.080
When you count something
with a very low count rate,

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.750
you have to account for
longer to be as confident

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.470
that your number is correct.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.460
So let's say you want
to be 95% confident

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.120
or within plus or minus 2
standard deviations or 2 sigma.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.340
You have to count for
longer and longer.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.990
For something that's
really radioactive

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:14.590
you can be sure, or 95%
sure, that the count

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.010
rate you measured is accurate
for a shorter counting time.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.480
So everything in this class
seems to come up in trade-offs.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:20.980
Right?

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.530
You trade off stability
for a half-life.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.200
You trade off decay
constant for half-life.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.220
You trade off binding
energy for excess mass.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.880
You trade off counting
time and precision.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.830
You trade off exposure
and dose. which

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.550
you're going to get into later.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.710
We'll see if anyone
wants to use a cell phone

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.690
or eat irradiated
food afterwards.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.470
And I do all the time, so that
should tell you the answer.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.172
So in the last
seven minutes or so,

00:35:47.172 --> 00:35:48.880
I want to walk you
through playing around

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.670
with what happens when you
change the values of lambda

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.710
1 and lambda 2?

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.010
So what do they look like
when the half-lives are

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:01.160
roughly equal and when one is
much larger than the other one?

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.010
So let's set them
to be about equal.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.270
These are just unitless.

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.670
So let's set them equal to one.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:10.750
I think the system explodes
when we set them exactly equal

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:14.700
because that term right there.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.250
So let's say that's 1.001.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.500
It's about as close
as we can get,

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.610
and let's confirm that we get
the same sort of behavior.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:26.910
So isotope n1 just
follows exponential decay.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.890
There's nothing
that changes that.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:34.710
Isotope 2, its slope tracks
the value of isotope 1

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.920
for a little while until
you build up enough n2

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.690
that it starts to decay.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:42.270
You can find when
that point is when

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:46.470
lambda 1 n1 equals lambda 2 n2.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.930
There's one little step that
we didn't fill in if you

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.148
want to find the value of n2.

00:36:51.148 --> 00:36:53.190
So then you can just
rearrange this a little bit,

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.100
and you'll say n2 would
have to equal lambda

00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.940
1 over lambda 2 times n1.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:06.960
Which is n1 0 e to
the minus lambda 1 t.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.400
So if you want to find that
point right there in time,

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.730
you can solve this.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.130
Then let's look at n3.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:22.440
So n3 when n2 is almost
0, n3 slope is almost 0.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.555
It's a little hard
to see because--

00:37:24.555 --> 00:37:27.180
I'll tell you what-- let's make
all the half lives longer which

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.640
kind of expands the graph.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.390
Wrong way.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:35.492
Let's make it--

00:37:35.492 --> 00:37:42.650
Ah, we'll just move
that decimal point 0.1.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.357
There we go.

00:37:43.357 --> 00:37:44.690
That's like expanding the graph.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:45.190
Right?

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:50.120
So when n2 is almost 0, the
slope of n3 is almost 0.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:55.100
And when n2 reaches a maximum,
so does the slope of n3.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:02.090
Just like we predicted using
our graphical method right here.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.440
And then over longer times--

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.870
let's put the half lives
back to the way they were.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:13.778
Over long times
n3 trends to n1 0.

00:38:13.778 --> 00:38:15.320
Don't let that little
piece fool you.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.120
Again t equals less than 0
is not a valid time for this,

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.780
so we're not
accounting for that.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.790
And n3 tracks right to
here to the value of n1 0,

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.250
and n2 and n3 turn to 0.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.700
So for this case where you
have the half-lives roughly

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.770
equal to each other, you can
expect a pretty big bump in n2.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:40.750
What's going to happen when
lambda 1 is extraordinarily

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.026
big meaning the half-life of
n1 is extraordinarily short.

00:38:45.026 --> 00:38:46.484
What do you guys
think will happen?

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.350
Not mathematically
but physically.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:59.624
If n1 just kind of goes ba-boom
and instantly decays away.

00:38:59.624 --> 00:39:02.155
AUDIENCE: There would
be a lot of n2--

00:39:02.155 --> 00:39:02.655
right then.

00:39:02.655 --> 00:39:03.447
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:39:03.447 --> 00:39:04.322
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:04.322 --> 00:39:05.822
MICHAEL SHORT: Your
n1 is just going

00:39:05.822 --> 00:39:07.560
to turn into n2
right away, and n2

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.800
is going to take its
sweet time decaying to n3.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.140
So let's see what
that looks like.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:20.190
If lambda 2 is much
bigger than lambda 1,

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:23.860
let's make the maxima
a little different.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.580
Change our slider value a bit.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:34.430
So if l2 is big and
l1 is small, well,

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.980
let me change the
actual axes to make

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.630
this a little easier to see.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.780
There we go.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.020
You can see that much,
much more quickly

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.470
than we have it in this graph
right here l1 just decays away

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:49.670
right away.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.640
L-- I'm sorry-- n1
decays right away.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.640
n2 builds up to a much
higher relative value

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.940
because it's produced
faster than it's destroyed

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.620
for short amounts of time.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.710
So you can end up with
a great spike in n2

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:08.500
which slowly decays away to n3.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.180
How about the opposite effect?

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:14.410
What if l1 lambda 1 is
really, really small

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.080
indicating a very
long half-life,

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.450
and lambda 2 is
really, really large

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:22.260
indicating a small half-life.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:22.760
Yeah.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.180
AUDIENCE: It would
basically go from n1 to n3.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.833
As soon as it goes to n2,
it's going to decay to n3.

00:40:27.833 --> 00:40:29.000
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.010
In this case you've
got n2 as soon

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.493
as its created self-destructs.

00:40:33.493 --> 00:40:34.910
So let's see what
that looks like.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:41.010
So we can just slide l2 to
be big, slide l1 to be small,

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:46.270
and you can actually
graphically see n2 just shrink

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.030
towards the x-axis.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.980
And it's almost like you
only have two equations.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.720
It's like you just
have n1 and n3

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.150
and n2 basically doesn't exist.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.850
Where the slope of--

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.990
where the slope of n3, except
at extremely short times,

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.598
just tracks the value of n1.

00:41:04.598 --> 00:41:06.140
And I know in the
book they're called

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.120
secular or transient equilbria.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.045
I'm not going to require that
you memorize those terms.

00:41:11.045 --> 00:41:12.920
It's more important to
me that I can give you

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.600
a real physical situation.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.470
Say here's these three
isotopes, for four isotopes,

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:20.690
or six doesn't matter because we
can solve these pretty quickly.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.190
Tell me what's going
to happen based

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.070
on the relative
half-lives as long as they

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.960
decay in a nice linear chain.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.850
I'm not going to give
you something where

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:31.760
n1 can beget n1 or n4 or n6.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.360
Because at that point you
can construct the equations,

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.450
but I don't expect you to be
able to graphically solve them.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:42.450
And I may also
throw you curveballs

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:44.910
like nuclear activation
analysis to see well

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:48.640
what happens when you turn
on or turn off a reactor.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.300
I've got an example of that too.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.680
We're right at this point
here, I guess, t equals 50.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.190
Yeah.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.340
I've set it up such that
you turn off the reactor

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.120
and n3 is stable right
there, but n1 and n2

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.020
continue to decay.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.920
So it's not hard to cad these--

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.582
to code these
sorts of things up.

00:42:12.582 --> 00:42:14.290
I'll share the links
with these equations

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.570
so you guys can play
with them yourselves.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.960
Add to them yourselves, and try
just getting an intuitive feel

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.052
for how series
radioactive decay happens.

00:42:23.052 --> 00:42:25.510
So I want to know now that we
spent a couple of days on it,

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.420
would you guys be
comfortable setting up

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.310
sets of differential
equations like this?

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.090
Say yes, no, maybe?

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.970
I see a lot of up and
down shaking heads.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.813
That's a promising sign.

00:42:36.813 --> 00:42:38.980
If not I'm willing to spend
a little more time on it

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.980
on Thursday if folks would
like a bit of review.

00:42:42.918 --> 00:42:44.460
And if you're afraid
to tell me, just

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.110
send me an email
anonymous or not.

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:46.373
Yeah?

00:42:46.373 --> 00:42:48.040
AUDIENCE: Do you think
maybe Thursday we

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.820
could do a like a real example?

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.720
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.697
AUDIENCE: Of a like a series.

00:42:53.697 --> 00:42:54.780
MICHAEL SHORT: I think so.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.035
Yeah, with real example
with numbers and everything.

00:42:57.035 --> 00:42:57.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.493
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:42:58.493 --> 00:42:59.640
OK.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.250
Well, we can make one of
those up for Thursday.

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.930
Cool.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.060
And what about the
graphical solution

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:10.740
method since I don't know
whether they teach that

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.230
in the GIRs, but what I
do want to be able to do

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.670
is look at the limiting cases.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.430
In other words, fill in the
four corners of the graph.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:20.790
At t equals 0, what are
things actually doing?

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.440
n1 is just decaying
at its half-life.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.270
There is no n2 yet.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.440
So these slopes are
equal and opposite.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.260
And there's no n3 yet, so
that there is no slope of n3.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.158
So I would like you guys
to try reproducing this.

00:43:35.158 --> 00:43:37.700
And I will-- again I'll provide
pictures of these blackboards

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.120
so you guys can
see, but it would

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.850
be very helpful for you guys to
try to reproduce these graphs

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.200
as we saw them.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.160
Then you can check them here
on the graphical calculator,

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.250
and then play around with
the amount of n0, or--

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.820
I think I just broke it.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.930
Let's just call that one.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.250
There we go.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:59.830
And play around with sliders
or values of n1, n2, or n3.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.530
That's an interesting solution.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.440
So since it's about
four or five of,

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.310
I want to open it up to any
questions you guys may have.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:07.826
Yeah.

00:44:07.826 --> 00:44:10.350
AUDIENCE: I have a question
from the [INAUDIBLE] First

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:11.015
time do this.

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:14.360
Did you have-- do you know
what integrated video because

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.620
like there are endless
possibilities if you

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.840
just [INAUDIBLE] add up
to the right mass number?

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.443
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh yeah.

00:44:20.443 --> 00:44:22.110
The questions for a
spontaneous fission.

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:24.700
What fission products
do you choose?

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.790
I'll say they're all good.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:31.270
As long as you pick something
with roughly equalish masses,

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.900
so you don't pick like it fizzes
into hydrogen and something

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.790
quite smaller, which
should be better known

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:37.350
as just proton emission.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:40.090
You're going to get
roughly the same answer.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:40.810
Yep.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.500
AUDIENCE: Would that be
something we just like set up.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.950
Like the top number is 80.

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:50.750
We just look at whatever 40,
42, 38 arms pick a number.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.340
MICHAEL SHORT: Roll a D 80.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.920
You'll get basically the same
result. Roll an 80 sided dice.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.540
Hopefully at MIT you could
find one, or write a program

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.220
to make random number between
about 10 and 80 or 10 and 70.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.930
Let's go to the actual problem
set to see what you guys mean.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:13.570
I want to make sure I'm
answering the correct question.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:17.541
Problem statement Yep.

00:45:17.541 --> 00:45:19.896
Yep.

00:45:19.896 --> 00:45:21.900
So allowable this
is for this one

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.280
allowable nuclear reactions.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.030
Yep.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.370
So for a spontaneous
fission just pick one

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.470
you think would be likely.

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.450
You can also look up
what sort of isotopes

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:32.393
are created when elements fizz.

00:45:32.393 --> 00:45:33.810
It's not straight
down the middle,

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:36.300
so like uranium won't
often split into two

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.340
equally sized fission products.

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.410
They'll have roughly
different masses,

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:42.143
but which ones you pick?

00:45:42.143 --> 00:45:44.310
You're still going to get
the same general solution.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.310
Yep.

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.390
AUDIENCE: I'm so confused
on how to find one.

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:50.954
Like a situation where it is
unlikely possible because is

00:45:50.954 --> 00:45:55.360
it spontaneous fission or is it
generally possible for heavier

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.798
elements like
transuranic elements?

00:45:57.798 --> 00:46:00.340
MICHAEL SHORT: So the question
is when is spontaneous fission

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:00.860
possible?

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.280
Is it only for heavy elements?

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.380
There is a difference
between energetically

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.500
possible and observed.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.140
That's part of the
trick to this problem.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.350
If you do out the Q equation
to find out for add fission

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:20.593
products that you picked, you
may be surprised at the result.

00:46:20.593 --> 00:46:21.510
However, you're right.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.390
You don't tend to see
spontaneous fission happen

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.670
until you get to really
heavy things like uranium.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:31.050
So there's more to will
something spontaneously fizz

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:35.450
than does the Q value
allow it to happen.

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:36.950
So I don't want to
give away anymore

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:40.140
but I will say if you're
surprised at your result,

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.710
you might be right.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:43.430
Yep.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:47.210
AUDIENCE: On this question
for electron capture.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:48.710
In the equation
you gave us, you're

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.670
calculating Q in an
electronic capture.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:56.210
Its the massive parents
minus the dollars minus the I

00:46:56.210 --> 00:47:00.056
think binding energy of the
electrons is what you wanted.

00:47:00.056 --> 00:47:02.960
When I try find out what the
binding energy of an electron

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.005
is, it says it depends
on the shell that its in.

00:47:05.005 --> 00:47:06.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.970
AUDIENCE: So how
do we know which

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.285
electron the nucleus is after?

00:47:11.285 --> 00:47:14.400
Do we assume its from
the innermost shell?

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.350
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.900
So the question was if you're
doing electron capture where

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.090
you have some parent
nucleus and you've

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:23.990
got a lot of electron shells.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.450
The binding energy of every
electron is different.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:28.440
Which one goes in?

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.960
One, you find the data
on the nest tables.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.980
Two, chances are it
will be the closest one.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.650
So a roughly 80% of
the time these things

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:41.310
happen from the K shell with
very decreasing probabilities

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:42.390
from the outer shells.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:46.010
So you can pick either
the k or the L shell,

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.030
like both things may happen.

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:51.030
But I would say for simplicity's
sake assume it's an inner most

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.255
shell electron.

00:47:52.255 --> 00:47:54.630
And you can look up the binding
energy on the NIST tables

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:55.797
on the learning module site.

00:47:58.890 --> 00:47:59.920
So any other questions?

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.120
Yeah, Luke.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.840
LUKE: On graphing the
spectrum, the satellite

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:10.000
intensity vs. the
energy for 4 2.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.890
MICHAEL SHORT: For 4 2.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:12.520
Ah yes.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.530
So graphing the--
this would be like

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.360
if you had an electron detector.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.290
Is that what I asked for?

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.420
4 2, write the full
nuclear reactions

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.660
and draw the energy spectrum you
expect from each released form

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.140
of radiation including
secondary ejections of particles

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:28.410
or photons.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:33.522
So by a spectrum, I mean,
yep, energy versus intensity.

00:48:33.522 --> 00:48:34.490
LUKE: OK.

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:35.948
MICHAEL SHORT: So
there you'll have

00:48:35.948 --> 00:48:38.660
to account for the spectrum
like the various range

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.490
of the betas that
can be released,

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:45.560
any ejected electrons, any
Auger electrons, any photons

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.380
from X-ray emission from
electrons falling down

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.130
and energy levels.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:50.422
Yeah, Alex, you had a question?

00:48:50.422 --> 00:48:51.080
ALEX: Yeah.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.083
What are the Auger electrons?

00:48:53.083 --> 00:48:54.500
MICHAEL SHORT: The
Auger electrons

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.680
is that funny case where
in our mental model

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.020
a gamma ray hits an
inner shell electron,

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:05.120
and it's usually an inner shell
electron, shooting it out.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.780
Then another electron
will fall down

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.660
to fill that hole
emitting an X-ray.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.370
And the Auger process
can be thought

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:18.060
of that second X-ray hits
an electron on the way out

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.340
and fires out the electron.

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.610
So this here would be
the Auger electron.

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:26.370
They tend to be
particularly low energy.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.285
Yeah, Luke.

00:49:27.285 --> 00:49:31.602
LUKE: If you have that cascade
of electrons during an electron

00:49:31.602 --> 00:49:35.450
capture, are they still
Auger [INAUDIBLE] radiation?

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:36.510
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:41.070
As long as you have a higher
level shell coming down

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.230
to a lower shell and the
ejection of an outer shell

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.730
electron.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.440
That's than Auger
electron emission process.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.690
Regardless of whether
it started with gamma

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.154
or started with
electron capture.

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:51.654
Yep.

00:49:51.654 --> 00:49:53.490
AUDIENCE: How do we
know if that happens?

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.530
MICHAEL SHORT: You can
actually sense or detect

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:57.180
the energy of those
Auger electrons

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:01.100
with a very sensitive
Auger electron detector.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.020
These are in the sort
of hundreds or thousands

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.855
of EV range.

00:50:04.855 --> 00:50:07.022
AUDIENCE: But for like the
context of this question,

00:50:07.022 --> 00:50:09.380
how do we know--

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:10.984
where would we go to find them?

00:50:10.984 --> 00:50:13.067
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, to get
the Auger electron data?

00:50:13.067 --> 00:50:13.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.477
MICHAEL SHORT: For
that you can actually

00:50:15.477 --> 00:50:19.990
look up the binding energies
of an outer shell electron,

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:21.880
and you can do
that energy balance

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:25.000
where it would be E2 minus E1.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.890
Whatever the energy
of that X-ray

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:34.060
is minus the binding energy
of the emitted electron.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.860
And because there's
infinite possibilities.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.280
I mean you could eject any
electron, just pick one.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.500
And say here's an
Auger electron,

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.540
or draw a couple
of lines in places.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.935
I don't have I don't want
you to get every single line.

00:50:45.935 --> 00:50:47.560
If we asked you to
do this for uranium,

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.613
there's like you
know 92 electrons

00:50:50.613 --> 00:50:52.030
and a lot of
different transitions

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:53.810
that's not what we're going for.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.518
I want to make sure
you know the physics.

00:50:55.518 --> 00:50:57.340
Not that you can draw
92 lines accurately

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.622
with a fine-toothed pencil.

00:50:59.622 --> 00:51:01.240
Do you need a question two?

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:01.865
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:01.865 --> 00:51:04.600
So for 2 1 if we write two
possible nuclear reactions

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.830
for 239 on [INAUDIBLE]
the right was only

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:09.580
off the case of any
decision and that it's

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:12.390
a state which decay processes
and repeating processes may

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:15.490
be possible for each
general type of reaction.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:16.620
What exactly does that--

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.350
I find the answer for
number two is alpha.

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:22.284
MICHAEL SHORT: Maybe
that's the answer.

00:51:22.284 --> 00:51:24.500
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:28.590
MICHAEL SHORT: And does anything
compete with alpha decay?

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:32.082
Does anything compete
with spontaneous fission?

00:51:32.082 --> 00:51:33.880
OK.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.656
Cool.

00:51:34.656 --> 00:51:36.024
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:36.024 --> 00:51:38.310
AUDIENCE: Is that an
indication of [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:39.393
MICHAEL SHORT: Beta decay.

00:51:39.393 --> 00:51:40.985
Well, is there--
well, for that you

00:51:40.985 --> 00:51:42.360
can look up the
table of nuclides

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.680
which I've got up here.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.720
So let's take a look
at plutonium 239,

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.560
and it precedes by alpha
or spontaneous fission.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.510
So every year I
switch up the isotope

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:59.220
and make sure that there's at
least a couple of decay modes,

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.220
and therefore the answers are
going to change every year.

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.355
But the general
question doesn't,

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.480
So this year I happened to
pick an interesting one.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:10.180
Yeah, it's kind of
a mind game, right?

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.290
What are you missing?

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.040
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.140
MICHAEL SHORT: Nothing.

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:13.786
Yeah.

00:52:13.786 --> 00:52:14.950
[LAUGHING]

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.620
Yeah, go with your
physical intuition.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:21.416
Any other questions, and
maybe time for one more.

00:52:21.416 --> 00:52:31.370
AUDIENCE: For 3 2, I could
only find one nuclear reaction.

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:35.831
The action played after
the nuclear reaction.

00:52:35.831 --> 00:52:37.020
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah Yeah,

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.020
AUDIENCE: That's very
curious you're really

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.237
[INAUDIBLE] decay.

00:52:40.237 --> 00:52:41.070
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.890
AUDIENCE: And, so I
was wondering where

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.170
the molybdenum [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:47.670
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
so the question

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:51.720
is I specifically wrote
which nuclear reactions could

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.790
make 99 molybdenum,
despite there

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:56.740
being only one natural one.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:00.320
So what could you
induce artificially?

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.330
And if you can do that
profitably, I'll guarantee you

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.130
there's a startup in it for you.

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:06.870
So what are all the
different particles

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:10.260
that something could absorb
to create molybdenum 99,

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.530
and which of those are
allowable nuclear reactions?

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:15.750
And if they're not
allowable, how much energy

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.510
do you have to put
in an accelerator

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:20.550
to make that reaction happen?

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:23.370
And is the price of
electricity in the accelerator

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.540
worth the Molly 99
that you create?

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.410
There are actually
quite a few startups

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:29.827
working on this
problem right now.

00:53:29.827 --> 00:53:33.173
So the answer to this
question is be creative.

00:53:33.173 --> 00:53:35.340
Think about all the different
particles you know of,

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.010
and how they could
create Molly 99.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.270
And figure out are any of
those processes allowed,

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.430
and if they're not
allowed, how energetic

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:45.805
do you have to make the incoming
particles to allow them?

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:49.850
Ah, good question.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.370
There's some creativity
hiding in these problems.

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:53.360
So it's 10:02.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:56.090
I want to cut it off here,
and we'll start off Thursday

00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:01.550
with a numerical
example of this stuff.

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:04.240
Nuclear activation analysis.

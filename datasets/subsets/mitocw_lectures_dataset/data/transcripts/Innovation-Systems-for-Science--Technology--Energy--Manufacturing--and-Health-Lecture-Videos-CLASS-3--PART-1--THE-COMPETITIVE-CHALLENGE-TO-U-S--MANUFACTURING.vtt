WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So just as kind

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.600
of a synopsis of
some ideas that we're

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.990
going to get through, we're
looking at manufacturing, which

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.770
is a way to profit
from innovation,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.340
as a way to scale innovation.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.250
And we'll do something of an
historical review here today,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.390
so we'll look at the last big
competitiveness challenge.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.920
The US went through a challenge
from Germany and Japan.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.510
We'll take a particular look
at Japan's manufacturing

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.660
innovations in the '70s.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.350
We'll review a distributed
model of production

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.110
that the US came up with,
in some ways in response.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.340
We'll look at manufacturing
and innovation

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.230
organizational shifts
within both Korea and Japan,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.840
and then talk a bit about how
the nature of the competition

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.210
is changing as well.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.660
So that's kind of a
backdrop, and then next week

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.260
will be a more pointed focus.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.270
So the first piece we'll go
through, and I'll lay it out.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.770
And Chris, do you have--

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.080
RASHEED, you've got Hughes.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.663
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:01:25.663 --> 00:01:26.990
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right, OK.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.160
So this is Kent Hughes.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:38.870
Kent Huges led the joint
economic committee,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.550
staff director in the Congress.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.965
He was a senior official in
the Department of Commerce.

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:47.180
And he kind of wrote the
history of the competition

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.180
over production between US
and China, a period of time

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.960
when he was very deeply
engaged in policy making.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530
So let's get this
backdrop kind of down

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.000
because I think
it'll help us see

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.630
a lot about what the US is
going through now in terms

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.580
of manufacturing.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.530
So in the 1970s, the
US faced a mess--

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.860
intractable high inflation,
declining productivity growth,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.750
therefore a slow growth rate,
rising economic competition,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.710
rising national anger,
frustration with government.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.140
Sound familiar?

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.470
And the US model of kind of
pretty unfettered markets

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.500
of limited government
support for industry

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.690
was a very different
innovation model,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.300
innovation system than
what Japan and Germany were

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.640
pursuing.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.163
And that in turn led
to the beginnings

00:02:49.163 --> 00:02:51.455
of what could be called the
US National Competitiveness

00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:54.185
Strategy.

00:02:54.185 --> 00:03:00.250
So the essential
elements of that history

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.590
of the initial response to
Japan's development of quality

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.040
manufacturing, which we'll
get into in a minute,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.640
there were different
responses from each party.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.260
And these will be
familiar to you as well.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.260
So each party was organized--

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.970
remember when we discussed
classical economics, right?

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.840
And the key factors
in classical economics

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.380
were capital supply
and labor supply.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.310
Each of our parties is organized
around one of these, right?

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:36.070
So the capital supply response
came from the Republican side,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.572
and Congressman Jack Kemp
of Buffalo and Bill Roth,

00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:43.280
who was chairman of
the Finance Committee

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.420
and the Senate from
Delaware, their argument was,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.470
let's adjust marginal
tax rates that

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.050
will spur capital
availability and investment.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.620
And we'll recover.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.520
The Democrats will
organize around

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.650
their traditional
mantra of labor supply,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.830
broadly defined, right?

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.160
And they had moved
towards what was then

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.140
known as industrial
policy, still known

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.160
as industrial policy.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.329
So they were looking to
rescuing failing industries

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.870
and reorganizing
them for turnarounds.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.920
And at a later time, through
the Young Commission,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.120
another set of ideas begins to
enter the discussion around,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.300
quote, sunrise industries.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.840
The Young Commission tired to
cut between these two party

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.660
perspectives and develop
a different approach.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.980
So John Young was head
of Hewlett Packard,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.280
and President Reagan named him
the head of this commission.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.450
And their focus was on
national competitiveness.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.250
And they concurred that things
like fiscal and monetary policy

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.540
are important.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.890
But they were also interested
in what the innovation side

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.740
of the research side could do.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.860
So it was not simply
a governmental role

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.322
in basic research,
but basic technology.

00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:10.780
And they developed
a model that was

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.750
in this public private
partnership that

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.150
was industry led.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.240
And the term partnership
nation emerged

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.920
from some of their work.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.770
So this was, in effect, a
third way out of the box.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.670
The two parties had their
underlying theories.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.610
And Young walks in with a
different kind of approach.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.130
So he's out of the
Silicon Valley.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.920
He's used to working with DARPA
and the Defense Department,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.050
so he's not afraid of government
and its technology support

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.140
rule.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:47.590
And this whole effort
was called the New Growth

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.930
Compact, all right?

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.190
So it was an attempt to
cut between the parties

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.575
and develop a series of
new programmatic elements.

00:05:56.575 --> 00:05:58.990
So some of the things
that eventually emerged--

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.540
not specifically from the
recommendations necessarily,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.660
but emerged over time--

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.600
were created as
cooperative R&D agreements

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.340
with industry between
governmental laboratories

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.160
and industry.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.840
So in other words, we've got
these snappy governmental labs.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.410
Little emerges from them.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.560
Could we do
cooperative agreements

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.450
to get technologies
out of the labs

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.860
into the hands of industry?

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.440
It's a new tool.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.480
The Bayh-Dole Act comes out
of the same time period,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.000
which, prior to the Bayh-Dole
Act, the federal government

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.330
owned the fruits of
the research that it

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.520
supported at universities.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.770
Now the federal government
is not a commercial entity,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.800
so nothing happened to it.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.310
So it was moved
to shelves, right?

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.520
The IP was not really utilized.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.140
So Bayh and Dole came up
with the idea of giving

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.570
the universities that had
sponsored the research

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.850
activities-- supported the
research activities with

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.020
federal funds--

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.450
let's give them ownership.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.060
And they in turn typically
share it with their researchers

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.190
and give them a vested stake
in developing the technologies

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.170
that the research is leading to.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.790
So this plays a
really critical role

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.120
in starting to put universities
on the playing field

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.795
as innovation actors, right?

00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:24.510
It gives them a stake in the
outcomes of their research.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.325
The Advanced Technology Program
and the Manufacturing Extension

00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:29.700
Program come out of the Commerce
Department in an attempt

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:36.750
to introduce both new
technologies and an attempt

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.230
in the MEP program
to bring advances

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.020
Japan had been pushing
on quality production

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.090
into small US manufacturers.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.070
There were education proposals.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.843
That attitude was
essentially pro-trade.

00:07:52.843 --> 00:07:55.110
In other words, don't
ignore the world.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.370
Let's be successful at trade
and be innovative in trade.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.480
That attitude gets adopted
by the Clinton administration

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.200
and leads to things like
NAFTA and the China WTO.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.820
So that's kind of what is coming
out of the Young Commission

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.383
in terms of new ideas, but
let's go back to the challenge

00:08:14.383 --> 00:08:15.300
that they were facing.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.860
What was this?

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.110
What was this new
model around production

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.460
that Japan was launching?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.650
And I would argue that
was big enough so that it,

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.789
in fact, amounted to a
significant innovation wave.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:36.059
And it was the one
wave that the US

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:40.690
missed in the second
half of the 20th century.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:47.280
So Japan hit on innovating
and manufacturing

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.000
as a way towards its
own competitiveness

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.260
as a leading world
economic power.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.880
And before the 1970s,
the US had come up

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.690
with a way of dealing with
quality in what's called

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.980
a quality price tradeoff.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.180
So in our mass
production system--

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.630
and the US essentially
came up with most

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.400
of the elements
of mass production

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:20.150
starting around the 1840s
and moving for 100 years.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.070
The US had become
a dominant mass

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.490
produ-- we had really invented
mass production at huge scale.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.260
And we were selling
manufactured goods

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.150
into a continent sized economy.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.490
Of course, continent sized
economy that existed.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.910
And part of the
mass production idea

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.960
was never stop the
production line.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.100
Always keep it moving.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.500
Always keep producing.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.620
And how do you
deal with quality?

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.720
Well, you do
statistical analysis

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.330
of the products
you were producing.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.700
You would decide that some fixed
percentage were not meeting

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.710
those quality standards.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.760
And so at the end of the
system, after you would produce

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.120
the goods, you would have an
inspection group throw out

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.170
whatever it was--

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:14.020
1.8%, 2.4%, whatever the
statistical number told you--

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.220
after the production
system had been developed.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.290
Quality is really how
good is the product.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.580
Quality control is
what's the unit of--

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.450
are there units
of equal quality,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.600
right, across all
that you're producing?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.200
Japan came up with a
completely different system

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.930
and a much better system.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.770
And it was called
here the Toyota model.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.640
But it was based in
Japanese manufacturing.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.010
So the idea here was build
quality into each product,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.400
not at the end of the system,
throw a bunch of stuff away.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.450
Ensure that the entire system
is working to ensure quality.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.050
And anyone, any worker, can
stop the production line

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.850
if they see a quality problem.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.630
So catch it at the
beginning and build quality

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.130
into your entire
production process.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.040
The idea came actually from an
American named Edward Deming.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.770
And he was unable to persuade
US manufacturers to adopt

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.270
this model.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.390
So he takes it to Japan.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:21.190
And we sense
Japan's rich culture

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.010
here around
craftsmanship, right?

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.910
It fits wonderfully with it.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.210
All right, so this is--

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.860
Japanese samurai culture, of
course, respects the samurai,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.890
but accords almost
equivalent respect

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.900
to the sword maker, right, who
is almost equally as famous.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:47.360
So there's a huge focus on
high quality and craftsmanship

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.200
in Japanese culture.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.740
So what Deming is saying
fits with the kind

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.930
of culture of Japan.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.510
There are other pieces
that Japan comes up with--

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.940
just in time inventory.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:07.160
In other words, a major
burden that manufacturers face

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.070
is that they have to store
up a lot of inventory

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.440
to have enough goods
available for the marketplace.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.550
But when you hit an
economic downturn,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.860
then you're stuck with
this massive inventory

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.570
that you can't
get rid of, right?

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.870
And it becomes a huge cost
burden on your system.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.890
Japan's idea was produce for
what the market is actually

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.230
absorbing--

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.860
in other words, produce just
in time to get it to market.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.600
So that calls for
a whole new level

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.410
of efficiency and
communications really

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.555
IT embedded in
earlier kind of ways

00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:44.180
throughout the whole
production system.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.990
And it significantly
reduced the exposure

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.980
of significant manufacturers
to economic downturns.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:08.500
Japan integrated its dealers and
its suppliers into its system.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.840
So in the US,
major manufacturers

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.942
would keep their suppliers at
arm's length and have them bid.

00:13:13.942 --> 00:13:15.650
And there was no
particular relationship.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.273
They were just looking for
the lowest price, right?

00:13:18.273 --> 00:13:19.690
Japan, the suppliers
were actually

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.490
integrated into that system.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.870
And in turn, the dealers who
were just selling these goods

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.760
were also integrated in, so
that you had much closer touch

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.130
with what customers
actually needed and wanted,

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.590
as well as what the
quality of the suppliers,

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.640
what they were producing,
is going to be.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.360
Japan had a culture of
respecting the production

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.200
moment.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.330
So they would move
their engineers

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.980
onto the factory floor as
their first set of assignments.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.250
So if you look at, in contrast,
the US didn't do that.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:54.750
All right?

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.150
So the engineering
profession was

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.490
one in the 19th century
US that was trying

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:04.900
to take a hold with those
other established professions--

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.540
doctors, lawyers, ministers.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.570
So when you look at these
early photographs of MIT

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.225
and you look at
photographs of MIT

00:14:12.225 --> 00:14:16.510
labs, those wonderful
photographs of the steam lab,

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.356
you can't imagine coal
dust all over the place.

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:21.731
These characters
were all wearing

00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:26.212
these starched white shirts
with those fancy weird bow

00:14:26.212 --> 00:14:28.420
ties they wore at the end
of the 19th century, right?

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.160
They looked so prim and proper.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.090
They're trying to be like
ministers or doctors, right?

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.840
They're trying to
elevate their profession

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.560
and separate themselves in a
way from the work floor right?

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.280
So the engineers want to
be in a glassed up area up

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.170
above the factory
floor in the US, right?

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.780
They don't want
to be down with--

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.170
heaven forbid-- the workforce.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.540
So it's an attempt by
an engineering culture

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.780
to establish its identity.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.750
You can understand
why it happened.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.853
But Japan hit on a much
better plot, right?

00:14:58.853 --> 00:15:00.520
Integrate the engineers
in the workforce

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.020
and make them one, right?

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.460
Much better, right?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.800
So we have learned to get
our engineers into the mix

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.600
in the manufacturing sector.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.570
Japan came up with this
quality manufacturing model.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.870
Sometimes we call it here
a lean manufacturing.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.230
It led to an effort by
the US to simply copy

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.430
what Japan had come up with.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.220
We had to take apart
the Toyota model.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.430
A lot of that work is
being done at MIT, right?

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.790
So Dan Rus and
several others at MIT

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.617
are writing up the Toyota model.

00:15:35.617 --> 00:15:37.450
And explaining it to
the rest of the country

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.490
was a really important stage.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.810
Standard industry
approaches like Six Sigma

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.700
that came out of
GE have essentially

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.030
attempted to incorporate
Japan's quality ideas

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.800
and make them pervasive
in US production

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.810
for both major
manufacturers, OEM suppliers.

00:15:57.936 --> 00:16:01.760
A few other things, there's
something called the product

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.340
cycle.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.040
And time is a competitive
factor in this,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.602
so eliminating time
delays and then

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:12.560
something actually the
US really contributed to

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.398
was concurrent
engineering design.

00:16:15.398 --> 00:16:16.940
So you engineers in
the room I'm sure

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.107
know what I'm talking about.

00:16:18.107 --> 00:16:26.043
But in other words, if you and
I constituted Chrysler Motors,

00:16:26.043 --> 00:16:27.460
the way in which
we would organize

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.992
Chrysler Motors in
the old days was

00:16:29.992 --> 00:16:31.450
we would have a
bunch of engineers,

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.160
and they would do the design.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.110
And then they would
finish the design,

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.350
and then they would take it
to the production people.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.140
And the production
people would say, well,

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.390
that's all very well and
good, but we can't make that.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.730
So we do it, right?

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.020
And then it would be redone.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.240
And then they would take it
to the engineering people

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.590
again and then take it
to the marketing people.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.633
And the marketing
people would say, well,

00:16:54.633 --> 00:16:56.800
that's all very well and
good, what your engineering

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.520
people have done, what your
factory floor people have done,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.320
but we can't sell this thing.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.170
So completely redo it.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.849
In other words, it was a
stage by stage process,

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.060
with every stage having a veto.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.319
So the development
process for design

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:14.550
was painful, and lengthy,
and often adversarial.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.520
Concurrent design is to put
all those teams together

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.460
at the outset contributing
to the design--

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.030
dramatic time savings,
dramatic efficiency savings.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.920
So these are all
kinds of ideas that

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.360
came out of this time period.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.680
Another idea that Japan had--

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.260
and we weren't
organized this way--

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:43.130
Japan had a whole different
way of approaching what we

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.480
could call the labor trade-off.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.900
So Japan had a system of
essentially guaranteed

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.420
lifetime employment.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.800
So if you were a
worker in Japan,

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.100
you were pretty well
assured in this era.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.260
It's changed a bit now, in
this era of a lifetime job.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.160
And in return for that
assurance of a lifetime job,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:14.080
management would control the
work rules, or what's actually

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.650
happening on the factory floor,
right, now that we processed

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.720
where the rule systems is.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.740
That was the trade-off.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.680
The US had a complete
different trade-off.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.850
We treated labor not as a
fixed cost, like Japan did.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.120
We treated it as
a variable cost.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.760
And the trade the unions
insisted on-- this was an era

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.700
of pretty heavy unionization
of manufacturing in the US

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.500
at the time--

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.340
unions weren't
able to affect who

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.130
gets hired and fired
in the employment

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.390
side of the equation.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.690
But they would control
the workloads, right?

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.470
And they designed those to
be as protective as possible

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.850
as their workforces, right?

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.610
Not necessarily the
most efficient system.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.680
So Japan actually had a
better model here, right?

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.280
Now we continue to treat our
workforce as a variable cost,

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:12.780
right?

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.630
So whenever there's
an economic downturn,

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.670
US companies dump their
workforces as a quick response,

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:19.170
right?

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.838
That's fundamental
management theory in the US.

00:19:21.838 --> 00:19:23.880
Other countries don't
necessarily do it this way.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.220
Japan has had to get more
flexible in its model

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.460
as it's gone to more
global competition.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.810
But it had a completely
different way

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.570
of organizing its workforce.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.690
Labor became much more
collaborative, rather than

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:43.970
adversarial, and ready to
leap on new efficiencies

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.280
in the production
process, rather than fight

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.100
them every inch of the way.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.500
So again, this was a
contributing factor

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.940
to the kind of new model
that Japan was creating.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.790
There's another element
here of industrial policy.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.280
So Japan is recovering
from World War II.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.060
It develops an
innovation system that

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.670
is very focused on production.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.432
That's what it's got
to stand up against.

00:20:10.432 --> 00:20:12.390
And that's where this
quality model comes from,

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.210
and these other pieces.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.470
And Japan is very resource poor.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.830
So starting in the
1880s, Japan understood

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.440
that it had to have
an export orientation.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.930
It had to export
to live because it

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.580
had to get the resources in
order to produce them, right?

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.043
And buy those back, so it
needed an export surplus

00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:34.960
to be able to do that.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.840
One of its core institutions
was called MITI--

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.700
Ministry of International Trade
and Industry-- now called METI.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.410
And the nickname for
this was Japan Inc.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:55.550
But a very integrated system
of governmental leadership

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.960
tied to major industries.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.950
And the major industries
weren't organized

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.840
as they were in the US.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.360
We had anti-trust
laws in the US.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:10.100
We did not really impose
that in the post-war period

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:15.260
and allowed Japan to keep
its, quote, keiretsu system.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.360
So that's a system
of major firms

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.470
typically engaged in production
activities, financing,

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.350
global trading,
and then networks

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.340
of suppliers that
are tied to those.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.810
So these are groups
of related firms

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.800
that are all mutually owned and
tied to each other, all right?

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.780
They would violate US anti-trust
laws in all likelihood,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.830
but that's the way Japan
organized its core industries.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.370
Now, not all Japanese firms are
part of these keiretsu, right?

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.370
So a company like Sony
was actually outside

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.200
of this, right?

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.210
But most of its
industry was organized

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.710
in this very simple kind of way.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.270
And you can see
how their dealings

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.860
with a major
governmental entity,

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.890
like MITI, could be readily tied
to unify government decision

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.680
making and industry
decision making.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.840
So when the US was
competing against Japan

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.810
in this quite centralized,
quite efficient model,

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.040
US had a lot of trouble coping.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.960
And you've seen them--

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.430
when we talked
about Jorgenson, you

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:30.070
saw some of the
productivity and GDP curbs.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:37.270
So historic US
productivity rate generally

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.390
around 2%, and historic US GDP
growth is generally around 3%,

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.170
right?

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:49.540
Between '73 and
'91, those plummet,

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.260
so we fall to productivity
rates at around 1%

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.420
and GDP growth about 2%.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.810
It was a pretty grim time
in the United States.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.780
We were up against a powerful
industrial competitor,

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.910
and Japan was able to
take economic sectors

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.860
that the US thought
it would always have,

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.650
like consumer electronics,
like a large part of the auto

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:12.250
sector.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.050
Because it had a better
innovation model.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:25.460
So in a very brief
period of time,

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.310
that's kind of what
happened in the 70s and 80s.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.270
The US response, as
I suggested earlier,

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.590
was that we would attempt
to copy Japan on quality.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.540
And we call it
lean manufacturing,

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.740
but we would attempt to
replicate as much as we could

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.020
of that Toyota model.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:50.780
And by and large, our industries
have pretty well done that.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:56.570
But we also kept a focus on our
very strong innovation system.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:04.540
So we launched in the 1990s
the IT innovation wave,

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.700
which Japan misses, right?

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.910
And if you get your economy
to a leadership right

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.650
to the edge of the
technological frontier,

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.100
and you organize your economy
around leading innovation

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.260
ways with Japan and just
organize its economy

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.900
around doing, around a
new production system,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.080
and then you miss a wave,
it can be pretty unpleasant,

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.630
all right?

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.930
So it was unpleasant in the
US when we missed a wave

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.550
in the '70s and '80s.

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.282
But then things got
tough for Japan.

00:24:33.282 --> 00:24:35.240
Now that's not the only
factor that's going on.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.310
There's macroeconomic factors.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.910
There's demographic factors.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.410
There's a series of things that
are occurring simultaneously

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.035
in Japan.

00:24:43.035 --> 00:24:46.032
But one part of
the story is around

00:24:46.032 --> 00:24:47.240
missing this innovation wave.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.400
So that was the kind of response
that the US came up with.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.730
It used its innovation
system to develop effectively

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.370
radical innovations
in the IT space

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.720
and create whole new industries.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.830
So we pursue radical innovation.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.240
Not consciously--
but in a way, that

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.720
was effectively our response.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:20.900
Why don't we stop there
and go through the sheets

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.970
and discussion of Kent Hughes?

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:26.850
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.845
So Kent Hughes, I
think he really talks

00:25:29.845 --> 00:25:31.470
about sort of this
'80s period in Japan

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:35.070
and then really isolates
the sort of US response.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.690
So how is the US
going to respond

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:41.510
to kind of larger problems
with our manufacturing system

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.260
and really competing
on that global scale,

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.105
now that Japan has sort of
captured a lot of things going

00:25:46.105 --> 00:25:48.480
on with quality manufacturing
and that sort of innovation

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.030
wave?

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.510
I think one of the
really important things

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.270
that he talks about is sort
of this bureaucratic climate.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.390
So there's a lot going
on sort of trading

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.640
on the international scale,
but bringing it back home

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.930
to the US.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.600
You have to get a lot of
people onboard in order

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.870
for you to sort of move
forward in this cohesive way,

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.000
unless you're riding
an innovation wave.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.880
And so we're set up in a
radically different way

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.910
than Japan.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.880
And we have to kind of
figure out what to do.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.750
And so talking about
Ronald Reagan's response,

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:25.700
I think it was pretty cool and
important that Ronald Reagan

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.170
sort of exercises his
discretion with this commission

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.890
on industrial competitiveness
with John Young.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.640
So I was just wondering
if any of you guys

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.320
had any feelings on sort
of the presidential power

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.970
to not only kind of
highlight issues,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.130
but sort of take the
lead and take action,

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.041
separate from all the
bureaucratic dealings?

00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:53.470
Oh yeah, so Steph, I
saw you raise your hand.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.505
STUDENT 2: Oh, I wanted to
point attention to Matthew.

00:26:56.505 --> 00:26:58.630
STUDENT 3: I mean, I thought
when I was reading it,

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.766
that he was actually
quite slow to act on it,

00:27:00.766 --> 00:27:04.870
and it was really Congress that
kind of pushed the efforts.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.710
And later on, he
decided that this was

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.191
something that was important.

00:27:13.137 --> 00:27:16.580
Yeah, it seemed more of
like a political at first.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:22.170
STUDENT 4: Yeah,
or making motions

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.960
without actually
making actions, just

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:30.630
to sort of look like Reagan is
taking action on this thing.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.810
And yeah, I agree.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.620
I thought he ended
up dragging his feet,

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.500
and other people had to
sort of push for anything

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.183
to be enacted with
the Young Commission.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.290
RASHEED: So I think one of
the big pieces in this Young

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.930
Commission is how they
decide to choose members.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.690
And they pick kind of large
manufacturers of industry,

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.150
and they start with John Young.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.710
But I thought it
was interesting how

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.610
he didn't get to sort of hand
pick the members that he'd like

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.490
to be on his own commission.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.758
I thought that might be a
little bit short-sighted,

00:28:06.758 --> 00:28:09.300
considering he's going to have
to work with all these people.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.950
And it might be a way of
sort of to drag your feet.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.730
But I thought the
sort of what came out

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.790
of the commission, which is this
new report, which highlights

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:22.970
a lot of these sort of
transformative things, sort of

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.480
would've never happened
if he didn't sort of grab

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.520
from all these places in
industry and manufacturers.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.540
But is there any
sort of merit to sort

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.852
of bringing these
people in, having

00:28:34.852 --> 00:28:37.310
them work on this commission,
and then publish this report?

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.150
Even though we don't
sort of act on it,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.960
but you see all of these
things that he highlighted

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.320
in sort of New Growth Compact,
maybe 10 years down the line,

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.460
might really be important.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.740
And sort of, this
lays the groundwork

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.510
for five or 10 years
in the future when

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:52.343
you're ready to sort
of act on these things.

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:56.140
So I guess my goal would
be, is there a merit

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:02.260
to sort of even if it's kind of
haphazard attempt at addressing

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.870
the issues, is it a
still important metric,

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.443
maybe not now, but five
or 10 years down the line?

00:29:08.443 --> 00:29:09.610
STUDENT 4: Yeah, I think so.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.190
And with the Young
Commission, I think

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:17.260
that out of that commission,
Young decided to form--

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.150
what's the name?

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:22.120
I'm blanking on it, but
it still exists today.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:22.840
I looked it up.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: The
Council on Competitiveness.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.270
STUDENT 4: Yes, exactly.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:32.440
So yes, there are lasting
knowledge and wisdom

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.910
from a commission like this.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.097
So yeah, definitely,
it's better than nothing.

00:29:36.097 --> 00:29:38.180
It's better than sticking
your head in the ground.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.660
I think some of the
stuff they put forward

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.965
is definitely extremely useful.

00:29:43.965 --> 00:29:45.310
It's there.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.360
It's published.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.092
It's accessible.

00:29:49.092 --> 00:29:51.550
STUDENT 5: I think it's one of
those better late than never

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.690
things, right?

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.128
Because it only seems
to happen that--

00:29:55.128 --> 00:29:56.920
I don't know if this
is a trend with the US

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.420
or countries in
general, but it only

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.510
seems that they put in all this
effort for one specific issue

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.010
when something's
going wrong, right?

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:08.150
Why not prevent things from
going wrong in the first place?

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.490
And I don't know.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:15.310
The government seemed to be very
hesitant to change their ways

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.130
surrounding their views
on specific policies

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:18.930
around innovation.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.790
So like I said, better
late than never.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.770
But in my opinion, it'd
be better why didn't they

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:29.253
do this decades before?

00:30:29.253 --> 00:30:31.420
STUDENT 2: I think the
question I have with relation

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.280
to this reading is
that Hughes largely

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.660
characterizes domestic
policy making as reactionary.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.910
And I agree.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.970
What hope exists for utilizing,
A, the courts under the living

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.180
constitutionalist framework to
really address these questions

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.520
and, or meaningfully
integrating the kinds

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.100
of knowledge and
consensus that is

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.640
created in these commissions.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.330
And I don't know that
there is yet a model

00:30:55.330 --> 00:31:00.190
for effective consensus building
outside of these commissions

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.820
and translating that
to policy action

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.530
with collaboration in
the legislative branch

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:07.695
and the judicial branch.

00:31:07.695 --> 00:31:09.820
And that's, I think, where
your point sort of comes

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.300
into action, that
there is an opportunity

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.970
for proactive
policymaking, but it

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.290
has to be integrated
with discussions

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.500
around the branches.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.610
It can't just be
isolated in one branch

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.350
because then, as
Hughes pointed out,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.620
there's going to be competition
amongst them on what

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.662
the right thing is to do.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.090
RASHEED: Yeah, so that brings
maybe my follow-up question.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.480
You might be able
to help us out here.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.660
So I think the
president, in this way,

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.250
really was able to just kind
of use his power to set aside

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.250
and kind of call for the
study and commission.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.460
Is there a way for
sort of legislators

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.100
to kind of do the same thing?

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.940
Let's say I'm a
committee on energy.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:02.530
Can I call for a study or the
committee section of Congress

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:03.780
that deals with manufacturing?

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.395
Can they sort of call for
a study in the same way,

00:32:06.395 --> 00:32:08.270
and then maybe work with
the executive branch

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:09.478
to kind of do the same thing?

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.140
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I mean, just
a comment from my background

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.990
experience having worked in
the Senate for about 15 years--

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:23.400
yes, the committees
of Congress can

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.050
function on an ongoing
basis to try and identify,

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.290
Kevin, exactly the
problem you were raising,

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.088
which is be a
little foresighted.

00:32:31.088 --> 00:32:33.630
Some committees are obviously
much better at this than others

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.770
historically.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.620
But there's no guarantees.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.180
And frankly, government
tends to respond to crises.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.630
And if there's
not a crisis, it's

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.320
hard to get it
mobilized, organizing,

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.100
and moving to be foresighted.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.750
That's not necessarily
all bad, right?

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.670
There's advantages
of having limits

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:01.090
on governmental
intervention here.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.800
And if the system is
working fairly well,

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.600
you probably don't want
government intervention.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.100
It's only when you hit a
crisis moment that you really

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.890
want it to fall into place.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.042
I understand,
though, your points

00:33:14.042 --> 00:33:16.000
about wouldn't it be
better if we were watching

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.167
all this stuff all the time.

00:33:17.167 --> 00:33:18.940
So there is that reality.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.860
You've got to hope that somebody
somewhere in the society

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.840
is undertaking that review.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.268
But it's not something
government is terribly good at.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.550
And a typical response to a
crisis in a short term kind

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:35.160
of way.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.150
So we came up with these
various mechanisms,

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.780
none could really be called
a competitiveness strategy.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.430
We came up with a
bunch of pieces, right?

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.550
One piece that's not
on here was Symantec,

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:52.370
which is an attempt to
deal with Japan's effort

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.640
to really capture the
semiconductor sector, which,

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.890
again, produced very
high quality production

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:02.250
capabilities and in
semiconductor chips,

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.380
particularly DRAMs.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.940
And the US was producing
a lot of chips,

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.550
but they were not
as high quality.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:13.610
And the manufacturing
process was not as efficient

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.050
as Japan was.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:18.130
So Canon and Nikon
were opposed to be

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.110
able to capture a very
large part of that sector.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.090
The solution the
US came up with--

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.409
and again, this is DoD--

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.690
the Department of Defense--

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.210
which viewed semiconductors
as a pretty critical

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.587
national security technology.

00:34:31.587 --> 00:34:33.920
Because it was embedded in
all kinds of critical defense

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.100
technologies.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.219
DoD agreed to cost share
with the big industry

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:45.530
organization consisting of both
the semiconductor fabricators,

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.730
but also the supplier system,
the equipment and parts

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.949
suppliers system for
the semiconductor

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:53.830
in this community.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:56.350
That community came
together, eventually settled

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:59.230
on a series of steps
to build quality

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.870
into the US semiconductor
manufacturing process.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:09.083
Cost shared with DARPA, and it
really turned around a sector.

00:35:09.083 --> 00:35:11.250
Now there are other
developments going on here, too.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.180
The US taking leadership
of integrated circuits

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.660
and microprocessors, kind of
the next stage of technology,

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.450
so that certainly helped.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.640
But nonetheless, the
effort to drive quality

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.830
into semiconductor production
was a very concrete example

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:33.180
of an industry and
governmental collaboration

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.310
that actually worked.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.720
So these other pieces here
are a little more hands-off--

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.170
CRETA, Bayh-Dole Act, the
Advanced Technology Program,

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.170
but not as direct.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.055
Symantec was a
fairly direct effort

00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:46.430
in the particular
economic sector

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.120
with national security
ramifications to intervene.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.070
So in some ways, that's
the most seminal model that

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.020
came out of this time period.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.830
But again, the minute
that the IT revolution

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:03.810
starts to take off at the
beginning of the '90s, then

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.350
the US drops its concern
with manufacturing, right?

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:12.600
And we go on to having a great
time for a decade with the IT

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.540
revolution, which,
as we discussed,

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.698
is a remarkable period of growth
and of economic well-being

00:36:19.698 --> 00:36:20.198
in the US.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.310
How about another one, RASHEED?

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.190
RASHEED: For Hughes?

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:31.830
Yeah, I think we kind
of center our discussion

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.890
a little bit on the US response
to what's going on in Japan.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:38.460
But I thought it might be
interesting to at least touch

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:42.370
on how the different
paradigms-- and so

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.600
the US and Japanese culture.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:49.358
So in Japan, we've talked about
kind of like these workers

00:36:49.358 --> 00:36:50.650
treating labor as a big source.

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.950
And so you're sort
of employed for life.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.390
These paradigms
play out in Japan,

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.880
and they're just kind of
characteristics of the culture.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.487
But I think looking at
international trade,

00:37:00.487 --> 00:37:02.070
is this sort of the
first time that we

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.760
had to deal with a
difference in paradigm

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.113
affecting international
trade, and basically just

00:37:09.113 --> 00:37:10.530
the fundamentals
of the US economy

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.592
in a pretty large
and widespread way?

00:37:14.592 --> 00:37:16.050
Because I guess,
globalization will

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.248
bring new countries
and new actors

00:37:18.248 --> 00:37:19.290
acting in different ways.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.950
But there's sort
of no competition

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.880
until Japan sort of poses
this entirely different model

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.570
for how to do things.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:33.000
But I'd like to at least touch
on how does kind of setting up

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.160
your problem and your
paradigms in this way,

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.730
does that provide opportunity
for sort of new innovation

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:46.050
ways, in that if I set up
postwar Japan in a slightly

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.260
different way, do I get a
slightly different outcome?

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.550
STUDENT 4: I was wondering--

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.620
this might help answer that--

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.960
does Japan have the equivalent
of the US labor union?

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, the labor unions

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.610
are organized very
differently however--

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:06.740
far less adversarial.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.500
Again, if you have a lifetime
guarantee of work what's

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.950
there to fight about, right?

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:14.060
Why do you want to
have fights, right?

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.610
Instead, they're much more
collaborative institutions

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:21.170
that tend towards moving
towards great efficiency

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:26.030
to promote their
company's performance.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.665
There's much greater incentive
for collaboration in the system

00:38:30.665 --> 00:38:32.450
that they set up.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:37.400
Now again, some of
that is faded as Japan

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.930
has entered a much more
globalized competitive world

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:48.110
of competition than it faced
as its system was emerging.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:57.860
But the trade-off of getting
cooperation from labor

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:02.100
around work rules in return
for a lifetime employment

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:06.170
has tended to work
well for Japan.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.640
In fact, the US auto
industry was actually

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:17.410
moving in that direction for
a time period before, again,

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.320
high competition kind
of caught up with it.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.080
But it's just that labor
trade-off is just a completely

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.266
different arrangement.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:30.870
Look, I don't want to
underestimate these big macro

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.670
factors that are
playing here, right?

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:37.340
So at the end of the
World War II era, the US

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.245
and the developed world--

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.850
non-Communist
world-- essentially

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:51.150
came to a set of arrangements
around free trade concepts,

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:58.610
and open economies, and lowering
tariff and trade barriers

00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.180
and so forth.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.025
And that was the consensus
system of the time.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.220
When Japan organized its
economy and really began

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.330
to move on entry as a
global economic power,

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.510
it organized around a
different set of concepts.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.150
It was not organized around
a free trading system.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.210
It was organized around a
pretty mercantilist approach.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:25.300
Again, as part of
Japan's history,

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.240
it has to trade to survive.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.820
It has to export
to survive, right?

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:36.490
So they developed a very
focused export system.

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:42.710
They undervalue their currency
so that their manufacturers

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.020
would always have a
price advantage over US

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.460
manufacturers, right?

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.340
US put up with that
for essentially world

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.980
national security kind
of reasons with an ally.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.730
And we assumed we were
kings of manufacturing.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:59.120
Who could interfere with us?

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.610
Japan had a much more
interventionist attitude

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.650
by its government into
supporting particular

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.780
and assisting particular firms.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.650
That was not like the US system.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:12.710
It made it very
hard for imports,

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:15.110
particularly of
complex technologies,

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.020
to enter the Japanese markets.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.840
So it was playing by a different
set of more mercantilist

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.280
kinds of rules.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.620
And frankly, that
model became a model

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.130
for other Asian economies.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:30.800
So that was a model that worked
for Taiwan, and for Korea,

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.280
and now China.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.545
And it's not based on that open
trading regime consensus policy

00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:39.660
that the US tried to build
at the end of World War II.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.050
So we're up against different
economic models here.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.140
Part of the story is that
the US hasn't really figured

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.730
out what the right strategy is.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.920
But RASHEED, I think I
interrupted your ability

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.190
to get answers to your
question from the table.

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.053
RASHEED: A little bit.

00:41:59.053 --> 00:42:00.470
Yeah, so definitely
wanted to talk

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:04.550
about some of these
Japanese paradigms

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.580
kind of being a little bit
more pervasive in the way

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.630
that they set up,
just like in the way

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.620
they set up their whole
economic structure.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.410
And is there an opportunity
for different countries

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.060
to sort of adopt different
paradigms in this way?

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.740
STUDENT 3: To an extent.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.020
I think it almost goes
back to that discussion

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.770
we had about our innovation
systems that makes them

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:32.890
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.760
And I think while that
paradigm worked well

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.500
for Asian countries, I think
there would definitely be still

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.150
a lot of resistance in the
US if we tried to set up

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.530
an identical paradigm here.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.850
People have these strong
beliefs about free trade

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.530
and laissez-faire government.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.200
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Right, although those

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:57.420
are now right at the center of
a major political debate, really

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.570
for the first time since--

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.510
well, there was a debate over
these issues in the 1970s

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.360
and '80s, a big
debate as Japan came

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.770
to the forefront in two major
economic sectors in particular.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.600
And we're back to
that debate now.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.430
We're having it right now.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.310
And so all of this is actually
pretty interesting context

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:19.417
to be watching, I think.

00:43:23.138 --> 00:43:25.430
We'll have to see what the
new administration proposes,

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:29.480
but they appear to be moving in
much more of a neo mercantilist

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.190
kind of direction
than prior regimes.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.925
STUDENT 6: So in order to
figure out whether or not,

00:43:36.925 --> 00:43:40.210
not only if other
countries can try

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.020
to convert their
economies to this,

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.520
but rather, whether they
should, we have to figure out

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.990
what was the--

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:54.610
so one of the main blocks
between any economy and Japan's

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.360
economy is these kinds of--

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:03.610
what was the term you had for
those things like railroad

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:04.910
monopolies and oil monopolies?

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:05.410
Oh yeah--

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:06.670
STUDENT 3: Business sectors?

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.930
STUDENT 6: What?

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.097
STUDENT 4: Business sectors?

00:44:08.097 --> 00:44:09.960
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Industrial policy.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.620
STUDENT 6: It's the
regulations that keep it from--

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.550
STUDENT 5: Antitrust.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.425
STUDENT 6: Thank you.

00:44:13.425 --> 00:44:14.930
Sorry.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.180
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.097
STUDENT 6: Yeah, we're
on the same wavelength.

00:44:18.097 --> 00:44:20.710
OK, so those antitrust
laws, we have

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:26.890
to figure out what is it
specifically within Japan that

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.470
would conflict with those laws.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:34.120
And well, is it
really the best system

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.860
for the individual worker?

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.780
So from the impression
that I've gotten,

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.820
the government is
so closely linked

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.245
with the industrial sector.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.290
I feel like it would be an--

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:54.700
I'm not sure how that
transition could occur.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.970
It's kind of like because they
had come out from World War II,

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:01.100
they had the opportunity to
restructure from the ground up.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.010
So I'm not sure
if you could take

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:06.820
an economy that's already based,
even if it's a better system.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.680
And I'm not sure you
could just revamp it,

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.430
at least in any
reasonable amount of time.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.030
STUDENT 7: I do agree with
that in that there's also

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:20.060
historical and cultural
factors to consider, like a lot

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.030
about how America views itself
as you're pulling yourself

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:26.930
up by your bootstraps and
competitively getting ahead,

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:30.500
less so than this kind
of more collaborative,

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:36.050
industrial conglomerate that
is making sure everyone's OK.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:40.340
So I think it could
encounter resistance

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:45.238
in cultures like ours, where
that's not as respected.

00:45:45.238 --> 00:45:46.780
STUDENT 8: Yeah, I
think also there's

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.370
the issue of scalability.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:52.690
Because Japan is so much of a
smaller country than the US,

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.190
their structure
might not translate

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:56.770
well on a broader scale
to ours, especially

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:58.180
with the cultural difference.

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.150
Because I know
educationally, it's

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:02.980
very much pretty structured.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.610
If you do these things and
you go to these schools,

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:09.550
you tend to go
get slotted in, so

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:12.490
to speak, into certain
industries and certain roles.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:16.660
And that's kind of an
approach that we've

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:20.170
tried to avoid going
towards here in the US.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.900
We kind of promote, oh, you
can go into whatever field

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.440
you want.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.890
You don't necessarily have
to go on a certain path.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.680
So I think there's
definitely differences

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.690
fundamentally in
ideology that prevents

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:38.523
kind of the same model being
imposed upon both countries.

00:46:38.523 --> 00:46:40.690
STUDENT 6: Regarding at
least the scalability thing,

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.830
you could possibly counter
that by saying, well,

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.200
we have a lot of states.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.620
So you theoretically could
just have a couple of states

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.900
just try a similar system.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.120
It'd be easier to
revamp them because it's

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.600
a much smaller area.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:56.020
It's fewer people.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.380
So I mean, of course, there's
still plenty of reasons why you

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.970
can't or why you shouldn't.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:04.120
But it definitely would
make it a lot easier

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.950
to do, or at least look at.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.410
STUDENT 5: Yeah, I think
just to add on to that,

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:11.380
I think one of the writers
from the first class

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.640
actually has a whole--

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.848
he's written a lot about
these sanctuary cities.

00:47:14.848 --> 00:47:16.390
I think that's the
wrong term, but he

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:18.390
talks about cities where
they have special rules

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:19.660
for certain industries.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.160
And that's also
especially important

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.020
because especially
in the last election,

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.812
there's only certain
cities that are really

00:47:24.812 --> 00:47:28.819
doing well because of technology
since San Francisco, New York.

00:47:28.819 --> 00:47:30.236
I'm probably
forgetting a couple--

00:47:30.236 --> 00:47:32.440
a lot.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.870
But what he is really
pushing is like, OK, well,

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:37.100
we're going to get jobs
in this sector in Detroit,

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.475
and we're going to get jobs
in this sector in Houston

00:47:39.475 --> 00:47:40.902
and bring them back.

00:47:40.902 --> 00:47:42.610
And that was kind of
what he was arguing.

00:47:45.818 --> 00:47:47.860
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
I'm going to cut this off,

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.060
so we can make progress
with some of the readings.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.893
But I think this is a
good background for us

00:47:51.893 --> 00:47:53.237
to lead into--

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:55.570
I mean, you all raising these
cultural historical things

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.350
would be great background when
we hit our discussion of Korea

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:03.490
and also how Japan had to try
and reorganize its innovation

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:07.360
system as it got to the
frontier in Glen Fong's piece.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.920
So hang on to a
lot of these ideas.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.940
Let me jump to the
next reading here,

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.830
which I'm going to go
through just very briefly.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:18.290
We're now back.

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.410
It's post 1990s, right?

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:24.330
We're now back in our time
with that as a backdrop.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:30.060
I put this reading in here
by Barry Lynn and a book

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.100
that he wrote called
End of the Line.

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.600
It's not a book that I have
a lot of agreement with,

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:42.540
but there's an interesting
historical perspective here

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.392
that I especially want
you to get a handle on,

00:48:45.392 --> 00:48:47.100
particularly given
the conversation we've

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.040
had about industry and culture.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:55.110
So Barry Lynn argues
that there's essentially

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:59.968
three periods of
US manufacturing

00:48:59.968 --> 00:49:00.760
industrial history.

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:10.570
There is a period between
Alexander Hamilton.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:15.290
And we call it 1945, the
end of World War II, right?

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:20.120
And I mean, Hamilton is a
absolutely critical figure

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:28.700
in US economic history because
he had a remarkably big picture

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.790
of what the US
economy could become,

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:35.322
a bigger picture than
anybody of this time

00:49:35.322 --> 00:49:37.680
in the political system.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.980
So and his fundamental
understanding

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:49.330
was that in this era of
a small new power faced

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:54.190
with much larger contending
European nations,

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:58.570
that the only way that the
US keeps its independence

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.928
is by building a strong
independent commercial economy,

00:50:01.928 --> 00:50:03.680
right?

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.590
So Thomas Jefferson
at the same time

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.510
is devoted to an
agricultural economy

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:10.440
and a concept of young farmer.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.610
And that's how democracy
is going to take place.

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.960
Hamilton is working in a
completely different direction.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:19.400
Let's stand up a major
national banking system.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.320
Let's stand up a major
commercial economy.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:27.440
And he himself is strongly
dedicated to early US

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.490
manufacturing industry.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:33.466
So he's investing in an early
manufacturing plant across New

00:50:33.466 --> 00:50:36.410
York City and in New Jersey.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.980
So Hamilton's
concept was that we

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.780
need to pursue
rational national self

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:46.910
dependence in manufacturing.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.920
And tariffs are
fine because that

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.580
will ensure the growth of US
manufacturing and production

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:55.340
capability in the US economy.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.410
And he creates a lot of the
fundamental institutions

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:03.660
that frankly, we still rely
on in maintaining that very

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.190
small commercial economy.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:12.850
Then there is the post-World War
II emergence of the Cold War.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:17.380
And Lynn argues that
the US government

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:21.820
leaves its Hamiltonian
notions of national self

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:27.850
dependence in manufacturing to
build a larger concept, right?

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:29.860
Confronted with an
international confrontation

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.910
with a different
economic system,

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:38.890
the US works towards building
a world economy that integrates

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.322
the US, Europe, and
Japan in particular,

00:51:41.322 --> 00:51:42.280
and other nations, too.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.670
But those are the
principal ones--

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:48.400
in a system of mutual
dependence, right?

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:53.520
So this is not a self
dependent manufacturing system.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.620
This starts to move
us in the direction

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:59.580
of a multi-continent
production system that's

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:03.160
going to be shared
by the participants.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.180
And then Lynn argues that
the third stage really

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:15.540
occurs in the 1990s as President
Clinton moves to move China

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.210
into the world economic system.

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:21.810
And that notion there is a--

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.230
it's a similar notion
to what occurs in Europe

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:29.000
in the post-war period.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.680
That if they integrate
their economies

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.180
and they all own
each other, they're

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.260
never going to fight
World War II again.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.480
All right?

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.630
There's a lot to be said
for that concept, frankly.

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:44.960
That an economically
interdependent integrated world

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.050
is going to significantly
reduce national security threats

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:48.710
over time.

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:51.920
That's essentially,
Barry Lynn argues,

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.220
Clinton's driving
conceptual framework

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.560
that this interdependent
economic system, tied

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.830
by joint manufacturing
and a common set

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:06.540
of economic organizations,
will enable world peace, right?

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.130
That's the notion.

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:12.900
So the WTO agreement and
China's entry into the WTO

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.770
is the critical
enabling step here.

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:21.480
And the west production
system is indeed,

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.930
to a significant extent,
merged into China

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:29.130
with China's production
output going worldwide.

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:32.400
Now there's a whole defense set
of perspectives here, right?

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.570
There are integrationists,
which Clinton would be one,

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:40.900
according to Lynn,
essentially extending

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:44.070
a Western manufacturing
production system into China,

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.740
will bind China to a
global economic system,

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.645
substantially reducing
national security problems

00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:54.460
in the long term.

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.190
And then there's a
whole different school

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:00.340
of the list of his profound
differences in these nations

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:04.150
and their geopolitical
systems, geopolitical goals

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:06.958
and their political systems
that are going to endure,

00:54:06.958 --> 00:54:08.500
and the only question
is which nation

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.000
gains the advantage from the
economic interdependence.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.680
But the next thing
that Lynn argues

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:22.620
is that this
globalism has created

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:27.290
its own economic
determinism, right?

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:29.690
That a new global
economic system

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:32.547
has in fact emerged here that
nobody's really in charge of,

00:54:32.547 --> 00:54:33.470
right?

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:36.080
That nobody-- no
separate country,

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.800
or even groups of
countries, can manage--

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.720
that it's larger than the
ability of these countries

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.780
to manage.

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:50.510
So Lynn writes this before
the 2008 financial meltdown,

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.060
which is truly a
world phenomenon,

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.710
driven by failures
in this country,

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:58.940
but pervasive worldwide.

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.710
And then there is
these frantic moments

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.150
as countries try
to figure out how

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:06.170
to manage this global
financial crisis

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:11.390
and realize how lacking in
tools they are to cope with it.

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:14.390
So kind of a final
point that Lynn makes

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.180
is that we've now
created a system that's

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:20.240
larger than the countries
themselves, right?

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.570
It's largely, frankly,
deterministic and somewhat

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.310
independent of them.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:28.850
And the ability to intervene
becomes much more problematic.

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:31.640
All right, so I thought it was
just an interesting perspective

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.100
to kind of throw
into the mix here,

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.460
as we begin to think about some
of these historical questions

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.861
and try to think about
the kind of global economy

00:55:39.861 --> 00:55:41.840
that we've made.

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.698
So who's got that one?

00:55:43.698 --> 00:55:44.990
RASHEED: I think it's still me.

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.840
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Really?

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.040
RASHEED: Yeah.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:46.860
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Thanks, RASHEED.

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.568
RASHEED: Yeah, we can
take it from there.

00:55:48.568 --> 00:55:53.870
So I thought we'd comment on
kind of the interconnectedness

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:57.590
and globalism might be
very specific to this time.

00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:00.230
I think he wrote about 2000.

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:03.740
And so he's like probably just
come from the '90s and seeing

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:09.027
Clinton sort of definitely push
towards laissez-faire business

00:56:09.027 --> 00:56:11.360
practices on the international
scale, which is something

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.610
that, yeah, as Americans
we're pretty used

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:16.417
to this whole idea
of the government

00:56:16.417 --> 00:56:18.500
is very separate from
business ideals and business

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.380
practices, but
also the promotion

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.510
that now it's not
just the US that

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:24.780
has to operate in the system.

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.530
But now we have to deal
with other countries that

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:28.700
promote this.

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:33.200
And so I thought it was pretty
important that we kind of date

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.980
him in 2000, where
we're kind of riding

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.300
the high of a lot
of these promotion

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.990
of international
interdependence.

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:47.270
But we do see the trouble,
I guess, definitely in 2008.

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:50.840
So is there sort of
room for us not only

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:54.120
as we develop in sort of this
interconnected globalized

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:54.620
world?

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:58.010
Is there room for
regulation and sort

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.860
of do intergovernmental
business practices that

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:04.310
have to be put in place to
sort of keep us in check?

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.070
STUDENT 5: OK, to add
on to that and also add

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:12.440
a fourth perspective,
so Andy Grove

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.820
was one of the three
founders of Intel.

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.440
And their big focus and
their main working ability

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:22.610
as a company was manufacturing,
especially very detailed

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:24.470
complex manufacturing.

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:27.710
And so he actually
wrote a letter in 2010,

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:29.280
and then he passed away in 2016.

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.490
But he wrote one about why
we need more manufacturing

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:36.410
in the US and why it's
dangerous when we don't have it.

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:39.290
And he goes on to say, Mr.
Grove contrasted the startup

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:40.910
phase of a business.

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.070
What uses for new
technologies are identified

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:44.120
with the scale-up phase?

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.790
When technology goes from
prototype to mass production,

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:47.660
both are important.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.095
But only scale-up is an
engine for job growth.

00:57:50.095 --> 00:57:51.470
And scale-up in
general no longer

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.120
occurs in the United States.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.460
Without scaling, he wrote,
we don't just lose jobs.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.040
We lose our hold
on new technologies

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.690
and ultimately damage
our capacity to innovate.

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:01.250
He then goes on to
talk a little bit

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:03.710
about laissez-faire
and open markets.

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:06.530
But then he argues that
even though laissez-faire

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:10.940
and those principles are good,
there is room for improvement.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:14.930
He talks about job centric
economies and politics,

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:17.180
where in a job centric
system, job creation would

00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.897
be the nation's
number one objective,

00:58:18.897 --> 00:58:21.230
while the government's setting
priorities and arraigning

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:23.278
the forces necessary
to achieve the goal.

00:58:23.278 --> 00:58:25.820
And within this operating, not
only in their immediate profit

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.778
interest, but also in
the interest of employees

00:58:27.778 --> 00:58:29.360
and employees yet
to be hired, which

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.430
is beneficial to the country.

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.410
He ends with saying
something that we're

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:38.005
seeing right now, which is
wealth inequality, that if we

00:58:38.005 --> 00:58:40.130
do have a place where we
just pretty much outsource

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:41.180
everything, we're going
to have a country that

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:44.150
has very high profitability,
but low prosperity, which

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:46.692
is what we're seeing right now,
and especially very impactful

00:58:46.692 --> 00:58:47.850
in the last three years.

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.552
Especially since after
2000-- well, in the 2000s,

00:58:50.552 --> 00:58:52.760
everyone started to outsource
all their manufacturing

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:55.820
because it's cheaper
in China, Asia.

00:58:55.820 --> 00:59:00.340
But that's really hurt jobs
in the US in a statement.

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:01.090
STUDENT 4: Sorry--

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.140
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Thanks, Martin.

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.223
STUDENT 4: Who wrote that?

00:59:03.223 --> 00:59:04.390
STUDENT 5: Andy Grove.

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:05.420
So--

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:07.020
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: One of
the three founders of Intel.

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.510
STUDENT 5: And he was also
very important because he--

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:09.190
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Andy Grove also

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:11.142
has one of my favorite
remarks, which is

00:59:11.142 --> 00:59:13.620
that only the paranoid survive.

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.740
STUDENT 5: Yeah.

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.413
He's written a lot
of great books,

00:59:16.413 --> 00:59:17.830
but the differences
and the reason

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:19.120
I added him is because
his perspective is more

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.740
of the business
person who's seen kind

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.050
of the impact versus
the three sources

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:26.000
added were mostly politicians.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.432
And so I thought that would
be interesting to add.

00:59:28.432 --> 00:59:29.890
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Thanks, Martin.

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:31.765
And look, a lot of the
issues you just raised

00:59:31.765 --> 00:59:34.975
are going to be prime topics
in next week's class, too.

00:59:34.975 --> 00:59:38.440
So just hang on
to a lot of that.

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.570
We can discuss it here,
too, of course, but--

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:42.778
STUDENT 2: Would it be
acceptable and, or appropriate

00:59:42.778 --> 00:59:45.670
to do a straw poll of who agreed
overall with Lynn's argument

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:46.600
versus who didn't?

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
With Barry Lynn?

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:49.120
STUDENT 2: Yeah.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:49.750
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Sure.

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:50.958
STUDENT 2: Can we straw poll?

00:59:50.958 --> 00:59:52.700
Who generally thought
that [INAUDIBLE]??

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:56.258
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Now
which part of his argument?

00:59:56.258 --> 00:59:57.050
STUDENT 2: I mean--

00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:59.830
oh, so I think the
piece I was missing

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:03.760
in your analysis about
his argument on Clinton

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.740
is that he didn't think
that was a good idea.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.068
He didn't appreciate
the integrative approach

01:00:08.068 --> 01:00:10.360
because he felt that the
invisible hand that we had all

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.410
presumed to exist that would
effectively regulate the market

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:17.320
and ensure that everyone
was acting in not only

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.720
their own
self-interest, but also

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.260
in the self-interest of the
system being sustainable

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.258
was dangerous.

01:00:24.258 --> 01:00:26.050
Because it could
collapse, and then it did.

01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:28.180
So overall, I agree
with that component.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.790
And I guess, that's what I'm
curious about other people's

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:31.600
perspectives on.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.730
Do we think that his
conception of how

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:44.775
laissez-faire is implemented
is generally applicable or not?

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.150
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I mean, look,

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:49.440
that's a good summary of the
point that Lynn brings us to.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.911
So thank you for
pushing on that.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.913
RASHEED: Agree
with some caveats.

01:00:58.913 --> 01:01:00.080
STUDENT 7: Oh, we're voting?

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:00.425
STUDENT 6: Yeah.

01:01:00.425 --> 01:01:01.600
STUDENT 2: OK,
yeah, let's start.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.570
STUDENT 5: Let's simplify
the statement, though.

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:03.190
STUDENT 6: Yeah.

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:04.670
STUDENT 5: Just keep
it as a true-false.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:05.337
STUDENT 6: Yeah.

01:01:05.337 --> 01:01:06.650
Yeah.

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:09.620
STUDENT 2: Do we think
laissez-faire economies

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.683
are dangerous in the way that
Lynn has articulated them?

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.890
Yes, do we?

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.098
STUDENT 6: Yeah, pretty much.

01:01:18.098 --> 01:01:19.750
STUDENT 2: OK, who does not?

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:21.090
Who does not?

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:24.944
Who thinks laissez-faire
is good with caveats?

01:01:24.944 --> 01:01:25.567
OK.

01:01:25.567 --> 01:01:27.650
STUDENT 6: Have you heard
of the Great Depression?

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:35.880
RASHEED: So I think my
caveats were definitely

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.770
you had this opportunity in
laissez-faire to sort of spread

01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:43.470
this idea of not only
comparative advantage,

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:47.712
but you also spread, hopefully,
if this works, positively

01:01:47.712 --> 01:01:48.920
sort of like the good things.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.610
And if you hit maybe
Martin's point on bring in--

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:56.720
job creation is kind of
one of the central pieces,

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.180
just sort of keeping
the social tide of sort

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.838
of everybody rising.

01:02:01.838 --> 01:02:04.380
I think you get an opportunity
to sort of like spread the job

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.880
creation, sort of spread all
these things with laissez-faire

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.330
and looking, like
Clinton did, towards sort

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:12.510
of not so much outsourcing,
but sort of like looking bigger

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:14.930
than just kind of creating
jobs in the United States

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:16.440
to sort of rise our wealth.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.227
But if you look at if
you can create jobs now

01:02:19.227 --> 01:02:21.810
all over the globe and integrate
them into this interconnected

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:25.430
system, you have the opportunity
to sort of rise the tide

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:28.536
globally in laissez-faire.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.370
STUDENT 7: I just think the main
point I got from Lynn's reading

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:40.780
is that systems with single
point failures are dangerous.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:43.448
And I feel like that would
be true on any scale.

01:02:43.448 --> 01:02:45.240
He's just talking about
now we're on such a

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.470
bigger scale that it's
going to affect everyone.

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:51.240
But I think that at
the national scale,

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.530
that would still be dangerous.

01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:55.790
Any system that has single
point failures is a concern.

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:58.320
But I don't necessarily
agree with the fact

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.660
that he thinks that
can't be corrected,

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:05.190
while still having a somewhat
laissez-faire system.

01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:07.860
I mean, I do think it would
require some regulations,

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:11.910
but even if it was just
having a few plants that

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.580
makes semiconductors
outside of Taiwan,

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.520
I feel like that could
be not a huge imposition

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.290
on laissez-faire and reduce this
single point failure problem.

01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:25.470
STUDENT 3: Actually, when I was
reading that, I was thinking,

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:28.830
would it really be safer then
to have every factory making

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:31.170
every component of the phone
all in the United States?

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:32.795
Wouldn't that just
geographically cause

01:03:32.795 --> 01:03:34.838
you to be less diverse?

01:03:34.838 --> 01:03:36.630
STUDENT 9: Yeah, I
think that's interesting

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:39.300
because he uses
language to make it seem

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.080
like this is what a globally
distributed architecture looks

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:43.770
like.

01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:44.340
But I agree.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.757
I think if you have all of
your manufacturing or something

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:50.940
concentrated in one geographical
area, it's not globalization.

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:53.338
It's not really a very
complex integrated system.

01:03:53.338 --> 01:03:55.380
It just happens to be far
away from your country.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:57.442
That doesn't make it local.

01:03:57.442 --> 01:03:59.400
STUDENT 2: Would we
conceive of Lynn's argument

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.730
as America first then?

01:04:03.152 --> 01:04:05.110
STUDENT 8: Yeah, I've
been thinking about that.

01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:07.590
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, I mean, Lynn

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:10.860
is painting a dark side here.

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.980
And he's painting a portrayal
of opening up the system.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:19.410
And then the system itself
begins to take control, right?

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.440
This globalized
financial system itself

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.650
begins to take
control and minimize

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:28.170
the ability of
any of the players

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:30.210
to impact or affect that.

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:33.960
So it's a fundamental statement
about the fragility and lack

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.460
of resilience.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:43.540
And your single point of failure
point is well taken, Chloe.

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.350
It's a dark picture here,
and what makes it intriguing

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:49.150
and the only reason why
I still keep it in here

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:52.930
is that sure enough, that's
exactly what we ended up

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.280
with in 2008.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.670
And boy, that was
so close to a really

01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:02.020
massive worldwide depression
that it's painful in economy.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:05.560
So I put it in as kind of
a useful warning lesson,

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.500
but also a lesson
about how we've

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.100
moved in the international
organization of our economy

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.070
from a nation-centered
to an ally-centered

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:18.310
to a truly globalized
kind of orientation here.

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.860
And what are the
implications of that?

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.810
We need to keep
thinking about this.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:25.300
STUDENT 8: Going
back to that whole--

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.360
the 2008 collapse,
you were saying

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.170
that it's very
difficult to regulate

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:35.770
some sort of financial system
that reaches across borders.

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:41.950
But at least with the 2008
crisis, a lot of the collapse

01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:44.080
stemmed directly
from the US, which

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.130
means that at least with
the collapse of that form,

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:51.550
US regulations clearly would
have helped significantly

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:54.970
and would have prevented
the crisis altogether.

01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:58.810
So my feeling is at least
if we're going to use that

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:02.018
as the example,
then it just isn't--

01:06:02.018 --> 01:06:02.560
I don't know.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.160
I don't know how true it is
then that we can't actually

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.550
regulate this system.

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:10.000
Because if you have all these
countries that are all--

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.330
ignoring natural disasters,
like what happened in Taiwan,

01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:16.630
if all these separate countries
are regulating their industries

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:19.930
properly in order to make
sure that no bank is,

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.230
quote unquote, too
big to fail, then

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:26.710
I don't see how the
system could collapse

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:29.885
if all the individual components
are doing what they should be.

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:32.260
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So let me
put this in a different way

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:32.760
here.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.200
We've been targeting
an innovation wave.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.230
I think this
significant argument

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:46.870
that the explosion of
the financial services

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:53.900
sector, incredibly rapid growth
in financial services sector,

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:58.170
in the 1990s, in the 2000s,
that's an innovation wave.

01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:00.870
There certainly were
technological innovations

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.250
that were at the heart of this.

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:05.940
The IT revolution was clearly
a great organizing factor.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:09.080
The ability to bring
mathematics to bear,

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:14.010
to work on a problem of big data
and initial kinds of analytics

01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:16.830
to bring algorithms to
bear on market trading--

01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:20.070
these were all significant
technology advances

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:27.940
that were enablers of creating
a truly globalized system.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.220
And we moved at a
relatively short period

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:35.810
from national systems, financial
services and financial service

01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:38.120
organizations to much
larger global systems.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.330
So when the US
economy went down,

01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:44.000
it hit the rest of
the world economy.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.920
US financial system went down.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.250
It hit the rest of the
world economy in wave

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:51.380
after wave after wave
and began to jeopardize

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:54.320
a whole nest of other
financial institutions

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.800
that were caught up in this
very integrated kind of system.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.640
So that's more of what
I'm driving at, Max.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:06.140
And look, as we've discussed
in innovation waves,

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.330
there's always a bubble, right?

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:10.800
And the problem
with having a bubble

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.250
in your financial
services sector

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.990
is that it brings
down everything.

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.490
It's one thing to have
a bubble with dot coms.

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:20.300
Yeah, lose the dot
coms, but if you

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.029
lose the world
financial system because

01:08:23.029 --> 01:08:27.290
of the technological bubble,
it's pretty powerful.

01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:29.500
Andrew Lowe is a wonderful
professor of finance

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.670
here at MIT.

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:33.620
Has a remarkable chart, right?

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:37.970
The chart is-- it's the
history of the value

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:43.100
of home prices adjusted for
inflation in the United States.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.779
And it's a hockey stick.

01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:48.680
OK, so it's inflation adjusted.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.750
It's flat, and the
numbers start getting put

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:52.100
together in about the 1880s.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.800
And should you go on the 1880s,
there's the Great Depression,

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.300
right?

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.000
A couple of recessions,
but it's pretty stable.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.330
Then about 1990, it
just skyrockets, right?

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:05.120
It just skyrockets, and you
wonder what were we thinking?

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.520
I mean, this is clearly
going to be a bubble.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.580
Why was it that the financial
services sector decided

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.450
that the ultimate fundamental
unit of value in the world

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.910
financial order is going to
be the American home mortgage?

01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:18.529
Why did we do this, right?

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:19.609
What were we thinking?

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:22.729
But in a way, that's
exactly what we do.

01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:24.560
Now, Andrew goes on
to make an argument.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.630
We developed all these very
interesting new financial tools

01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.340
in the course of
that innovation wave.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.465
He wouldn't necessarily
call it an innovation wave,

01:09:33.465 --> 01:09:35.359
but I would.

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.970
Let's figure out
if we can settle

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:42.200
on some better units of
value than the American home

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.350
mortgage, right?

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:46.310
Is there a way to drive
investment, which we can now

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:51.319
mobilize on a global scale on
to much better units of value?

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:54.560
So the project he's been
involved in has been,

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.570
can we drive it on
innovation based research?

01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:02.390
Can we create agglomerations
of, really, major capital?

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:05.060
Not just $60 billion a
year in a $19 trillion

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:08.750
economy of venture capital,
but real numbers, right?

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:12.890
And move those larger numbers
on in the innovation system.

01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:15.530
So he's working on health
research in particular.

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.840
But it's an interesting concept.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.630
And in a way, it
comes out of trying

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:22.100
to wrestle with
some of the points

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.400
that Barry Lynn kind of
put on the table here.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.730
RASHEED, a closing thought?

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:28.550
RASHEED: Yeah.

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:33.700
So I think Barry
Lynn probably takes

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.470
maybe a different
position than in the time

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:38.930
that he was talking
about her, too.

01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:42.350
I think if he had said this
in the room with Bill Clinton,

01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:45.230
he would have had an
interesting discussion.

01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:46.760
But I was actually
just wondering

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.885
if we could talk about
this, like a little bit more

01:10:48.885 --> 01:10:50.360
of the critical reception.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.640
And [INAUDIBLE] is he the first
guy to say maybe laissez-faire

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.470
wasn't a good idea, guys?

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.750
And then we see the
after effects afterwards.

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:03.680
But critically, I think reading
this, I was pretty kind of

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.810
taken aback by a lot of
the things he was saying.

01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:09.230
Is this sort of maybe not
politically, but socially

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:14.190
acceptable thought in
the US in maybe 2005?

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.930
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
it's a moment of dissidence

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:19.260
in our reading list, right?

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.630
It's a little contrarian.

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:24.600
So just like Charles Schulz
was contrary in last week,

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.810
Barry Lynn is
contrary in this week.

01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:29.010
So, good summary.

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:30.560
Thank you, RASHEED.

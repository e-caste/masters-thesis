00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.260
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.900
Let's get started.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.520
Today we are going to talk
about competition.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.490
Just, once again, I want you
guys to try to have in mind a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.450
flowchart of where the
course is all going.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.800
Where does this fit in?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.350
We talked last time about how
firms decide on the cost

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.200
minimizing way to produce a
given level of output through

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.530
the tangency of the isoquant and
the isocost. And we talked

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.600
about how if we were consumers,
we'd be done then.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.300
Consumers just find the tangency
and indifference

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000
curve in the budget constraint,
and they're done.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.950
But firms aren't done.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.720
Because the level of output,
unlike the budget which is

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.390
given to you as a consumer,
the level of output is not

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.140
given to the firm.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.670
They get to choose it.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.000
So with firms, we have to
go one step further.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.790
We actually have to choose
the level of

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.790
output that we produce.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420
We don't just choose the way to
produce it but actually how

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.690
much to produce.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.830
So, for consumers, it would
be sort of like consumers

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.900
choosing what their budget
constraint is.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.730
And the way we do that is we
bring in-- since we now have a

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.640
third variable, which is
how much to produce--

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.670
we have to bring in
a third equation.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.930
And that equation we bring in
is essentially the market.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.090
Essentially, we say the market
imposes conditions on the firm

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.340
which helps them figure out
how much to produce.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.950
So we take all the stuff
we did before.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.770
We then take that and put
that in a market.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.500
And the market interacts
with the firm.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.250
And from that market
setting, the firm

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.680
derives how much to produce.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.230
So, basically, the level of
production for a given firm,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.760
little q, will be derived from
how firms behave in different

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.530
market settings.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.870
And the market setting we're
going to start with today is

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.800
the classic starting point for
economics which is the market

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.075
setting of perfect
competition.

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:18.750
We're going to start talking
about perfectly competitive

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.510
markets, a benchmark of
perfect competition.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.550
With perfect competition, this
is basically a case where many

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.400
firms are selling goods
to many consumers.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.890
We're then going to, in the next
few lectures, talk about

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.790
more realistic alternatives like
monopoly which is not a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.930
game but rather a market
structure.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.980
It is basically a case
where one firm

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.180
sells to many consumers.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.080
Or oligopoly, my favorite word
in all of economics, not

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.005
because I like the
topic so much, I

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:48.730
think it's a cool word.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.130
This is when several firms sell
to a large market, which

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.120
is probably the most realistic
setting of all.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.800
And we're going to come
to talk about those.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.510
But, today, we're going to start
with our benchmark of

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.160
perfect competition.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.410
Now, what is perfect
competition?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.830
I can give you a technical
definition.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.330
Technically, perfect competition
exists whenever

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.240
firms are price takers on both
the output and input markets.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.040
They're price takers on both the
output and input markets.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.080
So perfectly competitive
firms are price takers.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.300
That is no action that they
take can affect either the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.260
price at which they sell their
goods or the price that they

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.060
pay for their inputs.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.150
They're price takers.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.110
They're not price makers.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.080
No action they take affects
either the price at which they

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.710
sell their good.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.810
No action the individual firm
takes affects either the price

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.880
at which they sell their goods
or the price they pay for

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.130
their inputs.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.570
Well, when will this be true?

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.430
Go back to lecture one.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.280
Technically this would be true
if a firm faced perfectly

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:06.730
elastic demand for their
goods, and if they had

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.440
perfectly elastic supply
of inputs.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.400
Under those conditions, firms
will be perfectly competitive

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.709
if they face perfectly elastic
demand for their goods and

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.399
perfectly elastic supply
of inputs.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.230
OK.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.810
So let's focus on the first of
those which is perfectly

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.710
elastic demand.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.270
Let's take a look
at Figure 10-1.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.160
These should be little
q's by the way.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.860
This isn't a market.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.930
This is a firm.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.380
These should be little q's.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.350
So, basically, what you have
here is that you have a firm

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.815
facing a perfectly
elastic demand.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.690
What that means is the firm's
quantity is pegged by their

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.500
supply curve.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.860
Or, in other words, the point is
the firm cannot change the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.456
price one iota from that level
P. So, in other words, if this

00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:04.000
is a supply shift, say the price
of the firm's inputs go

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.520
up, the firm doesn't
get to charge any

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.680
more for their goods.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.860
They just sell fewer goods.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.438
So the supply shift from S1 to
S2, the firm is going to be--

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:16.080
it should be little
q1 to little q2.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.540
They're going to reduce the
quantity they sell, but they

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.720
cannot change the price.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.550
They face perfectly
elastic demand.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.150
So when does this make sense as
a description of the world?

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.170
Well, it makes sense as a
description of the world under

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.680
four conditions.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.360
So there's four conditions
under which perfect

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.210
competition will exist.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.060
The first condition is
identical products.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.135
In a perfectly competitive
market, when the firms in that

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:56.860
market sell identical products,
now let's be clear.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.200
They don't have to literally
be identical.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.860
They have to be perceived by
consumers as identical.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.280
So when I say identical
products, they don't have to

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.100
literally be identical.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.360
But consumers have to consider
them identical for purposes of

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.710
their demand across firms.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.804
So firms have to sell identical
products for there

00:06:13.804 --> 00:06:14.580
to be perfect competition.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.610
Because if products aren't
identical, then firms will be

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.790
able to charge different prices
from each other because

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.190
they have something
different to sell.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.300
So firms need to be identical.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:33.240
Second of all, consumers have
to have full information on

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.490
all prices.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.880
Well, let me write down the next
two conditions, because

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.950
they're related.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:53.255
And the third is low transaction
or shopping costs.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.200
OK, these two are critical.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.630
Because the way perfect
competition is going to work,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.770
its consumers are going to
shop across firms selling

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.300
identical goods.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.195
And they're going to buy
from the cheapest one.

00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:14.430
And if there's any failure of
either of these, the consumers

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.670
might not know if you're the
cheapest. And, therefore, you

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.230
might be able to charge extra.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.035
So perfectly elastic demand,
once again we're getting to

00:07:23.035 --> 00:07:25.570
the microfoundation of something
we discussed in the

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.690
second lecture.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.780
We discussed perfectly
elastic demand.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.880
Now we're talking about
where that comes from.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.440
What conditions do you need?

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.540
Perfectly elastic demand is
going to require that

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.480
consumers know all the prices
and can cautiously shop across

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.380
all the options.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.410
Otherwise, firms might have
some opportunity to charge

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.890
different prices.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.900
And finally-- and we'll come
back to why this is

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.150
important--

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:55.580
there needs to be free entry and
exit of firms. This one I

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.210
can't really give you
intuition for yet.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.000
Just take my word for it.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.450
We'll come back to why
that's important.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.920
So, basically, what you want for
an example of a perfectly

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.960
competitive market, you want a
market where producers are

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.910
selling homogeneous goods in
an easily informed, easily

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.070
shocked arena.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.470
So I think the best example of a
perfectly competitive market

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.150
is those guys selling like
shlocky touristy things around

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:32.850
Port Authority in New York or in
any large open air market.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:37.960
Basically, in that area, these
guys all sell the same crap.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.809
You can go from one to
one quite easily.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.440
And it's quite easy to find
out what the prices are.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.550
That's not perfectly easy, but
it's quite easy to find out

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.440
what the prices are.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.980
That is a condition for a
perfectly competitive market.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.410
It's easy to shop, because
they're all in the same area.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.320
Prices are pretty easy to
observe, and the products are

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.880
all, basically, identical.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.580
There are only so many
little Statues of

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.880
Liberty you can buy.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.720
So, basically, that's an
example of a perfectly

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.820
competitive market.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.530
Now, in reality, no perfectly
competitive market exists.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.260
There's never been a perfectly
competitive market.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.680
But this is sort of as
close as we can get.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.250
Questions about that?

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.940
Now that provides a good moment
to pause and talk about

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.560
Peter Diamond who just won the
Nobel Prize in Economics.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.915
This is my MIT economics Peter
Diamond, MIT Econ Peter

00:09:28.915 --> 00:09:30.640
Diamond shirt.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.250
Peter Diamond just won the
Nobel Prize in Economics.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.610
Peter Diamond is the greatest
economic theorist of his

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.290
generation, sort of the heir
of the Paul Samuelson, Bob

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.420
Solow generation that founded
this economics department and

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.290
made it great.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.360
Peter Diamond was sort of the
next generation that led this

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.320
economics department forward
and kept it great.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.200
And Peter has made contributions
throughout

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:50.990
economic theory.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.860
He should have won the
Nobel 10 times over.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.560
What they finally gave it to
him on Monday for was for

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.350
search theory.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.230
And search theory is essentially
about what happens

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.720
when markets don't work like
these vendors around Port

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.810
Authority in New York, when
markets aren't perfectly

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.730
competitive.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.240
Where, basically, you have
markets where there is some

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.360
mismatch and some search costs
that sellers have to pay to

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.600
find the right buyers, and
buyers have to pay to find the

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.120
right sellers.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.400
So the best example here, and
the example of which they

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.560
really gave him the Nobel Prize,
was the labor market.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.630
It was about search costs
in the labor market.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.590
And what Peter Diamond and his
fellow co-winners talked about

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.840
was about how in the
labor market,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.860
your firms have vacancies.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.940
They have jobs they
want to fill.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.080
Individuals have labor supply.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.060
They want to provide themselves
to these jobs.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.040
And so there's unemployment.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.820
There's people out of jobs
looking for jobs.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.760
But there's vacancies.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.660
There's jobs that are empty.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.590
And both exist at
the same time.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.120
And how can that be?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.890
In a perfectly competitive
market, that couldn't be.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.450
You couldn't have both jobs
looking for people and people

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.900
looking for jobs.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.960
But what Diamond wrote down,
and these other theorists

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.320
developed in their models, is
basically how you get these

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.850
frictions in the labor market.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.360
Where since these jobs have
specific characteristics

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.200
employers are looking for,
you can't quite match the

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.640
vacancies to the unemployed
workers.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.300
There's a sorting process where
some are easy to match.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.430
You can take the high school
dropout and put him in

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.900
McDonald's.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.980
That's easy.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.280
But the job which requires some
computer skills, you have

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.070
to find the right guy
to take that.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.490
And, basically, it's these
frictions that lead to what we

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.240
call the natural rate of
unemployment in our economy,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.920
which is the notion that no
economy would ever get down to

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.770
0 unemployment.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.130
That's impossible.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.900
And the reason is because there
will always be some

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.490
frictions and some mismatch.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.730
There will always be some
inability of people to find

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.580
the right people to fill
their vacancies.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.290
Now, we don't know what
the natural rate is.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.650
When I was in grad school, we
learned that the rate was 7%.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.950
In the 1990s, the natural rate
seemed to fall to about 4%.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.550
That is we got to about a
4% unemployment rate.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.300
Now who the heck knows what the
natural rate is anymore.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.470
And a big debate right now among
economists in macro is

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.340
how much of our 9.6% is an
increase in the natural rate,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.030
which is something the
government can't really fix

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.710
very well, versus short-term
demand reductions, which the

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.520
government could fix by pumping
more resources into

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.610
the economy.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.300
And all that is informed,
theoretically, by the work

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.360
that Peter Diamond did.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.070
Now, I hope what I just
described sounded pretty

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.940
obvious to you.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.460
And that's good, because that's
what great theory does.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.720
Great theory ex-post
sounds obvious.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.440
It's just ex-ante, before Peter
Diamond did this, people

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.150
always said, well,
we have these

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.150
perfectly competitive markets.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.260
This is how they should
function.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.130
And he's the guy who really
taught us how real markets

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.370
should function like this.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.350
And that's why he gets
to go to Stockholm.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.450
So that's very exciting for our
economics department, very

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.770
exciting for the profession.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.670
And it's just a great moment,
really, in taking economics--

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.540
I saw it described very
well in one article--

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.690
these last few Nobel Prizes
are the beginning of

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.770
recognizing that economics is
not what we teach in this

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.460
course anymore.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.230
You need what we teach in this
course to go on in economics.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.020
But probably the first couple
dozen Nobel Prizes were for

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.670
about what we teach
in this course.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.440
And the last few have been about
what you teach in the

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.650
subsequent courses.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.110
And that's a real evolution of
Freakonomics, to understand

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.630
that we need to mature as a
science and move beyond the

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.820
basics that you learn in
14.01 and move beyond

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.560
to these other things.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.630
So we're giving you
the basics here.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.140
But the excitement happens
elsewhere.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.090
So it's a very exciting time for
our department and for the

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.560
profession as a whole.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.500
Now with that little diatribe
aside, let's go back.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.180
So we have these.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.450
So now, having said all
that, forget it.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.620
Forget Peter Diamond existed.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.340
We're now going back to
perfect competition.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.340
And, once again, as I said
in the first lecture--

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.000
and Peter would be the first guy
to say it, this is how he

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.620
taught me to do economic
theory-- you've got to make

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.940
simplifying assumptions if
you want to get anywhere.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.540
So we're going to make a
simplifying assumption of

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.640
perfect competition.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.860
We'll weaken that
as we go along.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.820
But, for now, imagine it's
perfect competition.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.000
And we have the situation of
perfectly competitive firms.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.745
Now a very important distinction
to draw-- and

00:13:54.745 --> 00:13:56.410
that's why it's important to
remember that these are little

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.890
q's not big Q's--

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:04.770
is the distinction between firm
demand and market demand,

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.890
firm versus market.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.895
And this is something
which is confusing.

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:09.230
It confuses me at times.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.320
I may even get it
wrong at times.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.570
I'll need you to correct me.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.850
Even if a given firm faces
perfectly elastic demand, it

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.740
doesn't necessarily mean
that market demand

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.890
is perfectly elastic.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:26.350
That is the overall demand for
little, fake Statues of

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:32.730
Liberty around Port Authority
in New York is

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.300
not perfectly elastic.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.910
As the price goes up, fewer
people will buy them.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.490
As the prices goes down, more
people will buy them.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.425
But for any given vendor
selling them, it

00:14:40.425 --> 00:14:41.670
is perfectly elastic.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.750
Because there's always
someplace next

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.880
door you can go.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.220
So it's very important to
distinguish between the demand

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.530
facing the firm being perfectly
elastic and the

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.070
demand facing the market not
being perfectly elastic.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.680
And the way to think about this
is to think about the

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.370
concept of residual demand.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.260
We have a demand function
for market D of p.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:11.460
We have a demand function for a
market which is that as the

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.970
price goes up demand
goes down.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.000
Now the demand function for a
given firm, we'll call the

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.420
residual demand D super r
of p, is equal to what?

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:31.150
It's equal to the demand for
the market minus the supply

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.730
that all other firms in the
market provide, S super 0 of

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.970
p, the supply that all other
firms in the market provide.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.870
So the demand for my
product as a firm

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.450
is my residual demand.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.810
It's the market demand minus
what other firms supply.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:54.070
Well, if you differentiate this
with respect to price,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:16:04.620
you'll see that dDr/dp equals
dD/dp minus dS0/dp.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.190
This first one is the
market demand curve.

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.040
We know that's a negative
number, because demand curves

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.640
slope down.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.440
We're not assuming
Giffen goods.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.670
We know that's a negative
number.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.240
But this is a positive number.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.930
Supply curves slope up.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.450
The amount that other firms in
the market will supply as the

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.080
prices goes up is positive.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.520
Supply curves slope up.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.330
So this is a negative number.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.270
But this is a positive number
which means, by definition,

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.840
this is a very negative
number.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.465
The firm's residual demand
responds more to price than

00:16:42.465 --> 00:16:44.510
the market's demand does.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.580
Because the firm's residual
demand is after all the supply

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.830
of other firms.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.730
So we can rewrite this in
terms of elasticities.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.470
So let's assume, for a second,
that all firms are identical.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.100
Assume, for one second, that
we're in a market where all

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.700
firms are identical, that little
q equals big Q over N.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.089
Assume that all firms
are identical.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:10.140
And so, therefore, the amount
produced by other firms, Q

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:15.609
super 0 is (n - 1) x q.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:20.230
So, basically, the amount that's
produced by other firms

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.920
is (n - 1) x q.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.099
So the last is demand facing a
given firm, epsilon sub i is n

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:31.280
times the elasticity of demand
for the entire market minus (n

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.310
- 1) times the elasticity of
supply for the market.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.300
So, for example, let's say
you've got a market with 100

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.632
firms in it.

00:17:40.632 --> 00:17:43.860
It's a big market but not
outrageously big.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.180
We have plenty of markets with
more firms than that.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.430
And let's say that the
elasticity of demand for this

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.580
market equals minus 1.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.560
So it's in between elastic and
inelastic, not a crazy number.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.970
And the elasticity
of supply is 1.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.320
Let's just say that's
the example.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.540
Then what you get is that for a
given firm, if you used this

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.620
formula, the elasticity of
demand facing a given

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.350
firm is minus 199.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.910
It's a huge negative number.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:19.470
So even though the market demand
is modestly elastic,

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.330
minus 1-- it's elastic
but not crazy--

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.890
the demand facing the given
firm is crazy elastic.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.800
So, basically, the point is that
even if a market does not

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.270
have super elastic demand, a
given firm can face very

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.360
elastic demand.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.610
And that's what can lead
to perfect competition.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.510
It's very important to
keep those distinct.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.430
When we talk about demand, think
about demand at the firm

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.620
level versus demand at
the market level.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.590
Demand at the market level,
that's about substitutability

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.300
with other goods and the things
we've talked about

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.670
deriving demand curves.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.070
When we derive demand
curves, we're not

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.400
deriving firm demand curves.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.840
We're deriving market
demand curves.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.570
And so the demand curve was a
function of elasticities and

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:07.150
substitutability across goods.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.640
The firm demand curve is a
function of all that but also

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.620
how many firms are
in the market.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.220
If there are a lot of firms in
the market, it's going to be

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.650
very elastic in a perfectly
competitive market.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.250
Questions about that?

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.130
It's an important distinction
to keep in mind.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.350
Now, with that as background,
let's now come to profit

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.580
maximization which is what
this is all about.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:33.220
Remember I said we assume that
every decision consumers make

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.160
is driven by utility
maximization.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.680
Every decision producers make
is driven by profit

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.970
maximization.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.730
So let's talk about profit
maximization in the short run.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.200
How do firms maximize profits
in the short run?

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.290
Now, the first question
we have to

00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:00.040
ask is what is profits?

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.060
Well, that seems pretty
straightforward.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.760
I defined those already.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.440
I said, the profits were equal
to revenue minus costs.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:14.740
Profits are equal to revenue
minus costs.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.740
Well, the trick is that there's
two different types of

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.100
people who measure costs.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:20.970
Revenue is revenue.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.220
It's just, basically,
the money you make.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.070
And anybody can measure that.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.310
But there's two different
ways of measuring costs.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:36.110
There's accounting costs, and
there's economic costs.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.910
And these are different
concepts.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:48.880
Accounting costs are cash flow
costs what you actually pay.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.700
So your accounting costs are
what you actually pay.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.790
So if you buy something for
x dollars, that's your

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.710
accounting costs.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:04.390
The economic costs are about
opportunity costs, which is

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.090
not about what you lay out in
cash, but what you could have

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.030
done with that cash.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.140
It's not just about what you
lay out, but what you could

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.980
have done with that cash.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.370
So to give you an
example, let's

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.870
just do a simple example.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:23.630
Imagine that you graduate.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.330
You're going to graduate.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:24.720
I don't mean that.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.750
You're going to graduate.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.886
Imagine that after you graduate,
you decide you're

00:21:29.886 --> 00:21:32.620
going to start a website design
firm on the side.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.530
You're going to do this while
you decide what to do with the

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.095
rest your life.

00:21:35.095 --> 00:21:35.858
You're trying to figure
out where to go to

00:21:35.858 --> 00:21:36.340
grad school or whatever.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.720
You'll start a website
design firm.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.490
That seems easy.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.010
Basically, how does the website
design firm work?

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.120
Basically, you work full-time,
and you hire some slave

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.450
programmer who works for you.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.480
He does all of the grunt work.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.680
And let's say that you have
to pay him $40,000 a year.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.510
So it's going to be you working
full-time plus some

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:59.050
slave programmer you're going
to pay $40,000 a year.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.960
And let's say that you have
a computer that's like six

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.000
months old, a year old.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.900
It's still in pretty
good shape.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.520
It's not brand new, but it's
still in pretty good shape.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.450
And you just let the slave
programmer use that.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.590
So you don't have to
buy a new one.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.716
So you've got the programmer,
you're paying him $40,000.

00:22:12.716 --> 00:22:14.900
You're letting him use
your computer.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.750
You buy some new computer
you're working on.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.660
So you do your work,
and he does work.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.760
You put it together.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.250
At the end of the year, you
tally up all the receipts

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:23.500
you've had from your
website design,

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.820
and you've made $60,000.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.310
So you sit back and say, well,
that's pretty good.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.660
I put in $40,000.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.130
I paid $40,000.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.360
I brought home $60,000.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.690
That's $20,000 in profit.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.430
That's not a bad profit.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:42.800
If we think about profit
margins, we'll often think

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.690
about profit relative
to revenue.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.800
Well that's $20,000 of profit
on $60,000 of revenue.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.520
It's a 33% profit margin.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.995
Most companies would
kill for that.

00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:53.230
So you say, that's not bad.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.740
I made a 33% profit margin.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.080
But what opportunity costs did
this calculation miss?

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.380
So if you were an accountant,
you'd stop there.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.330
That's why accountants don't
make as much as economists.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.710
Because we're better.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.320
If you're an accountant,
you'd stop there.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.280
But if you were an economist,
what do you recognize?

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.690
What did this calculation
miss?

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.820
What opportunity costs were
involved in running this firm

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.840
that the cash flow calculation
didn't capture?

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.400
Yeah?

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.835
AUDIENCE: If you plot your
grunt worker and your

00:23:17.835 --> 00:23:20.339
computer, you might have been
able to do more work, because

00:23:20.339 --> 00:23:21.589
the computer might be
more efficient.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:25.410
OK.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.590
That's sort of a different
issue.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.090
That's sort of about the fact
that you might not have

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.090
produced as efficiently
as possible.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.510
I'm not asking that question.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.960
I'm asking, given the numbers I
gave you, why did I misstate

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.620
your economic profit?

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.096
Yeah, in the back.

00:23:39.096 --> 00:23:39.792
AUDIENCE: You could have
gotten another

00:23:39.792 --> 00:23:41.400
job that paid more.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.970
PROFESSOR: I could have gotten
another job that paid more.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:43.740
Here's another thing about it.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.860
I just spent an entire freaking

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.580
year, and I made $20,000.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.910
You're hoping you do better than
that with an MIT degree.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.400
At least your parents are hoping
you do better than that

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.260
with an MIT degree.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.890
So, basically, the first source
of opportunity cost

00:23:55.890 --> 00:24:00.950
that this has missed is the
value of your time.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.250
That doesn't show up as an
accounting cost. But it's a

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.200
real opportunity cost,
because you could

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.150
have had another job.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.780
So let's say you could
have gone out and

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.770
made $60,000 a year.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:15.940
You could have easily
found a job making

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.170
$60,000 as an MIT graduate.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.330
Well, then that's a cost of
running this website.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.690
By spending the year setting
this up, you forgo--

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.920
I don't know what the past
tense of forgo is--

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.350
forgoed?

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.640
$60,000 in income you
could've earned.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.330
You've forgone $60,000 you
could have earned.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.980
That's a real cost. It's not an
accounting cost. It didn't

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.350
show up on anybody's books.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.650
But it's an opportunity
cost. What else?

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.334
Yeah.

00:24:46.334 --> 00:24:48.886
AUDIENCE: Also the $40,000 that
you gave the program, you

00:24:48.886 --> 00:24:49.582
could have invested
it somewhere else.

00:24:49.582 --> 00:24:51.438
And it could be growing.

00:24:51.438 --> 00:24:53.720
PROFESSOR: You could have
invested the $40,000.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.810
You gave him the $40,000.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.400
You paid it.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:56.750
It's gone.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.600
If you put it in the bank, you
could've earned interest on

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.580
that money.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.550
That's an opportunity cost. And
we'll come back and talk

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.100
about capital markets
and interest later.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.630
But that's opportunity
cost. What else?

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:05.190
There's one more.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.560
AUDIENCE: You could have
sold the computer.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.660
PROFESSOR: I could have
sold the computer.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.980
I gave it to him, and
he used it for free.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.980
But if I could have sold that
for $1,000, that's an

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.780
opportunity cost as well.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.680
So, in fact, if I could have
worked for $60,000.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.520
On the $40,000, I could have
made $2,000 of interest. And I

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.890
could have sold the computer
for $1,000.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:27.170
Then, actually, my opportunity
costs were $63,000 plus the

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.820
$40,000 I paid the guy.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.880
So, actually, the entire cost of
the operation was $103,000.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.780
So I actually lost more than
$40,000 running my little

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.870
website business.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.070
So opportunity costs represent
the fact that you could have

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.820
done other things with
your resources.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.450
It's not just the fact
that your cash flow

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:44.680
said positive $20,000.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.330
Your economic flow said
minus $43,000.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.770
Because while you're plus
$20,000, you were minus

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.360
$60,000 that you could
have earned.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.380
Now you're down to
minus $40,000.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.830
You're minus $2,000 that you
could have earned in interest

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.350
on the money you paid
the programmer.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.740
Now you're down to
minus $42,000.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.465
And you're down another minus
$1,000 you could have made by

00:25:59.465 --> 00:26:00.890
selling that computer.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.730
So you're at minus $43,000.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.190
So you actually lost money.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.770
So when we talk about profit,
we want to think about

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.680
economic profit, not
accounting profit.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.850
Now, I'm not going to make that
distinction much now.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.230
But I want you to keep that in
mind as you go out and think

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.740
about starting your business or
think about whether firms

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.710
are profitable, remember we use
an economic concept which

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.640
accounts for opportunity cost,
not just an accounting concept

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.740
which follows the dollars.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.660
Question about that?

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:27.940
OK.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.090
Now, armed with this, we now
say, OK, how does a firm

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.660
maximize profits?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.680
Well, that's easy.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.450
We say that profits is a
function of quantity produced.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.960
Revenues is a function of
quantity produced minus cost

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.420
as a function of quantity
produced.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.260
Remember, what was our goal when
we laid out the start of

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.070
this lecture?

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.790
It was to figure out what
little q a firm chooses.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.640
Well, what little q a firm
chooses is dictated by

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.950
maximizing this equation.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:27:02.140
So a firm will choose little q
such that dR/dq equals dC/dq.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.550
That's the profit maximizing
equation.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.680
A firm will choose its quantity
such that dR/dq

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:15.490
equals dC/dq or, to put it in
economic terms, where marginal

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.190
revenue equals marginal costs.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.110
The firm will choose to produce
a quantity q where its

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:26.200
marginal revenue, which is the
revenue made from selling the

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.160
next unit, equals it's marginal
cost, which is the

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.860
cost incurred by making
the next unit.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:38.100
Well, in a competitive market,
we know what dR/dq is.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.360
Because remember in a
competitive market, dR/dq is

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.380
given to the firm
by the market.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.590
In a competitive market, dR/dq,
or marginal revenue,

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.520
equals the price.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.610
The price is given
to the firm.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.600
It comes from God in the
competitive market.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.820
We'll talk later about
where it comes from.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.890
But, for now, let's
consider it God.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.610
They're price takers.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.410
They just get some price
handed to them.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.950
So in a competitive market, we
know what marginal revenue is,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:01.850
it is price.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.740
So what this says is that in a
competitive market, the profit

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.190
maximizing equation is price
equals marginal cost. Memorize

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.800
it, put it under your pillow.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.970
In a competitive market, price
equals marginal cost is the

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.840
profit maximizing condition.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.370
You will produce until the
marginal cost of producing the

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.350
next unit is equal to the price
you can sell that unit

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.600
for in the market.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.960
So, to see that further, let's
look at an example.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:37.390
Let's go to the next figure,
Figure 10-2a.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.260
For the next few examples,
I'm going to use a

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.070
particular cost function.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.440
The cost function I'm going to
use to make this all concrete

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:54.320
is C equals 10 plus
0.5q squared.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.470
That's the cost function
I'm going to use.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:03.040
So armed with that cost
function, let's say the price

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.310
in the market is 6.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.010
Let's say the price
in the market 6.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:10.650
I just pulled that
out of my hat.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.640
It's a market for whatever.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.340
We're just doing an example.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.340
Now, what we have on this graph,
we have a cost curve

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.790
and a revenue curve.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.010
The cost curve literally
graphs that function.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:26.290
So, in other words, if you
produce two units, then your

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:30.440
cost is 10 plus half
of 2 squared or 12.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.060
If you produce 2 units, your
costs are 12, and so on.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.570
You've got this cost curve.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.190
You've also got a
revenue curve.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.860
Well, the revenue curve is just
6 times the number of

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.360
units produced.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.930
Because the price
per unit is 6.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:47.150
So it's just a straight line
with a slope of 6.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.090
So each unit you produce,
you make 6.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:59.800
Now, what you'll see here is
that for this cost curve,

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.290
what's marginal cost?

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.970
Well, if we differentiate this,
we see that marginal

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.380
cost equals q.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.880
I made this an easy example.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.230
If you differentiate that,
you'll see that

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.130
marginal cost equals q.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.780
That is just differentiate
this cost equation.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.400
Marginal cost equals q.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:22.520
So what that says is that the
profit maximizing point is

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.640
going to be to set marginal
cost equal to price.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.640
So that says set
q equal with 6.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.080
And you're done.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.460
That's how much the firm
should produce.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.650
The firm should produce six
units, because it's marginal

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.250
cost function is q.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.950
It's a linear function.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:44.940
The price is six.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.030
That's a horizontal line.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:51.920
So they only intersect in one
point where quantity equals 6.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.110
Now, what you notice in this
graph is that this happens to

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.400
be the point where the gap
between the revenue curve and

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.280
the cost curve is largest. These
are not marginal curves.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.200
This is revenue and cost. But
notice that at 6 that's

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.770
exactly where the revenue curve
and the cost curve have

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.800
the largest gap between them.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.160
I think a more intuitive way
to see this is to flip to

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.660
Figure 10-2b.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.030
This shows the marginal profit
that you make on

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.510
every unit you sell.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.860
So, in other words, if you sell
fewer than 2 units, you

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.050
lose money.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:29.690
Why?

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:36.040
Because if you sell 1 unit, your
costs are 10 plus 10.5.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.220
If you sell 1 unit, your
costs are 10.5.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.420
Your revenues are 6.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.400
You lose money.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.150
You lose 4.5.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.320
If you sell 2 units,
you make 0.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.730
Your costs are 12, your
revenues are 12.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.440
You make 0.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:54.120
If you sell 3 units, your
costs are 14.5, 10

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.130
plus half of 9.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.570
Your revenues are 18.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.460
So you make money.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.020
So each unit, you can calculate
how much you're

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.620
making on that next unit.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.780
On the 3rd unit,
you made money.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.340
4th unit, you make
even more money.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.270
5th unit, even more.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.230
6th unit, you make the most
money you can make.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:17.290
In the 6th unit, your costs
are 10 plus half of

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:21.240
36, or 18, so 28.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.690
Your costs are 28.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.390
Your revenues are 36.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.610
So you make a profit of 8.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.860
You make a profit of
8 on that 6th unit.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.870
Think of yourself as
climbing this hill.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.730
In economics, optimization is
a hill climbing exercise.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.820
Think of yourself as climbing
up this hill and asking

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.460
yourself, should I make
the next unit?

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.800
Does the hill keep going up?

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.610
Yes, it keeps going up.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.120
Make that next unit.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.090
Then you get to the top.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.070
And now you say, well, should
I make the 7th unit?

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.560
Well if I make a 7th unit,
my costs are 10 plus

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.550
half of 49, so 34.5.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.410
My revenues are 42.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:03.220
So my profits are only 7.5.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.810
I make less profit
on that 7th unit.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.910
So I shouldn't make it.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:11.240
Now, you might say,
wait a second.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.790
Why wouldn't you make it?

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.830
You still make profits.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.340
Why wouldn't you go ahead and
make all units all the way

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.050
down to 10?

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.330
You still make profits
on those units.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.670
And the answer is because of
opportunity cost. The answer

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.260
is that yes, you make profits.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.850
But given where your marginal
cost curve is, you could do

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.440
better by that point going and
producing other goods.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.220
That's why I care about
accounting costs versus

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.310
opportunity costs.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.050
Accounting costs says look,
you're going to make money

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.960
until you go to 10 units.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.460
But opportunity cost says, no.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.000
At that point, the opportunity
cost has gotten high enough

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.300
that you could do
better devoting

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.980
your resources elsewhere.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.075
And that's why you want to stop
at the point where you're

00:33:58.075 --> 00:34:00.810
at the top of the hill, where
the price equals the marginal

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.250
cost.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.540
So what are the profits you make
at the top of this hill?

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.830
Well, if you go to the next
diagram, we can see what the

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.719
profits you make are.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:17.659
So this next diagram,
Figure 10-3,

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.600
illustrates this example.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.030
So what we have here is an
example with cost curves for

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:26.290
this cost function, once again,
10 plus 0.5q squared.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:30.389
Average costs is that line
in the middle there.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.260
That's the average costs.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.560
You have an average variable
cost that's a line, that's

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.350
linear, an average variable cost
that has a slope of one.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.730
You have an average fixed cost
that's everywhere declining,

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.969
because your fixed costs of 10
is everywhere declining.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:46.000
As you produce more
and more, your

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.120
fixed costs are declining.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.409
And, as I said, you have
a marginal cost of q.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.389
So your marginal cost
of 1 unit is 1.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:57.420
Your marginal cost of 2
units is 2, et cetera.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.290
So this draws out the cost
curves that correspond to that

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.200
cost function.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.280
You see them drawn out here.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.090
Now, we also, on this diagram,
have a demand curve.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.910
The demand curve is perfectly
elastic facing this firm.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.530
It's a perfectly competitive
market.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:20.030
And that perfectly elastic
demand curve is horizontal at

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.520
price equals 6.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.780
So what does the firm do?

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:33.720
It chooses to produce where
marginal cost equals price.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.710
When it produces where marginal
cost equals price,

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.810
then what profits
does it make?

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.670
On each unit, it makes a
difference of the profits

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.870
between the price and average
cost. Now it's an important

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:54.780
distinction.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.090
We went over this in lecture
and section.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.490
But let me go through
it again.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.420
Marginal cost is the cost
of the next unit.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.265
Average cost is the average
cost of all the

00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:04.040
units you've made.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.240
So if I make 6 units, what
profit do I make?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:15.740
Well, on that 6th unit, I
make a profit of 1 and

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:25.700
1/8 or 1 and 1/4.

00:36:31.925 --> 00:36:36.380
I make profits of 1 and
1/4 on that 6th unit.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:41.020
But I make those profits
on all 8 units I sell.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.770
So what that means is, in total,
I'm going to make a

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:45.970
profit of 8.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.330
The area of this rectangle
is eight.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:50.790
Here's the key.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.900
You cannot choose a production
level that produces a bigger

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.270
rectangle than this.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:59.970
So if you produce 7, your
rectangle will be longer.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.910
But the gap between price and
average cost will be smaller.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:07.240
So your total rectangle
size would fall.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.580
The largest rectangle
is produced at a

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.390
production level of 6.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.610
That's the most efficient use of
your resources is when you

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.790
produce at a point where
marginal cost equals price.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:21.060
Because when you produce at
marginal cost equals price,

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.620
that causes the maximum gap
between price and average

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.020
cost.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.150
Flip back for a second
to the first figure.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.380
Not the first figure,
I'm sorry, 10-2.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.170
This relates back to 10-2.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.510
As I noted, the largest
difference between your

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:45.110
revenue and your cost curve
was that 6 units.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:47.510
That's where the gap is large
between revenue and cost.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.770
That's where you produce.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.510
Now we flip forward again
to Figure 10-3.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:56.930
You see that corresponds to the
point of the largest gap

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:05.790
between price and average cost,
I'm sorry, the largest

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:09.260
of the points on the marginal
cost curve between price and

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.100
average cost. So if you produce
on the marginal cost

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:17.460
curve, if you produce 7 units,
then you're going to have a

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.500
smaller gap between price and
average cost. And, therefore,

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.100
even though you produced 1
more unit and are making

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.830
profit on it, your total
profits will fall.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:29.090
The key point is that yes,
climbing back down that hill I

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.420
still make money.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.670
But I make less and
less money.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.670
And that, as a result, that
rectangle is being reduced as

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.230
I climb down that hill.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.920
That rectangle is maximized
at the top of that hill.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.680
That's the point at which
I make the most money.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:54.750
So that's why we say profit
maximization occurs at the

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.970
point where price equals
marginal cost. Because that is

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:01.360
the point of greatest gap
between revenues and costs.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.910
Where price equals marginal cost
is one of the greatest

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.220
gaps between revenues
and costs.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.490
That's the profit maximizing
point where that rectangle is

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.260
largest. And you can demonstrate
for yourself, and

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.030
you should, that at any other
production level, that

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.970
rectangle will be smaller.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:14.880
Questions about that?

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.820
Yeah.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.856
AUDIENCE: What do you
do if you have

00:39:17.856 --> 00:39:19.110
a linear cost function.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.460
So that means marginal
cost is a constant.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.960
Then how do you determine
the line?

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.210
PROFESSOR: You don't.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.590
It's an indeterminacy.

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.490
That's right.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.170
I'll try to avoid giving
you problems like that.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.340
Basically you get a
corner solution.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.890
In a perfectly competitive
market, you'd get an

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:36.920
indeterminate solution.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.460
In a nonperfectly competitive
market, you will have a

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.900
determinant solution.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.610
But in a perfectly competitive
market with a linear marginal

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:44.180
cost, you'd have an
indeterminate solution.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.230
Either you produce
0 or infinity.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.700
So you'd have an indeterminate
solution.

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:54.230
Now, just a further drill this
in, imagine, for a second,

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:57.140
there was a cost shock
to the firm.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.110
Imagine there was a cost
shock to the firm.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:03.590
Imagine that there's a tax on
the firm where the firm has to

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.170
pay a tax of an amount t.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.590
Let's say t is $1.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:13.740
The firm has to pay a tax of $1
on every unit they produce.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.880
Well, what is their
new cost curve?

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.960
Somebody tell me what the
new cost curve is.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.640
If you have a tax of $1 on
every unit you produce,

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.020
someone tell me the equation
for the cost curve.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.440
I didn't write it down
here, did I?

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:24.890
No.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.590
OK, what's the equation
for the cost curve.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:28.320
Yeah.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.160
AUDIENCE: Just add plus
tq to the top thing.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:40.840
PROFESSOR: Exactly C equals 10
plus 0.5q squared plus tq.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.660
Because for every unit you
produce q you pay a tax t.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:46.550
And since t is $1, it would
just be plus q.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:49.140
If t is $1, it would
just be plus q.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.760
So the cost function
has now shifted.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.660
So what we see is that it has
shifted average cost and

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.120
marginal cost both upwards.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.520
Average cost has shifted
upwards by that amount.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.870
And average cost has
shifted upwards.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.950
And marginal cost has shifted
upwards by precisely $1.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.590
It's just a linear shift of
marginal cost. Because

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:15.380
marginal cost is now q plus 1.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.160
If you differentiate this with
respect to q assuming t is 1--

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.350
t is now $1--

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.500
if you differentiate this with
respect to q, marginal

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.320
cost is q plus 1.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.060
So your marginal cost curve has
shifted up by $1 or by t,

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.790
in this case, in the
more general case.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:36.570
Well, what does that do to the
first production decision.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.910
Well, now it doesn't change
their maximization formula.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.410
They still want to set marginal
cost equal to price.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.730
So now they say, set q plus
1 equal to price.

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.590
Well, the price is 6.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.100
So it says set q equal to 5.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:58.450
Now the profit maximizing
level is 5 units.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.600
The profit maximizing
level is 5 units.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:07.450
What this is saying is because
the tax increases your

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:11.970
marginal cost, you are
now producing less.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.310
And what we can see now, if we
flip to Figure 10-4, we can

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.260
see what that's done
to your profits.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:24.580
Your profits have now fallen to
the dotted rectangle, the

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.750
much smaller dotted rectangle.

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:29.900
Your profits used to be
that entire slashed

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.160
rectangle plus the dots.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.800
Now your profits are just
where the price exceeds

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.690
average cost which is just that
smaller dotted rectangle.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.690
Your profits have fallen
dramatically.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:47.140
So by imposing a tax on this
firm, we've dramatically

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.390
reduced their profits.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:56.870
Now, this is the economics
behind why taxes can lower

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:58.960
production.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.910
Now, you might say,
wait a second.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:02.830
In reality, if we tax a
firm, the don't have

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:03.260
to lower their profits.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.290
They just pass it on and charge
consumers higher prices

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.550
but not in a competitive
market.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.660
In a competitive market,
they can't do that.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.896
If you tax a firm in a
competitive market, it comes

00:43:15.896 --> 00:43:17.146
out of their profits.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.015
Because they face a perfectly
elastic demand, so they can't

00:43:22.015 --> 00:43:23.020
raise the price.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.360
All they can do is just say,
well, the price is the same.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.920
My marginal cost has gone up.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.870
I'm going to produce less, and
I'm going to make less profit.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:31.900
And that's life.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.390
So a tax in a market like this
is just going to lower the

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.710
firm's profits, and it's going
to lower their level of

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.210
production from 6 to 5.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:40.882
In noncompetitive markets,
different things can happen.

00:43:40.882 --> 00:43:42.000
We'll talk about that.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.320
But in a competitive market,
this is what

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.710
happens with the tax.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.260
You basically set the new
marginal cost equal to price,

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.940
and you get that they produce
5 units instead of 6 at a

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.630
lower profit level.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.592
Yeah?

00:43:53.592 --> 00:43:54.772
AUDIENCE: Would that
be a good cause for

00:43:54.772 --> 00:43:56.424
entering the market--

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.040
PROFESSOR: You're right.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.530
That's an excellent point that
I should have pointed out.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:04.770
What do I mean by short run?

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.420
What I mean by short run is
remember, labor is variable.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.470
Capital is fixed.

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:09.650
What do I mean in
this context?

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.510
Think about the short run as
being the period over time

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.035
over which firms cannot
enter and exit.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.450
When we talk about competitive
markets in the short run, we

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.550
talked about short run
being the time in

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:21.780
which capital is fixed.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.190
Now we're going to add
another condition.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.090
We're going to say the short run
is the period of time in

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:31.830
which there's no firm
entry or exit.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:32.520
That's the short run.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.730
We'll come back and talk about
what entry and exit does.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.510
And that's going to have
some funky effects.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.000
We'll talk about
that next time.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.920
But what we mean by short
run here is no

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.680
firm entry and exit.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.510
Whichever firms are in the
market at the beginning of the

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.040
short run people are in the
market at the end of the short

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:46.430
run period.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:47.315
Yeah.

00:44:47.315 --> 00:44:49.343
AUDIENCE: But in your
conditions, you had like free

00:44:49.343 --> 00:44:51.250
and fluid entry and
exit of firms.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:51.910
PROFESSOR: Right, exactly.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:54.810
And that's why I said, don't
pay attention to that yet.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.190
In some sense, those are the
conditions of perfect

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:56.670
competition.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.090
I didn't say if that was
short run or long run.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:00.270
Those are the full long
run set of conditions.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.220
That's why I said we're going
to ignore four for now and

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.530
just focus on the first three.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:05.720
In the short run, only the
first three are relevant.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.790
Because in the short run there's
no firm entry or exit.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:09.670
In the long run, which we'll
talk about next time, that

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.020
fourth one will be relevant.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:12.720
Good question.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.320
That's a good point.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.830
Thank you for pointing
that out.

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:17.400
Other questions or comments?

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.240
One other thing I want to cover
before we stop which

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.970
relates to the long run, is that
in the long run, this is

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.340
sort of the transition,
the bridge to talking

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.840
about the long run.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.570
We also have to decide,
ultimately, whether or not we

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.730
want to shut the firm down.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.890
So, in other words, we want to
set price equal to marginal

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:38.530
cost. That's one condition.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.710
But, actually, short run profit
maximization has a

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.040
second condition.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.720
Short run profit maximization
has two conditions.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.190
The first is to set price equal
to marginal cost. The

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.490
second condition of short run
profit maximization is to

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.920
check whether the firm
wants to shut down.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.170
Why would a firm want
to shut down?

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.080
It might want to shut down if
it actually loses money by

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.330
continuing to produce.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:12.540
And that's because firms may
lose money but not shut down.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.600
Firms may lose money
but not shut down.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.090
Or firms may lose so much
money they shut down.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.520
And we need to consider that.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.700
Let's get rid of the tax.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.390
Let's go back to the marginal
cost with the tax.

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:28.040
Imagine the price in this
market suddenly

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.560
fell from 6 to 3.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.350
The price of the market is
now $3 per unit you sell.

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:37.835
Well what would the
firm's profits be?

00:46:37.835 --> 00:46:42.060
Well, if the price fell to 3,
the firm would choose to

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.790
produce 3 units.

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:46.480
You would still have this
condition, marginal cost

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:46.970
equals price.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.580
Price is 3, and marginal
cost is q.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:49.960
So q is 3.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.650
You still produce 3 units.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.970
If you produce 3 units,
its costs are 10 plus

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:58.530
4.5 which is 14.5.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.250
At a price of 3, it makes 9.

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:05.360
So its profits are
negative 5.5.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.370
It would lose money from
this production.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.640
Remember marginal cost
equals price.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.160
That doesn't vary with what
the price is or anything.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.680
This is a maximizing
condition.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.770
If a price changed, it's not
like you change which equation

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:23.080
you follow.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.500
You always follow
this equation.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.800
The efficient production level
is always marginal cost equals

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.330
price regardless of
what the price is.

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:31.800
So if the price is 3, the
efficient thing to do would be

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.710
to produce 3 units
and lose money.

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.610
Now, you might say, well,
then that's stupid.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:41.300
If that goes negative, wouldn't
they just shut down?

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.070
And the answer, is in
the short run, no.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.530
And the reason you wouldn't shut
down in the short run is

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:51.270
what I talked about last time
which is about the notion of

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:53.680
sunk costs.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.350
In the short run, the fixed
costs that you paid

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:58.830
to produce are sunk.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.560
They're unchangeable
in the short run.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.040
In the long run, they're
changeable.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.390
You can just leave.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:06.430
But in the short run, you've
invested fixed costs of 10 in

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:07.600
being in this market.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.520
You've paid a fixed cost of 10
to produce in this market.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:17.200
Given you're in this market, and
you've paid 10 to produce,

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.010
you will not exit unless
you lose more than $10.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:27.670
You will not shut down unless
you lose more than $10.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:30.480
You will not shut down unless
you're losing so much money

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.510
that you can't cover
your fixed costs.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.380
Because you've paid those fixed
cost. In the short run,

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.280
they're sunk.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.180
So unless you're actually losing
more than your fixed

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:44.740
costs, you will not shut
down your firm.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.770
OK.

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:47.145
This is actually pretty
confusing, and

00:48:47.145 --> 00:48:47.680
we're out of time.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.410
So what I'm going to do is we'll
pick it up on Monday

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:51.870
exactly at this point.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.670
And I'll go through some more
of the intuition for this.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:56.180
And that will be our segue for
talking long run profit

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.710
maximization which we'll
talk about on Monday.

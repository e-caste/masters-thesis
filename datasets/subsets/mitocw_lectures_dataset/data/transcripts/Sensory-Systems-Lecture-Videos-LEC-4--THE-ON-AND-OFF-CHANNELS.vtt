00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.490
PROFESSOR: All right,
so now today, the topic

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.930
we are going to discuss will
be the ON and OFF channels

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.230
in the retina.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.420
I will provide you
with a brief overview

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.250
again of what we have
covered before about this,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.640
and then will go on and
look at this in some depth.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.590
Now before I start
on that, let me just

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.120
very briefly mention again
that the syllabus-- which

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.390
all of you I presume have.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.420
If any of you doesn't have
a syllabus-- any one of you

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.330
doesn't have a syllabus,
we can provide one for you.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.290
What I would like to
encourage all of your

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.450
again is that you do this
so-called preparatory

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.630
reading that appears
for each session, which

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.970
will make it easier
for you to follow,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.190
and consequently, also
memorize the basic facts

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.950
that we are going
to be dealing with.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.320
Alright, so therefore let me get
started with the so-called ON

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.970
and OFF channels.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.750
And what I would like
to do first of all

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.970
is to tell you what are the
major questions we are going

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.420
to pose in dealing with
this very-- to me at least--

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.080
very interesting question
of the ON and OFF channels.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.990
The first prime question
you're going to ask

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.295
is why did the ON and
OFF channels evolve?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.650
What is their function?

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.600
As I've already
indicated before,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.100
it is rather complicated to
have created these two channels,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.960
and therefore there
must have been

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.590
a great deal of evolutionary
pressures to accomplish this.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.130
So that's the prime
question we're going to ask.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.040
Now more specifically
we're going

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.600
to ask how the
rods and the cones

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.680
are involved in the creation
of the ON and OFF channels.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.960
And then you're going to
ask how do the ON and OFF

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.040
channels contribute
to the center

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.340
and surround organization
of retinal ganglion cells,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.080
because this has been a big
issue among many investigators

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.580
over the past 20 or so years.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.160
Then you're going to ask what
role do these channels play

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.295
in giving rise to the
transforms that we had discussed

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:54.780
the last time in visual cortex.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.550
And lastly we're
going to ask what

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.160
are the consequences of
blocking the ON channel

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.705
on neuronal activity
and on perception.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.810
And this last
question then will be

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.710
successful in answering
several of the questions

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.650
that we pose as to why we have
these curious arrangement of ON

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.460
and OFF channels in the retina.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.000
All right.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.360
So now let me first of all talk
about the neuronal responses--

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.850
sorry-- of the ON and OFF
retinal ganglion cells.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.890
First of all, if you
remember, I told you

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.830
that back in the 19th
century, Keffer Hartline

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.510
was the first to record
from single neurons

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.430
by dissecting single
fires in the optic nerve.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.720
And then what he did-- he
shone light into the eye.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.740
And then subsequently--
especially when

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.210
I talked the last time
about Hubel and Wiesel--

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.010
what was done is to
use reflected light.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.720
And most currently we
using reflected light

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.490
by presenting images on
a computer monitor facing

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.100
the animal or the
human we are studying.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.610
Now when Keffer
Hartline did this

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.700
by shining light
into the eye, he

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.860
noticed that there are some
says which are called ON cells,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.670
some cells that are OFF
cells, and some cells which

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.490
are both ON and OFF.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.040
Now his idea at that time
was, using that method,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.570
that ON cells discharge
when a stimulus came on

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.430
in the visual
field, and OFF cells

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.430
signaled their termination.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.080
That was his idea,
and that's why

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.635
I call them ON and OFF cells.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.420
So subsequently, especially when
reflected the light was used,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.130
a different view had
emerged as to what

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.030
might be the reason for
having these kinds of cells.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.600
And this was further enhanced
by the beautiful findings

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.720
of Kuffler, when he
noticed that there

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.000
was center-surround
organization in these cells

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.280
at the so-called ON,
OFF, and ON/OFF cells

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.110
responded vigorously
when a light was

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.560
shown into the center,
but responded less

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.580
when the light shown
into the surround.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.160
So then people began to do
all kinds of experiments

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.360
to try to study this in
further detail, and one of them

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.310
was to use reflected light,
either by using a projector

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.550
or by using a color monitor.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.020
And when they did that-- I'm
going to show this to you

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.640
schematically-- they
found that if you

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.740
had a certain lit background
like we have here,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.770
you could present the
stimulus either by virtue

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.712
of light increment or by
virtue of light decrement.

00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:43.000
And as I had mentioned
to you before,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.740
the visual system
is dramatically

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.860
different from the other
senses that we have in

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:54.330
that we need to be able to see
dark stimuli in a background,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.500
like letters on a page, as well
as light incremental stimuli.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.530
And so this idea then,
if it's selected that way

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.080
schematically, looks like this.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.870
An ON cell will fire
vigorously when a bright spot

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.300
appears in the center, and
will not fire to a dark spot.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.720
If anything, it'll be
slightly inhibited.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.450
OK?

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.910
By contrast, when you look at
an OFF cell, you get inverse.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.945
It fires vigorously.

00:06:21.945 --> 00:06:26.030
If you would, it gets
excited by a dark spot.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.090
It gets excited by the
detriment in light illumination.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.780
Now if you did the same thing
using a much larger spot

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.040
of light-- that is shown
here-- what you see here

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.750
is that the
center-surround antagonism

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.760
that we talked
about fully applies

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.540
to this kind of stimulation
conditions as well.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.890
Use a large spot, bright
spot, or dark spot

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.100
and you see that
the over responses

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.300
of the cells-- the responses
are much more limited than when

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.750
you confine the simulation
to the center, only

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.710
further emphasizing
this important fact

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.150
about center-surround
antagonism--

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.860
this incredible increasing
complexity of the organization

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.120
of neurons that you see
already in the retina.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.290
OK, so now we are
going to next look

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.550
at the anatomy of the ON
and OFF ganglion cells.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.880
And as we look at these various
ways of studying the ON and OFF

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.200
channels, we are gradually
going to understand

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.830
what these two systems
are really for.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:41.050
So the first thing is to use
this method that I had also

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.630
already described, namely that
you can record intracellularly

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.610
from a cell, understand
its functional responses,

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.380
and then you can inject
a label, and then

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.040
you can process
that anatomically

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.570
to see what it looks like.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.760
So when this was done, a
very interesting new finding

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.190
had emerged, which
is depicted here.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.350
Here we have the
photoreceptors--

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.810
just the tail end of
them, if you will-- that

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.510
connect to the bipolar cells.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.340
Two bipolar cells are shown.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.060
And then they project into the
inner plexiform layer, which

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.840
we often just refer
to as IPL, which

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.420
is subdivided into
two parts-- A and B.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.559
And it was shown that
the majority of cells

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:37.299
arborize in either one or the
other of these two sublamina

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.495
in the inner plexiform layer.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.500
But there were also some
cells, which is not shown here,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.360
that had arborization
in both of these lamina,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.570
and that's to
anticipate actually

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.090
the property of those cells,
which are called the ON/OFF

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.200
cells.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.960
Now furthermore, it was found--
because these cells were

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.840
labeled after recording--
that the cells that arborized

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.980
in subliminal A, or the
inner plexiform layer,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.260
were so-called OFF cells,
and those that arborized

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.860
in subliminal B,
like this one here,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.490
and this one here, and this
one here, were ON cells.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.690
OK?

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.710
So there was a distinct
spatial segregation

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.350
into the lamina of those
retinal ganglion cells that

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.470
were ON and OFF, and
also furthermore,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.570
those that were
ON/OFF because they

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.870
had arborization
in both of them.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.890
So that was the basic finding.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.350
Now when that was
discovered, people

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.930
went on and asked
the question, what

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.050
is the spacial
arrangement of these cells

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.320
on the retinal
surface, if you will.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:58.980
And so experiments were done
in which cells were labeled,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.120
in most cases with
the Golgi stain,

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.850
and then the retina was looked
at head on with a microscope.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.960
Now the interesting thing
about a microscope is,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.610
which all of you
I'm sure know, is

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.220
that the higher
the magnification

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:18.670
that you use, the shorter
the focus of the microscope.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.920
And in fact, what
you can do here

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.490
is when you look
at his head I like

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:28.690
that, if you can focus either
in sublamina A or sublamina B,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.260
and if you do that, since
we had gotten these results,

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:39.180
you know that whatever focuses
into sublamina A would be OFF

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.340
cells, and whatever
comes into focus

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.590
and the [INAUDIBLE] is
coming to focus in B,

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.710
would be the ON cells.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.320
So then what was
done by a fellow

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.190
called Heinz Wesley is
he asked a question, what

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.960
is the spacial
arrangement of these two?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.120
Do they respect
each other, or what?

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.870
And so when he did that,
here is a good example

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.090
of what that looks like.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.840
Here we have labeled both the
ON and OFF cells using the two

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.822
depth of [INAUDIBLE],
and you can

00:11:09.822 --> 00:11:11.280
see they're kind
of helter skelter.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.960
Then if he focus deeper, he
focus only in the ON cells.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.230
It looks like a they're
very, very nicely arranged,

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.470
and that's also true
for the OFF cells.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.600
And they respect each other.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.580
Looking at the dendritic
arbors, there's

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.030
a little overlap among
the dendrites themselves

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.330
of the cells.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.380
So what's this then said is that
the ON cells respect each other

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.680
but don't seem to give a
damn about the OFF cells.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.170
And the reverse applied
to the OFF cells.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:43.190
OK?

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.325
So as if there were two
independent entities.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.165
So that was a very
interesting finding.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.250
And so that was one of
the initial cues saying

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.950
that these ON and OFF
cells do different things,

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:02.950
and each is a devoted
entity to what it does.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:08.050
All right so now to understand
this even better, let's go back

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.380
and take a brief overview
of the retinal connections

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.990
so we can understand how
these systems came about.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:20.080
And the first thing to do is
to talk about the photoreceptor

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.750
basics.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.530
And I told you many times--
by now I'm sure all of you

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.026
know that already-- that all
photoreceptors hyperpolarize

00:12:27.026 --> 00:12:28.230
to light.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:34.320
Then I also told you when
photoreceptors depolarize--

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.915
that's when they release
their neurotransmitter, which

00:12:36.915 --> 00:12:38.190
is glutamate.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.530
And that glutamate acts on
both the horizontal cells

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.100
and the bipolar cells.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.890
And then furthermore, just
to look in the details--

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.499
this you don't need to remember
exactly in these words-- photon

00:12:50.499 --> 00:12:52.790
absorption by the photopigment
results in isomerization

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.490
of the chromophore from
11-cis to all-trans.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.990
To all-trans this causes
hyperpolarization, thereby

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.280
reducing
neurotransmitter release.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.040
But what you do need to
remember is the next step,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.120
which says the same thing
in much simpler words.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.340
It says that the two
classes of bipolars,

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.240
the ON and the OFF, synaptic
junction of the OFF bipolars

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.710
is sign conserving, and
that of the ON bipolars

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.600
is sign inverting.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.250
And so as I've told you the
last time, as you hyperpolarize

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.610
and depolarize
the photoreceptor,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.520
an OFF bipolar cell does
the same thing like this,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.300
but the ON bipolar
does the opposite, OK?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.020
So you created a
two-ended system--

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.603
a double-ended system, if you
will-- from a single-ended one

00:13:37.603 --> 00:13:39.103
that you have in
the photoreceptors.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.790
Now, yet another fact that
is important to remember

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.430
is that the ON bipolar
cell receptor is mGluR6.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:55.770
That is a specific molecule
that exists in most animals,

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:00.710
only in the retina, created
anew in the course of evolution,

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.870
indicating what
considerable pressure there

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.650
had to be able to
have an ON system.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.940
And lastly I should add here
also that the OFF bipolar

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:15.530
receptors are mGlueR1 and 2
and they follow, pretty much,

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.000
the way the
photoreceptors respond,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.850
which means that
their activation leads

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.070
to the opening of channels,
causing depolarization.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.270
And of course you all know
that-- I should restate maybe

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.150
once more-- that when neurons
in the retina that had greater

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.100
potentials, when
they depolarize,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.820
neurotransmitters released.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.280
When they hyperpolarize,
they do not release them.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.110
In anything, they
stop releasing them.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.610
OK.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:50.040
So now let's look at this wiring
again in more graphic detail.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.905
Here we have a cone.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.630
And the fact is that
in central retina,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.680
each cone connects with at
least two bipolar cells.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.170
So in other words, in the
retina there are many, many more

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.090
bipolars than there
are photoreceptors,

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.240
which is amazing if you
think about the numbers.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.010
I don't know if you
remember the numbers.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:17.640
I told you there are more than
50 million cones, and maybe

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.470
150 million rods, in the retina.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.620
So the retina is an
unbelievably complex structure

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.645
with millions and millions
and millions of cells.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.460
All right.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.920
So what happens then-- you
create these ON and OFF bipolar

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.835
cells.

00:15:32.835 --> 00:15:36.490
The OFF ones, by virtue are
sign conserving synapse.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.620
The OFF, by virtue, are
sign conserving synapse.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.395
And they connect with two basic
classes of ganglion cells--

00:15:44.395 --> 00:15:46.620
the ON and the OFF.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.850
So the ON and OFF
signals, in large part,

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.310
then are sent
separately, especially

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.200
to the [INAUDIBLE] nucleus.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.000
But let's not forget
that they also

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.430
have the so-called ON/OFF cells.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.120
And many of them actually end
up projecting the colliculus,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.140
as we'll talk about later on.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.120
So this is a very basic wiring.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.980
They can then add here,
as I've already said.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.070
This is sign inverting synapse.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.290
This is sign-conserving
sign conserving synapse.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.950
And then we can add
the fact that we

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:22.700
have horizontal cells that
collect signals going sideways

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.220
on the retinal surface,
thereby creating--

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.700
hypothetically speaking, at
least-- the surround effect,

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.360
although that we will look at
in just a minute in more detail

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.800
because some people had
proposed-- many hypotheses had

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.720
emerged why we have
ON and OFF channels--

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.910
and a lot of the
hypotheses was to create

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.940
this famous
center-surround antagonism

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.580
that you see in the
retinal ganglion cells.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.960
I'll have a model
for that in a minute.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.880
OK, so here we have
the ON and OFF systems.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.510
And again I want
to point out to you

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.880
that they terminate in different
sublamina, the inner plexiform

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.170
layer-- the ON in sublamina
B and the OFF in sublamina A,

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.040
whereas the ON/OFF system
looks something like this.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.240
It has dendritic arbors.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.130
They are ON/OFF ganglion
cell in both layers,

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.690
and connects to both the
ON and the OFF like that.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.930
So that's how you
create these three

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.800
types of cells at the
very simple level.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.700
Now the issue that I
just to referred to

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.710
is how is this surround
mechanism created.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.310
One hypothesis is
that it's created

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:39.150
by virtue of the
horizontal cells

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.510
predominantly, as shown
in this figure, which

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.770
is pretty much what
you had seen before.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:48.900
So the surround is created by
the horizontal cell network.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.700
An alternative hypothesis
that was for a while popular

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.090
was that actually the reason
we have ON or OFF channels

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.590
is to create the surround
antagonism in retinal ganglion

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.355
cells by using this kind
of wiring arrangement.

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:05.910
I'm not going to go
into details about this

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.460
because to anticipate
what I'm going

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:13.180
to tell you is that this model
does not seem to be correct,

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.330
and that of course
is often the case.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.220
We have many, many
different models

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.060
and then one of
our tasks is to try

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.305
to figure out which
one is correct.

00:18:22.305 --> 00:18:23.937
And you know what
often happens is

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.520
that if three models
are correct, well

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.561
there's a fourth one you
didn't even think about.

00:18:27.561 --> 00:18:30.870
So that sometimes
happens, and especially

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.460
when you study the brain.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.000
All right.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.615
So now we are going to move on.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.380
This is, unless you had read
the preparatory material,

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.730
is something that
may puzzle you--

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.170
the effects of APB
on the responses

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.540
of neurons in the visual system.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:55.060
So now I'm going to ask you guys
as to how many of you actually

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.640
know what APB is.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.010
Oh, I see all
these hands raised.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.635
Oh my goodness.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.060
All right.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.860
So nobody knows what the APB is.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.360
That's good.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.770
So that way you are going to
learn something brand new.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.490
But if you get a chance and
read the preparatory material,

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:18.010
then it will be easier for to
remember these many, many facts

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:22.020
that I'm going to try to impart
on you with each lecture.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.120
All right, so APB.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:30.100
APB stands for an
artificial molecule called

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.180
2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:38.192
And to show that to you in
some detail, it is shown here--

00:19:38.192 --> 00:19:39.400
2-amino-4-phosphonobuterate .

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.640
Butyrate-- "ate," as you
know, stands for acid.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.390
OK?

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.100
So this molecule, as I
mentioned to you before,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.690
was invented, if you
will, by Watkins and Evans

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.640
in England, who are
molecular biologists.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:03.600
And their game, as I mentioned,
is to create new molecules--

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.216
and many of which are either
analogs or antagonists

00:20:07.216 --> 00:20:08.090
of neurotransmitters.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.340
Now this is a glutamate
neurotransmitter

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:17.270
that is discharged by many,
many cells in the brain,

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.650
including your photoreceptors.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.650
So this is a variant of that.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:27.530
Now once this molecule
was invented, or created,

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.210
I should say
perhaps, people began

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.250
to ask the question, well
what is this variant?

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.940
What can they do for us?

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.700
And that was the basic
game they all played.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.360
You create molecule after
molecule after molecule,

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.400
and then you test them to
see whether they can tell you

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.610
something useful in
studying the brain.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.160
And it turns out that there's--
I've mentioned before also--

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.480
most of those molecules you
can throw into the waste paper

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.370
basket.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.710
But the few of them come out
and become very, very useful.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.460
And this one here--
that's the reason

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.290
I'm mentioning it to
you-- this APB turned out

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.560
to be a magic bullet.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.860
First of all-- you
should remember this--

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.290
that this a
neurotransmitter analog.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:23.360
So what happens is in a
way it acts like glutamate,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:29.270
but it acts really specifically
on the neurotransmitter

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.230
sites of the ON bipolar cells.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:41.180
And what it does-- it
fills the receptor site,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.310
which then makes those
neurons insensitive

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.045
to subsequent light stimulation.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.770
All right?

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.350
So this then is a
remarkable molecule.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.350
And consequently, people began
to do all sorts of experiments.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.450
And it was discovered that
when this substance was applied

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:06.710
to the retina, indeed shining
light into the receptor

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:11.750
fields of cells failed
to elicit a response.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:17.750
But by contrast, when
as part of dark stimulus

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.040
was present in the
receptor field,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.980
the cells continued to fire.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.130
So that was a basic finding,
and so a method was developed

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.490
to study this in the monkey.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.412
And let me show you
what the method is

00:22:30.412 --> 00:22:31.870
so you can get a
sense of what it's

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.740
like to do
experiments like this.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.770
So the method was
to put two tubes

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.640
into the eye of an anesthetized,
paralyzed animal, through one

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.510
of which you could
infuse a substance,

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.785
and through the other which
the substance could exit.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.540
Because if there were no exiting
and you fuse something in here,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.710
the eye would swell
up, so to speak,

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.575
and it would kill
the cells in the eye.

00:22:54.575 --> 00:22:56.740
So you got to circulate it.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.480
So what you have to do also
is to take the vitreous humor

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.180
and make sure that-- you know
that's a jelly-like substance--

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.890
to make it so that it was fluid
enough to come out of this tube

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.130
here, as well.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:17.890
So then you could present to
the eye either a solution that

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.390
had no effect on
anything, because you made

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.430
that solution with enough
molecular substances

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.050
similar to what's in
the vitreous already.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.850
OK?

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.540
And then what you
could do is you

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.050
could switch over using
this same substance

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.510
and add a little bit of APB.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.850
Now APB is a very
powerful substance

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:43.040
so you need only small amounts
of it to have an effect.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.099
And then what you
did is you recorded

00:23:45.099 --> 00:23:46.890
from either the lateral
geniculate nucleus,

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.300
in this case, or from
the optic nerve fibers,

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.450
or from the visual cortex.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.650
And so now you have
this magic bullet,

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.510
and first, however, you want
to determine, is it true.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.370
What has been found originally
in the mutt puppy-- is it also

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.540
true in the monkey?

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.860
If you inject this APB
into the eye of a monkey,

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.980
do you really stop the
responses of ON-center cells

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.206
to view light
visual stimulation,

00:24:16.206 --> 00:24:17.455
light incremental stimulation.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.870
And the answer is lucky
B-- because otherwise I

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.810
wouldn't be telling
you this, of course--

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.280
is that the answer is yes.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.720
So here is an example
of taking a response.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.850
These are cumulative
histograms, OK?

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.760
You've turned the light
on, and then turned it off.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.130
And you can see here's an
ON-center cell responds

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.380
vigorously under
normal conditions.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.210
You put APB into the eye,
the cell stops responding.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.100
And then when the animal
recovers from this,

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.980
you wash it out, so to speak,
then the response returns.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.255
By contrast, we
do same experiment

00:24:52.255 --> 00:24:55.090
in an OFF-center cell,
shown on the right.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.580
You see that the cell
continues to respond

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.445
when you put APB into the eye.

00:24:59.445 --> 00:25:02.130
So this is indeed
a magic bullet,

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.540
which selectively
blocks the ON system,

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.330
and has no significant
effect on the OFF system.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.550
So this then opened
the gates to study

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:19.850
what happens when you do
these kinds of experiments--

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:25.300
in this case, in
monkeys-- to determine

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:31.010
what might be the function
of these two systems.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:37.220
And so this then enabled one
to test the various hypotheses,

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.440
which I had mentioned
to you briefly before.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.910
The first hypothesis
you can ask,

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.520
is it true-- as that model
I've shown you the right--

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.270
that it is interaction
between the ON or OFF systems

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.920
that gives rise to the
center-surround antagonism

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.670
of cells in the retina.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.450
That's one thing you could test.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.020
So to assess that,
let me show you

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.370
what the experimental
procedure is.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.490
What you do here-- here is
a receptive field of a cell.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.290
And in this case, this cell--
the recording is taking place

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.120
in the geniculate-- and
this particular cell

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.980
is one that is color selective.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.020
It responds best to
a small red spot.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.540
And if you hit the surround
with a different color,

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.360
the cell is inhibited.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.270
So the way this is
then done is you

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.070
shine the light on
the center, then

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.480
you shine the light
on the surround,

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.430
and then you're
in the OFF cycle--

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.750
you just hit the surround alone.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:46.390
So this then shown to
you here over time.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.830
Here's a center stimulation.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:48.677
Turn it on.

00:26:48.677 --> 00:26:49.760
Then you hit the surround.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.470
Then you turn it off.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.610
So because-- and
the center stays on,

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:56.270
and during the OFF cycle,
you hit the surround.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.600
So this shows the
exact manner in which

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.191
you turn these on and off.

00:27:01.191 --> 00:27:01.690
All right.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:08.190
So now the big question is,
how do ON- and OFF-center cells

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.185
respond to this
stimulus arrangement.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:17.275
So say you have an ON cell,
which would discharge to this.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.122
Then the response
should decrease

00:27:21.122 --> 00:27:22.580
because of the
surround inhibition.

00:27:23.764 --> 00:27:26.237
And you'll see the
normal response.

00:27:26.237 --> 00:27:27.695
And the question
now-- what's going

00:27:27.695 --> 00:27:32.167
to happen if you put in the APB?

00:27:32.167 --> 00:27:33.875
Well there are a number
of possibilities.

00:27:35.167 --> 00:27:36.750
One is that nothing's
going to happen.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.050
That's unlikely because
I already showed you

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:44.350
that APB blocks the ON
response of the center.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.240
The other possibility
is that you

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.940
lose the center-surround
antagonism, which

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:56.440
would prove that the ON and OFF
systems play a significant role

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.330
in creating
center-surround antagonism.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.830
All right.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.420
So those are some of
the possibilities.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.150
And of course a
third possibility

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:10.366
is that the OFF cells also
lose their surround antagonism,

00:28:10.366 --> 00:28:12.616
although their responses to
the center are unaffected.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.130
So let's take a look at that.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.340
And here are the data
under normal conditions.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.720
This again is the stimulation
arrangement lined up,

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.630
but you can see here
there's a huge response when

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.851
you hit the center
with a red spot,

00:28:29.851 --> 00:28:31.600
and then when you hit
the surround there's

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.230
a huge inhibition.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.680
When you remove that,
the response returns.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.670
And then during the
OFF cycle, there's

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:42.650
some spontaneous activity, but
the surround activation even

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:43.830
stops that.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.105
So there's very strong
center-surround antagonism.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.710
All right.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.390
So now I want you to
guess for a minute.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.890
What do you think
is going to happen

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:53.900
when we inject APB into the eye?

00:28:55.504 --> 00:28:57.420
Think about it for a
minute and I'll tell you.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.910
I listed some of
the alternatives,

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.219
and you can have a
hypothesis of your own

00:29:06.219 --> 00:29:07.510
of what you think might happen.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.933
All right let me show you
what really happened, OK?

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.940
When this happened, actually,
the experimenter thought,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.855
my god, we lost a cell
while we were recording.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.330
But then, subsequently when
the APB was washed out,

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.935
you got the same
response as before.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.360
And so the cell wasn't lost,
but the APB was so effective

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.510
that it stopped the
response of the cell

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.375
completely, both of the
center and to the surround.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.070
And now let's ask the question,
what happens when you do this,

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.740
not to an ON-center cell,
but an OFF-center cell.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.630
Think about it
again for a minute

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.270
and ask what do you
think would happen then.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.030
OK, so here it is.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.560
Here is an OFF-center
ganglion cell.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.081
And it shows here, using the
same stimulus conditions, that

00:30:01.081 --> 00:30:02.580
in this case, because
there's an OFF

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.960
cell, adding the
surround decreases

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.240
the degree of inhibition
turning OFF cycle.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.780
And here again the same
thing is happening.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.160
But the same thing happens
under both normal conditions

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.515
and after APB had been injected.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.560
So what this experiment then
shows-- and of course one

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.490
does this with
many, many cells--

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.440
is to prove that the
hypothesis, that the ON and OFF

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.630
systems play a significant role
in center-surround antagonism,

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.900
is wrong.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.380
And because of that, that
hypothesis has been eliminated.

00:30:38.331 --> 00:30:38.830
All right.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.830
So then we can move on
and ask the next question.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.150
I mean, let me first
draw this up again here.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:45.650
All right.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:49.720
Here we have the
photoreceptors--

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.393
the cone photoreceptors-- the
horizontal cells, and the ON

00:30:52.393 --> 00:30:53.440
and OFF cells.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.190
So this alternative hypothesis,
that the surround inhibition

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.860
is due to horizontal
cells, therefore,

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.285
has gained much
greater acceptance.

00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:05.720
OK.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.580
So now we are going
to move upstairs

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.930
and we're going to go to area V1
where we can ask the question,

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:21.500
well what were the transforms
that we had seen in V1.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.430
I presume all of you remember.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.950
What are the three major
transforms we talked about?

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:28.610
Who remembers?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.980
Come on.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.070
Sure you remember that, don't
you-- that we have cells--

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.205
most of the cells are
orientation specific, right?

00:31:42.205 --> 00:31:43.955
Most of the cells are
direction selective.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.550
And most of the
cells are selective

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.825
for spatial frequency.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.390
So those are three of
the major transforms.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.820
The other two we talked about is
a convergence of the ON and OFF

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.330
channels onto single
cells in the cortex.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:05.280
And the other was that
there was a binocular input

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.155
to many of the cells.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.820
So those were the
major transforms

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.300
we talked about the last time.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.890
And again I want to emphasize
the importance of this

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.560
by telling you that
Hubel received the Nobel

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:24.750
Prize for those discoveries
of how V1 operates.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.760
OK?

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.500
And of course I mentioned
before that Keffer Hartline,

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.320
when he discovered the ON
and OFF systems using light

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.990
that he shown into the eye--
he called them the ON and OFF

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:39.570
cells-- he received the
Nobel Prize as well.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.870
So those are truly, truly
major, major discoveries

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:48.010
and have triggered hundreds
and hundreds of experiments

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.830
trying to understand better.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.080
And certainly one of the
questions that was raised

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.100
is how does orientation,
and direction cell activity,

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.740
and special frequencies
activity, for that matter,

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.650
arise in area of V1.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.810
And one prominent
hypotheses was indeed

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:09.390
that the reason we have
ON and OFF channels

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.050
is to create these transforms
in the visual cortex.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.090
So what we can then
do, now that one

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:21.540
has this magic
bullet of the APB,

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.610
that one can record
from a cortical cell.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:33.140
See how it responds when
you inject APB in contrast

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.990
to before you injected
it and after injected it.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.740
So that's the big question
you're going to ask next.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.310
All right.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:43.880
So here is an example of what
of cortical cell's response

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.150
looks like using this kind of
histogram when a bar of light,

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.380
in this case, is moved
across the receptive field.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.780
Now this is a complex cell.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.966
And you can see it gives
a vigorous response when

00:33:56.966 --> 00:33:58.590
the light edge goes
across, and then it

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.650
gives a vigorous response when
the dark edge goes across.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:05.010
I'm showing this only for
one direction of motion.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.980
So that is a natural response.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.120
So now the question
comes up, what

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.394
happens when you inject
APB into the eye.

00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:16.375
A number of possibilities exist.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.429
The most basic one I think
most of you would buy

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:26.230
is that the light edge response
is produced predominantly

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.600
by the ON channel,
and the dark edge

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.699
response by the OFF channel.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:33.650
And if that is the
case, then this response

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:38.949
should be eliminated by
blocking it with APB in the eye.

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:41.699
And if you do that, that's
exactly what happens.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.060
You can see here under
normal conditions,

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.850
you get a vigorous response
for both light and dark edges.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.270
After APB, only a dark
edge response remains.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.909
So this then established
that these responses

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.890
to the different edges-- the
light edges and dark edges--

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:02.050
are a product of the input from
the retina to the geniculate,

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:06.130
and then to the cortex from the
ON and the OFF channels, which

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:08.450
then converge in
many cortical cells,

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:13.120
as is the case in this
particular cortical cell.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.610
So that then establishes
this very basic fact.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.100
Now the next
question we can ask--

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.310
what about those transforms
you talked about?

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:24.970
Let's first of all
look at the transform

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:28.240
of direction selectivity.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.310
So we can take a cell
that is, in this case,

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.300
directionally biased.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.550
And you can see what
the response is before

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.740
and after APB is injected.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.380
And what you see
here-- we move the bar

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.400
across in one direction, and
then we move the bar back

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.100
across the opposite direction.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.630
So the first half shows
a downward movement--

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.180
the second half,
the upward movement.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.840
Now what you see here
that the cell responds

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.870
is much more vigorous.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:55.990
It's not 100%
direction selective.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.860
I showed you some of
those the last time.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.200
This one is a bias--
about a four to one bias--

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.680
much more response to
the downward movement

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.120
than the upward movement.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.390
But the cell responds both
the light and the dark edge

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.390
in both directions,
and it lines up

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.910
with the temporal
arrangement here,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.410
proving indeed that
this is a complex cell.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.190
Now then when you
inject APB into the eye,

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.440
look what happens.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.680
You eliminate the light
edge response here and here,

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:29.790
but the cell is still
directionally biased.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.570
So direction specificity
was maintained.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.130
And when this was
studied in many,

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:36.870
many, many cells--
even cells that

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:41.320
were 100% direction specific--
blocking the ON channel

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.870
did not eliminate
directionality in the cortex.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.540
So that then indicates that
the ON and OFF channels did not

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:56.390
arise to bring about direction
selectivity in the cortex.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:02.820
And so that brings us
to the second transform,

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.680
which is orientation
specificity.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.280
So we can do that next.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.530
And here we have an example
using a very similar procedure.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.600
Again, a complex cell
when the APB is injected.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.430
The light edge
response disappears.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.220
You move the bar across
the different orientations

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:24.400
and this is the orientation
specificity you get.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.530
Now this is calculated here on
the basis of only the dark edge

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.256
response because you
want to keep it the same

00:37:31.256 --> 00:37:32.380
as you're going to do here.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.160
Since the light edge
response is eliminated,

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.950
you can see that the cells
orientation specificity is also

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:45.910
unaffected, meaning
that the orientation

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:49.880
specificity of
the cortical cells

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.130
is not due to the interaction
between the ON and OFF channel.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.950
Similar experiments were also
done with spatial frequency

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:06.070
selectivity, and again,
no effect was found.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.780
So this then led
to the conclusion

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.830
that the ON and OFF
channels did not

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.940
arise for the purpose of
creating the transforms that we

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:22.910
had denoted in our last
lecture about single cells

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:24.801
in the visual cortex.

00:38:24.801 --> 00:38:25.300
All right.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.140
So now what we can do
is here-- we can come up

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.430
with a silly model, just
to make it memorable,

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.260
which is to say
that the ON and OFF

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.020
channels flow into the cortex.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.760
And these attributes we talked
about-- orientation, direction,

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.740
and spacial frequencies
selectivity--

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.640
are produced by
cortical filters.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.430
What you have in
the cortex are all

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:51.300
kinds of inhibitory interneurons
and the interactions

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.600
among many, many neurons.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.380
And that kind of
activity that you

00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:02.190
get there is the one that
produces these attributes,

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:06.150
not the interaction between
the ON and OFF channels

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.795
that flow into
the visual cortex.

00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:09.960
All right.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:16.400
So now the next
question we can ask,

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:24.790
or what happens on APB under
photopic viewing conditions.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:30.740
We'll talk about scotopic,
as well as photopic, vision.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:42.070
To do this, and to answer how it
affects our visual capacities,

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:48.820
what we do is to turn to
behavioral experiments.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.470
In behavioral experiments,
what you can do

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.740
is you can present
various kinds of stimuli.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.720
You can train a
monkey-- in this case,

00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:02.780
with monkeys-- to see how
well they perceive a stimulus,

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.900
and ask them to make an eye
movement to that stimulus.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:10.290
So when you do
this-- testing that

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:13.550
hypothesis I've shown you
earlier about light increment

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.740
and light decrement--
what we can do

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.650
is to train a monkey
to first fixate.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.700
And then after the
monkey fixated,

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.480
you can present either
a light incremental spot

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.940
or a light decremental spot.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.220
The monkey's task is to make
a saccade to that target.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.670
And of course, those
spots will appear randomly

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.130
in several different
locations in each trial,

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.350
so the monkey doesn't know
where he's going to appear.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:42.710
And if he makes a
correct saccade to it,

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.500
he will get a drop of
apple juice for a reward.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.420
So that is the procedure.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.710
And so now the question
then comes up--

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:54.210
how well does the
monkey do in being

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.875
able to detect light
increment and light decrement?

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:03.010
So if you do that, luckily
one gets a very clear cut

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:05.350
and dramatic result.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.420
Here is the section
that I will show

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.660
you data for light
increment, and here

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.730
is a section showing
data for light decrement.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.420
So here is an example.

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.260
What you measure
here are two things--

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.860
you measure the monkey's
percent correct performance,

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.060
and you measure what the
saccadic latencies are

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.730
to make a saccade to the target.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.170
So it shows here that
under normal conditions,

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:34.570
the monkey's
performances is over 90%,

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.560
and that he has a
very nice distribution

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.140
of saccadic latencies
with a mean of about two

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.860
in 53 milliseconds.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.830
Then when you apply APB
to the eye, what happens

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.670
is that the monkey's
performance drops dramatically.

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:55.890
He is just a little
bit above probability,

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:58.620
and his latencies are very,
very late-- very, very,

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.180
very long-- 406 milliseconds.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.550
So in other words,
the monkey can barely

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.560
perceive a light
incremental stimulus

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.840
by virtue of having blocked
the ON channel in the retina

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.590
by APB.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.950
Now if you do the
same experiment

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:19.320
with light decrement,
what you see here

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.020
is the monkey's
performance remains

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.940
normal-- about 95% correct.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.000
And the latency
distribution is also

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.380
about the same-- two in 49,
versus two in 51 milliseconds.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:40.270
So that then says that
indeed the ability

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:43.700
to detect light
incremental stimuli

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:48.630
has been devastated by
the injection of APB,

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:53.280
and therefore raised the
idea that the ON and OFF

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.910
channels are for the purpose
of quickly and efficiently

00:42:56.910 --> 00:43:01.080
detecting light increment,
as well as light decrement.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:07.120
So that then was
the basic finding

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:14.050
that was obtained with this
behavioral experiment studying

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:17.030
the monkey's
performance on being

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.870
able to process visual stimuli.

00:43:20.645 --> 00:43:25.170
Now we are going to get
a bit more complicated,

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.080
because what we
talked about so far

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.360
was under photopic
conditions, meaning

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.670
when your cones were
fully functional.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:40.270
So the question is what happens
under scotopic conditions,

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:42.350
meaning what happens
when you're dark adapted.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.700
Now we have talked
about this before.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:52.220
It was pointed out,
initially by Schultze,

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.520
that we have two basic classes
of photoreceptors-- the rods

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.275
and the cones-- and that the
rods are for night vision.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:06.641
So now the question is, what
happens under night vision

00:44:06.641 --> 00:44:07.140
conditions.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.920
And when this was found-- this
was truly, truly baffling.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.070
And I'm going to
show you the data.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:17.540
It showed here under
light adapted conditions

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.530
with the same kind of
data-- but shown only

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.810
as histograms in this
case-- the monkey

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.190
does equally well
for light and dark.

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:29.920
And when you apply
APB, the monkey

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.360
has difficulty seeing the
light incremental stimulus,

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.390
but has little loss in the
light decremental stimulus.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:38.560
OK?

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.870
But when you do the same thing
under dark adapted conditions,

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:44.050
when only the rods
are operative,

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:45.490
a curious thing happens.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:48.900
The monkey doesn't see either
light increment or light

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.400
decrement.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.475
In other words, and the
way to put it shortly,

00:44:53.475 --> 00:44:58.120
is to say that the monkey
has become night blind.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:05.230
Now there are, among humans, a
small population of individuals

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.160
individuals who are
night blind, and what's

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.350
the situation with them?

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.570
It's called "night
blind" because they just

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.470
see very poorly at night.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.760
And, in fact, when
that is known,

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.730
they only get a special kind
of driver's license-- one

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.432
saying you can drive
in the daytime,

00:45:23.432 --> 00:45:24.640
but you can't drive at night.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.180
So now we have a
monkey here with APB

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.810
injected-- that
he's night blind.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:34.180
And also you see the same data
reflected in the latencies,

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.490
just like before.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.990
And it shows that the
monkey is devastated

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:41.460
both for light increment
and light decrement

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.300
by having a tremendous
increase-- more

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.035
than a tripling of
latencies for the few trials

00:45:48.035 --> 00:45:50.290
that he did carry out correctly.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:55.780
So now this being the case,
it raises a big question--

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.490
and I'm sorry that things
are getting so complicated,

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.510
but the brain is
complicated-- as

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:11.950
to just what is the nature
and arrangement of the rods

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.400
in the retina, and
how does that relate

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.320
to the arrangement of the cones?

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:16.870
OK?

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:21.100
So that brings me to
an interesting point.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.390
Again, as so often
happens, whenever

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.812
you're confronted
with a puzzle, you

00:46:27.812 --> 00:46:29.020
have all kinds of hypotheses.

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:32.960
And then luckily if you do
this instead of experiments,

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.880
you come up with the
right kinds of tools.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.250
You can eliminate most of them
and come up with the right one.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:47.180
Now, so we can
ask, first of all,

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:52.670
without talking
about APB at all now,

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.070
simply ask a general
question-- what

00:46:55.070 --> 00:47:02.480
happens to the receptive fields,
or retinal ganglion cells,

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.760
under dark adapted conditions?

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.985
And what happens is that the
receptive fields become larger.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:16.830
Now this initially-- discovered
by Barlow in England--

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.580
was negated by the other
individuals saying,

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.790
you just got scattering of
light-- that's why it's larger.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.600
So it was kind of
dismissed, but in the end

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.890
it turned that he was
right, as you shall see.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:34.490
The other thing that happened
is that the color selectivity

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:40.360
response disappears in the
retinal ganglion cells.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.470
And not only that, but it
disappears behaviorally.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.240
So when you have a
red rose, and you

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.520
look at a red rose at night when
only your rods are functional,

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.140
it looks like a black rose.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.860
The rods cannot process color.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:56.360
OK?

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.120
They can only process light
increment and decrement.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.550
OK, again just to reiterate--
the receptive fields

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.010
become larger.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:05.650
OK.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:08.930
So the big question is
what on earth is happening,

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:10.700
what kind of wiring
is taking place,

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.540
or what kind of
connections are created

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.510
to create these two things.

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:19.960
Now the second one is the
one that's the big puzzle.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.065
The first one we can
understand because it's

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:24.620
been shown that rods
are only one type

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.725
and that they don't
carry color information.

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:37.880
Now to study this further, way
back when in the 1870s-- 1880s,

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.280
Cajal did the large number
of experiments of this sort.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.910
If you remember, I told you
that Cajal played a central role

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:49.260
in using the Golgi stain, and
that he and Golgi received

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:55.790
the Nobel Prize in 1906
for their major discoveries

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:56.570
about this.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:01.470
So now he argued that
the way this happens

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.410
is that rods and the
cones connect differently

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:05.980
with the ganglion cells.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.580
And so here is a
picture of Cajal.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.370
He spent most of
his life like this,

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.960
looking through a
microscope, endlessly looking

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:19.190
at brain slices, and studying
the individual cells--

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:21.710
the shapes and drew them,
as you can see his pencil.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:25.150
He is in the middle drawing,
actually, a cell there.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:31.230
And so he speculated
about this a great deal.

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:34.070
And he was just a
remarkable person.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:39.646
And he had written
an autobiography.

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:47.580
And the way he speaks in this--
translated from Spanish--

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.890
but he has an incredibly
colorful way of talking--

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.830
"had," I guess I should say.

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.610
And I want to
quote some of this,

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.300
because I think you'll find
it interesting and amusing.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.930
So he said, "Since this
impression received by the rods

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:04.040
is different from that
taken by the cone,

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.850
it is necessary from
every point of view

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.360
that each of these
specific impressions

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:15.130
should be conveyed through the
retina by a separate channel."

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:19.370
The translation leaves a lot
to be desired, but that's OK.

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:21.070
So then he went
on and said, "When

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:25.060
we reason with common sense
and lift a war club determined

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:30.790
upon vigorous action,
nature ultimately hears us."

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:34.430
Very picturesque, as if nature
had heard anyone, right?

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:37.560
"Knowing what I was
looking for--" meaning he

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:42.730
had a hypothetical bias, right--
"I began to explore eagerly

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:45.380
retina of fishes and mammals.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.600
Finally as a reward
of my faith, there

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.800
deigned to appear most clearly
and brilliantly those two

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.590
types of bipolar cells
demanded by theory

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:58.220
and guessed by reason."

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:02.520
What he means by
this is that there

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:05.440
were two kinds of basic
kinds of bipolar cells--

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.930
and not the ON and OFF.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.960
But in this case, what
he was talking about,

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.700
he was talking about rod
bipolars and cone bipolars.

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:17.570
He said the rod photoreceptors
connect with rod bipolars,

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.570
and the cone photoreceptors
with cone bipolars.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:25.090
So that's what [INAUDIBLE]
then established,

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:27.550
and that finding was
basically correct.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:33.790
But then he went on to say that
these two kinds of bipolars

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:37.050
hook up with two types
of ganglion cells,

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:39.490
thereby forming separate
channels to the brain.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:45.190
So that was an interesting
conclusion, and for many years

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:46.530
that was accepted.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:49.040
And interestingly enough,
as it so often happens

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.880
with hypotheses,
this conclusion--

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.184
even though you had
the drawings looking

00:51:56.184 --> 00:51:58.100
through the microscope
showing that there were

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.740
these separate channels--
turned out to be largely

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.630
not one-- almost entirely wrong.

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.370
Now what do we mean by that?

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:06.960
Well people began
to do all sorts

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.370
of very careful intercellular
recordings in the retina,

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.450
and using much
more sophisticated

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:16.230
anatomical procedures
than Cajal was

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:19.050
able to use, thanks to the
new developments in the field.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:24.420
And they discovered, first of
all-- let me back up a second.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.100
This is sort of the model
that he had proposed.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.420
He had the cone model
and the rod model,

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.480
not distinguishing
between the ON and OFF.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.350
And so the model that
then subsequently emerged

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:40.640
was that ganglion cells
in most of the retina

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:44.220
actually receive a convergent
input- except in the fovia,

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.500
because you don't have rods
there-- so that you don't have

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:53.080
a doubling of ganglion
cells-- some for rods

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.100
and some for cones-- but
both the rods and the cones,

00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:00.450
through separate pathways,
feed into the ganglion cell.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:03.610
So then this was analyzed
in much, much more detail.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:08.240
And now I'm going to point this
out to you by providing you

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.241
with an overview of the
retinal connections.

00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:11.740
OK.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.690
So here we have the three
basic classes of cones.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:16.610
All right?

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.711
And we have the rods.

00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:19.210
All right?

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:23.870
Then, if you look at
the cones, each cone

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:28.890
gives rise to at least two
bipolar cell-- an ON and OFF

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.130
bipolar cell.

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:36.730
But the rods in
most species only

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:40.260
have a single kind
of bipolar cell,

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.020
and they can refer to that
as an ON bipolar cell,

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.990
because the synapses are all
sign-inverting synapses using

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:53.480
the mGluR6 neurotransmitter
receptor site.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.150
So that's what we have there.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:58.840
Now if you look further down
here at the ganglion cells--

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.680
and what we have is of course,
that we have the ON and OFF

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.430
bipolar cells from
the cones feed

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.030
into the ON and
OFF ganglion cells.

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:10.021
So now the questions are what
happens to the ON bipolar

00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:10.520
cells?

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:16.120
How do they connect
to these cells

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.640
since they do not form
a separate pathway?

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.890
And this has been
again-- things got

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:26.120
very complicated in
the course of evolution

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.870
where it was very important
to try to conserve things

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:31.640
as much as possible,
and that's why we do not

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.690
have separate pathways
for rods and cones.

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:37.210
If we did we'd need
a huge eye, and we'd

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:41.199
need at least twice
as many ganglion cells

00:54:41.199 --> 00:54:43.615
than we have at the present
time, which is about a million

00:54:43.615 --> 00:54:44.860
in each eye.

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:49.740
OK, so what really happened
is-- dumb-founding almost--

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:55.860
is that a so-called
amacrine cell --

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.830
I told you there are different
classes of amacrine cells--

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:02.370
one of them is a so-called
A2 amacrine cell.

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.420
That is a cell that
receives a direct input

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.340
from the ON bipolar cells.

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:14.250
Now that amacrine cell
connects to ganglion cells

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:15.750
in two different ways.

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:20.060
It makes a gap junction
connection with the ON bipolar

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:24.890
cells, and it makes a
glycinergic synaptic connection

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:27.360
with the OFF ganglion cell.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.790
So let's label this.

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.820
What we have here-- this is
inner plexiform layer again,

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.740
and here is the outer
plexiform layer.

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.580
And what we have here--
just to remind you,

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:40.740
that already know-- we have
a sign-inverting synapse

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:44.800
for the ON, and sign-conserving
for the OFF bipolars

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:49.840
that connect with the cones.

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.920
And now we have here-- let's
proceed to the A2 amacrine

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:58.910
cell that is feeding into
these cells from the rods.

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:03.380
And what we have here is a
glycinergic synapse, so-called.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.770
That's a real synapse.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.200
It's inhibitory.

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.660
And then here we have what
is called a gap junction.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.920
I'm sure all of you know
what these things are.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:16.830
Gap junction is what you
call an electrical synapse.

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:21.720
So they transform the signal
without any neurotransmitters

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.740
involved.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.720
So it directly activates-- in
this case, this fiber here--

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.040
and drives it.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.700
So what you create
in the inner retina

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:35.310
then here is a
double ended system

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:40.550
for the rods that is created in
the outer retina for the cones.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:43.030
So you create [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:47.060
Here are the OFF, and here are
the ON inputs to the ON and OFF

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.710
ganglion cells.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:51.390
Now because of this
arrangement, what happens

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:56.370
is that the size
of the receptive

00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:59.170
fields under dark
adaptive conditions

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:04.300
is bigger because a bigger range
of connections from the rods

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.505
to the ganglion cells.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.950
So all this is nice
wiring that finally,

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:12.230
after many, many
years of experiments,

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:13.630
has been clarified.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:14.785
Sorry it is so complicated.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.950
That's just how it is.

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:23.340
Explains then the claim that
you have bigger receptive fields

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.980
at night than in the daytime.

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.015
And now that has been
generally accepted.

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:32.990
OK so now the central
conclusions that we come to

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:36.160
is that ON and OFF
channels have emerged

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.380
in the course of evolution
to enable organisms

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:44.040
to process light both
incrementally and decrementally

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:48.110
for being able to see
things rapidly and quickly.

00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:48.870
All right?

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:50.500
So that is the prime function.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.200
Nature has gone to
incredible extent

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.250
to modify the basic organization
of the visual system

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:01.170
and the retina to
create a way to be

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:03.510
able to process
both light increment

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:05.070
and decrement rapidly.

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:08.900
Now that may provide you
with a little cute mnemonic,

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:10.550
if you will.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:11.830
Here we have a fish.

00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:15.645
Fish also, believe it or not,
have ON and OFF channels.

00:58:16.794 --> 00:58:20.110
Now what happens is
if below here there

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:23.080
is a predator--
a large fish that

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:28.570
is trying to catch this fish--
because of the sun shining

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:30.530
on it, it reflects
the light, and so

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:33.910
this fish would see
this particular predator

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.740
by virtue of light increment.

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:36.870
Got it?

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:40.540
By contrast, if you
have osprey up here

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.520
that's trying to
catch this fish,

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:46.380
that osprey against the sky
would be seen as a dark object.

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.480
OK?

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:54.490
And so now, since this fish
has both ON and OFF cells

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:57.730
in its retina, it's
going to do this.

00:58:57.730 --> 00:58:58.400
You ready?

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:02.750
He's going to escape, OK?

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:08.680
So that then, in a
nutshell, tells us

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:16.670
why we have ON and OFF channels
in the visual system-- namely

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:20.460
to enable us to process both
light increment and light

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.390
decrement effectively.

00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:24.600
And as I've mentioned
to you before,

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.410
whenever you read or
write, you see things

00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:32.770
mostly by virtue
of your OFF system

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:39.140
because you have dark print or a
dark pen on a light background.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:42.795
But of course the
obverse is also the case.

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:48.320
So this was known
for ages and ages.

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.670
And that's why
eventually, instead

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:54.310
of having print
in which you have

00:59:54.310 --> 00:59:58.170
a black page with
white letters, you now

00:59:58.170 --> 01:00:00.880
a white page with black
letters, because that's

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.170
much more economical to achieve.

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:06.940
And you can read both
light incremental

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.400
and light decremental
letters equally well

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.570
because we have these
ON and OFF channels.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:14.230
OK.

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:17.800
So on the basis of
this then, we are

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:24.460
ready to summarize why we
have this remarkable duality

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:30.540
in the retina, originating
in the ON and OFF channels,

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.820
whose circuits we
by now, I presume,

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.060
you understand pretty well.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.890
So just to reiterate for
the umpteenth time, which

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:40.622
is easy to remember by
now, all photoreceptors

01:00:40.622 --> 01:00:42.510
hyperpolarize to light.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:47.390
Secondly, the cone driven
ON and OFF channels

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:51.120
originate at the level of
the retinal bipolar cells.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:51.730
OK?

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.270
For ON bipolars
you have a system,

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:56.785
which involves
sign-inverting synapses.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:58.910
OK?

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:03.686
The neuron transmitted by
the way of the photoreceptors

01:01:03.686 --> 01:01:05.500
is glutamate.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:13.090
And you come to the receptor
sites-- the mGluR6 receptor is

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:20.050
the one that inverts the signal
for the ON bipolar cells.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:27.450
And the mGluR1 and 2 is the
neurotransmitter receptor site

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:30.710
for the OFF bipolar cells.

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:33.500
Now APB-- can
important to remember

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.880
this-- is that glutamate analog.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.980
A lot of people make a mistake
and think it's an antagonist.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.900
It's a glutamate analog.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:44.515
So what happens is that
it blocks the ON bipolar.

01:01:44.515 --> 01:01:47.850
Now let me say just a couple
more words about this.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.960
We move our eyes about
three times a second.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:02.560
Every time you move your eye
some mechanisms in the retina

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.690
wipe the slate
clean, so to speak,

01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:09.339
because if it didn't,
then the image that

01:02:09.339 --> 01:02:11.380
would fall on the retina
after you moved your eye

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.530
would interfere
with the image that

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:15.510
had fallen on the
eye beforehand.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:18.010
So there's an
incredibly rapid system

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:21.530
that breaks down the
molecular arrangement

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:27.910
of glutamate and many other
transmitters in the retina

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.880
so that with each
movement of the eye,

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.620
you can see things clearly.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.830
Now there is an exception
to that, of course,

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:36.720
under extreme conditions.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.390
We have what is
called "after images,"

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:41.450
like when you look at
the sun for a while.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:45.996
Then you will see an after
image lingering on in your eye.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:49.690
But under normal
illumination conditions,

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:53.910
the slate is wiped clean
with every shift in the eye.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.290
Quite amazing.

01:02:56.290 --> 01:02:56.790
All right.

01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:00.300
Then APB blocks the ON response
of retinal ganglion cells.

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.970
The OFF response and
center-surround antagonism

01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:03.990
are unaffected.

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:08.630
APB blocks lighted
responses in the cortex,

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:11.540
but has no effect on
orientation, direction,

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.385
and spatial frequency
selectivity.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.400
APB reduces the sensitivity
for light increment,

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.520
and the ON and OFF channels for
rods arise in the inner retina.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.970
And I should add
here that there's

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:31.140
only one kind of rod bipolar,
which is the ON-type.

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.070
There are no OFF-type
rod biopolars.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:41.650
Then in most primates there
are only ON rod bipolars.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:44.170
The rod ON and OFF
channels are created

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.700
in the inner retina
by the amacrine cells,

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:49.750
predominately by the
so-called A2 amacrine cell,

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:50.970
as I told you.

01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:54.090
Lastly, excitatory
signals are generated

01:03:54.090 --> 01:03:56.820
for both light increment
and for light decrement

01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:00.280
by virtue of the ON
and OFF channels.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.600
So those are the
major conclusions

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:10.380
that we need to make about this
remarkable achievement of how

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.780
the visual system works,
by virtue of having created

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:18.820
the ON and the OFF channels,
by virtue of having then

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:23.020
done this, by virtue of creating
from a single-ended system

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:26.050
of the photoreceptors,
a double-ended system

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:28.030
at the level of
the bipolar cells.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:31.285
So that then is--
sorry how complicated

01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:35.830
it is-- the basic layout of
the retina and the ON and OFF

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.030
channels.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:42.790
Next time we are going to talk
about yet another subdivision

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:46.260
in retinal ganglion cells-- the
so-called midget and parasol

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:46.840
cells.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.240
I think I've mentioned
to you before that we

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.290
have several different classes
of retinal ganglion cells--

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:54.320
not just ON and OFF.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:59.210
And the so-called
midget and parasol cells

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:01.257
have ON and OFF subdivisions.

01:05:01.257 --> 01:05:02.840
And then there are
several other cells

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.256
that do all kinds
of other things.

01:05:04.256 --> 01:05:05.950
We will talk about
some of those.

01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:09.410
But the overwhelming, largest
number of cells in the retina

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:12.120
are the midget and the
parasol, and so they

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.970
deserve the greatest
scrutiny as to why

01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:17.040
we have those two systems.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.140
And that's we are going
to discuss the next time.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:25.880
So that pretty well finishes
what I had to cover today,

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.060
and so if any of you
have any questions,

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.680
I will be happy to try to answer
them for you, as long as it

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.500
pertains, of course, to
the ON and OFF channels.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.170
Anybody not clear
on the rules of how

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:42.890
APB works-- that it's an analog,
that it fills the receptor

01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:46.690
sites of the ON bipolar
cells, rendering

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:50.795
them insensitive to
subsequent light stimulation?

01:05:50.795 --> 01:05:53.230
Now I should add maybe
one more thing here

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:57.730
is that unlike the glutamate,
which is broken down

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:02.630
in milliseconds, this
artificial substance-- APB--

01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:05.260
there's no natural
optic mechanism for it.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:10.810
And so it lingers on, and
that's why it is so effective.

01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:15.260
And it has to be washed out
of the eye-- you typically

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:21.330
have to wait 10-- 15 minutes
for the eye to return to normal

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:25.950
because there's no rapid
optic mechanism for the APB,

01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:27.765
in contrast to the glutamate.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.390
Well it sounds like I
was reasonably clear.

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:41.020
I hope you can absorb
this and marvel

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:45.980
at the inventiveness, if
you will, of evolution

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:48.960
to have created this
incredible mechanisms that we

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:49.815
see in the retina.

01:06:49.815 --> 01:06:52.300
It's just dumb-founding.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.500
Yes, it's just incredible.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:01.390
So that then is what we
going to finish with today.

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:03.360
And so I will see
you Wednesday, and we

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.600
talk about the midget and
parasol systems, which

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.610
is also very
interesting, by the way.

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.160
And I hope you've
enjoyed hearing

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.560
about what those
two systems are for.

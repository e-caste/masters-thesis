WEBVTT

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
OK.
Good morning.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In the last lecture I did a
little demonstration for you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where I showed you a pair of
inverters.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And showed you that the output
of the first inverter looked

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
weird, certainly not like
anything we have seen thus far.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It looked like a slow rising
transition like this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And using that motivation we
have begun our study of RC

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
circuits.
And in particular for today the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
lecture is titled "Digital
Circuit Speed".

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We are going to look at the
fundamentals of digital circuit

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
speed.
And it all boils down to an RC

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
delay.
By the end of the lecture,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I am going to show you two
numbers that you can look at a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
circuit and obtain by
observation, multiply them out

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and you will get a good idea of
the speed at which a circuit

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
will run.
It is pretty amazing.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So as a quick review --
The relevant section for this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is Chapter 10.4.
As a review,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
we said to understand things
like this we need to develop the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
foundations for RC circuits.
And the example I covered was

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that of a very simple circuit
that looked like this --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
An RC circuit of this form.
And I also showed you that for

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
an input of the form,
input that steps from zero to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000
VI at time T equal to zero.
And assuming that the capacitor

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
state at time T equals zero was
zero.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
What this means is that the
capacitor starts from rest,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
so at time T=0,
oops, this is VI,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm sorry.
So we assume that the capacitor

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
starts from rest.
At time T=0 I apply a VI step,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
capital VI.
And then I want to look at how

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the voltage across the capacitor
behaves.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And we did a bunch of analysis.
And at the end of the day,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
in the final demo in the
lecture last time I showed you

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that the capacitor would behave
like this.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It would start off at,
oops.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I am sorry.
This should be,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
let's assume that started off
at VO.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We get a different equation for
zero.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So let's say the capacitor
started off at VO,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in which case VC at time T=0 is
VO as expected.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And we showed that the output
would look something like this.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.000
After a long period of time
this would come up to VI and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000
this rise had a time constant of
tau=RC.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So we wrote the equation for
this waveform.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And this is the case when VI is
greater than VO.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I would like you to stare at
the circuit and this result here

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to get more intuition on what is
going on.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
At time T=0,
VC starts off at VO as expected

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
because I am telling you that is
the case, that is initial

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
condition.
It starts off at VO.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Then this one steps to VI.
There is no infinite transition

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
anywhere here,
and so the capacitor holds its

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
voltage at VO,
at time T=0.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And then the VI here,
which is greater than VO,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
begins to charge the capacitor
up, charge it through this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
resistor.
And so therefore the capacitor

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
charges up.
After a long period of time,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
from the basic foundations of
capacitors, we know that the

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
capacitor appears like a
long-term open circuit to DC.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is a DC voltage VI.
So it appears like an open

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
circuit.
So after a long period of time

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
VI appears at the end.
And from here to here I have an

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
exponential rise that is
typified by an equation of the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
form -t/RC.
This kind of waveform rising

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
from a smaller value to a higher
value is typified by this

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
expression.
We saw the expression when we

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
developed the equations last
time.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
On the other hand,
if the input was such that VI

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
was smaller than VO,
so let's say VI was smaller

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000
than VO then what will happen is
that the capacitor voltage would

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
start off at VO,
because I am telling you that

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
is the initial condition,
and would then decay in this

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
manner to the final value of VI
which is the input.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Instead of going up this way it
decays down to the final value

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
applied to the circuit.
Again, the time constant is RC.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But this is typified by a form,
this is exponential rise and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
this guy e^-t/RC is an
exponential decay.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The key thing to remember is
that when you have RC circuits

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of this form,
the waveforms that you get are

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
either each of the e^-t/RC or
1-e^-t/RC.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So you can now begin to see how
waveforms such as that come

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
about.
We will do an example and sit

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
down and compute the inverter
delay.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And notice that this waveform
here is very typical or

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
corresponds to this waveform
that we see here.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Here I am starting at VO.
And assuming this axis starts

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
off at zero, this one starts
very close to zero and then

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
rises up to some final value.
So far I have reviewed some

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
material for you that I covered
the last time.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
As a second step,
I would like to give you a much

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
more intuitive approach --
-- that doesn't involve solving

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
any differential equations.
And the reason I do this is

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that most experienced circuit
designers do not sit down and

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
write differential equations
each time they see an RC

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
circuit.
When you are starting out and

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
you see an RC circuit,
you say node method and you

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
write the differential equation,
but experienced people don't do

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that.
They look at it and they can

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
sketch the waveform out by
inspection.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And I will show you how to do
that.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It is indeed incredibly simple
once I give you some intuition.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Throughout the rest of this
course, I will be showing you

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
many such examples where
initially I develop the

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
foundations of stuff and then
show you an intuitive approach

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
that very quickly lets you
either get the final answer or

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
at least sanity check the answer
that you have gotten.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And this is how experienced
circuit designers deal with

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
stuff.
How many people here have seen

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
this movie Bend it Like Beckham?
So you know this Beckham

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
character doesn't think about
how he is going to curve the

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
ball.
He just does it and it happens.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
He doesn't sit down writing
differential equations to find

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
out the projectile trajectory
and all of that stuff.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You just kind of do it.
These series of intuitions I am

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
going to give you is going to be
in line with the Bend it Like

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Beckham kind of intuition.
And this one in particular I

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
would like to do in honor of one
of your recitation instructions

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Professor David Perreault.
And so this piece of intuition

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
is going to be termed "Practice
it Like Perreault".

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Watch what I do with the other
names.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Professor David Perreault is
really a world expert in

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
designing really incredible
power supplies for very,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
very small chips and so on.
He doesn't start writing

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
differential equations to do
this stuff.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
He looks at it and sketches it
out.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Let me show you how he would do
this.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Suppose I have my circuit like
before, VI, R and C,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and I am telling you that
VC(0)=VO.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And my input VI is a step that
looks like this.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
VI is a step.
How would Professor Perreault

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
do this?
Let's do it completely by

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
intuition.
No math here.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
All right.
We know that I have told you

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
that this guy starts off at VO.
I am telling you that.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
You know it is going to start
at VO.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And there is no impulse or huge
infinite transition,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and so the capacitor starts off
at VO.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We also know from basic
capacitor properties that after

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
a long period of time,
in the steady state,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
this is but a DC voltage.
If you apply a DC and here is

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
my capacitor.
After a long period of time

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
this guy is going to look like
an open circuit.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It is going to charge up to
some value and then is going to

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
look like an open circuit.
Because if it didn't,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
you would keep charging it and
its voltage would keep

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
increasing.
That doesn't happen,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
it looks like an open circuit.
So it looks like an open

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
circuit in the long run.
The voltage across it must be

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
capital VI.
If I don't have current flowing

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
in the circuit then the only way
that can happen is --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
This open circuit.
Capital VI appears across the

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
capacitor.
Well, after a long period of

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
time I know that the output must
look like this.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
In this case,
I have assumed VI is greater

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
than VO.
So you have two points of your

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
curve, VO and VI after a long
period of time.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And, as I told you earlier,
with capacitors you get two

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
kinds of curves.
Two things.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
What you do is go zoop.
There you go.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
You're done.
And this has an exponential

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
rise.
This is with the form

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
1-e^-t/RC.
So we can write an equation for

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
that as follows.
VC we know has something to do

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
with minus t/RC.
This is of that form,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
so there has to be that term in
there somewhere.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And I start off with VO.
At time T=0 this is one and

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
this is one, so this term
becomes a zero.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
At time T=0 that becomes a zero
so I get VO here.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I am going to make sure this
stuff stays zero at time T=0,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
so I start off with VO.
Now, as time wears on what

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
happens here?
This voltage here,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
VI-VO, if you look at this
difference.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
That is exponentially decaying
over time.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And so therefore all I have to
do here is write VI-VO.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
There is the answer.
I know the form of the curve.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I am just fitting an expression
that meets this form.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
This starts off at VO.
When time T=0 this second

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
expression is zero and so it is
VO.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And this difference here decays
down to zero.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And this difference here,
VI-VO is multiplied by this

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
term here and that is what I
get.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And you can confirm this.
At time T=0 this is zero.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
At time T infinity this goes to
zero, this goes to zero leaving

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
a one, and VO and minus VO
cancel and I get a VI.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Virtually any such simple
voltage source,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
current source,
resistor, capacitor,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
circuit for most inputs like
steps and so on can be analyzed

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
in this manner.
Initial value,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
final value,
it's simple.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And just to show you that this
is simple, I am going to label

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
this expression this way.
It is of the form 1-e^-t/RC.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Just remember that.
Now, by the same token,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
what if VI had been smaller
than VO?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Then that is simple,
too.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I would have had my VI being
here.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
VI would have been here.
And that is of the form.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
In this particular situation,
here is my VI,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
my starting value and I do
this.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And just to label that,
let me label that this way.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
I just told you that for RC
circuits you go this way or you

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
go this way.
So it is down here.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I get some kind of an
exponential decay.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And, like before,
think of this one.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
This one has VI as a base value
here.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And the difference between the
two is VO minus VI.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And that difference decays.
So I have a VI out here,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and this difference decays so I
get VO-VI and that decays in

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
this form.
So I get an exponential decay

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
of this difference here.
Just stare at it for a while

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
longer.
You should be able to just go

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and knock it off like this,
just like Professor Perreault

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
would.
No differential equations.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Just write it down by looking
at the curve.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Let's keep these two in mind,
OK, these forms?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
One is the 1-e^-t/RC form and
the e^-t/RC.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Both have a time constant RC.
Let me just make this a dashed

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
line just to be on the safe side
here.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
That is our first piece of
intuition.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And, as I pointed out before,
in problems you face in life or

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
in ones that we give you,
feel free to use the intuitive

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
method.
Or what you can do is apply the

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
mathematical method and then
check your answer by using your

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
intuition.
What I would like to do next is

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
apply what you have learned so
far to figure out what we set

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
out to figure out,
which is the delay of my

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
inverter.
I had promised you that by the

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
end of this lecture I was going
to close the loop on that little

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
demo.
I was going to close the loop

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
for you on this little circuit
that we had looked at,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
one inverter driving another
inverter.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
This was A, this was inverter
X, and this was my node B.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
The green curve you see out
there, the middle one has a

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
transition shown up there.
And what I am going to do next

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
is use the results we have
gotten so far to compute a

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
number.
We are going to compute a delay

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
number both for a rising
transition.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
We will call that delay DR for
rising transition.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And we will compute a delay for
the falling transition DF.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Remember, that this is the
input that falls down sharply.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
The intermediate node B rises
much more slowly.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And because this rises much
more slowly this guy here falls

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
a little after this transition
here, and so there is a delay.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And I am going to apply what we
have learned so far and do an

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
example for you and figure out
what that delay is.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
This is an absolute
foundational calculation done in

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
building digital circuits all
the time.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
It is remarkable that something
so simple is used in designing

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
even the most complex of
circuits to obtain very quick

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
ideas of what my delay will look
like when I have some subcircuit

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
driving some other piece of
subcircuit.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Let me just draw a few
equivalent circuits for you.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
The internal circuit looks like
this.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
This is my inverter X,
A, my node B.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And notice that I have this
capacitor CGS.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Since I am interested in this
node, let me show you that,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
this capacitor explicitly,
it is because of this capacitor

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
here that arises because of this
MOSFET here between the gate and

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
the source.
And that capacitor gives rise

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
to this RC thing that we are
seeing.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
This is RL, this is RL,
VS, VS.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And let's say,
just as up there,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000
at time T=0 I get a transition
like so, a falling transition

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
from say 5 volts to 0 volts at
the node A.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
This is VA here.
That is shown up there.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
And VB --

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
We had expected that VB would
look like this.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
We expected VB to be
instantaneous and looking like

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
that, but instead because of the
capacitor VB looks like this.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And remember,
again, this is of the form

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
1-e^-t/RC.
And we will write down the

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
answers by inspection.
From this let me draw the

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:39.000
connection to circuit delay by
showing you another little graph

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
here t, VB, zero.
And what I am going to show

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
you, this is 5 volts.
And so the output goes like

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
this from close to zero to 5
volts.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
It is close to zero.
Because, at least with the

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
inverters we have been seeing in
lab and so on,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
the RON for the inverter is
very, very small compared RL.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
So it is virtually zero down
here.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
And so what is the delay?
I mentioned there are two

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
delays of interest.
One is the rising delay.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
That is the logical value at
the end, if I wait a long enough

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
period of time,
is a logical one.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Delay is simply defined as
starting from here how long does

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
this output take to get to a
valid one?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
At what voltage here can I say
that this transition corresponds

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
to a logical one?
At what voltage here can I say

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
that that represents a valid
one?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Any ideas?
Yes.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
It depends on the discipline,
bingo.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
So it depends on the
discipline.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Now let's get more specific.
Since it depends on the

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
discipline, at what value based
on something in the discipline

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
can I say this thing is a
logical one?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
This is an output remember.
VOH, bingo.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
There is some VOH somewhere.
And it takes some amount of

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
time to get to a valid logical
one output, ergo there is your

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
delay.
This is tR.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
And I call this the rising
delay of the inverter X.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
It is interesting that the
rising delay of inverter X,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
based on our model,
depends on the parameters of

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
this inverter and the parameters
of whatever it is driving.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
So remember that the delay is
not necessarily just the

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000
property of the inverter itself,
but it depends on the context.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
If I stick my inverter before
another inverter like this,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
it is the capacitance on that
inverter by our model that tells

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
me what the delay is going to
look like, of course in addition

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
to RL.
And we will do the math in a

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
few seconds.
By the same token,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
if I had this wire connecting
not to one inverter but going to

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
ten other inverters,
I expect to have a capacitance

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
equal to ten times CGS.
And so therefore this thing

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
should rise even more slowly,
correct?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
The more capacitance on here
the slower it rises up.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Simple.
If I put more and more load on

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
this line by putting more and
more MOSFETs on that line,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
more and more inverters this
will rise slower.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
In our example I just have one,
so let's go ahead and compute

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
the delay.
This is called the rising delay

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
of X.
That says that for this node

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
here to go from its output value
to a valid one,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
which is VOH how long does it
take?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Notice that if this capacitor
was zero then you would have

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
seen an instantaneous
transition.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
If you have an instantaneous
transition then notice that the

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
rising delay was zero.
That was the model we had

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
looked at up until learning
about capacitors.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So let's go ahead and compute
the number.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
I can draw an equivalent
circuit for computing a rising

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
delay.
The equivalent circuit for the

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
rising delay looks like the
following.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
The VS voltage source,
with a resistor RL and a

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
capacitor CGS,
because when I turn this guy

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
off, this guy has gone off,
and so as far as the rise time

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
of this node is concerned I can
look at this circuit,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
ground through CGS through RL
through VS back to ground.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
And just for simplicity,
let me draw this in a form that

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
we understand.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
CGS.
Let me use this as my ground

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
node.
And this is the voltage VB.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
And this is RL.
And V is simply VS once that

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
transition happens.
My other equations here,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
VI=VS.
And what is VB(0)?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
VB(0) is at what value does
this node start out?

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Notice that for simplicity here
if this RON is much,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
much smaller than RL,
then this node would be very

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
close to ground.
So I will just go ahead and say

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
that VB at T=0 is approximately
zero.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
And then what I want to find
out is what does the value look

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
like for time starting from zero
and then going forward?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Well, we have become experts at
this now.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Let's do the intuition here.
Start off with zero.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
That's good.
Because my initial value is

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
zero, I start off here.
What is the final value?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
After a long time,
since this is a DC voltage,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
what would be the value at VB
after a long time?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Pardon?
VS.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
If I wait long enough then it
is going to be at VS.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
This is greater than the
initial value,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
so we're done.
That is my 1-e^-t/RC form.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
It took me three seconds there.
It's pretty cool.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
We could add the expression for
this.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
And the expression was I take
my starting value,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
which is zero,
and I add to that this

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
difference VS and I multiply
that by this form.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
There we go.
And remember I get this from

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
that rising form up here.
V0=0, this is zero,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
so it is simply VI times that,
and VI=VS.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I really would like you to get
this intuition.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
If I had two choices,
one is that you understand the

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
intuition and are able to sketch
that versus in your sleep be

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000
able to solve the differential
equation and get to the answer.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I would much rather you get the
intuition, if it is one or the

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
other.
It is very simple.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Start off at zero,
I go chuck, and boom,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
I get to VS and this is my
1-e^-t/RC form.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I need to compute tR.
And tR is the time that this

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
takes to get to VOH.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:53.000
For what value of time,
for what T, does VB reach VOH?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000
I want to find tR.
What's tR?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
From that equation,
that simply tells me the

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
trajectory of VB as a function
of time.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
And so I need to find out what
is T for which VB is VOH?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
I write VOH=VS (1-e^-t/RC).
So after a rise time my output

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
is going to be VOH.
And so let me go ahead and find

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
tR.
Let's see.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I bring this to this left-hand
side and divide VOH by VS,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
and then I move things around
and what I end up getting is

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
-tR/RC and on the other side I
get ln(1-VOH/VS).

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Divide VOH by VS,
that is this,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:00.000
move this to the other side,
and move e^-t/RC to this side.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
And take logarithms on both
sides.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
This is what I get.
tR is therefore -RLCGS

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
ln(1-VOH/VS).
That is my rise time.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
You can just do this by
inspection.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:30.000
It is just so awfully simple.
Just to give to some intuition

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.000
with numbers and so on.
Let's say that RL=1K,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
VS=5 volts, VOH=4 volts,
CGS=0.1 pF.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
This happens so often that we
often time call it "puff".

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
0.1 puff.
It is pF, it's called puff.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
If it is nF,
I don't know why they didn't

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
call it "nuff".
They just call it nanofarads.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000
TR for these numbers gets to be
one times ten to the three times

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
point one times ten to the minus
twelve for pico-farads

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
ln(1-4/5).
And if you do the math you get

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
this down to 0.16 nanoseconds.
This means that if I had an

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
inverter like that droving
another inverter then my output

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000
transition would be delayed by
0.16 nanoseconds.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Trust me, when Intel builds
microprocessors or when Broadcom

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
builds its cable modem chips,
they have to do this one way or

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
the other using a computer tool
or by hand for virtually every

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
little subcircuit in their chip.
That is how you get the delays

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
or some approximation thereof.
What I want you also to do is,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
for no particular reason,
I will just compute for you the

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
following quantity RLCGS.
The time constant of that

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
circuit for no reason at all.
I am just going to compute it

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
and stick it here.
And RLCGS 1 K times 1 pF is

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
simply 0.1 nanoseconds.
I am just writing it and

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
sticking it there for no
particular reason.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
The next step let's do the
falling delay,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
DF.
That is the rising delay.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
And, although I didn't show
this to you in the demo,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000
there is a corresponding delay
of the fall time.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
It doesn't fall instantly,
but rather it falls rather

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
slowly.
Let's draw the equivalent

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
circuit for when the node X
falls.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Notice that in my inverters
here, this node starts off being

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
at VS.
This is high.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
And this is going to fall
because when I turn this

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
transistor on it is going to
pull this node to ground or it

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
is going to fall down.
And what is the equivalent

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
circuit?
The equivalent circuit is that

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
ground through capacitor to this
node.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
At this node I have RON
connecting to ground and I have

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
RL connecting to ground through
VS.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Let me draw that little circuit
for you.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Remember life begins and ends
on storage elements,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
so I will draw them first.
My storage element CGS.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
That is VB.
And, as I said,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
this is node X,
it goes from RON to ground,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:15.000
and it also goes through RL
through VS to ground.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And in this particular
situation VB of zero for the

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
following delay,
VB starts off at VS so VB of

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000
zero is VS.
And the final output I am not

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
sure yet.
What is the final value of the

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
voltage at this node?
I don't know that yet.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
I need to compute that.
So what I will do is whenever

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
you see something like this,
a capacitor connecting to

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
linear stuff,
or a nonlinear element

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
connecting to linear stuff.
For no apparent reason you

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
should at least think about
what?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Think Thevenin,
exactly.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
And then see if you can use the
Thevenin method to simplify your

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
life.
Capacitor, a bunch of stuff

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
here, I need to find out the
initial value.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Oh, I know that.
That is VS.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Done.
I need to find the final value

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
using my intuitive method.
For the final value,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
I could do it just by looking
at this, but I wanted to throw

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
in Thevenin.
Hey, let me try to the Thevenin

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
equivalent and see if that makes
my life any easier.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
VTH.
The Thevenin method says that

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
you can replace this circuit
here with a Thevenin equivalent

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
of the sort for the purpose of
determining what happens at this

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
node given that that is linear.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
So I need to find out that for
the purpose of determining what

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
happens at the node X.
I have to replace this with its

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Thevenin equivalent.
And I now need to find out RTH

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
and VTH.
So I get RTH by looking in

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
here, shorting this guy and
looking at the resistance.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
So I look in like this,
then I short this guy here and

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
I get RL in parallel with RON
because this one shorts to

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
ground.
So RTH is simply RL in parallel

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
with RON.
This is a convenient notation

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
for RL being in parallel with
RON.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
And you all know the value of
that.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
It is another one of our very
simple patterns like voltage

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
divider and so on.
Resistances in parallel can be

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
computed as RL RON divided by RL
plus RON.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
What is VTH?
VTH is the open circuit voltage

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
here.
If I take out this capacitor,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
I want to find out what the
voltage here is.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Ah-ha, voltage divider.
VS, the voltage divider here,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
RL and RON.
I could write this down as VS

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
times RON/(RL+RON).
Remember you will see again and

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
again and again and again in
6.002 or any circuit stuff that

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
you do, you will see them all
over Thevenin.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Voltage dividers,
current dividers,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
resistances in series,
resistances in parallel,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
RC thing-a-ma-jigs like this.
So if you just remember those

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
10 to 15 intuitive patterns then
you are pretty much set for

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
life.
It just comes on again and

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
again and again.
Parallel resistors.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Voltage dividers.
You should be able to write

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
down a voltage divider in your
sleep.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
So this is what I have.
Let me now write down

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000
intuitively what I expect the
node X to do just by inspection.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Let's see.
What is the initial value of

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000
the voltage across the
capacitor, intuitive method?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
This is how Professor Perreault
would do it, remember?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
He would start off by saying
ah-ha, initial value is VS

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
because I am told it is VS.
I start off with VS.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
And so I start off here.
What is the value after a long,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
long time based on this circuit
here?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
V Thevenin.
After a long time this is a DC

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
voltage because that is a DC
voltage.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
The capacitor looks like an
open circuit after a long time.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And VTH appears there so it is
simply V Thevenin.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
And then when you see those
two, boy, I love doing this,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
you go like this.
That is the coolest part.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
And then I am done.
It is so simple.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Three seconds or less,
I am able to tell you what the

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
delay of an inverter is purely
by intuition,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
completely intuitively.
I mean I haven't done any

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
solving.
It is just by observation.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Took this circuit,
made my life easy,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Thevenin, looked at RTH,
VTH and then sketched it by

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
inspection.
Again, if you find that things

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
are really, really,
really simple don't be

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
surprised.
Once you get some conceptual

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
understanding things are indeed
very simple.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
You can eliminate a lot of math
just by staring at things

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
attempting to build up the
intuition.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
As a next step what I can do is
write down the expression for

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
VB.
And I write down the expression

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
from a falling transition.
How do I do it?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
What was it?
What is the method?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
I take the lowest value of
interest here.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
That is VTH.
And then I add to that this

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
difference decaying
exponentially.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
And that difference is simply
VS-VTH.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And that decays exponentially.
This form is the e^-t/RC form.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
And, boom, I am done.
Many of you are wondering,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Professor Agarwal,
if life was so simple,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
why on earth did you have us
mess around with those

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
differential equations to get
here?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
You show us differential
equations and then you don't use

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
them anymore.
Well, that is a good question.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
The answer to that is that you
need to understand the

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
foundations.
Once you understand the

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
foundations you can find
simplifying techniques to get to

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
where you need to be,
but you need to understand the

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
foundations.
You need to at least see why

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
things are the way they are at
least once.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Understand the foundations and
then find intuitive ways of

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
getting your answers.
So now my falling delay here

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
is, I start off with VOS and I
need to get all the way down to

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
what value to compute.
At some point here,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
this is a valid one,
at some point VB becomes a

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:02.000
valid zero for the output.
And that is when I stop my tF

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
block.
What is the value here for this

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
to be a valid zero?
Don't all yell at once.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
VOL.
I simply had to figure out what

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
is the value of time,
this is Page 7,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000
for which this expression
decays down to VOL.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:38.000
So it is VTH+(VS-VTH) e^-tF/RC.
Then I simplify this.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000
How do I do that?
VOL-VTH.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Then I divide that by VS-VTH.
So VOL-VTH.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Divide that by VS-VTH.
Take logarithms on both sides

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:14.000
and then multiply by RC.
So I get tF is -RC log of that.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000
This is R Thevenin and this is
CGS.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:30.000
How did I get this?
VOL-VTH divided by VS-VTH.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Take logs on both sides.
And then multiply throughout by

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
-1/-RC and I get my tF.
Done.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Let's do it for the same set
numbers, just that we add an RON

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
of 10 ohms.
I will do this for RON of 10

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000
ohms and compute the value for
you.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
tF=-RTH.
RTH is RON parallel RL.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
This is 10 ohms.
That is 1K.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:20.000
So 10 ohms in parallel with 1K
is approximately 10 ohms.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
So let me just use
approximately 10 ohms.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000
1 pF, that is RC times ln of
VOL.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Oh, I need to give you a VOL.
Let's say my discipline has VOL

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
being 1 volt.
And so therefore I end up

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
getting a VOL-VTH divided by
VS-VTH.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Since RON is much,
much, much smaller than RL,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000
since RON is 10 ohms and this
is 1K, most of VS will drop

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
across RL.
This is a hundred times

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
smaller.
Compared to VOL,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
which is 1 volt,
VTH is very,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
very small.
VTH will be on the order of

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
0.05, and so therefore I simply
write down VOL here and say VTH

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
is approximately zero,
and I get VS-VTH.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
This is approximately 5.
So let me just say this is

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
approximately.
And if you do it you will get

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
1.6 pico-seconds.
Again, just for fun,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000
let me write the corresponding
RC time constant for the

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.000
circuit, which is RTHCGS.
So RTH is approximately 10 ohms

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
and CGS is 1 pF,
so this is 1 picosecond.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Now you will understand why I
have been writing this time

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
constant down.
It turns out that the time

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
constant is a very,
very important number.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
So you see an RC circuit,
and you compute its time

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
constant for an RLC connection
like this, it is the series

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
resistance times the capacitor.
The time constant is a very

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
important number.
And usually the circuit delays

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
are in the neighborhood of the
time constant value.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
In this case this is 1 pS.
That is 1.6 pS.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
And in this case we had 0.1 nS
and 0.16 nS.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
So the time constant itself is
a good indicator of what your

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
delays are going to be like.
If you have no time,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
you are sloshing your cereal
down in the morning and you need

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
to know how long the delay of
the inverter very quickly,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
you have three seconds.
Just do the RC and that is a

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
good first approximation.
What I would like to do next in

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
the last three or four minutes
is set up a little demo for you

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
for your recitation,
and then your recitation will

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
cover it.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
This is a true story.
This really,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
really happened.
In this West Coast school,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
which shall remain nameless,
they had a chip,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
they built a chip.
And the chip had a bunch of

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
pins, as you might imagine.
And the pin,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
as you have a trace on a board,
a wire on a board there are

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
some capacitance attached to
wires, between the wire and

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
ground.
And that is a capacitor.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And they just called it a load
capacitance.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
It could have been 0.1 pF or
0.01 pF or something like that.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
What they found when they built
this chip --

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
What they found was that the
voltage here they expected to

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
look like this,
this computer science

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
abstraction and so on,
zero to one transition,

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
boom, it should look like this.
But for the reasons we saw

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
today the observed transition
was much slower and looked like

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
this.
So the students said ah-ha,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
let's speed up this chip.
We can speed up the chip by

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
looking at the RL and RON of my
driving inverters.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
And if I make RL small --
Notice if I make RL small my

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
delay is small.
If I make RON small my falling

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
delay is small.
So let's make really small RLs

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
and RONs and let's all have fun.
Unfortunately,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
what they observed was that by
making RL and RON both small,

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000
the RC time constant small they
expected to see a much sharper

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
rise time.
And this was the original.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
But what really happened was --
They expected this to get

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
faster and kind of look like
this, but what happened was

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
disaster struck.
What they observed was

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
something like that.
This is a real-life story.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
And so instead of getting
something like this they go

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
something like this.
And why is that a problem?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
That is a problem because
notice when I expect to be at a

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
zero, I got some spikes that
went higher than VIL into the

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
forbidden region and did bad
things to me.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
So let me show you a little
demo and show you that that's

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
exactly how the circuit is
behaving.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Notice that this is what I
expect but this is what I see.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Look at the purple curve here.
Notice these spikes that are

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000
showing up there.
This is true.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
They saw it happen.
And why is this happening?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000
It turns out that what was
happening was that the two pins

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
were next to each other.
And I will show you a little

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
demonstration here.
Let's see if you can figure out

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
why this was happening.
Think of these as two pins and

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
the pins are close together.
I am just modeling the two pins

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
with a role of wire.
And what I am going to do is --

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I am going to separate the
wires and keep them far apart.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
It is like keeping my pins far
apart.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Hey, guess what happened?
Those nasty spikes went away.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
But then I cannot keep my pins
1 meter apart on a chip.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Your laptops are going to look
20 yards long.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
You want the pins to be very
close to each other so that you

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
can have many pins on chips and
therefore have very small

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
systems.
But then look,

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
I get the spikes.
Any idea why that is happening?

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Why is that when the pins are
close together I get those

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
spikes?
Any ideas?

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Somewhat?
We just learned about

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
capacitors, so this must have to
do with capacitors.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000
There is this parasitic
capacitor between the pins,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
exactly.
Here is what is happening.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Here is what I expect.
I expect a nice square wave at

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000
the output.
But instead I have a pin next

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000
to me.
And I have a faster wave form

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
driving it.
And so therefore there is a

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
parasitic capacitor here.
And because of that I get

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000
something called "crosstalk".
And the model for crosstalk is

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
some resultant resistance with
the parasitic capacitor and I

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
get those spikes.
And the 6.002 experts saw the

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
solution.
They said how do we fix this

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
problem?
6.002 experts said the way we

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
fix this problem if it is slow
it may be better.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Instead of having sharp
transitions let me drive it with

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000
slower transitions.
Let's switch to the demo again.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
You will see this in
recitation, but I will show you

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000
the demo very quickly.
I have a sharp transition of

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
the input, which is that yellow
thing out there.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
I am going to make the
transition slower.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Switch to a triangular wave.
And you will notice the spikes

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
go away.
Oh, no.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
That is the wrong one.
The other one.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
There you go.
The moment I switch to a slower

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
transition boom,
the spikes go away.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
You want to switch back to
square?

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
There you go.
The 6.002 experts saw the

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
solution.
Slower transitions.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000
And you will do this example in
detail in Section tomorrow.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Thank you.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's get going,
here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Remember where we were?
We were trying to figure out

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the structure of the atom.
At the beginning of the course,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we saw classical physics,
classical mechanics fail to

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
describe how that electron in
the nucleus hung together.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then we started talking about
this wave-particle duality of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
light and matter.
We saw that radiation and

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
matter both can exhibit both
wave-like properties and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
particle-like properties.
And it was really important,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
this observation of Davisson
and Germer, and George Thompson,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
this observation that electrons
exhibited inference phenomena.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That is when you took electrons
and scattered them from a nickel

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
single crystal.
The electrons scattered back as

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
if they were behaving as waves.
There were diffraction

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
phenomena or interference
phenomena, bright,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
dark, bright,
dark patterns of electrons.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Actually, that Davisson and
Germer paper is on our website.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You are welcome to take a look
at that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It was just that observation,
coupled with de Broglie's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
insight into Schrödinger's
relativistic equations of motion

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that led Schrödinger to say,
well, maybe what I need to do

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is I need to treat the wave-like
properties of that electron in a

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
hydrogen atom.
Maybe that is the key.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In particular,
maybe that is the key because

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the electron has a de Broglie
wavelength that is on the order

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
of the size of its environment.
Maybe, in those cases,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I need to treat the particle as
a wave and not as a particle

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
with classical mechanics.
He wrote down this wave

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
equation, an equation of motion
for waves, this H Psi equals E

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Psi, where we said last time we
are going to represent the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
electron, our particle,
by this Psi,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the wave.
We are going to call it a wavef

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
unction because we are going to
put a functional form to it very

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
soon.
And there was some kind of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
operator, here,
called the Hamiltonian

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
operator, that operated on this
wave function.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And, when it did,
you got back the same wave

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
function times a constant E.
And this constant,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
as we are going to see,
is going to be the binding

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
energy of the electron to the
nucleus.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But then, we took a little
detour and I said,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
well, let's see if we can
derive, in a sense,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the Schrödinger equation.
And that is what we started to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
do.
And I am really doing this for

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
fun, you are not responsible for
it, but I am doing it because I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
want you to see just how easy
this is.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
To illustrate this,
I am just going to take a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
one-dimensional problem.
I am going to let my electron

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
be represented by this wave,
one-dimension,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Psi of x.
2 a cosine 2 pi x over lambda.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And then I said,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
suppose I want an equation of
motion, I want to know how that

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Psi changes with x.
Well, you already know that if

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I take the derivative of Psi
with x, that is going to tell me

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
how Psi changes with x.
And we did that last time.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And then I said,
well, I want to know the rate

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
of change of Psi with x.
I am going to take the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
derivative again.
I have the second derivative of

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Psi of x.
And that is what we got last

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
time.
And then, I noticed that in the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
second derivative,
and you noticed,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
too, somebody said this was
recursive, that we have our

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
original wave function back in
this expression.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I can rewrite that whole second
derivative here just as minus 2

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
pi squared, quantity squared,
over lambda,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
psi of x.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So far,
this is just any old wave

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
equation.
Nothing special about this.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This anybody could,
and had, written down before.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
What is special is that
Schrödinger realized,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
here, that if this is going to
be a wave equation for a

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
particle, then maybe this lambda
here, maybe I ought to put in

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
for lambda what de Broglie told
me.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And that is h over p.
Maybe this lambda here is the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
wavelength of a matter wave,
so let me write this expression

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
in terms of the momentum of the
particle, where the momentum has

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
this mass m in it.
And so when he did this,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
this became minus p squared
over h bar squared,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
we said hbar is h over 2pi,
times psi of x.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Hey, this is getting good

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
because now we have a Psi of x
over here.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But then what he said was,
well, I want to write this

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
momentum in terms of the total
energy.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Total energy is always kinetic
plus potential.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The kinetic energy,
we said the other day,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
can be written in terms of the
momentum.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The kinetic energy is p squared
over 2m-- plus the potential

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
energy. And I

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
am going to make this as a
function of x,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the potential energy.
Now, I am just going to solve

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
this for p squared.
p squared is equal to 2m times

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the total energy minus this
potential energy.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Now, I am going to
plug this into

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
here right in there.
And, when I do that,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I am going to get the second
derivative of Psi of x with

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
respect to x equals minus 2m
over h bar squared times E minus

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
U of x times Psi of x.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Just simple
substitution for p

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
squared there.
Nothing else.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Now, I am going to do some
rearranging.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And the rearranging,
on the right-hand side,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
is I am going to have only E
times Psi of x.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
E times Psi of x looks like the
right-hand side of the

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Schrödinger as I wrote it down.
That is good.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
When I rearrange this,
I get minus hbar squared over

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
2m times the second derivative
of Psi of x with respect to x

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
plus U of x times Psi of x
equals E times Psi of x.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And now, I am going to pull out
a Psi of x here,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
so that is minus hbar squared
over 2m second derivative with

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
respect to x plus U of x,
the quantity times Psi of x

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
equals E times Psi of x.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And guess what?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
We've got it.
We got it because all of this

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is what we define as the
Hamiltonian.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
All of this is h hat.
H hat, operating on Psi of x,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
gives us E times Psi of x.
This Hamiltonian,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
as you will learn
later on, is a kinetic energy

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
operator.
This is the potential energy

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
operator operating on psi.
That is the Schrödinger

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
equation.
It is hardly a derivation.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It is taking derivatives.
It is a wave equation.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
The insight came right here,
this substitution of the de

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Broglie wavelength in an
ordinary wave equation.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
This is the insight,
getting that momentum in there

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
with the mass,
making this,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
then, an equation for a matter
wave.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
That is it.
You just "derived the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Schrödinger equation." Easy.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Bottom line here is that the
Schrödinger equation is to

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
quantum mechanics like Newton's
equations are to classical

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
mechanics.
When the wavelength of a

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
particle is on the order of the
size of its environment,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
the equation of motion that you
have to use to describe that

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
particle moving within some
potential field U of x

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
or U, you have to us this
equation of motion and not

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Newton's equations.
Newton's equations don't work

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
to describe the motion of any
particle whose wavelength is on

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
the order of the size of the
environment.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
It just does not work.
Now, just as an aside,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000
classical mechanics really is
embedded in quantum mechanics.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
That is, if you took a problem
and solved it quantum

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
mechanically,
and you solved the problem,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
a problem for which the
wavelength of a particle was

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
much, much greater than the size
of the environment,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
which is the classical limit,
quantum mechanics would give

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
you the right answer.
In other words,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
say you took some problem where
the wavelength of the particle

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
is larger than the size of the
environment.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
That is, a problem where you
would normally use classical

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
mechanics.
But if you use quantum

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
mechanics, you would get the
right answer,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
if you could solve the problem
because the equations are very

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
difficult.
But, in principle,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
you would get the right answer.
However, if you took a quantum

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
mechanical problem,
that is, a problem where the

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
wavelength of the particle is on
the order of the size of the

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
environment and you used
classical mechanics,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
well, you won't get the right
answer.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Because classical mechanics is,
in a sense, a subset.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It is contained within quantum
mechanics.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It is a limit of quantum
mechanics.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
We have to learn a new kind of
mechanics, here,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
this mechanics for the motion
of waves.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Now, for a hydrogen atom,
we have to think of the wave

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
function in three dimensions
instead of just one dimension,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
here.
And so we are going to have to

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
describe the particle in terms
of three position coordinates.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Usually you use Cartesian
coordinates, x,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
y, and z.
But this problem is solvable

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
exactly if we use spherical
coordinates.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
How many of you had spherical
coordinates before and know what

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
we are talking about?
Not everybody.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
If I gave you an x,
y and z for this electron in

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
this atom, where the nucleus was
pinned at the origin.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
If I gave you an x,
y and z coordinate,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
you would know where that
electron was.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
But, alternatively,
I could tell you the position

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of this electron using spherical
coordinates.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
That is, I could tell you what
the distance is of the electron

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
from the nucleus.
I am going to call that r.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
That will be one of the
variables.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I could then also tell you this
angle theta.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Theta is the angle that r makes
from the z-axis.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
That is the second coordinate.
And then, finally,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
the third coordinate is phi.
Phi is the angle made by the

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
following.
If I take the electron and drop

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
it perpendicular to the
x,y-plane and then I draw a line

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
here, well, the angle between
that line and the x-axis is the

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
angle phi.
Instead of giving you x,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
y, and z, I am just going to
give you r, theta,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and phi in spherical
coordinates.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And now, this wave function is
also a function of time,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and I will talk about that a
little bit probably next time.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So, that is the wave function
that is in some way going to

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
represent our electron.
I haven't told you exactly yet

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
how Psi represents the electron,
and I won't tell you that for

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
another few days.
Question?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
No.
I actually thought this was the

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
way the book set it up.
I may have it backwards.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I think this is the way our
book sets it up.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
It won't make a difference in
any of the problems we solve

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
here.
But, in general,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
if you are given a problem to
solve, you are going to have to

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
look and see how they define
their coordinate system.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Actually, somebody else asked
me that the other day.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Now, what we have to do is
actually set up the Hamiltonian

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
for the hydrogen atom.
That is, we have to set up the

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Hamiltonian specifically for the
hydrogen atom.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And we have to set it up in
terms of spherical coordinates,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
r, theta, and phi.
And when we do that,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and we are not actually going
to do that, that is what the

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Hamiltonian looks like.
Actually, this is in three

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
dimensions, and so if I were
doing it in the x,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
y, z, what I would have here is
a second derivative with respect

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
to y, plus a second derivative
with respect to z.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
That is what it would look like
in three dimensions in Cartesian

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
coordinates.
But when I transform from

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Cartesian coordinates to
spherical coordinates,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
an exercise that takes five
pages, and everybody should have

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
that experience once in their
life, but maybe now is not the

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
right time for that experience,
you do get this.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And essentially,
the Hamiltonian is a sum of

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
second derivatives with respect
to each one of the coordinates,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
because essentially this term
is a second derivative with

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
respect to r.
This term is a second

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
derivative with respect to
theta.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
This term is a second
derivative with respect to phi.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
That is the specific
Hamiltonian.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
These are all kinetic energy
operators, as you will learn

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
later on.
And then there is this term

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
here, U of r.
This U of r,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
what is that?
What is U(r)?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Potential energy.
It is the Coulomb potential

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
energy of interaction.
It is isotropic,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
meaning it is the same at all
angles.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
The only thing it depends on is
the distance of the electron

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
from the nucleus.
It only depends on r.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
It doesn't depend on theta and
phi.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
So, that is the Schrödinger
equation for the hydrogen atom.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
It is a differential equation,
second-order ordinary

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
differential equation.
In 18.03, you are going to

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
learn how to solve that.
In 5.61, or 8.04 I think it is,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
in physics, in quantum
mechanics, you are going to

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
solve that.
You can do that.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
It is not hard.
But what do I mean when I say

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
solve?
What I mean is that we are

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
going to calculate these Es,
these binding energies,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
this constant in front of the
psi.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
That is called an eigenvalue,
for those of you who might know

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000
something already about these
kinds of differential equations.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
This E is the binding energy of
the electron to the nucleus.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
We are going to look at those
results in just a moment.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And the other quantity we are
going to solve for,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
here, is psi.
What we are going to want to

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
find is the actual functional
form for the wave functions.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
That, we can get out of solving
this differential equation.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
The actual functional form for
psi.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
The functional form is going to
be more complicated than what I

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
wrote here, but we can get that.
We will look at that in a few

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
days from now.
And do you know what those wave

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
functions are?
They are what you studied in

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
high school as orbitals.
You talked about an s-orbital,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
p-orbital, d-orbital.
Orbitals are wave functions.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
That where they come from,
orbitals, from solving the

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Schrödinger equation.
Now, specifically,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
orbitals are the spatial part
of a wave function.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
There is also a spin part to
the wave function,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
but for all intents and
purposes, we are going to use

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
the term orbital and wave
function interchangeably because

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
they are the same thing.
Question?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
We are going to get to that in
just a moment,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
and if you think I don't answer
it then we will go back to it.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
We are going to solve this.
And this equation is going to

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
predict binding energies,
and it is going to predict

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
these wave functions in
agreement with our observations,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
and it is going to predict that
the hydrogen atom is stable.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Remember when we tried to
predict the hydrogen atom using

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
classical ideas?
We found it lived a whole

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
whopping 10^-10 seconds.
Not so when we treat the

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
hydrogen atom with the quantum
mechanical equations of motion.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Let's write down the results
for solving the Schrödinger

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
equation.
And the part I am going to

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
concentrate on today is these
binding energies.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
And, on Friday,
we will talk about the wave

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
function, solving the
Schrödinger equation for those

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
wave functions.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
What does the binding energy
look like?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Well, the binding energies,
here, coming out of the

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Schrödinger equation look like
this, minus 1 over n squared

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
times m e to the 4 over 8
epsilon nought squared time h

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
squared.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
m is the mass of the electron.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
e is the charge on the
electron.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Epsilon nought is this
permittivity of vacuum we talked

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
about before.
This is a conversion between

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
ESU units and SI units.
h is Planck's constant.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Planck's constant is
ubiquitous.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
It is everywhere.
What we typically do is we lump

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
these constants together.
And we call those constants a

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
new constant,
the Rydberg constant,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
R sub H.
And so our expression is equal

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000
to minus R sub H over n squared.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000
The value of R sub H is equal
to 2.17987x10^-18 joules.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:43.000
That is a number that you are
going to use a lot in the next

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
few days.
But what you also see,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
here, is an n.
What is n?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Well, n is what we call the
principle quantum number.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And its allowed values are
integers, where the integers

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
start with 1,
2, 3, all the way up to n is

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
equal to infinity.
Well, let's try to understand

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
this a little bit more by
looking at an energy level

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
diagram again.
I am just plotting here energy.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Here is the zero of energy.
Here is the expression for the

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
energy levels that come out of
the Schrödinger equation.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
When n is equal to one,
that is the lowest allowed

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
value for n, binding energy is
essentially equal to minus the

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Rydberg constant.
**E = -(R)H**

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
But our equation says the
binding energy of the electron

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
can also be this value because
when n is equal to 2,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
well, the binding energy now is
only a quarter of the Rydberg

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
constant. It is higher

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
in energy.
When n is equal to 3,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
well, the binding energy of
that electron to the nucleus is

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
a ninth to the Rydberg constant.
When it is equal to 4,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
it is a sixteenth.
When it is equal to 5,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
it is a twenty-fifth.
When it is equal to six,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
it is a thirty-sixth.
So on, so on,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
and so on until it gets n equal
to infinity.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
When n is equal to infinity,
then the binding energy is

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
zero.
When n is equal to infinity,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
the electron and the nucleus
are no longer bound.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
They are separated from each
other.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
They don't hang together when n
is equal to infinity.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Now, this is rather peculiar.
This is saying that the binding

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
energy of the electron to the
nucleus can have essentially an

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.000
infinite number of values,
except it is a discrete number

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
of infinite numbers of values.
In the sense that the binding

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
energy can be this or this or
this, but it cannot be something

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
in between, here or here or
here.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
This is the quantum nature of
the hydrogen atom.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
There are allowed energy
levels.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Where did this quantization
come from?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
It came from solving the
Schrödinger equation.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
When you solve a differential
equation, as you will learn,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
and that differential equation
applies to some physical

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
problem, in order to make that
differential equation specific

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
to your physical problem,
you often have to apply

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
something called boundary
conditions to the problem.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
When you do that,
that is when this quantization

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
comes out.
It drops out of solving the

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
differential equation.
What are boundary conditions?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Well, remember I told you in
the spherical coordinate system,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
r, theta, phi?
Well, phi sweeps from zero to

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
360 degrees.
Well, if you just went 90

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
degrees further,
so if you went to 450 degrees,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
you really have the same
situation as you had when phi

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
was equal to 90 degrees.
What you have to do in a

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
differential equation,
which usually has a series as a

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
solution, is that you have to
cut it off.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
You have to apply boundary
conditions.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
You have to cut it off at
degrees.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Because otherwise you just have
the same problem that you had

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
before.
This is a cyclical boundary

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
condition.
And it is that cutting it off

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
to make the equation be really
pertinent or apply to your

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
physical problem,
that is what leads to these

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
boundary conditions,
mathematically.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
That is where it comes from.
That is where all the

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
quantization comes from.
Now, let's talk a little bit

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
about the significance here of
these binding energies because

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
somebody asked me about it
already.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
When the electron is bound to
the nucleus with this much

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
energy, we say that the electron
is in the n equals 1 state,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
or equivalently,
we say that the hydrogen atom

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
is in the n equals 1 state.
We use both kinds of

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
expressions equivalently.
When the hydrogen atom or the

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
electron is in the n equals 1
state, we call that the ground

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
state.
The ground state is the lowest

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
energy state.
The electron is most strongly

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
bound there.
The binding energy is most

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
negative.
And the physical significance

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
of that binding energy is that
it is minus the ionization

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
energy.
Or, alternatively,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
the ionization energy is minus
the binding energy.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
It is going to require this
much energy, from here to here,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
to rip the electron off of the
nucleus.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
The binding energy here is
minus the ionization energy.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
That is the physical
significance of it.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Now, did you ask me about the
work function?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Okay.
The work function is the

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
ionization energy when we talk
about a solid.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
That is just a terminology,
that is historical.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
When we talk about ripping and
electron off of a solid,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
we call it the work function.
When we talk about ripping it

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
off of an atom or a molecule,
we call it the ionization

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
energy.
And the other important thing

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
to know here is that when we
talk about ionization energy,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
we are usually talking about
the energy required to pull the

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
electron off when the molecule
or the atom is in the lowest

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
energy state,
the ground state.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
That is also important.
But our equations tell us we

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
also can have a hydrogen atom in
the n equals 2 state.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
If the hydrogen atom is in the
n equals 2 state,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
it is in an excited state.
Actually, it is the first

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
excited state.
The electron is bound less

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
strongly.
It is bound less strongly,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
and consequently,
the ionization energy from an

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
excited state hydrogen atom is
less because the electron is not

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
bound so strongly.
And, of course,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
we could have a hydrogen at n
equals 3, n equals 4 and n

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
equals 5, any of these allowed
energy levels.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Not all at the same time,
but, at any given time,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
if you had a lot of hydrogen
atoms, you could have hydrogen

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
atoms in all of these different
states.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Now, the other point that I
want to make is that this

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Schrödinger result,
here, for the energy levels

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
predicts the energy levels of
all one electron atoms.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
What is a one electron atom?
Well, helium plus,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
that is a one electron atom or
a one electron ion.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Helium usually has two
electrons, but if we pull one

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
off it only has one left,
so it is a one electron atom.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Lithium double plus
is a one electron atom because

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
we pulled two of its three
electrons off.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
One electron is left,
and that is a one electron atom

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
or an ion.
Uranium plus 91 is

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
a one electron atom.
We pulled 91 electrons off,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
we have one left,
and that is a one electron

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
atom.
The Schrödinger equation will

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
predict what those energy levels
are, as long as you remember the

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Z squared up here.
For hydrogen,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Z is 1, and so it doesn't
appear.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
But Z is not one for all of
these other one electron atoms.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Where does the Z come from?
It comes from the Coulomb

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
interaction.
That potential energy of

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
interaction is the charge on the
electron times the charge on the

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
nucleus, which is Z times e.
That is where the Z squared

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
comes from.
We have to remember that.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Now, how do we know that the
Schrödinger's predictions for

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
these energy levels are correct,
are accurate?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Well, we have to do an
experiment.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
The experiment we are going to
do is we are going to take a

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
bulb here, pump it out,
and then we are going to fill

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
it up with molecular hydrogen.
And then in this bulb,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
there is a negative and a
positive electrode.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
What we are going to do is
crank up the potential energy

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
difference between those two so
high until finally that gas is

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
going to ignite,
just like that.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
And we are going to look at the
light coming out.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And what we are going to do is
we are going to disperse that

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
light.
We are going to send it through

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
a diffraction grating,
essentially.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And that is like an array of
slits.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
What you are going to see are
points of constructive and

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
destructive interference.
But in the constructive

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
interference,
you are going to see the color

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
separated.
There is going to be purple,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
blue, green,
etc.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
The reason is that the
different radiation,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
the different colors have
different wavelengths.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
They have different
wavelengths, then they have

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
slightly different points in
space at which constructive

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
interference occurs,
and so the light is dispersed

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
in space.
We are going to analyze what

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
the wavelengths of the light
that are being emitted from

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
these hydrogen atoms are.
See, the discharge pulls apart

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
the H two and makes
hydrogen atoms.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
We have to do this by taking a
diffraction grating.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
The TAs are going to give you a
pair of diffraction grating

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
glasses.
You are supposed to come and

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
look at the discharge here.
You can see it.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
I will turn it a little bit for
those of you on the sides here.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
And we will see what we see.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
If you cannot see the lamp,
you are welcome to get up and

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
move around so that you can see
it.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Can you do this light,
too?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
This one over here,
sir.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Can you move this one away?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
If you look up at the lights in
the room, you can see the whole

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
spectrum, because that is white
light.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
I am going to turn the lamp
over here so that you can see

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
this a little better.
The spectrum that you should

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
see is what is shown on the
board.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
If you look to the right of the
lamp, here, you should see a

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
purple line.
The purple line is actually

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
very light, so only if you are
up close are you going to see

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
the purple line.
You can see the blue line very

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
well.
That is very intense.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
The green line is also very
diffuse.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Again, only if you are close
are you going to be able to see

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
the green line.
And then, the red line is very

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
bright.
And now I am going to move this

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
over here so you have the
opportunity to see it.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Again, you are welcome to get
out of your seats and move

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000
around so that you can,
in fact, see it.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:24.000
What you should be seeing,
hey, interference phenomena

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
works.
Useful pointer.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
What you should see,
depending on which one of the

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
constructive interference
patterns you are looking at,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
there should be a purple line,
there should be a blue line,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
very intense,
purple is weak,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
green is rather week,
and the red is very intense.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
What is happening,
here?

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Well, what is happening is that
in this discharge,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
there is enough energy to put
some of the hydrogen atoms in a

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
high energy state.
And we will call that state E

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
sub i,
the energy of the initial

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
state.
Actually, that is an unstable

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
situation.
That hydrogen atom wants to

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
relax.
It wants to be in the lower

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
energy state.
And what happens is that it

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
does relax.
It relaxes.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
The electron falls into the
lower energy state,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
but, because it is lower
energy, it has to give up a

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
photon.
And so the photon that is

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
emitted, the energy of that
photon has to be exactly the

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
difference in energy between the
energy of the initial state and

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
the final state.
That is the quantum nature of

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
the hydrogen atom.
The photon that comes out has

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
to have that energy difference
exactly.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
And, therefore,
the frequency,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000
here, of the radiation coming
out is going to correspond to

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
that exact energy difference.
And, for the different

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
energies, for the different
transitions, you are going to

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
have very specific values of the
frequency of the radiation or

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
the wavelength of the radiation.
For example,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
some of those hydrogen atoms in
this discharge have been excited

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
to this excited state,
which we will call B.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
The energy difference between B
and this ground state here is

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
small.
Therefore, we are going to have

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
some radiation that is low
frequency because delta E,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
the difference in the energy
between the two states is small.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
And then there are going to be
some hydrogen atoms that are

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
going to be excited to this
state, the A state.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
And, relatively speaking,
that energy difference is

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
large.
There are going to be some

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
hydrogen atoms that are going to
be relaxing to this ground

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
state.
And when they do,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
since that energy difference is
large, the frequency of the

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
radiation coming off is going to
be high.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Or, correspondingly,
the wavelength of the radiation

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
coming off is going to be low
because the wavelength is

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
inversely proportional to the
frequency.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And, likewise,
for this transition we are

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
going to have some long
wavelength radiation emitted.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Well, let's see if we can
understand specifically the

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
spectrum, here,
in the visible range for the

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
hydrogen atom.
What I have done is to draw an

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
energy level diagram again.
Here is the energy of n equals

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
1, n equals 2,
n equals 3, etc.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Here is the n equals infinity,
up here.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
It turns out that this purple
line is a transition from a

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:30.000
hydrogen atom in the n equals 6
state to the n equals 2 state.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
That blue line is a transition
from n equals 5 to n equals 2,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:43.000
the green line is a transition
from n equals 4 to n equals 2

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
and the red line from n equals 3
to n equals 2.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Notice that since this energy
difference here is small,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
this line has a long
wavelength.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Since this energy difference is
larger, this line has a shorter

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
wavelength.
All of these transitions that

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
you are seeing in the visible
range have the final state of n

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
equals 2.
Now, how do we know that the

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Schrödinger equation is making
predictions that are consistent

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
with the frequencies or the
wavelengths of the radiation

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
that we observe here?
Well, we have got to do a plug

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
here.
This is the frequency that we

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
would expect.
It is the energy difference

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
between two states over H.
Here is the initial energy.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Here is the final energy.
We said that the Schrödinger

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
equation tells us that the
energies of the state are minus

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
R sub H over n.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
For the initial energy level,
it is minus R sub H over n sub

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
i squared. We plug

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
that in.
For the final energy level,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
well, it is minus R sub H over
n sub f,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
the final quantum number
squared.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
We plug that in.
We rearrange some things.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
And then this is the prediction
for the frequency.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
I said that this level right
here is the n equals 2 level,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
so we will plug in the two for
the final quantum state.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
And so this is then the
prediction for the frequencies

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
of the radiation to the n equals
2 level.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
You just plug in n equals 6,
n equals 5, n equals 4,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
n equals 3.
And you know what?

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
The frequencies that are
predicted match what we observe

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
to one part in 10^8.
There really is precise

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
agreement between the results of
the Schrödinger equation and

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
what we actually observe in
nature, therefore,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
we think it is correct.
And there are no experiments

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
that cast any doubt,
so far, on the Schrödinger

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
equation.
Now, the set of transitions

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
that we just looked at are these
transitions.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Plotted here is another
energy-level diagram for the

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
hydrogen atom.
Here is the n equals 1 state,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
n equals 2, n equals 3,
n equals 4.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
And we looked at all the
transitions that end up in the n

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
equals 2 state.
This set of transitions.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
It is called the Balmer series.
Now, the n equals 2 state is

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
not the ground state.
There is a transition from n

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
equals 6 to n equals 1,
the ground state.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
It is this one right here.
But, you see,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
that is a very high energy
transition.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Actually, this transition,
from n equals 6 to n equals 1,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
is in the ultraviolet range of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
And so you cannot see it with
the experiment that we did,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
but it is there.
And then, of course,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
the hydrogen atoms that relaxed
to n equals 2,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
well, they actually eventually
relax to n equals 1.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
And there is a transition
there, it is over here,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
n equals 2 to n equals 1.
But, again, that is a high

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
energy transition.
It is also in the ultraviolet

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
range of the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
And so all of these transitions
that end up in n equals 1 are in

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
the UV range.
They are called the Lyman

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
series.
All the transitions that end up

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
in n equals 2 are in the
visible.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
They are called the Balmer.
n equals 3, the Paschen,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
is in the infrared.
Brackett is in the infrared.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Pfund is in the infrared.
And so we cannot see these

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
easily.
Now, these are named for the

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
different discoverers.
The reason there are so many

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.000
discovers is because these are
all different frequency ranges.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Different frequencies of
radiation require different

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
kinds of detectors.
And so, depending on exactly

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
what kind of detector the
experimentalist had,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
that will dictate then which
one of these sets of transitions

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
he was able to discover.
But not only does this work for

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
emission, but this also works
for absorption.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
That is, we can have a hydrogen
atom in the ground state,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
a low energy state.
And if there is a photon around

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
that is exactly the energy
difference between these two

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
states, well,
that photon can be absorbed.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
If that photon is a little bit
higher in energy,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
it won't be absorbed.
If it is a little lower,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
it won't be absorbed.
It has to be exactly the

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
difference in the energies
between these two states.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Again, that is the quantum
nature of the hydrogen atom.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
And now, if you are calculating
the frequency for absorption,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
what I have done here is I have
reversed n sub i and n

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
sub f.
This is 1 over n sub i squared

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
instead of 1 over
n sub f squared,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
which was the case in emission.
And I have reversed this so

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
that you get a positive value
for the frequency of the

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
radiation absorbed.
We will have two different

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
equations for absorption and for
emission.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
So, those are the Schrödinger
equation results.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I forgot to announce that there
is a forum this evening from

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
5:00 to 6:00.
You should have signed up in

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000
recitation.
If you didn't,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
and still want to come,
send us an email and come.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
And we need the diffraction
glasses back as you are exiting.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
See you Friday.

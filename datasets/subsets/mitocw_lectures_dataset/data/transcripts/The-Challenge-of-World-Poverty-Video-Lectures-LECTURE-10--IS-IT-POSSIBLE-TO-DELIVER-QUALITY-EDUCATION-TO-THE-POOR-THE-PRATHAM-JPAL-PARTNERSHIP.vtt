00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.320
PROFESSOR: So today, we're
showing just a very short

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.760
video I just wanted
you to hear.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.350
And we're going to be talking
about Pratham today.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.280
We've had a very long
relationship with Pratham over

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.320
the years, we being J-PAL.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.140
That is me and Professor
Banerjee and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.090
several graduate students.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.800
And one of the leaders of is
this person, Rukmini Banerji

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.440
And it's sort of useful
to hear this.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.920
It's a very short segment where
she explains a little

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.690
bit what she sees the education
problem being about.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.000
And then we'll take
it from there.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.856
[VIDEO WITHHELD]

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:18.620
PROFESSOR: So I kind of wanted
to take one lecture to go in

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.560
detail to all of our work with
Pratham, not only because I

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.890
think Pratham is an amazing
organization, but also because

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.690
it will expose you to how we
learn about the problem, how

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.800
we build from one evolution to
the next, one project to the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.740
next, how one project is
bringing some more questions

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.430
then we started with, and how
the next project tries to get

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.250
at these questions, also how the
partnership with the local

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.370
partners develops and
works and all that.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.080
And to this, we are going to be
talking about this quality

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.800
problem, where we are trying
to address the basic point

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.330
that she makes.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.580
Kids are in school.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.780
At the moment, she talked at the
Clinton Global initiative,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.000
that was 90%.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.720
But the enrollment rates
are even higher

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.669
now, close to 100%.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.110
In some districts, it's more
than 100%, because some of the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.370
five-year-olds also go to
school, because that's kind of

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.090
a convenient way to
get babysitting.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.520
But despite that, the
achievement is low.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.530
She did point out the results
from the ASER survey.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.720
So every year, since 2005,
Pratham puts together teams of

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.750
people, local people,
who go from local

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.730
universities, et cetera.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.950
And they go in every single
district in India.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.690
How many districts did she
say there was in India?

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.470
She mentioned it
at some point.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.040
You see that everything
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.520
if you are listening
to the video.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.450
She said it at some point, how
many district they work in and

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.700
how many districts they have.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.170
If I'm not mistaken, she said
something like 600.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.430
So they are sending people to
every district in India, teams

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.800
of college students, local
volunteers, et cetera.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.520
They have a sampling.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.350
Of course they don't go
to every village.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.740
But they do a sample
in each district.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.910
And they administer a very
simple test of reading skills

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.520
and math skills.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.950
So the reading skill test
looks like a page.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.030
On the left side, you have
a very simple story.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.380
Like she said, I go to school.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.450
My brother goes to school.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.540
We like going to school.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.250
On the right side, you will
have single words and then

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.300
single letters.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.890
First, you start the child
with a very simple story.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.350
If they can do that, you bring
them to a slightly longer

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.590
story and try to measure
their comprehension.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.160
If they come to the very simple
story, you ask them to

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160
read a word.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.220
If they can't read a word, you
ask them to read a letter.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.710
So you, in this way, classify
your child as a nothing

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.310
reader, a letter reader, a word
reader, a small paragraph

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.300
reader, or a story reader.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.080
And the simple, small paragraph
reader is what you

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.470
should be able to do at the
end of the first grade.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.020
And what they find is, on
average, in 2005, that about

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.240
35,000 children, aged 7 to 14,
most of them are in school and

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.990
could not read a grade 1
paragraph and 60% could not

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.690
read a grade 2 story.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.330
So these are numbers on one
of the ASER survey.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.520
So blue is better in the maps
I'm going to show you.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.160
And this is the fraction of kids
who are out of school.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.020
And so that's quite a blue map,
because there are not

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.000
very many kids who are
out of school.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.210
And the colors here
are the same.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.590
This is now the reading
ability.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.350
This is the fraction of
kids who can read a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.050
standard one text.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.460
So it is the fraction of kids
who can read or understand one

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.880
text among the kids who
are enrolled in

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.110
standard three to five.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.500
So among children who are
enrolled in standard three to

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.100
five, how many of them can read
this grade one paragraph?

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.720
And you can see that
now we have a lot

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.150
of red in this card.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.770
The red is a bit distributed
in different places, but

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.790
mostly it's quite red.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.430
If you know India, does this map
look like what you would

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.995
expect for any social indicator
within India?

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.900
For anyone who knew India or
about India, because this is a

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.600
question that you might not
know the answer to.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.005
So it doesn't really, because
the folklore in India-- and if

00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:05.360
you look at immunization, that's
really what you get--

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.370
is that sort of the bad states
are these ones, Uttar Pradesh,

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.900
Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.180
These are what they call the
BIMARU state, Bihar,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.970
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.420
This is like where you have a
lot of boys and not very many

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.610
girls, suggesting infanticide
or selective abortion.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.870
This is where you have very
low immunization rate, bad

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.860
outcomes, of course,
as I mentioned.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.670
And these are the good states,
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.020
Tamil Nadu, Kerala.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.920
Kerala is, in particular, one of
Amartya Sen and John Rawls'

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.640
favorite states for its
successful education.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.870
Kerala does well here, almost
everyone can read.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.920
But what is surprising is
you have Tamil Nadu.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.780
They're very proud
of themselves.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.740
A lot of the kids are in
school, et cetera.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.970
It's very red.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.363
Less than half the kids enrolled
in [INAUDIBLE] three

00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:07.630
to five cannot read
a sentence.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.950
So that upset the government
of Tamil Nadu a great deal.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.910
So when the first ASER report
came out, they didn't believe

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:14.290
the result.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.350
That is not possible.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.000
They went ahead and did their
own test, but they found the

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.430
same thing again.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.640
So this suggests that there
is something different.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.230
It's not only like disorganized
places that are

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.350
unable to deliver
to their kids.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.900
Their is something maybe
deeper than that.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.220
And Bihar did surprisingly
well in not being at the

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.760
absolute bottom of the
barrel in this graph.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.010
So Bihar was happy.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.030
Another thing that's is maybe
even more troubling is this

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.225
survey has been done from 2005
to 2010, every year.

00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:52.680
It's been released in January
every year, on the Republic

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.310
Day in India.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.660
And there is no progress.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.180
So India is progressing across
all these dimensions, becoming

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.860
richer, there are fewer
poor people.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.430
We're seeing they're eating less
and less, which is not

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.430
progress, per se.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.110
But education, nothing,
no progress.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.920
Also troubling is it's not
an Indian exception.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.250
Surveys very similar to ASER
have been done in Kenya and

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.170
Uganda and Tanzania
and in Pakistan.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.750
And they all find similar
kind of things.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.015
A lot of children are in school,
most of them can't

00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:27.856
read anything.

00:08:27.856 --> 00:08:28.332
Yep?

00:08:28.332 --> 00:08:31.664
AUDIENCE: Is there still
progress across the board on

00:08:31.664 --> 00:08:33.568
average, like in the nation?

00:08:33.568 --> 00:08:37.082
Or the states are
static as well?

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:38.010
PROFESSOR: So you're
exactly right.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.200
That's a very good question.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.130
It's no progress across the
board in the nation, but the

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.510
states are not static.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.670
Some states start doing well
for a while, and means some

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.210
states are moving down
to compensate.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.150
So, for example, in the
last report, 2010,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.490
Punjab had a big progress.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.650
So that's one of the things they
are trying to look at is

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.330
why is Punjab suddenly
progressing?

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.350
What are they doing
that is different?

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.190
And I'm going to be able to
talk a bit about that.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.740
And in fact, in the Punjab
example, what they seem to be

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.680
doing that is different is
really to try to insist on

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.520
these core competencies
in the schools.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.830
They have a period of time,
every school day, two hours a

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.290
day, which are devoted to
teaching the kids at whatever

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.190
level they are forgetting
the curriculum.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.990
And that is what they think is
the reason why Punjab is

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.830
progressing.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.760
So what we are going
to do today is--

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.840
do we have evidence to suggest
that, in fact, they're right?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.400
And that is the key problem and,
therefore, the key of the

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.840
success of Punjab.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.910
Meanwhile, some other state,
like Uttar Pradesh, would be

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.940
going down.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.245
Ben?

00:09:49.245 --> 00:09:51.220
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.754
Is the student to teacher
ratio more or less?

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:55.158
I know these states are huge.

00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:57.030
But are they more or less
the same across

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.970
the different states?

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.590
PROFESSOR: So it's a
very good question.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.080
I think, they are, probably,
generally

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.160
more or less the same.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.480
And they are not horrible.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.540
Because, actually, being a
teacher is not a bad job.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.140
So there are a number of
teachers who are available.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.080
So you don't have the very,
very, large class size that

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.920
you have, for example, in a
country like Kenya, where,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.180
after free primary education,
the class size in grade one

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.190
was easily 70 to 80 children
per classroom.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.938
You have less of
that in India.

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:26.416
Yeah?

00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:29.523
AUDIENCE: So it seems like the
enrollment is high, but do

00:10:29.523 --> 00:10:32.485
they also track that the
attendance is high?

00:10:32.485 --> 00:10:33.675
PROFESSOR: So that's a
very good question.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.300
And the answer is that, yes,
they check attendance.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.340
And attendance is low.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:43.980
So attendance is low, both for
teachers and for children.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.140
So in Bihar, for example, we
have a survey of children's

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.390
attendance.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:55.510
The rate of absence is between
30 to 50% for kids.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.150
And we've done the same
thing in several

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.050
countries of the world.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.260
Generally, children's absence
is very, very high.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.050
So kids are enrolled, but
they don't show up.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.240
And it's not that they
are ghost enrollees.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.500
This 30% attendance is not
concentrated across 30% of

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.570
kids who never come.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.490
It's every child who is absent
one day, coming one day,

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.500
absent on day, coming one day.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.930
And that is one problem.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.230
So we have a lot of absence
of children.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.160
And we have a lot of absence
of teachers as well.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.680
So a survey was done in four to
five developing countries,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.450
by the World Bank,
including India.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.610
They found a very large
teacher absence rate.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.110
So in India, it was about
25% absence rate.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.670
And that's about what ASER found
as well, of teachers.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.980
So you show up to a school
during school hours, and you

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.160
have three of four
teachers who are

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.090
actually in the school.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.680
The second problem is that once
they are in the school,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.450
it is not a given that they
are actually teaching.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.310
So another one out of these four
teachers is actually in

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.110
school but not teaching.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.870
There was a funny report, a few
years ago, describing what

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.890
they were doing, ranging from
drinking tea to drawing

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.040
political posters.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.890
The reason being that a lot
of these teaching jobs are

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.310
patronage jobs, which are
filled by the political

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.580
parties, so they need to draw
their posters sometimes.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.830
So that means that the teachers
are present teaching

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.030
half the time.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.850
The students are, themselves,
present about half the time.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.250
That means the students get
about a quarter of the time

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.080
that they should get in
front of a teacher.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.940
This is a where, [? Hookman's ?]
point, that

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.530
you need a bit of time of
student-teacher interaction to

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.005
get teaching.

00:12:38.005 --> 00:12:40.120
It actually becomes
quite pertinent.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.840
Yep, sorry?

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.290
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the standard curriculum.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.230
What kind of things
does it teach?

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.680
Is there any [INAUDIBLE]
benefits from it?

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.620
Are there any kids who are
up to the curriculum?

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.900
PROFESSOR: So that's a
very good question.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.244
What is the curriculum?

00:12:54.244 --> 00:12:56.020
So the curriculum in India--

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.350
and that actually is true in
the countries I know--

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.370
tends to be very ambitious.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.080
And there are various
reasons why those

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.330
curriculum are very ambitious.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.010
They are probably more ambitious
than what is being

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.430
taught in the US.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.630
Actually, significantly more
ambitious than what is being

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.310
taught in US primary schools.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:23.830
We once showed up to a school.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.455
We were with the Pratham team.

00:13:25.455 --> 00:13:26.810
The visit was announced.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.570
The teacher wanted
to look good.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.760
And his idea of looking good was
to draw things like that

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.530
on the board, in this grade
three class, so all the kids

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.410
were like looking around.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.340
And it doesn't mean that this is
what he actually does on a

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.405
day in day out basis, but
it means it is what

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:45.140
they suggest to do.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.320
So it's not necessarily
a bad curriculum.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.340
In fact, India has a lot of
good, very good, very serious

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.700
education experts who are
thinking about educating the

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.510
child to a real, true
understanding of science.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.750
But for most of the children,
it's completely above their

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.090
head, very quickly.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.310
And then some of the children
benefit from it.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.130
We can see an example of
that very quickly.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.070
We'll see an example of
that very quickly.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.420
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.400
AUDIENCE: Is their proficiency
in math as bad as in

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:13.750
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.076
PROFESSOR: It tends
to be worse.

00:14:16.076 --> 00:14:19.440
So math is a bit worse
than reading.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.640
For example, if you look at
division, which is the

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.820
equivalent of your standard two
kid, you have like 20% of

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.070
kids can do division.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.460
So that's where we are.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.630
So this quality of education,
I was saying the other day,

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.810
has not concerned the policy
establishment, very much, for

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:41.420
many years.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.410
The policy establishment has
been more concerned about

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.165
getting as many children as
possible in schools, enrolled

00:14:48.165 --> 00:14:49.130
in schools.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.250
With the understanding that,
oh, if we can manage to get

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.630
them in schools, somehow
learning will happen.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.070
And the Turkey experiment is,
in a sense, an archetypal

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.840
example of that, which is
let's make education

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.880
compulsory, let's have boarding
schools, let's have

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.570
buses that are going to
bring the kids to

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.460
the boarding school.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.410
And then black box,
learning happens.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.570
You have an educated child.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:15.030
But it's been about 10 years
since academics have been a

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.210
bit puzzled at that.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.280
And looking at the quality of
education saying, how do we

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.500
make education actually work?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.720
What's important?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.070
And the first thing that jumps
at you, when you go to a

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:28.350
school in India, in Kenya, even
in rural Morocco, which

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.410
is a richer country,
is that there is

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.950
nothing in the school.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.010
The school is usually
very bare.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.530
You have fewer desks
than students.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.450
People are bunching like
three to a desk.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.900
They will usually have a
blackboard, very few

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.480
textbooks, and, of course,
nothing like computers and

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.910
things like that.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.300
So the first generation of
studies was about, well, they

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.160
have none of that.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.040
How can they learn?

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.260
Maybe what they need
is more material.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:00.580
And in fact, when the idea of
randomized evaluation started

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.470
to be applied to development,
Michael Kremer, who is a

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:09.330
professor at Harvard, wanted to
do a demonstration project,

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.410
wanted to show that it is
possible to do a randomized

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.010
evaluation.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.330
And it's interesting.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.460
And he wanted, for demonstration
purposes, an

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.790
example where it would clear
that it has an effect.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.030
And so he asked around,
et cetera.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.210
And he found out that what would
be obvious is textbooks.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.100
In Kenya, no one
has textbooks.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.400
If only we give textbooks to the
kids, obviously, they are

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.670
going to learn better.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.880
So that was his first example
that he chose, which was

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.680
chosen specifically to
demonstrate success.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.600
And running his experiment, he
was learning how to do an

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.570
experiment at the same time.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.080
So his first experiment was
very small, 14 schools, 7

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.340
treatment, 7 control,
and found no effect.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.370
He thought about it, and he
said, oh well, of course, it's

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.840
because I have so few schools.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.360
And you remember, when you have
schools, you need to take

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.760
into account, when you calculate
your standard error,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.579
that all these children
are similar.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:08.390
So he said, oh well, my
experiment is not big enough.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.030
So let's take a bigger
sample of schools.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.849
He took 100 schools.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:16.180
He took half of them and
again found no effect.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:20.099
So there he thought, well, maybe
the test is too hard.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.910
I'm using the test,
the normal test.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:22.730
Maybe that is too hard.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.980
Let me use a different test that
is going to be able to

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.060
discriminate progress even
at a lower level.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.330
And he got his experiment
started.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.880
And again, he found no effect.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.060
So there he started saying maybe
there is no effect, even

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.360
in a larger sample, even
with a better test.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.380
So maybe there is no effect.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.910
So eventually, what he found is
that, if you focus on the

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:50.070
children, who were already doing
well at the baseline,

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.690
then they benefit from
the textbooks.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.050
So that's a very long winded
answer to your question, which

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.260
is there are children who
benefit from the curriculum

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.910
and, therefore, benefit
from the textbooks.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.290
But it's a small minority.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.510
And the explanation he gave is
the textbooks are in English,

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.470
which makes sense, because the
curriculum in Kenyan schools

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.770
is in English.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.530
But a lot of children don't even
speak English, because

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.600
English is their
third language.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.500
They first speak their mother
tongue, the local language.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.940
Then they learn Swahili in
the first few grades.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.840
And then English is introduced
in grade one as a language,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.450
and then as a language of
instruction from grade three

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.650
or grade four.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:30.100
But the problem is that because
the kids aren't

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.180
actually learning effectively,
by the time they reach grade

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.410
five or six, they actually don't
know English, so the

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.900
textbooks are of no use.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.850
So exposed, it could
be understood what

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.440
was going on here.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.230
And then they tried
a bunch of stuff.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.330
Flip charts also
have no effect.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.940
Cutting the class size in two,
if you make no other

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.430
differences, also
has no effect.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.560
And a little bit worrisome,
things like the deworming

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.280
program, which increases
attendance, but it didn't

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.530
increase test scores.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.230
So it seemed that these
extra school

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.750
days also had no effect.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.810
So changing inputs
just didn't work.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.490
So maybe it's a problem that is
just incredibly difficult.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.440
So we were there a
few years ago.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.270
So what this common with all
this intervention is that they

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.100
are just changing the inputs.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.500
They are doing more of the same,
adding more textbooks,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.880
adding more teachers, adding
more resources.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.270
But they are no change to the
pedagogy and no change to the

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.490
incentives.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.510
So no one is given incentives.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.940
The teachers are not
given incentives.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.340
The students are not
given incentives.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.060
The parents are not
given incentives.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.650
And the pedagogy and the
curriculum stays the same.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.580
So that's kind of where we were
about five, six years

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.150
ago, a little bit depressed.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.830
Picture us, this was our first
set of randomized experiments

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.640
and nothing works.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.990
So we were thinking, maybe, this
is going to be the end of

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.650
randomized experiments,
because you can't be a

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.850
doomsayer forever, otherwise
people really hate you.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.750
So that's why we were
a little bit sad.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.670
Rukmini came to visit us,
shortly after that happened, a

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.140
few years after the
establishment of Pratham, came

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.360
here to MIT.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.280
Because a former MIT student
had gone to work

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.010
for them as an intern.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.660
A former undergraduate
student of ours had a

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.530
relationship with them.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.780
So Pratham started in 1994.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.130
At that time, it was established
by UNICEF to help

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.690
some kids in Bombay.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.130
It would be your typical, small
NGO doing some work in

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.940
Bombay, particularly what they
call bridge classes.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:45.370
Which is take a kid who is out
of school, give them a course

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.670
for a few months so that they
can try and go back to their

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.250
regular school.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.410
That's what they were doing.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.070
But they were ambitious.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.100
So there was the Rukmini that
you heard and Madhav Chavan

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.270
wanted to make a real
difference.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.120
So since then, they're
grown substantially.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.160
They've reached millions and
millions of children.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.300
I think there are about 38
million children, who are

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.590
reached by the Pratham program,
one way or the other,

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.600
so about half the population of
France, overall population

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.100
of France, just in
terms of scale.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.900
And so that's the largest
non-governmental organization

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.890
to do education in India,
probably in the world.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.150
And their motto is "every child
in school"-- that half

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.810
of the world would
agree with them--

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.910
"and learning well"--

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.750
is where, maybe, they have
a little difference.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.350
So they came to us towards
the beginning.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.240
And that's the reading
that read for today.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.540
They wanted to evaluate the
Balsakhi program, which was

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.450
the flagship program
at the time.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.680
Balsakhi means the friend
of the child.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.540
So the Balsakhi is a young
woman, from the

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.220
community, so an adult.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.190
Like she said, you need
some adult time.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:22:00.850
Barely an adult, some
18-year-old, usually having

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.440
only high school education,
so grade 10 to 12.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.480
And Pratham would give them a
very short training and then

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.910
dump them into the school,
with which they had an

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:16.590
agreement with the teachers that
the school would let them

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.785
pull out the kids who were
lagging behind in grade three

00:22:20.785 --> 00:22:22.800
of in grade four.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.340
So why is this a good
demographic, the 18-year-old,

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:33.620
grade 10 educated woman?

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.330
Why is that a good goal
to work with?

00:22:41.635 --> 00:22:42.120
Yep?

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.787
AUDIENCE: She's more familiar
with the community, so she can

00:22:44.787 --> 00:22:46.980
probably relate to
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.360
PROFESSOR: So that is one reason
is that she is more

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.450
known to the community,
because she's local.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.850
She's not much older.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.550
And she's not intimidating or
scary for the parents, who,

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.420
maybe, can work better
with the kids.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.140
That's a very good reason.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:58.750
What's another reason?

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.214
AUDIENCE: I would say for
the teacher's as well.

00:23:00.214 --> 00:23:02.654
Maybe the teachers are not as
intimidated that the balsakhi

00:23:02.654 --> 00:23:05.094
will go and teach these
students some really

00:23:05.094 --> 00:23:07.550
innovative thing that would
make [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.000
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.920
So for the teachers, she might
be not very intimidating,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.400
which will cut both ways.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.810
On the one hand, it's
more easily

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.050
acceptable for the teachers.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.080
On the other hand, there is a
tendency that teacher would

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.670
use the balsakhi to make
the tea or other

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.260
activities like that.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.520
And we are going to see some
of that happening, not

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.360
actually in Baroda.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.818
Yep?

00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:29.148
AUDIENCE: So she's locally
trained, which makes sense in

00:23:29.148 --> 00:23:30.940
kind of [INAUDIBLE]
perspective.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.420
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.090
She is locally trained,
only for two weeks.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.560
This is very cheap.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.140
And there is another
aspect of the cost.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.136
Yeah?

00:23:39.136 --> 00:23:41.294
AUDIENCE: Not about the cost,
but she might be more

00:23:41.294 --> 00:23:44.614
motivated to help the
[INAUDIBLE] children, because

00:23:44.614 --> 00:23:49.096
it's not like this is a second
job she can perform.

00:23:49.096 --> 00:23:50.590
It's not a fallback option.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.744
It's something that she
wants to do that is a

00:23:53.744 --> 00:23:54.574
period in her life.

00:23:54.574 --> 00:23:56.070
It seems a bit time sensitive.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.590
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.270
So she might be more motivated
for this reason.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.680
Also for what you said earlier,
that she's close to

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.440
them, et cetera.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.220
But also this is something that
she effectively chose to

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.440
do at this point and not
something that is just putting

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.876
money in a bank account.

00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:13.830
AUDIENCE: She's not highly
qualified, so the [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.680
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.050
She's not highly qualified,
so she's cheap.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.120
What is another reason
why she is cheap?

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.410
Why don't these people go
and do something else?

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:29.330
AUDIENCE: Also there's a high
turnover in these [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.025
make a certain income to teach,
so you're not really

00:24:32.025 --> 00:24:34.720
relying on this thing.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.140
It's [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.043
quality of the teaching.

00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:39.458
It doesn't have to be like a
small, really enthusiastic

00:24:39.458 --> 00:24:40.708
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:43.322 --> 00:24:46.220
So it's easy to get
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.280
They have high turnover, which
could be a plus or a minus.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.140
On the minus side, of course,
you don't get the experience.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.460
On the plus side, you
don't get tired.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.320
And you don't rely on people
who have a huge vocation.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.260
You rely on people getting
enthusiastic for one year.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.730
So very much along the model
of Teach For America, where

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:15.010
you get MIT, graduating from
school, energetic about

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:15.890
wanting to do this.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.960
A bit of what you're saying,
which is it's what I want to

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.680
do at this point in my life.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.160
And then by the time you
don't want to do it

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.630
any more, you stop.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.000
And there is one more thing
about them, specifically,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.066
which makes them cheap.

00:25:29.066 --> 00:25:30.518
AUDIENCE: Everything
about them.

00:25:30.518 --> 00:25:34.027
I mean I think there's like a
good chance that they have

00:25:34.027 --> 00:25:35.842
families or that they're part of
a family, and maybe that's

00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:37.294
why they're stuck in the area.

00:25:37.294 --> 00:25:38.988
And they don't necessarily
have the ability to go

00:25:38.988 --> 00:25:40.700
somewhere else.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.560
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.410
That's a very important point.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.280
Most of these women
are unmarried.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.650
They are living at home.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.420
They are sort of waiting
to be married.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.990
And there is actually not
much they can do.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.290
Because the parents won't
let them leave.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.070
And mostly, their parents won't
let them work, because

00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:00.030
working is not becoming for a
certain, sort of lower, middle

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:03.290
class category woman, waiting
to be married.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.350
You shouldn't be like working.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.230
You should be able to be--

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.970
it's not a good signal for the
family that they're not able

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.290
to provide for you
and all that.

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.560
But this is hardly
seen as working.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:20.210
This is more like volunteering
and helping your community and

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.210
things like that.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.705
So they can do that.

00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:24.210
So they are sort of available.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:28.150
So one part of the genius of
Pratham is that they identify

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.390
a group of people who
are actually sort of

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:31.890
available for free.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.880
Here, they pay them, but in
future programs, that I'm

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.820
going to talk to you a minute
after, they're not even paid.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.002
They are just unpaid.

00:26:39.002 --> 00:26:40.350
They do that for a while.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:46.790
And that get some, presumably,
other rewards of doing that,

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:50.230
which are more in the form of
intrinsic reward of seeing the

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.570
kid progress, and, therefore,
you also select people who are

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.260
motivated in that dimension
as one of you pointed out.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.610
So that's all of the pluses.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.440
The minuses you already
mentioned.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.060
The turnover is one of them.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.490
You can't get them to
get experienced.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.660
The second minus is
that they're, of

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.140
course, much less educated.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.520
Maybe there is some good reasons
why a teacher needs a

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.750
college degree.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.890
Maybe it's actually terrible
to take the kid out of the

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.050
classroom to put them in front
of someone who knows nothing.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.870
So that's kind of the
risk that would

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.890
potentially be there.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.930
So that's the program.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:36.970
And when they came to see us,
we were wondering how to

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:41.730
evaluate this program, with
them, in an experiment, in a

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:47.800
way that is not going to cause
a problem for them in the

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.820
city, that's not going to hinder
their work too much.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.660
And that's experimental design
that we decided to

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.860
adopt in a new place.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.740
So Vadodara and Gujarat, those
were places where they had not

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.460
worked at all.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.040
Had about 100 schools.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.220
A little more than 100 schools
divided in two groups,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:15.120
randomly, with the
computer, group A

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.820
schools and group B schools.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.020
The group A schools
got the balsakhi

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.310
for grade three children.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.180
The group B schools
got the balsakhi

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.070
for grade four children.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:29.170
So what's an advantage of this
design from the point of view

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.180
of political acceptability?

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.160
Why did we go like this, instead
of doing the more

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.010
standard thing, which would be
to say, well, in group A

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.220
treatment, and grade three and
grade four get the balsakhi

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.380
and group B, no one
gets a balsakhi?

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.500
AUDIENCE: Well, in a way, if you
don't give one group any

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.620
treatment at all, you're
almost sabotaging your

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.510
education [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.360
PROFESSOR: Sabotaging
is a strong word.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.880
But exactly the idea is that
this allows you to be present

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.960
in every school.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.380
So Pratham is not
infinitely rich.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.990
They can easily argue-- and I
think that was very true at

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.820
that time-- that look,
we can give you one

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.620
balsakhi per school.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.460
We can't afford more.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.920
So you either put it in three
or you put it in four.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.520
We can't give you both.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.670
But at least every school
is being engaged with.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.880
So they are engaged with
the system as a whole.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.780
And no school is
disadvantaged.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.040
That makes it easier for the
school system to say, yes,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:37.870
they are just working with us.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.510
They are part of us.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.480
It also makes data collection
much easier, because you're

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.000
involved with everyone.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.790
What is a potential danger
of this design?

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.070
The plus is what I just said.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.800
What's the potential minus?

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.180
Since you have a balsakhi in
every school, what's the

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.592
potential minus?

00:30:02.592 --> 00:30:05.227
AUDIENCE: They might not just
be teaching grade three.

00:30:05.227 --> 00:30:08.150
The might be overlapping grade
three and four or something.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:08.573
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:13.150
The balsakhi might take both
groups, so that your control

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.605
group becomes partly treated.

00:30:16.605 --> 00:30:18.710
Or even if it's not the
balsakhi, the head teacher

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.920
might say, oh great, we have
a balsakhi for grade three.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:27.210
So we're going to take the
teacher out of grade three and

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.550
use it to divide grade
four in two.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.790
And so grade four would
be associated.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.960
Or they could say, well, since
the grade three got the

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.660
balsakhi, when some other
organization comes with

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.170
computers, well, we'll put
them in grade four.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.970
So there is a danger of
resources being reallocated

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.950
across grades in a way that
contaminates your treatment.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.230
So fortunately, that was not
really an issue there, because

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:55.670
in Vadodara, the way the school
system is organized, a

00:30:55.670 --> 00:31:00.460
school is made of one teacher
per grade, regardless.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.460
Sometimes in the same school
building, you have more than

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.970
one school.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.680
And that happens sometimes
in the US as well.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.510
You have this charter school and
the regular school sharing

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.720
the same school building.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.380
In Vadodara what happened is,
if it's a big school, it's

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.030
actually a big school building,
but under totally

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.090
separate administration.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.790
So a school is made of five
teachers and a head teacher.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.700
That's it.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.530
So there is less scope for
reallocating, because you have

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.470
your one teacher anyway.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.370
And they're also not very
imaginative in terms of using

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.000
the resources in the
most optimal way.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.800
So that turned out not
to be a problem.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.770
So the way we evaluated the
program is then by comparing

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.910
grade three, group
A's treatment

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.080
compared with control.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.850
And in grade four, that's
the opposite.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.800
We also worked in Bombay.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.220
So that's the second year
we have asked a group.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.930
So if you were a kid who was
in grade three, in group A,

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:57.200
you are treated in grade three
and then, again, you are

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.000
treated in grade four,
because you would

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.610
have moved one grade.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:06.530
If you were a kid who entered in
grade four, you would never

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:07.790
be treated.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.270
Or if you were a kid who entered
grade three in group

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.940
B, you also would never
be treated.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.840
So we have kids treated one
year, kids treated two years,

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.830
and kids treated one year.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:24.410
And then in Bombay, we did
something similar.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:27.550
This is Shobhini She used
to work at Pratham.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.880
And now she's one of the
executive director of J-PAL

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.310
South Asia.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.280
You can say, hi, to her.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.330
And in Bombay, we did something
similar, except we

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.160
started in grade two, three,
and then moved

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.180
it to three, four.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.950
The reason why we switched is
that they realized that they

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:48.030
didn't have right pedagogy for
engaging with the grade two

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.110
children, that the grade two
children were too small, and

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.890
they didn't know how
to deal with them.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.510
The initial plan was to do two,
three and then reverse

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.650
again, two, three.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.500
And then they turned out that
they weren't happy with

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.560
they're grade two, so they
moved three, four.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.930
So that's kind of the idea.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.150
So this is the design.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.620
So in principle, now, we could
say, well, they're good.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.230
We have the designs.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.430
Now, all we need to do is to
compare treatment and control

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:16.980
after one year and after
two years, and

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.440
we're going to be done.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:23.090
But unfortunately, when you run
real experiments, you get

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:24.395
real problems.

00:33:24.395 --> 00:33:27.190
I've yet to meet an experiment
where there was no problems.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.080
And this was, at least,
my first big one.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.020
So we had a lot of problems
that I want to talk about.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:39.110
The first one is the way to
evaluate the program was to

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.720
administer a test
in the school.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.610
And we had some issue
with the test.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.610
The first one is that,
as I was saying, a

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.360
lot of kids are absent.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:55.670
And if we only tested the kids
who were present in school, we

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.920
have some attrition.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.620
Maybe in urban India,
absenteeism is less bad, but

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.780
maybe 20% of kids are absent on
a given day, so they don't

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.400
take the test.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.719
So why is that potentially a
problem to have missing kids

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:13.460
in the test?

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.448
Yep?

00:34:14.448 --> 00:34:16.671
AUDIENCE: Maybe the kids that
are absent are those that are

00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:20.376
more likely to not [INAUDIBLE]
class, and so they either

00:34:20.376 --> 00:34:22.846
chose or their parents chose
that, maybe, they could better

00:34:22.846 --> 00:34:24.822
use that time working
from home.

00:34:24.822 --> 00:34:27.786
And so all the results
are biased.

00:34:27.786 --> 00:34:29.762
Then you're only really
testing the kids that

00:34:29.762 --> 00:34:32.232
understand more and you're
ignoring the kids that

00:34:32.232 --> 00:34:33.239
understood the least.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:33.389
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.300
So that could be the first
problem, which is those kids,

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.570
whom we are testing, they are
not representative, because

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.290
maybe they're the one who
understand the most.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:46.520
And that could lead to an even
bigger problem, because

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.010
suppose the intervention is
effective and most kids now

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.500
understand better.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.409
Then what could happen with the
attrition in the treatment

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:55.780
group versus the
control group?

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.240
Now you all know very well,
it's the kids who don't

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.460
understand who don't come.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.880
And now the kids who understand
better are in the

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.120
treatment group.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.850
What might happen
to attrition?

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:18.025
AUDIENCE: The attrition would
be less for the students who

00:35:18.025 --> 00:35:19.460
are in the treatment group.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.610
PROFESSOR: The attrition would
be less for students who are

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:22.900
in the treatment group.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.620
And the kids who are coming
tends to be the weaker kids.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.830
So now we are comparing the
strong kids in the control

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.530
group to the strong kids plus
some of the weak kids in the

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.930
treatment group.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:39.120
So that will tend to make our
estimate look smaller relative

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.290
to what it should be.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.720
Because now we have a different
population of

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.470
students in the treatment
and control groups.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.150
So we have a bias here.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.750
It goes in the direction of
not finding an effect.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.560
So if we still find an
effect, we're happy.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.560
But it's not the
right estimate.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.390
So to solve this problem,
what did we do?

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:07.160
Did we rely, uniquely, on
the test in the school?

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:07.640
Yeah?

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.871
AUDIENCE: You found the kids,
even if they happened to be at

00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:11.870
home or elsewhere and
administrated the test

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:12.340
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.290
PROFESSOR: We went and looked
for them, wherever they were,

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:18.290
except if they'd left
for the village.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:22.000
So the attrition ended up being
low, less than 10%, and

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.470
similar, now, in treatment
and control school.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.590
Because it's not because people
don't understand that

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.520
they leave for the village.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.800
It's because they have something
to do there.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.350
So that was the first thing.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.670
The second problem we had is
that the testing instrument--

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.190
actually, not in year
1 but in year 0--

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.070
we designed a test which
was at grade level.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.390
We designed a test to
test the curriculum.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:49.490
So it's like, if this is what
should be tested, what's on

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.570
the board, here, we tested
at that level.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:55.640
So if they were supposed to
learn Euclidean geometry,

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.230
that's what was tested.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:01.290
And we had a big problem, which
is that the teachers

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.640
cheated like crazy.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.220
So the reason we saw that
is that all of the

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.950
tests were the same.

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.980
So clearly, the teacher had
written the answer on the

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.120
board, and all the students
were copying down.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.170
In one class, all the students
had the same name.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.690
So the teacher clearly wrote the
name, like a sample name,

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:21.240
on the board.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.970
And all the students dutifully
wrote down the name that they

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.670
saw on the broad.

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.050
So we said that's not working.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:32.360
There is a paper by Steve
Levitt, who shows very subtle

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.180
things, how you can
detect cheating.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.110
That was easy.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.265
It didn't require a lot
of imagination.

00:37:37.265 --> 00:37:41.860
It was pretty obvious that
cheated like crazy to make

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.230
their kids look better.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.730
So we thought about how we
can solve this problem.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.760
We are going to administer a new
test without the teacher,

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.450
that some special Pratham staff
is going to come to

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.450
administer the test.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.110
And we did that.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.780
And then we realized that
most of the students now

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.700
had 0 on the test.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.560
So this test was way too hard,
which is why the teacher had

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.110
been cheating, because they
were a bit embarrassed.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:12.150
So the solution here was to
develop a much easier test

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.620
that covered the competencies
starting from, can you write

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.740
your own name, to--

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.110
I don't know--

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:25.020
2 plus 2, finishing with a few
questions such as as, Nancy

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.800
goes to the market.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.620
And she buys three onions
at 15 rupees.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.290
And how much change does she
have, that kind of thing.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.000
So that's the problems
that we had.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.430
Further problems we had, we
had a problem in Bombay.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.010
Because the second year of the
evaluation turned out to be

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.600
2002 to 2003.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.790
Before that, September
2001 happened.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.340
We were walking in a quite
Muslim neighborhood of Bombay.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.100
A lot of kids were named like
Osama and things like that.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.850
People were pretty upset about
the US at the time.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:10.240
And so Pratham, maybe because
of us, maybe just it would

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.100
have been anywhere, was somehow
seen, maybe, as an

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.960
American presence.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.660
So some schools said that
they don't want to

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.550
work with the program.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.920
So about 30% of schools said
that they did not want to work

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.830
with the program.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:27.490
Or, in another set of schools,
someone was identified, but

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.680
they couldn't read, themselves,
so they couldn't

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.310
really be entrusted to teach
reading to the kids.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:35.410
So they also didn't do it.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:40.080
So can we just drop all the
schools that refuse to

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.410
participate from the program?

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.718
Can we just drop them
from the analysis?

00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:48.960
AUDIENCE: Well, that's
a selective bias.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.702
There is a some reasons for
which they dropped, which make

00:39:51.702 --> 00:39:54.190
them inherently different
from the other schools.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.455
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:39:54.455 --> 00:39:59.490
So we can't do that, because
that's a selection bias.

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.060
Maybe these are the weaker
schools who are

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.030
refusing the program.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.510
Maybe they are the stronger
schools, because they are

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.540
independently minded.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.290
Who knows?

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.870
But what is clear is that's
it's certainly not random.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:14.390
So we lose random control
comparison.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.786
So what we do?

00:40:16.786 --> 00:40:20.340
Well, the first thing you can do
is to say, well, I'm going

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.450
to not measure the effect
of the balsakhi program.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.540
I'm going to measure the effect
of my intention to

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.430
treat the schools with
the balsakhi program.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.830
So we called that intention
to treat.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:36.290
What an intention to treat is
a Pratham official coming to

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.170
the headmaster and saying,
hey, we have a

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.210
balsakhi for you.

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:44.810
So this, we can do in an
unbiased way, right?

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:49.660
Because if we compare all the
test scores in the school

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.300
where someone has come and
offered the program to the

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.940
test scores in the school where
no one has offered the

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.090
program, there is no
selection here.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.470
But it's not the effect
of the program.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:04.540
It's the effect of my attempt
to provide the program.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.720
So that's why we call it
an intention to treat.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.890
It's not the treatment effect.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:10.880
It's the wishful thinking.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.620
It's like my attempt
to treat you.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.430
Now, I wrote, here, on the
board, if we wanted to know

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:25.410
the effect of the program itself
not the intention to

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:31.470
treat, we can divide the
intention to treat effect by

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:35.440
the fraction of schools who
accept the program.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:41.340
So, for example, if 70% of
schools accept the program,

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:50.050
and we find an effect of 10 on
the test scores, a gain of 10

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:54.060
points in the intention to
treat, the intention to treat

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.110
is 10 points.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:58.450
That's due to only 3/4
of the schools.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:02.470
So we can blowup the estimate
by dividing by 3/4, which is

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.550
about multiplying by 1.25.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:09.530
So instead of 10, the
effect is 12.5.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:13.070
So this is what's called
a Wald estimate.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.850
When you divide your intention
to treat by the fraction of

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:21.980
the take-up of the program,
which, here, we call that the

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.180
first stage.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.050
So in the first stage, you offer
a program, and then some

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.760
fraction of people take it.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.120
In the second stage,
that has an effect.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.270
And the combination of the first
stage and the second

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.050
stage produces the intention
to treat.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:38.460
So now to go from the intention
to treat the effect

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.430
of the program, you
do a scale-up by

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.930
dividing by the take-up.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:47.050
So this is, in five sentences,
you're instrumental viable

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:52.490
estimate,

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:56.740
We could spend about a
whole semester on it.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.405
There are conditions
under which this

00:42:58.405 --> 00:42:59.310
is valid to do this.

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.080
There are conditions under
which this is not valid.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:05.020
And this has interpretations
which vary.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.230
So Josh Angrist, in the econ
department, is the one who did

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.130
most of the work on this.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.765
So the point it that-- but think
of it in this simple

00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:18.000
way, for this kind of
noncompliance problem--

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.790
is let's just normalize
the estimate by

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.380
dividing by the take-up.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.850
It would also work if you have
some school in the control

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:29.780
group that managed to get
the balsakhi anyway.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.710
Then you could divide by the
difference between the take-up

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.780
in the intention to treat group
and the intention not to

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.050
treat group.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:41.080
So if 10% of schools manage to
get the program in the control

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:45.510
group, you would divide your
intention to treat by 27%

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.530
minus 10%, that's 65%.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.430
And you would blow
it up that way.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:58.450
What it amounts to doing is to
say, this is my estimate of

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:06.080
the effect of the program,
assuming that the only reason

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.680
why they're in the intention
to treat effect is because

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.550
those who might try to treat are
more likely to be treated.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:17.110
So here are the results.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:20.080
The results are expressed in
standard deviation of the

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.090
unique test scores.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.330
What this means is that we take
the mean of the control

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:28.700
group and divide by the
standard deviation.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.010
So the advantage of doing that--
maybe you can see that

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.910
more in recitation--

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:35.460
is that every education
program does that.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.870
So we can compare our results
to what other people did.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:43.270
For year one, this is the
standard deviation.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:46.680
This is the test score in
treatment and the test score

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.000
in control.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.450
That's the difference, 0.17.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:55.520
That's the standard error of
this difference below.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.930
So you divide one
by the other.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:59.720
You get a t-stat of about 1.7.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.520
So that's significant
but at a 10% level.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.680
In year two, kids progressed.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.710
And the difference
is much larger.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:16.080
So you get an effect of 0.4
standard deviation in math and

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.370
a 0.25 standard deviation in
language and something similar

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.550
for the standard four classes.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.860
So those are a large effect.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.520
To scale that up, one of the
most famous education

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.980
experiments is the Tennessee
STAR class-size reduction

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.380
experiment, where that
reduced class-size in

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.740
Tennessee from 20 to 8.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.050
It was very, very expensive
program that had an effect of

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.280
0.2 standard deviation.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.300
So 0.2 is considered to be a
reasonably large effect.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.670
Here, in the second year of the
program, we are way above

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.110
that for math.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:54.603
Yep?

00:45:54.603 --> 00:45:57.561
AUDIENCE: How big is the
standard deviation relative to

00:45:57.561 --> 00:45:59.540
the average score?

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.862
PROFESSOR: So this is
all normalized.

00:46:01.862 --> 00:46:06.720
So this is, in a sense,
already standardized.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.310
This is already standardized
to the average and to the

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.047
standard deviation.

00:46:11.047 --> 00:46:12.270
AUDIENCE: But there
is like a wide

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.880
distribution in the classroom?

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.330
PROFESSOR: You mean,
is it wide?

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:22.950
Yeah, so you can see, it's not
very wide, in this case.

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:27.860
Because the students are so
weak that, I think, the

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.860
distribution of test scores,
in terms of points, is not

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:35.090
that large compared to what
you could find elsewhere.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.760
It's kind of a relatively
tight distribution.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:43.660
So in terms of points,
it's useful.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.080
There are other ways
to look at this

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:45.820
than standard deviation.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:49.110
For example, the fraction of
kids who can do these kinds of

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.680
things, so in percentage
points.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.210
How many more kids
can do division?

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.810
How many more kids
can do addition?

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:56.380
Which are also useful
to look at, which I

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.180
don't have with me.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.430
That's a good point.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.530
So these estimates are large,
but they're not very precise,

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.960
because there's a lot of
differences between kids.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.530
And one thing that really helps
to control this noise is

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:17.880
to control for how good
where they before.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.300
Because test scores
of children are

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.360
extremely stable over time.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.150
The biggest predictor, sadly,
of how a child does is how

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.020
they did last year.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:30.370
And so, when we control for
that, we get much more precise

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.460
results, which are here.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:35.290
So these are a bunch
of results.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:39.960
So this is the improvement in
year 1, for both cities

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.460
together, where we get an
improvement of 0.2 in math,

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.896
0.3 in language--

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:51.190
sorry, opposite, 0.2 in math in
year 1, 0.3 in math in year

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:59.350
2, for verbal, 0.7, not
significant in math, for

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:02.990
verbal, 0.7 for year
1, 0.15 for year 2.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:06.720
And then we can look at various
aspects of it, where

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.690
we get a slightly bigger effect
for Vadodara and Bombay

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:15.350
but, generally, quite similar
results for math.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:19.600
And language has bigger effect
in Vadodara than in Bombay.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.610
Bombay starts from
a higher level.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:28.210
But across the broad, except
with Bombay year two, you find

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:33.080
pretty large effects,
quite large effects.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.060
So this is very different
from what we had

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.530
with the test scores.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:39.490
Now, you might still wonder
that these are for all the

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.090
kids involved in the program.

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:45.440
And you might still wonder
whether the effect comes from

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.220
helping the lower achieving
kids, which is what you're

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.290
trying to do, or it's coming
from helping the higher

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:54.330
achieving kids by removing
these disturbing, lower

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.910
achieving kids from their
classroom for two hours a day.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:00.180
That would be fine.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.280
But the distributional effect
would be very different.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.590
If the idea is that you just
send the kids to recess, and

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.060
they kind of hang-out, and
learn strictly nothing,

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.470
meanwhile, your 20, high
achieving kids progress, that

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:16.980
could give us those
mean effects.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.290
But that is not necessarily
something that we would be

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.870
very excited about.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:24.000
So for that, what is important
is then to look at what is the

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.800
effect by sub-group?

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.520
And what was the finding
when we looked at

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.401
sub-groups, who benefited?

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:34.167
AUDIENCE: The lowest one third
benefited the most.

00:49:34.167 --> 00:49:35.950
PROFESSOR: The lowest one
benefited the most.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:39.730
And who was more likely
to go to the balsakhi?

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.180
Also the lowest one,
fortunately.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:48.090
So when you look at the lowest
one, you start finding a

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:53.090
pretty large effect for the
bottom third and a much weaker

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.160
for the top third.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.270
For example, if you look at
year 2, the effect for the

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:00.740
bottom 1/3 is 0.5 standard
deviation.

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:02.430
That's starting to be
a huge effect, 0.5

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.390
standard deviation progress.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:07.310
0.3 for the middle
one, and 0.03 for

00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:09.170
the top one, no effect.

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.306
And this is your chance
to go to the balsakhi.

00:50:11.306 --> 00:50:13.850
So your chance to go
to the balsakhi

00:50:13.850 --> 00:50:15.240
declines with the group.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:22.340
So the point estimate of the
effect declines at about the

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.770
same rate as the point estimate
for the balsakhi.

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.880
So the next thing we did is a
little bit the same exercise

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:34.460
as adjusting the Bombay
estimate, to go from this

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.910
estimate of the effect of
putting a balsakhi in the

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:40.470
classroom, to are you going
to the balsakhi?

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:45.350
So basically, the effect, this
0.5 standard deviation, is due

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.610
to about 20% of kids
who are actually

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.210
going to the balsakhi.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.790
Because there doesn't seem to
be an effect for the other

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:55.340
children, which we see from
looking at the pattern

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:58.870
declining as the pattern
of take-up declines.

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:02.460
So now you can divide
this 0.5 by 0.2.

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:04.760
And you get the effect for
people who go to the balsakhi

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.970
of one standard deviation, which
are very, very, very

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:14.530
large effects, in the education
literature.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:17.350
And if you divide 0.32
by 0.16, you'll

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:19.470
also find about 1.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.070
And this is, of course,
unsignificant.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:24.520
But if you divided 0.4 by 0.06,
taking the estimate

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:29.830
seriously, again, you would find
the same type of effect.

00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:34.570
So this is a program that was
highly effective, for kids who

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:39.580
were sent to the program, but
had no effect on the kids who,

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.155
in principle, should have also
benefited from the reduction

00:51:42.155 --> 00:51:44.240
in class size.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.490
So what did we learn?

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:53.630
We learned that it is possible
to make a lot of progress,

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:58.490
with a grade 10 educated woman
trained for two weeks.

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:01.340
And we also learned that
teachers are not very good at

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.710
exploiting freed-up resources.

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:04.698
Yep?

00:52:04.698 --> 00:52:08.156
AUDIENCE: How much variability
was there between the

00:52:08.156 --> 00:52:09.406
different thirds?

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:16.260
If the top third isn't that much
better off than then the

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.185
bottom third, then that would
say something different than,

00:52:19.185 --> 00:52:21.390
if the top third is very well
educated whereas the bottom

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:23.850
third is really not.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:25.430
PROFESSOR: So the bottom
third, basically, knows

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:30.190
nothing at all, for starters.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:31.900
Like they can't do anything
at the beginning.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.350
They can't recognize letters,
can't recognize numbers.

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:37.555
Whereas the top third is not
at grade level but can at

00:52:37.555 --> 00:52:39.000
least do something.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.250
So what I'm saying is not
that we shouldn't care

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:43.050
about the top third.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:44.620
We should care about them.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.990
But that program was really
targeted toward the bottom.

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.380
And so the big difference, in
the context of this program,

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:51.890
is that the top third didn't
get the benefit from the

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:55.690
program, because they weren't
sent to the program.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:58.930
Except that there could have
been indirect benefits from

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:00.690
the fact that the teacher's
now have a much

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:01.960
smaller class size.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.140
Instead of 40 kids of very
heterogeneous levels, they now

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.100
have 20 of better level.

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:11.360
So they could have adjusted
their teaching to do better by

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.140
these kids.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.060
And it seems that they didn't.

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.750
So in terms of the whether
this is an optimistic or

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:20.640
pessimistic conclusion, it's
kind of the glass is half-full

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.500
or half-empty.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.120
The half-full part is
you can do this.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.410
It's reasonably easy to make
a lot of progress.

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:29.860
Perhaps because kids start from
such a low level, to go

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:32.820
back to your question,
initially.

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.965
If the standard deviation is
low, because everyone is at 0,

00:53:35.965 --> 00:53:37.950
then it's easy to make
some progress.

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:40.990
And you're going to see
it very quickly.

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:44.310
On the other hand, the teachers
seem to not really be

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:47.230
using the resources in a way
that allows them to take

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.010
advantage of this.

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:51.280
So that's where we were
at the end of this.

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.570
And we had a bunch more
questions that

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:55.520
we wanted to ask.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.450
What do we still need to know?

00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:00.230
So suppose we would want to go
from this program to, say,

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:03.490
well, let's do a policy
for all of India.

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:05.530
What else do we need to know
before we move further?

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:06.446
Yeah?

00:54:06.446 --> 00:54:10.692
AUDIENCE: The thing, for me, is
to understand what is the

00:54:10.692 --> 00:54:15.400
relation between attendance and
how much those kids, those

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.280
programs are actually
effective?

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.800
Because, I mean, you showed that
enrollment, as a whole,

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.380
doesn't have too much
of an influence.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.140
But maybe attendance
would help.

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:24.510
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:26.510
So we could say, well, maybe
there are other things to look

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:28.270
at, children's attendance,
teacher's attendance.

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:29.995
Maybe the big difference
with the balsakhi is

00:54:29.995 --> 00:54:31.710
that they were there.

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:34.040
Maybe that's just it.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.450
Can we change their learning
just with incentives?

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:39.900
AUDIENCE: Also, maybe look
at the curriculum.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.696
Maybe the reason why the
children are learning is

00:54:41.696 --> 00:54:44.310
because the material is more
basic, whereas if you just

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:46.760
stay in the classroom, the
material is already too hard,

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.760
and you're not able to do it.

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.340
PROFESSOR: That's the
other big contender.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.390
So you have both contenders.

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:54.940
One is, OK, the balsakhi
are actually there.

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.100
The kids are going.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.200
That's why they are learning.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.245
The second is that's not-- the
incentive to this is really

00:55:00.245 --> 00:55:03.730
the pedagogy, which is about
the learning material.

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:06.690
And if we could train the
teachers to train at that

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.320
level, we would have
the same effects.

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.266
AUDIENCE: The cost effectiveness
of the program,

00:55:11.266 --> 00:55:13.230
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:15.280
PROFESSOR: Right, so we could
say, what's the cost

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.050
effectiveness in the city?

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:21.445
We could look at the cost
effectiveness elsewhere.

00:55:21.445 --> 00:55:24.180
AUDIENCE: Also, it could be
interesting to see the effects

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:30.510
of having more strict, I
guess, passing policy.

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.840
Because a lot of kids are
advancing to the next grade

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.300
without actually
being prepared.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:38.030
And maybe making that a little
bit more strict, so that they

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:41.380
don't go to next level until
they're actually prepared.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.750
That could improve.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.270
It's a very good point.

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:47.260
In fact, the policy is not
strict at all at the moment.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:50.900
Rukmini says it the short
video, everybody passes,

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.280
regardless.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.390
So maybe having something where,
actually, repeating is

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:57.740
allowed or remedial education
of some kind is

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:01.831
provided would help.

00:56:01.831 --> 00:56:05.200
The other question one might
ask is, is it only an urban

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.780
phenomenon or would it also
work in rural schools?

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.190
Do you need to pay the people or
could you have volunteers?

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:15.330
Would it be sufficient to
distribute materials, if it's

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:16.450
a material question?

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:20.180
Would you be able to motivate
the teachers to do it, to

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.905
focus on the students?

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:30.630
Can you concentrate even more
on the basics and make even

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:33.370
more progress on the basics, by
not trying to do remedial

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:36.250
of everything, but just
focusing on learning?

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:38.160
So those were the questions
that Pratham had.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.430
Those were the questions
we had.

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:45.510
Another question you could ask
is, on the basics, you could

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:48.740
ask the opposite question.

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.960
You were saying that the
students at the top, it's not

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.470
that they are exactly ready
to come to MIT.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:57.480
They are still way below
grade level.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.770
Is there something that
can be done for them?

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:03.190
Or does this very simple
pedagogy that Pratham has work

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:06.020
only for to very low
achieving kids?

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:07.630
So we had all these questions.

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:08.590
But it was many years ago.

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:09.800
We had a lot of time.

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:13.990
So we started looking at them.

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:20.240
So the first thing we did was
a new evaluation in Jaunpur,

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.490
in Uttar Pradesh.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.450
In the first program, Pratham
was running this program.

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.150
And they called us
to evaluate it.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:30.970
And we went and evaluated what
it is they were doing.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:34.010
But with the Jaunpur program,
we were working together.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:38.320
So this study is, actually,
authored by Rukmini Banerji,

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.480
along with the rest of us.

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.780
We were now all working together
to try to figure out,

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.250
can we learn more
what's going on?

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.090
So Pratham renamed the balsakhi
program as the Read

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:52.440
India Program.

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.410
And as they renamed it, they
shifted to focus it on

00:57:56.410 --> 00:58:00.850
something even more basic and
simple, on reading, and tried

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:05.330
to spread out much more
everywhere, not focusing on

00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:07.990
cities but also working in rural
areas and working on a

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:09.400
much larger scale.

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:13.370
So we worked in rural
Uttar Pradesh.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:16.470
We had three groups of villages,
here, in Jaunpur.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:20.040
One group, where we just went
to see all the parents, had

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.890
village meetings, the
women and Pratham.

00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:24.570
We went to see the parents
and say, you know what?

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:26.030
There are things you can do.

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.940
You can advocate.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.520
We can lobby for more resources
for your schools.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.940
You can get an extra teacher
that the government will have

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.060
to pay for.

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.850
You can get scholarships,
et cetera.

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:41.360
That's the first treatment, to
see whether parents would be

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.770
able to engage with
the system.

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:47.460
The second thing we had is we
realized that parents were

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:51.380
overestimating how much
their kids knew.

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.730
So a first step, that Pratham
has discovered, to get people

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:59.180
excited about reading, is to
train parents to administer

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.210
the small Pratham test.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:03.820
So you go and say,
Ben, read this.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.820
And Ben is like staring
blankly.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:08.750
And then they realize, oh, my
god, the kids can't read.

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.780
And they have been giving their
kids to the schools,

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:16.300
faithfully, for years, and
assuming that something would

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:16.930
come out of it.

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:18.930
And then they realize in
this exercise that

00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:19.990
actually, not really.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:22.290
So the parents prepare a report
card for the village.

00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:24.550
And then there was a
lot of discussion.

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:26.500
And the third was the Read
India volunteer.

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:30.730
At the end of this process,
Pratham asked anybody, are

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.570
their volunteers to
learn Read India?

00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:34.590
In this case, they
were not paid.

00:59:34.590 --> 00:59:37.790
People just came up, boys
and girls, usually

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:39.430
youngish boys and girls.

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:42.410
They got trained by Pratham and
stared running these camps

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:44.432
for the students, Read
India camps.

00:59:44.432 --> 00:59:46.740
And what did we find?

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:52.510
That's kind of the result in
one graph, kids who, at

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:55.020
baseline, could not
read anything.

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.540
And this their result
at end-line.

00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:59.755
These three lines look the same,
control, information

00:59:59.755 --> 01:00:04.060
only, information plus test
provided no significant

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:04.970
difference.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.430
But there's a somewhat
bigger jump for

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:09.170
the Read India program.

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:11.330
That jump, you might think,
is really not that big.

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:12.970
So first, I have to tell
you, it's statistically

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:14.140
significant.

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.980
This is different than that.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:20.890
But second is, this jump is only
due to 13% of kids who

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:22.040
actually showed up.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.840
So only 13% of kids who couldn't
read went to the

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.230
reading camp.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:28.870
So we can do the same exercise,
the same Josh

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:31.660
Angrist exercise that we did
for Bombay or we did for

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.350
looking at the effect of the
balsakhi, to look at the

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:36.060
effect of Read India.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.120
So we divide this little
bar by 13%.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.570
What is it going to do
to my little bar.

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:44.580
It's going to make it
look much bigger.

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.236
So this is what we have here.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.760
And that's what we find.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.030
So these are kids who couldn't
read letters at baseline.

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:59.630
And now I'm adding to the
control group the little bar

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.220
that have now become bigger.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.040
And we get to exactly 100%.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:08.240
So this suggests that 100% of
the kids who actually attended

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.060
the camp are able to read
letters at end-line.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.340
So this is a program
which is trying to

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.860
get the kids to read.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.505
And it doesn't get them to read
full paragraphs, but it

01:01:18.505 --> 01:01:20.700
put them one level up.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.320
And you can do the
same exercise.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.650
Kids who were at letter levels
are able to read paragraphs

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.660
and kids who were at
paragraph level are

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.430
able to read stories.

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:32.850
So this is a program that,
as a program, is

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:34.760
tremendously effective.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:41.650
But there were still some
issues, which is that very few

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:42.880
kids attended the camp.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.490
Why did only 13% of kids
attend the camp?

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:50.590
And that is something that
was a puzzle for us.

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:52.850
Next time, we'll spend much more
time on why did only 13%

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:55.850
of kids come to the camp.

01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:57.470
Therefore, the overall
effect was low.

01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:59.810
Next time, we'll try
to understand that.

01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:03.300
But today, I'll tell you what
happened when we saw this

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.970
result, which is we saw an
effective pedagogy, where, if

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:10.280
I managed to grab Ben by the
collar and try to inculcate

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.560
him how to read with Pratham
technique, I can do it.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.810
He can learn letters.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.160
But on the other hand, if it's
left to volunteers and left to

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.240
the effort of the parents,
we only managed to

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.200
get 13% of the kids.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.040
So the next step was is it
possible to integrate this

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.850
within the school system?

01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:34.250
Because enrollment
is already high.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.700
Students are already a captive
audience in the school.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.550
If we could use the teachers
to do this, then that would

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:41.500
work better.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.280
So off we went.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.130
Pratham got a bunch of money,
by the Gates and Hewlett

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:49.490
Foundations, to expand
the program

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:52.340
in about 100 districts.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.490
That's how they reach 38
million kids today.

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:57.120
But they felt that they
should try and

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.290
work through the states.

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:02.570
And so here the trade-off was,
well, if it does work, if we

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:05.590
can make it work with regular
teachers, then we will have

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:07.590
many more kids reached.

01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:08.590
So that's the advantage.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:11.390
The 13% will become 80%.

01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:14.760
On the other hand, the treatment
effect might go from

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.020
this very large treatment effect
we have to a much lower

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:22.000
treatment effect if the teachers
are not willing or

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.660
able to carry out the program.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.710
So that's the question.

01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:28.900
So the next experiment, we
worked in two states, Bihar

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.080
and Uttarakhand.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.700
In the meantime, UP
got cut in two.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:39.170
And Uttarakhand is one of the
big, mountainous states, a

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:42.310
former part of UP, very
beautiful place with

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:45.240
mountains and stuff.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.170
So in Bihar, we contrasted
four models in different

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:52.620
state, a summer camp taught by
government teachers, trained

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.530
teachers to implement Pratham
as part of their regular

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:58.970
teaching, trained volunteers
roughly like the Jaunpur

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:01.880
model, and distribute
only the material.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.200
Can you just distribute the
material, the textbooks, and

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200
get an effect from that?

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.400
That would be the best, because
that's very cheap.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.360
In Uttarakhand, we tried this
same teacher training as in

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.530
Bihar and the volunteers.

01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:17.160
But the volunteers were put in
the school, with the idea

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.600
that, maybe, in this way,
the kids would come.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.620
And what did we find?

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.310
What we found is that, again,
when you have the volunteer

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:30.840
intervention, that again works
extremely well, with effects

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.180
similar to what we
had in Jaunpur.

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.500
So what we found in Jaunpur,
we find the

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.610
same thing in Bihar.

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:41.900
It worked in the same way, with
not very many kids going,

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.620
but the kids who went
really benefited.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.150
And what is interesting here
is that it's not only basic

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:50.550
reading level any more.

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:52.950
It also covers more
advanced skills.

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:56.210
And the gains were felt
at all levels.

01:04:56.210 --> 01:05:00.160
So the same approach of trying
to teach what the kids don't

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.250
know, it works at reading,
but it also works at

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:03.600
more advanced levels.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.100
So great.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:05.520
We had a big effect
on learning.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.160
We were happy.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:14.290
However, the teacher
intervention had very, very

01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:15.520
little effect.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.690
So training the teachers had
very, very little effect.

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:21.620
There is one effect on
Hindi written tests.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.200
So if you squint, you find a
little bit of an effect of the

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.880
teachers but, basically,
not much.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.690
And moreover, when you put the
volunteers in the schools, the

01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:32.300
volunteers had no effect.

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.855
In fact, what we found is when
you put the volunteers in

01:05:34.855 --> 01:05:36.930
schools, the teacher
is absent more.

01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:39.180
So they just stay home more.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.150
And the volunteers start
teaching the kids.

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:45.270
And then it has no impact.

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:48.300
So what do we conclude?

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.980
Is it that the teachers are just
horrible, and they can

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.950
absolutely, never teach
anything to the kids?

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.040
Well, we don't think that's
the case, because of the

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.995
summer camp.

01:05:58.995 --> 01:06:01.340
In the summer camp program,
it's the teachers who were

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.360
trained to teach.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.380
A teacher had to volunteer, and
they were paid extra to

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:07.490
teach summer camps.

01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:09.010
But they were still teachers.

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:09.710
And they were trained.

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:10.750
And they did it.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.270
And the summer camp effect
was as large as

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.720
the volunteer treatment.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.510
It means that teachers are able
to teach kids to read if

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:19.110
they want to.

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:22.250
So the problem is that it's
not that they can't.

01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:26.330
It's that usually they
choose not to.

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.710
And why do they choose not to?

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:31.010
That's what we are going
to see next time.

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:33.060
Where are we?

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.600
We know that we can improve
the quality of education.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.620
Because you can take a high
school graduate, train them

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.850
for two weeks, and
they can do it.

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:46.470
And the puzzle is that, why
is it not taken up more?

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.670
Why is it not taken up more
by the school system?

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.140
When the teacher's are trained,
it doesn't work.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.990
Why is not taken more by
teachers themselves?

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:59.160
Why is it not taken more by
parents, who are not sending

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.060
their kids to the reading camp
when they have a chance?

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.800
I mean some do but
not that many.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.790
And finally, they are
private schools.

01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:07.650
A lot of these kids are going
to private schools.

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:09.940
The private schools are somewhat
more effective than

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:12.760
the public schools but not
tremendously more.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.760
So why aren't the private
schools using those

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.120
techniques?

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.960
After all, nothing stops them.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.810
They can fire the teacher if
they don't do what they do.

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.600
They are more flexible.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.960
So why aren't the private
school adopting that?

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.960
So that's kind of where we
are, which is there is an

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.580
effective methodology, of very
effective, you know.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:33.090
You can get everybody to read at
least one more level, from

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.190
where they were, in three
months of a volunteer.

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:38.580
We can increase their skills
by one standard deviation.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.340
And yet this is not taken up.

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:42.530
So this is not the technology.

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:44.660
The technology exists.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:48.515
But it's not adopted, neither at
the individual level nor at

01:07:48.515 --> 01:07:49.560
the system level.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.550
So we'll see where
we are next time.

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:52.740
And we'll conclude with you.

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.990
AUDIENCE: How would
you [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:57.436 --> 01:07:59.570
PROFESSOR: Teachers are
very well educated.

01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:05.320
Teachers have a BA in teaching
plus a discipline.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.830
And it's a pretty competitive
job to get.

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.560
And it's very well paid.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.860
But it's very well paid at
entry, and then you don't

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:12.700
increase much.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.630
And you can never,
ever be fired.

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:16.880
So it's a very desirable job.

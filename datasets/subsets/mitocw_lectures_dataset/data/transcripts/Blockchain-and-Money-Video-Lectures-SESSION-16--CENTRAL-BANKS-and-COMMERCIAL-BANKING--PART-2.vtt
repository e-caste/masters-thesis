00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.290
GARY GENSLER: So we're
going to sort of come back

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.790
to central banking.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.820
I thought it was appropriate
to have two classes on this

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.120
when I was laying out the whole
semester in August, thinking

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.250
about how to build the class.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.350
In part because central banks
play such a significant role

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.470
to the world of
finance, but it's really

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.250
about their role in money.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.550
I mean, money and
central banking

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.090
have been so intertwined
for 300 or 400 years,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.480
and they are the custodians, the
essence of what Fiat money is.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.830
And of course, this course
is blockchain and money.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.710
And many of the things we're
talking about here actually

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.640
do relate to Bitcoin
and crypto finance,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.590
even though a central bank
digital currency doesn't

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.820
have to be tied to a
blockchain technology.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.120
So I'm going to do
a little bit back

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.520
to what we talked about Tuesday,
partly because Robleh Ali was

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.080
with us on Tuesday, I moved up
some of the content from today

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.080
to then as well just
to go through that.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.630
And of course if we do end up--

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.132
end early, we can always talk
about Tuesday's election too.

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:45.840
That's all right.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.630
So we're going to, as always,
sort of touch on the readings.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.480
I'm going to be asking you all a
bunch of questions about things

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.590
like Ecuador and
Senegal and Sweden

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.500
and maybe the Philippines
that were in the readings

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.970
and so forth.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.190
But it's all experimentation
by those four countries

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.699
and others.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.350
We're going to talk
a little bit about--

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.850
I'm just going to
try to come back

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.470
to what we were
talking about Tuesday

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.500
and why, again, I think
it's relevant to any course

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.050
in blockchain technology,
and particularly

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.795
if you're interested in
Bitcoin and crypto finance.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.830
Introduce a new
subject, really, which

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.800
is stable value
tokens, which are

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.050
a significant part
of experimentation

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.440
right now, again, in the
world of crypto finance,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.190
but relate them back to the
world of private banknotes.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.390
Because I see in the current
approach to stable value

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.520
tokens something similar
that we saw in the past.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.050
Central bank digital currency,
which we introduced on Tuesday,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.600
and that's going to be the bulk
of what we talk about today,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.560
and you're going to--

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.480
hopefully we'll have
a nice discussion

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.130
to see what all of you think of
these Sweden, Senegal, Ecuador

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.790
and the Philippines a bit.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.290
And so that's what we're
going to try to do.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.430
And again, we're going to sort
of dive into these questions

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.900
as we go through
those four countries.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.780
We talked a little
bit about MasterCard

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.090
when Sriham was with us--

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.790
right?

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.440
Priya's husband was with us
because he was with MasterCard,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.580
but we can touch back.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.880
That was really a
reading for today,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.990
and MasterCard took a out of a
patent on fractional banking.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.280
So central bank,
goals and functions.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.170
Anybody remember we
talked about Tuesday

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.150
as to what are
central banks about

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.620
and what their main goals
are and their functions?

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.410
Anybody want to--

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.350
STUDENT: Maximum employment
[INAUDIBLE] stability and also

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.777
the moderate long
term interest rates.

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.360
GARY GENSLER: Wow,
that's pretty good.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.880
You've got the three--

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.050
the three things that go
into the US dual mandate.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.600
So there's an economic
function, that central banks

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.900
in almost every country
have taken on some role

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.100
to promote the economy.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.190
But dominantly, it's
about price stability.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.170
And how does price
stability relate to money?

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:27.720
Anybody?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.220
James.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.720
Is that a hand up?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.740
STUDENT: No, but I
can give a guess.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.477
Inflation?

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:33.935
GARY GENSLER: All
right, inflation.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:35.760
STUDENT: Inflation,
making sure--

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.750
STUDENT: I would
add [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.480
GARY GENSLER: So
that's cost of money.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.000
Right.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.660
So price stability and
money relate because, what's

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.540
the three functions of money?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.040
STUDENT: Dependable
unit of account.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.957
GARY GENSLER: So a
dependable unit of account.

00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:54.830
It's right in that.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.870
So the third function of money--

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.520
store value, medium of
exchange, a unit of account.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.710
So stable pricing
is about making sure

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.880
that unit of accounting,
that unit of pricing,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.990
has some stability.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.930
So price stability is
really about money.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.810
And it also promotes an economy.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.390
They sit at the center of the
money system, central banks.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.080
At first a check on
the king to make sure

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.790
that the king didn't
overspend when

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.745
he was at war with another
king in another country.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.900
That's where it all
started, but they sit right

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.760
at the center of money.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.980
So the four things
we talked about,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:50.510
they managed the nation's
Fiat money in every country--

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.540
the supply, the price,
the payment systems.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.000
Payment systems are how
we move money around.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.933
So if you really want
to just boil it down,

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.100
you can take a whole course.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.505
There's wonderful
professors here

00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:04.630
that teach central banking.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.750
But I'd say manage the
nation's Fiat money.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.540
Oversee the banking system,
because the banking system

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.370
is a way to basically move
money around the system

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.290
and provides credit--

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.200
Tom, what does a bank do
when it provides credit?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.892
Just use the word "money"
somewhere in your definition.

00:06:26.892 --> 00:06:29.607
STUDENT: It expands
the quantity of money.

00:06:29.607 --> 00:06:31.440
GARY GENSLER: Expands
the quantity of money.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.472
And how does it do that?

00:06:34.472 --> 00:06:35.430
STUDENT: Lending money.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.260
GARY GENSLER: Lending money.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.430
So banks stand in between
investors or savers.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.530
We can call them depositors.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.050
So on the one hand, you have
depositors or investors.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.300
On the other hand,
you have borrowers.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.590
And banks are just
in the middle.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.640
And that's why it's called
financial intermediation--

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.863
intermediates, they're
just in the middle.

00:06:56.863 --> 00:06:58.530
It's more than just
being in the middle.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.260
I mean, it's a big role, but--

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.790
So the banks in the middle
are all about money.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.690
And so central banks
want to get involved

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.660
to manage those institutions.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.610
Initially, commercial banks
came before central banks.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.770
Commercial banks
were around, and they

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:28.130
kept failing, even in a time
of the small Italian states.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.760
They would fail, and there
were some family usually,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.370
or central authority
that helped out.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.740
And ultimately, the
central banks seem to--

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.140
today, it seems like the
central banks came first.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.450
But the commercial
banks kind of came first

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.700
and then there was a central
way to protect the system.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.410
Central banks are bankers
to their own governments.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.340
Paul Tucker, who now teaches
over at the Harvard Kennedy

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.720
School, but Paul Tucker
just came out with a book--

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.140
he was the deputy governor
of the Bank of England--

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.250
about the unelected power.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.200
Central banks are
unelected usually.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.420
They're don't stand
before the voters,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.910
but they have a tremendous
amount of authority.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.480
So the four types of
buckets of things they do.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.800
So we talked about--

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.870
I used this chart the
other day a little bit,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.520
but the three different
types of money.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.240
Please.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.430
STUDENT: In the
context of currencies,

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.800
I would add also that
the central bank have

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.650
a key role in
international payments

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.470
and international reserves.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.010
GARY GENSLER: Well,
so the question

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.409
is, will the central
banks have a similar role

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.770
for cryptocurrencies?

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.380
Anybody want to take one
side or the other about it?

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.090
Eileen, you think
it's going to go to 0.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.160
So you would probably say
central banks will not

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.075
have any role if
cryptocurrencies go to 0.

00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:52.450
STUDENT: I'm trying
to understand

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.117
the question, what
do central banks have

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:55.583
to do with cryptocurrencies?

00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:58.000
GARY GENSLER: All right, so
Alin just took the other side.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.458
He said, what do
central banks have

00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:00.970
to do with cryptocurrencies?

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.470
STUDENT: I mean,
there's going to be

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.010
a currency for one country.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.500
They will still need to
manage international reserves

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.610
and manage international
cross-border payments.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.170
If it's going to be
a global currency,

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.862
they need to [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:15.862 --> 00:09:19.010
GARY GENSLER: So
it's a hypothetical.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.430
STUDENT: But it's
a choice, right?

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.888
It's whether you
want your currency

00:09:21.888 --> 00:09:23.650
to float versus
Bitcoin, or whether you

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.980
want to defensively buy Bitcoin
and hedge your currency.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.460
I think the central bank has a
choice to pursue [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.600
GARY GENSLER: So any other
views on whether central banks

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.470
will get steeply involved in
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.480
Brotish.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.060
STUDENT: I think if your
currency can [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.910
of its own [INAUDIBLE] where it
does not interact with the Fiat

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.210
currencies, then the
role of central banks

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.257
would be completely restricted
to the governance of activities

00:09:58.257 --> 00:10:01.520
[INAUDIBLE],, whatever it
takes to get involved in that

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.060
[INAUDIBLE] attracting the
Fiat currency at any level,

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.080
then the central banks' role
becomes more involved in that.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.580
GARY GENSLER: The
more [INAUDIBLE],,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.910
the more it's more central.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.040
So isn't it possible that--

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.920
I mean, we don't know what
the future will bring.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.030
And Alin might be right.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.980
If cryptocurrency
doesn't take off,

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.740
then central banks
can kind of just

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.820
wave it away as some experiment
on the side of finance.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.430
But if it starts to
take off, I think--

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.960
do you pronounce it Guillermo?

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.650
Guillermo says that if it
becomes somewhat central,

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.590
as Brotish and
others have said, I

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.020
think that there would be
a role for central banks.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.360
If a country actually
was going to use it

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.970
as its medium of exchange,
a unit of account,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.610
a store of value--

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.240
and particularly if there became
fractional crypto banking.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.820
This Mastercard patent.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:03.300
Like if you actually saw
somebody taking crypto deposits

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.620
and making crypto loans,
and you had credit facility

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.970
through crypto--

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.720
we're a far way away from that.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.430
We're not there.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.690
But I'm saying,
if that happened.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.488
Sean?

00:11:14.488 --> 00:11:15.780
STUDENT: So I was just curious.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.690
A follow up on that,
if that happened,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.710
and it becomes a fraction
of the monetary supply,

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.640
in order for the central bank
to carry out its functionality,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.000
just like [INAUDIBLE]
operations,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.710
does that also apply to--

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.020
kind of if the
cryptocurrency plays a role,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.960
does that also
apply to [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.848
to the crytpocurrency project?

00:11:38.848 --> 00:11:40.890
GARY GENSLER: Well so
Sean's asking, if we really

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.930
were in this world
we're not yet in,

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:49.650
and cryptocurrency was a
dominant form of finance,

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.980
banking and so forth,
would you envision

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.972
the central bank trying to
do an open market operation?

00:11:57.972 --> 00:11:59.430
Anybody want to
tell the class what

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.140
open market-- it's
not in the readings,

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.250
but what open market
operations are used for?

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.710
GARY GENSLER: Is it increasing
or decreasing the money supply?

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.940
So yes the central bank
can buy some of the money

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.570
or sell some of the money
which affects the supply

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.820
and thus affects the price.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.660
So open market operations
effectively affects

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.190
the interest rate.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.190
You have often probably read
the interest rate targets.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.170
The Federal Reserve
has a target.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.330
But what they're doing in
an open market operation

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.950
is really buying and
selling supply of money.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.000
And when you influence
the supply of something,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.270
you change the price.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.050
And the price of money is
measured in interest rates

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.700
or foreign exchange rates.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.520
So Sean, I would say
that if it becomes

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.700
a dominant part of an economy,
then some central authority

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.340
might want to try to
influence its price.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.320
But there's a challenge.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.955
Does anybody want to guess
what challenge I'm thinking

00:12:56.955 --> 00:12:58.780
about why cryptocurrency--

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.880
let's say Venezuela was adopting
Bitcoin as a central means

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.530
in that country.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.750
What would be their
challenge of trying

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.900
to influence the price
of Bitcoin in Venezuela?

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.220
Alin.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.600
STUDENT: Well if the other
economies outside Venezuela

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.620
are using Bitcoin--

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.170
GARY GENSLER:
[INAUDIBLE] so Venezuela

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.800
might be only a small portion
of the overall Bitcoin

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.460
usage around the globe.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.350
So it's one thing if you're
one country and trying

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.050
to influence the price
of the currency that's

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.940
in use in that country.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.680
If Sweden wants to influence the
price of the krona, or Israel

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.185
the--

00:13:43.185 --> 00:13:43.685
Shekel?

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:53.710
But it's far more problematic
if it's a worldwide currency.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.480
Hugo and then Tom.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.790
STUDENT: I mean, I could
see that being kind

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.940
of like what we saw
earlier this year

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.080
or last year when there
was like a Korean--

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.455
the price of
Bitcoin in Korea was

00:14:04.455 --> 00:14:06.830
higher than the price of
bitcoin in the rest of the world

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.570
because there was so
much demand there.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.650
So if you get like the Central
bank of a certain country

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.780
buying Bitcoin in
their currency,

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.270
they're basically devaluing
their currency in relation

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.100
to Bitcoin and it might not--

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.648
like it might not affect
the world market in the way

00:14:21.648 --> 00:14:22.690
that they think it would.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:23.230
Right?

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.960
Unless they're effectively
buying Bitcoin on all

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.687
open markets around the world.

00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:28.520
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.070
And do you have a view as
to why the pricing went up

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.050
in Korea versus elsewhere?

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.020
It's called the kimchi premium.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.880
Literally, I don't make this up.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.640
But that was what it was called
in Bitcoin, the kimchi premium,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.760
which was that Bitcoin
was valued at a higher

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.890
price in Korea than elsewhere.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.377
Hugo, do you have a-- you had
one reason you said it's just

00:14:53.377 --> 00:14:55.710
thought that the Koreans were
trying to buy a lot of it,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.240
so there was a kimchi premium.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:57.770
Other?

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.455
Tom, we're going to get to you.

00:15:00.455 --> 00:15:02.830
STUDENT: In order to open an
account on a Korean exchange

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.090
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.120
So you weren't really
able to arbitrage very--

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.120
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.000
So Hugo, you're on to something.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.100
You're saying arbitrage.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.645
Ben?

00:15:10.645 --> 00:15:13.800
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] it
was difficult to arbitrage

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.710
because of the capital
controls in Korea.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.502
Is that something--

00:15:17.502 --> 00:15:18.502
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:20.120
So it was difficult
to arbitrage.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.853
So the basics of finance--

00:15:21.853 --> 00:15:23.520
we're moving a little
away from Bitcoin.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.340
But the basis of
finance is arbitrage

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.180
has been a part of finance
for, again, thousands of years.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.360
If I can buy something
in France and sell it

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.310
for a different
price in Switzerland,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.720
and it doesn't cost too much to
travel the roads between France

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.120
and Switzerland, I might
buy it in one country,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.720
sell it in another.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.370
And that's called locational
or geographic arbitrage.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:51.390
In a modern digital
age, digital assets

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.390
don't have much
locational arbitrage.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.450
Oil still has
locational arbitrage

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.570
because you might be
buying it in the Gulf Coast

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.910
and selling it in Africa.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.100
Or, you know, there might
be locational arbitrage

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.390
in physical commodities.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.850
But in digital financial
assets, there's

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.160
far little locational arbitrage.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.870
And it's interesting,
in Korea's case,

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.120
there was a
locational arbitrage.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.860
What was this about?

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.880
And it was because it was
hard for regulatory reasons.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.950
So there was a kimchi
premium, literally,

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.820
for quite some
time, because it was

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.880
hard to move Bitcoin
across the borders

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.330
for regulatory
constraints and so forth.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.450
But now, we've got--

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.520
Tom, you [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.040
STUDENT: Yeah, when we
talk about bank capital

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.430
requirements, does
US Federal Reserve

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.860
require banks to hold dollars?

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:50.210
Or are banks allowed to hold
any currency [INAUDIBLE]??

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.960
GARY GENSLER: Has
anybody been in banking?

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.210
Want to answer Tom's question?

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.530
STUDENT: Whether or not
bank capital, bank reserves,

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.510
have to be held in
dollar denominated--

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.960
GARY GENSLER: Josh, you've spent
a lifetime in banking, right?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.900
STUDENT: Yeah, so
there's a lot of rules.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:17.597
A lot of the rules are based
on the liquidity of the assets

00:17:17.597 --> 00:17:18.430
that you're holding.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.470
So if you're holding
capital, if you hold it

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.569
in treasuries, which
are very liquid,

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.780
and you could get out of them
in a certain amount of time,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.290
there's a big premium
to hold your capital

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.360
in those types of assets.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.750
So I think the rules
don't necessarily

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.650
specify whether it's
dollars or another currency,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.370
but they heavily
favor very liquid.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.920
GARY GENSLER: So Josh is right.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.260
It's basically--
it's all brought back

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.010
to the home nation's
currency unit,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.910
dollars or euros or renminbi.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.200
In some accounting books
it's brought back into that,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.620
but there's different
haircuts or weights

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.580
depending upon some
perceived model of liquidity.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.820
So a US treasury bond versus
a German government bond

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:16.522
might have similar
liquidity and the regulators

00:18:16.522 --> 00:18:17.480
will count it the same.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.840
But you're, in a
very real time basis,

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.990
using the foreign exchange
rate to bring it back

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.447
to the unit of
your home country.

00:18:25.447 --> 00:18:26.030
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.447
I'm jumping the
shark a little bit

00:18:27.447 --> 00:18:29.540
on my knowledge of finance
and central banking.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.490
But thinking about
whether or not

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.500
Bitcoin becomes a
reserve currency,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.750
or whether or not banks hold
it, to Guillermo's point of--

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.550
if central banks aren't
allowing financial institutions

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.500
to get credit for holding
bitcoin [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.860
Why would they have to do it?

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.693
GARY GENSLER: Well,
currently, central banks

00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:53.630
are not that favorable to
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.070
but they're probably right.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.100
There's not a deep history,
there's not a lot of liquidity,

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.350
and there's high volatility.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.300
And the underlying
markets are highly

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.150
susceptible to manipulation.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.900
We don't know for sure
what the real pricing

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.610
is at any given time.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.620
But in the hypothetical
world, where

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.350
it's be becoming
largely adopted,

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.590
I would suspect that central
banks around the globe

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.110
would have some capital
regime that would treat it

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.810
more favorably than
it's treated today

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:28.935
but less favorably than
government Fiat currency.

00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:29.560
STUDENT: Right.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.510
I mean, you trust
the German bond

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.290
because you trust the German
government [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.740
GARY GENSLER:
Generally speaking.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.770
STUDENT: More so than you
do decentralized governance

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.882
structure.

00:19:41.882 --> 00:19:43.840
GARY GENSLER: So there
are three types of money

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.520
that central banks
are involved in.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.540
Does anybody remember?

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.540
There's even a chart
up here you could see,

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.740
you can grab it from.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.315
Akira?

00:19:55.315 --> 00:20:00.570
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] central
bank databases Fiat authorized?

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.620
GARY GENSLER: Fiat what?

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.730
STUDENT: Fiat collateralized.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.665
GARY GENSLER: Fiat
collateralized.

00:20:03.665 --> 00:20:05.350
No, we're going to get there.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.750
That's going to be about
stable value tokens.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.224
I'm talking about--

00:20:09.224 --> 00:20:10.960
STUDENT: M1 M2 and M3.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.660
GARY GENSLER: All right, so
we talk about M1, M2, M3.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.240
So what's the what's
the first thing

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.550
that you might think about?

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.260
What's that?

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.830
I heard the word "cash," but--

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.210
some deposits.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.010
But starting with
just cash is money.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:29.110
So did I make it green?

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.080
Yes!

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.100
There we go.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:31.600
Thank you.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.475
I got some help here.

00:20:32.475 --> 00:20:33.560
Cash.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.730
That's one form of money,
and we all have it or--

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.890
actually, I've never asked.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.020
I always have cash in my pocket.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.780
How many people in this room
actually currently have cash

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.510
of some country in their pocket?

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.250
So we're down to
about 70%, but 30%

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.947
have no cash in their pocket.

00:20:53.947 --> 00:20:55.030
You're putting yours away?

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:55.750
STUDENT: $1.00.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:56.980
GARY GENSLER: $1.00.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.500
If we were in Japan, it would
probably be higher though.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.000
Right?

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.000
So one form of money is cash.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.668
Another form of money
that the central banks--

00:21:08.668 --> 00:21:09.960
STUDENT: Central bank reserves.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.910
GARY GENSLER: Central
bank reserves.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.202
Let's see if I made that green.

00:21:12.202 --> 00:21:13.020
Yes!

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.460
So central bank reserves.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.550
Again, I'm just going back
through this from Tuesday.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.660
Reserves started, but because
they were commercial banks--

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.090
and when governments set up
central banks, they said,

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.460
you have to save and
put some of your money--

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.820
a reserve-- with
the central bank.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.450
So that we might give
you deposit insurance.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:38.670
We might give you
access to liquidity

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:43.230
in hard times, which
is called opening up

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.200
some liquidity or
lending facilities.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.160
So you have to keep
a reserve from us.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.950
That's where the word came from.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.813
But it's a form of money.

00:21:51.813 --> 00:21:53.730
And the third form of
money, the form of money

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.570
that almost everybody in this
room uses on a daily basis?

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.840
The real form of money that
we use almost all the time?

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.910
So we had cash.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.590
We had central bank reserves.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.980
What do we actually
use almost every day?

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.650
What's that?

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:11.400
STUDENT: Deposits.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.720
GARY GENSLER: Deposits.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.020
So our bank deposits,
we are actually

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.120
transacting-- when
we go into Starbucks,

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.030
I know it doesn't feel this
way, but you're actually

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.190
moving some of
your bank deposits

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.285
to their bank deposits.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.807
That's how we're
really moving money.

00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:31.390
So those are the
three forms of money.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:37.480
We never see Federal Reserve
or central bank reserves,

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.810
we just see the cash
in the bank deposits.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:41.310
Kelly?

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:46.010
STUDENT: You talked about being
able to facilitate lending

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.390
when times are tough.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:53.150
So we go back a decade, how
have the rules sort of change

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.890
to prepare for that
scenario where banks--

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.320
were the central bank
would need the ability

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.330
to have a lot [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.190
GARY GENSLER: So Kelly's
asking, you know,

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:07.340
we all lived through
the financial crisis.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.280
How many of you in
2008 were in banking?

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.290
In any way?

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.990
All right.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.110
Oh Josh, you--

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.410
Alpha, where were
you working in 2008?

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.830
You were at Goldman Sachs.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.890
Yeah, I've heard of them.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.060
The other people that
raised their hands?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.670
Who else raised their hand?

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.500
Where were you working?

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.445
STUDENT: I was working for
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi.

00:23:35.445 --> 00:23:37.070
GARY GENSLER: Bank
of Tokyo Mitsubishi.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.737
I've heard them.

00:23:37.737 --> 00:23:38.380
Very big bank.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.850
Josh?

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.178
A hedge fund, right?

00:23:41.178 --> 00:23:42.470
STUDENT: A mortgage hedge fund.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.000
GARY GENSLER: A
mortgage hedge fund.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.670
Yeah.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.330
Yeah, uh-huh.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.780
We thank you, Josh.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.980
So the question is, how
would Josh, Alfa or Kira

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.360
get money today?

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.480
Who-- did anybody work
in central banking?

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.780
No.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:10.620
So the 2008 crisis came along,
and Josh, we let him fail.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.243
He was a mortgage hedge fund?

00:24:12.243 --> 00:24:13.410
STUDENT: We did pretty good.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.940
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.210
What's that?

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.550
STUDENT: He let us fail.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.900
GARY GENSLER: He let us fail.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.810
Goldman Sachs got a bit
of government support.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:32.460
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, did
you get any government support?

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:32.970
STUDENT: No.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:39.110
We had some [INAUDIBLE],, but
not critical [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.720
GARY GENSLER: It
was not critical.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.260
But the central banks
around the globe,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:48.120
particularly here in the
US, provided liquidity

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.290
in multiple ways.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.970
But it wasn't
going to be enough.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.490
They were providing
liquidity, one,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.540
for some banks that were
failing, Bear Stearns in 2007

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.500
failed.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.330
And through a legal
authority they

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.540
had from Congress
from the 1930s,

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.810
where you could actually lend
to a financial institution--

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.790
actually, you could lend
to any company in society.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:15.060
But they had never
used the authority.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.560
But they used the
authority that you

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.860
could lend versus collateral.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.400
And that was done with
Bear Stearns in 2007,

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.480
and then it was done
again in 2008 for others.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.230
And what did they do
with Lehman Brothers?

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.510
On the fateful weekend that
Lehman Brothers failed,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.800
what did the Federal Reserve
say to Lehman Brothers?

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.960
STUDENT: Let them go bust.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.918
GARY GENSLER: James said
they let them go bust.

00:25:35.918 --> 00:25:36.810
That is correct.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.060
They said, we can't
use this authority.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:44.060
And then we all know
in the history books

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.910
it's written how that fateful
week in September of 2008,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.940
then everything falls bust.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.840
Because there was uncertainty
in the marketplace.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.480
And so what they
did next, Kelly--

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.827
so they were using
traditional authorities.

00:25:58.827 --> 00:26:00.410
And what they did
next is they started

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.397
to test the limits of
their legal authority,

00:26:03.397 --> 00:26:05.480
along with the Treasury
Department and the Federal

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.210
Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and they put

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.400
a series of other things in.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.030
And under an old authority of
the Federal Deposit Insurance

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.280
Corporation, they
actually guaranteed

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:22.610
all debts of the banking system
in the US for a period of time.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.410
Under other authorities,
they figured out

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.300
how to put a guarantee
on money market funds.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.450
It was about $2 trillion
in money market funds.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:36.110
All of these almost
extra legal authorities.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:41.180
I mean, they were not written
right into congressional law,

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.070
but they pushed the
outer boundaries.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.680
And we knew when
Larry Lessig was here

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.170
he said that every contract
has some ambiguity.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.450
Every law has some ambiguity.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.760
And the best lawyers at the
Federal Reserve, the best

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.430
lawyers at the US Department
of Treasury and elsewhere

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.020
were thinking, where
is the ambiguity?

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:04.520
And can we use that uncertainty
in the law to save the system?

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.080
And then they went to Congress.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.750
They went to Congress and
asked for $700 billion.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:13.830
When Hank Paulson Treasury
Secretary went to Congress,

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.390
they sent a four
page, but it might

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:19.320
have been three page legislative
request for $700 billion.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:24.970
I remember I first read
that three or four page

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:29.650
request, because then a senator
from New York, Hillary Clinton,

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.450
asked me, this thing's come up.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.760
Will you read it and
give me your advice?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.830
It didn't take me long
to read three pages.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.260
It was an outright
request for $700 billion.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.480
It finally did pass.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.120
It first failed in the
House of Representatives.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.730
It became, I think, a couple
hundred page document.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:53.110
But $700 billion of US taxpayer
money went to the treasury,

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:56.510
and the treasury then
lended out and so forth.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.690
So it was multiple things.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.260
10 years later--

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.570
10 years later, a
law here, Dodd-Frank,

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.720
limits some of what the
federal government can do.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.470
It tightened the ability
to be the fire department

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.400
in the midst of a raging fire.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.562
And there's lively
public debate recently.

00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:18.770
Tim Geithner, who was Treasury
Secretary at the time,

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.720
has come out publicly,
and Ben Bernanke,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.178
I think, and they've written
an Op-Ed and some other pieces

00:28:23.178 --> 00:28:26.150
saying, it would be good to
loosen some of those Dodd-Frank

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.710
restrictions.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.210
But there's others
on the other side

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.720
who have said, no, we need to
keep those restrictions tight.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.900
Because if the restrictions are
loose, then we have something

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.510
called moral hazard.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.590
Does anybody know what
moral hazard might be?

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.800
STUDENT: I think it's
you run a risk that

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.860
is not commensurate
with what you can do.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:55.043
But if you're confident
because [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:55.043 --> 00:28:56.710
GARY GENSLER: And who
will run the risk?

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.560
STUDENT: It could be a
bank or it could be--

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.860
GARY GENSLER: So the banks
or financial institutions,

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.610
if you know you're
going to be bailed out,

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:04.660
will take more risk.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:10.600
It's human-- it's who we are.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.330
So my father had a small
business in Baltimore.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.580
He never had more
than 30 employees.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:20.890
It was a cigarette and candy
and pinball machine business.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.680
If he couldn't make payroll on
Friday, the city of Baltimore

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.670
was not going to help
him out on Monday.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.930
His employees might give him
another week or two-- hey, Sam!

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.370
My dad's name is Sam.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.440
We'll give Mr. Sam another week.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.390
But two or three weeks later,
they would have all quit.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:44.570
But the banks, so large, so
tied into their economies--

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.760
for many decades.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.460
2008 wasn't the only time.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.110
The sovereign steps in.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.030
The central bank steps in.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.590
So Kelly, the answer
to your question

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.760
is, there's probably less
ability for the central bank

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.770
in the US to step in.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.410
They still have very
real tools to be

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.780
the firefighter in the
middle of a raging fire,

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.870
but they're a little
bit more constrained.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.390
We as a society spoke through
our Congress and said,

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.490
we don't want bailouts.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.430
But in the midst of the
next crisis, some Treasury

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.710
Secretary, and some
Federal Reserve chair,

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.280
and maybe some president,
will be testing the limits

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.760
of those statutory authorities.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.287
And they might be knocking on
the doors of Congress again.

00:30:28.287 --> 00:30:30.120
STUDENT: I guess my
question is more testing

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.190
out the implications
of if we were to have--

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:37.980
for example, if Bitcoin were to
be backed by central banks what

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.875
those implications would be that
say, all of a sudden, instead

00:30:42.875 --> 00:30:44.920
of a ton of Bitcoin
had to be issued,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.490
we probably all know there's
a restriction on the supply

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:48.510
there.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:49.430
So--

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.710
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.150
Anybody want to take the other
side of Kelly's question?

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.190
Bitcoin's now the
currency that's--

00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.830
hypothetically, the
Bitcoin or some crypto.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.870
Alin would tell us it
would be some other crypto.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.470
Maybe it's Algorand
or something.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:08.190
What happens?

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.850
What's going to happen to the
flexibility of a central bank

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.390
and a government to bail
out their economy if it

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.745
was a crypto?

00:31:16.745 --> 00:31:17.850
STUDENT: It goes down.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.550
Kind of like the
example of the EU.

00:31:20.773 --> 00:31:22.440
GARY GENSLER: Remind
me your first name?

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.070
STUDENT: Isaac.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.903
GARY GENSLER: Isaac.

00:31:23.903 --> 00:31:25.210
So Isaac says it goes down.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:25.940
What do you mean?

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.510
It means their
flexibility goes down?

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.350
Tom?

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.142
STUDENT: I mean, if
it's a crypto currency,

00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:36.580
like we know from
today, it's impossible.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.080
Right?

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.430
I mean, there has to be
a finite set of coins,

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.180
tokens, whatever they are.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:48.228
And there has to be consensus
protocols. it has to be--

00:31:48.228 --> 00:31:49.020
GARY GENSLER: Eric?

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.270
So Tom contends--

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.310
Isaac says it gets a lot harder.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.510
Tom says it's not just
harder, it's impossible.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.010
Eric?

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.600
STUDENT: It depends
on the design

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.850
of the cryptocurrency
platform that underlines

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.230
the crypto that's being used.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:06.900
Because we will see
maybe later in this class

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.280
there are some known
collateralized stable coins

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.740
that actually have
smart contracts that

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:18.210
enforce money supply policies
to keep [INAUDIBLE] stable,

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.910
which is really similar
to handling money

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:23.740
supply in an automatic way.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.900
GARY GENSLER: So
Eric is saying--

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.780
we'll take one more.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:27.820
STUDENT: Well in the
case of Bitcoin rates--

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.525
GARY GENSLER: Remind
me your first name.

00:32:28.525 --> 00:32:29.300
STUDENT: I'm Santosh.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.010
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:30.580
STUDENT: Santosh.

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.405
GARY GENSLER: Santosh.

00:32:31.405 --> 00:32:33.197
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
like the mining system

00:32:33.197 --> 00:32:34.370
contains protocol.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:35.845
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:35.845 --> 00:32:38.160
GARY GENSLER: So what Eric
and Santosh are saying

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.640
is there's some flexibility--
either flexibility written

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.610
into the algorithm,
or flexibility

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:50.490
in that the 51%, if there's
a consensus or a hard fork,

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.170
you might be able to adjust.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.570
But at its core, it's probably--

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.130
as Isaac introduced
it, it's harder.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:02.120
I don't know if it's impossible,
but I think it's a lot harder.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.630
Just like the European Union has
a lot harder time helping out

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.680
Greece because you now have
multiple countries involved

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.820
in the decision making.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.530
The consensus-- what
satisfies German economics

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.660
and German politics
is different than what

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.390
might satisfy Greek
economics and Greek politics.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.442
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:22.442 --> 00:33:24.400
STUDENT: So I'm a bit
confused, because I guess

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.820
we're switching terminology.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.070
So when you say central
banks and cryptocurrency,

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.500
you don't mean central
banks and CBDCs?

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.150
You mean something else?

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.808
It's not-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:33.808 --> 00:33:34.850
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.570
I think we're dealing in
a hypothetical discussion.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:43.640
What if a cryptocurrency
were to actually take hold,

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.600
like a Bitcoin, in the future?

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.360
I think that's what your
questions were about.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:48.860
Eric?

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.282
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
popular enough and used.

00:33:51.282 --> 00:33:52.490
GARY GENSLER: Popular enough.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.100
Used enough as a store
of value, used enough as

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.920
a medium of exchange.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.990
And then there was a crisis.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.660
Very different than a central
bank digital currency.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.120
Yes.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:06.940
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.139
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] sort
of like an old days stat

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.739
specialist on the
foreign exchange.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:14.340
Would they make markets
know that there was--

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:18.250
if there was hard selling, then
they could actually come in,

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.310
be a backstop or [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:24.460
GARY GENSLER: Andrew's asking,
could the private sector be--

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
the central bank

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:29.920
serve sort of like a
private sector really works.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.199
GARY GENSLER: So could a
central bank in essence

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:36.489
come in and support
a cryptocurrency?

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.409
To some extent, for sure.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.480
Depends on what
their reserves are.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.040
And they also, of
course, are part

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.350
of a government that has
a taxing authority, has

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.570
a military.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.860
I mean, there's a
lot of extra might

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.350
that comes with being
part of a government.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.230
So I think the answer is yes.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.900
But multi-jurisdictional
currencies

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.600
usually fail on some level.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.390
The euro is still an experiment.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.850
It may still fail some
decades in the future.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:06.440
It's been tested.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.040
But multi-jurisdictional
currencies

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.720
in the past, high probability
is they usually fail.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.830
Because you don't have one
political system, one unified

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:22.500
set of government accounts,
one taxing authority.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.970
You know, there's a
bunch of challenges.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.740
But let's move on and try to
hit some of the things on--

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.890
so that's kind of a review a
little bit of the other day.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.540
We said, what's Fiat currency?

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.070
We've talked about it of course.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.760
Fiat currency then
represents all three forms--

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.840
bank deposits and notes
and reserves, and it's

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.930
accepted for taxes
and it's legal tender.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.910
In this hypothetical
case, we hadn't even

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.010
gotten to whether would
Bitcoin be accepted

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.250
for taxes with
Bitcoin, or crypto

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.440
be accepted as legal tender.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:00.690
But I would remind everybody,
whatever the future holds,

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:05.040
I think wide adoption in any
country you'd have to address,

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.860
will the government
accept it for taxes?

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.175
Will the government say it's
accepted as legal tender?

00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:16.370
And until and
unless that happens,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.440
usually it wouldn't
have wide adoption,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.390
even in a country
that's in distress.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.125
Again, we're not talking about
central bank digital currency,

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:25.250
but you could say the same
thing about central bank

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.270
digital currency.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:30.980
Unless it's accepted for taxes,
which it probably would be,

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.650
or accepted as legal tender.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:42.800
So I wanted to go back
to private banknotes.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.770
So commercial banks have
issued notes in the past.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.980
Think of this as
basically a piece of paper

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.530
that represents a bank deposit.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.340
The same way that we might
be moving mobile money now,

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.510
think of it--

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.580
but most of this was
done before there

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.440
was a time of central banks.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.230
And in the US, it was called
the free banking area.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.110
Andrew Jackson was the seventh
president of the United States,

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:11.385
and he really didn't
like a central bank.

00:37:11.385 --> 00:37:13.900
It was called the second
bank of the United States,

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:18.810
but he let it
expire in the 1830s.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.730
Andrew Jackson--
does anybody know

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.970
what piece of currency
Andrew Jackson is on?

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.630
Where is his portrait?

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.650
$20 bill.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:31.500
The one that we keep passing
around and everything.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.900
Andrew Jackson also was
president in a period of time

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.150
that it paid off
the national debt.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.110
Paid it off to zero.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:44.810
He was a Tennesseean that had
a strong view about finance.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.930
We had a very tough
time in the 1840s,

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.430
so I'm not sure we should have
paid off the debt completely.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:53.970
But the free banking
era, the notes

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.880
that went around in the
US for 20 to 30 years,

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.490
were all banknotes.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:04.810
And then the Civil
War came along,

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.860
and the US government
needed to finance a war.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.590
And the word "greenback"
comes from 1863,

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:18.540
when the North, the union,
wanted to raise some money.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.450
And they literally started
printing greenbacks.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:25.450
And also the first
National Bank Act

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.540
passed during the Civil War.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.500
And the National Bank
Act set up something

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.230
called the Comptroller
of the Currency.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.660
And the Comptroller of the
Currency-- those two words,

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.090
they confused me a lot
when I was on Wall Street.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.670
Why was the bank regulator
called the Comptroller

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:41.350
of the Currency?

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:45.520
But in the 1860s, it was to
control all these banknotes

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.290
that were being issued by a
bunch of commercial banks, most

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.730
of which that failed.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.560
Hundreds failed.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.570
Many of the pieces
of paper would

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.590
trade at different values,
discounts to each other

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.140
and so forth.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.640
And some say that
the world we're

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.620
living in now with
cryptocurrency,

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.400
this new market, is a little bit
like the private note period.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.120
Interestingly, there's two
countries or two areas that

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.410
still use private banknotes.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.180
Anybody from Hong Kong?

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.620
James and Anton.

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.410
So who issues your
currency, your cash?

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.350
STUDENT: There are three banks.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:29.490
GARY GENSLER: Bank of China,
HSBC and Standard Chartered.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:33.630
Bank of China represents the
People's Republic of China.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.140
HSBC represents local
Hong Kong and Standard

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.690
Chartered represents Britain.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.330
STUDENT: Actually,
we should also

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.890
add the monetary authority.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.080
Because they issue
[INAUDIBLE] $10.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.340
GARY GENSLER: They do, but it's
not really a private bank note.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.250
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.690
GARY GENSLER: No.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.270
So in Hong Kong, the notes--

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.455
the dominant notes, am I right?

00:39:56.455 --> 00:39:57.580
STUDENT: Anything over $10.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.710
GARY GENSLER: Anything
over $10 is by a bank.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.530
They have to follow the
rules of the central bank.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.420
And anybody from
Scotland or Ireland?

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.950
Is that too far north?

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.900
But similarly, in
the United Kingdom,

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.300
there's Sterling Bank notes.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.130
So we still do
have some of this.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.350
There's still a little
legacy of it left--

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:24.380
a tightly, highly
constrained legacy

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.050
because it's-- the
monetary authority,

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.090
it's called in Hong Kong?

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.560
STUDENT: Actually, no.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.310
GARY GENSLER: Is it
called a central bank?

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.227
STUDENT: It's not called
central [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:34.227 --> 00:40:36.770
STUDENT: It's called
[INAUDIBLE] financial authority.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.728
GARY GENSLER: Monetary
and financial authority.

00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:40.650
So the word "monetary"
is right in there.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.545
Just like in the
1860s in the US,

00:40:42.545 --> 00:40:44.420
the bank authority was
called the Comptroller

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.650
of the Currency.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:49.140
And it still is called the
Comptroller of the Currency.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.005
James?

00:40:50.005 --> 00:40:51.290
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] UK.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.110
If anyone ever travels to the UK
and gets a Scottish bank note,

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.693
give it back to the
person who gave it

00:40:55.693 --> 00:40:59.750
to you, because you [INAUDIBLE]
in England, everyone panics.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.070
It's like, what is this?

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.290
This does not look
like a usual banknote.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.940
It is technically legal tender.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.000
But people go, ah!

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.615
Don't want it.

00:41:07.615 --> 00:41:09.740
GARY GENSLER: So it's not
good north of a certain--

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.060
STUDENT: It's not good south--

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.950
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]
south of something.

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:17.360
STUDENT: I read that it's
not legal tender in South--

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.960
but it's also not legal
tender in Scotland.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.560
So you can use them in
Scotland, as a matter of custom.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.210
That's a question I had.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:29.690
But as a technical legal
matter, it's actually not--

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.680
it doesn't extinguish the debt,
but somebody won't sue you.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.040
GARY GENSLER: I
believe Ross is right.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.720
But for those who
don't know, Ross

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:42.440
spent a career as a bankruptcy
lawyer, as a partner of a firm,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.840
before he came back
for a Sloan MBA.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.142
So I'll go with
Ross on this one.

00:41:47.142 --> 00:41:48.412
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:48.412 --> 00:41:50.120
STUDENT: Moral of the
story is, if you've

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.300
got a Scottish banknote,
just give it back.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.770
Because I don't want this.

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.130
GARY GENSLER: There you go.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.220
So stable value tokens.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.810
What's the moral on this, James?

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.560
If you've got a stable value
token, do you give it back?

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.100
STUDENT: Well, in theory,
it's stable value.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.690
So you can exchange it for
whatever it's tethered to.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.300
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.320
GARY GENSLER: So what
are stable value tokens,

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.530
and what value might they have?

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.620
What pain point in
the crypto space?

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.440
Why did they come about?

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.136
There was a reading on
it, so maybe it was just--

00:42:25.136 --> 00:42:28.400
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
off the volatility

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:34.590
of the cryptocurrency in a
way that it's backed by--

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:39.000
[INAUDIBLE] currency so that
the [INAUDIBLE] volatility.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.320
GARY GENSLER: Volatility.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.420
So ease to dampen
the volatility.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:51.100
Why would somebody want a crypto
asset but ease the volatility?

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.060
What are the use cases for
crypto without volatility?

00:42:56.527 --> 00:42:58.360
STUDENT: Well they just
mentioned like loans

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.555
and savings accounts
as an example.

00:43:00.555 --> 00:43:01.930
But the thing with
the volatility

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.880
is that it struggled
as a store of value,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.600
because it's not stable and it
just goes all over the place.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.510
GARY GENSLER: So--

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.753
STUDENT: They use it
a lot for trading.

00:43:11.753 --> 00:43:12.670
GARY GENSLER: Trading.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:13.170
What type?

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:14.950
STUDENT: Different
cryptocurrencies.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:15.790
GARY GENSLER:
Cryptocurrency trading.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:16.990
STUDENT: You want to sell--

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.630
you're going back
to the stable one,

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.760
then going back to
another cryptocurrency.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.240
You don't have to go
into the banking system.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.240
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.700
So maybe it's also
being used for trading.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.710
So I've heard that it
dampens volatility.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.030
I agree.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:32.980
It could be used for trading.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:36.160
Because you might go
crypto to crypto to crypto,

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.040
but you want to keep a
better store of value

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:44.260
and a stable token as well.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.130
And that's what it's been.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.200
I list four different
approaches to it.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.870
These are design features.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.300
They are trying to
do the same thing--

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.900
have a cryptocurrency
that's not centralized,

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.120
or at least not backed
by a government.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.040
Not centralized that way--

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.130
it might be centralized that
the algorithm in the software

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.500
is centralized--

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.930
and four different
design features.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.920
And I think there was a
reading on this if I remember.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.340
Does anybody want to say
anything about tether?

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:21.470
What-- basically
backed by US dollars?

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.380
STUDENT: I think one
of the big issues

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.360
with it is that, if it
were to be really adopted,

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.210
you would need to have
a ton of collateral

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.760
to make it useful to people.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.010
And then the other issue
is that you'd also probably

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:40.570
need a central bank
like the Fed to actually

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:41.690
be there intervening.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:43.695
And that kind of goes
against the purpose.

00:44:43.695 --> 00:44:46.070
GARY GENSLER: Stephanie is
saying, if it really took off,

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:47.410
you'd need a ton of collateral.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:52.550
What if tether, or any Fiat
collateralized currency,

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.470
was not just a couple
billion dollars

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:58.520
but it was a trillion dollars
or a couple of trillion?

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.685
The whole US banking system
is about $16 trillion.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:08.800
There's $13-ish
trillion of deposits.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.070
What if you had a coin
that's 1 trillion of that?

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:17.470
STUDENT: If it's supposedly
backed by-- if it's that large

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:21.040
and it's supposedly backed by US
dollars, you have two choices--

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.060
three choices, right?

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.570
You either have a stack of
$100s for a trillion dollars.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:26.110
Physical--

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:26.735
GARY GENSLER: Paper.

00:45:26.735 --> 00:45:27.250
Linen.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:28.240
STUDENT: Paper.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.060
Or you have bank
deposits, which is what

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.370
you're trying to get out of.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:35.710
Or you've got the money with the
Federal Reserve, which you're

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:36.990
also trying to get out of.

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:39.220
So those are your only
three choices for,

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.920
where actually is
the collateral?

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.150
It has to be somewhere.

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.400
GARY GENSLER: But the reason
to drill into this, this

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.040
is part of the motivation
of why central banks are

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.860
looking at central
bank digital currency.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.710
They've been watching not just
Bitcoin and the whole crypto

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.980
space, but then they've
watched stable value tokens

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.880
come along--

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.980
stable value tokens
that are generally

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.610
backed by some blockchain
technology and blockchain

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:07.450
initiative that, frankly, they
don't have to be blockchain.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:11.050
I think you could build
something without it.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:14.190
STUDENT: Something-- if you have
a Fiat collateralized stable

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:17.630
coin like Heather, I can
understand why there's

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:19.090
a technological use case.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.090
Maybe you want to use it
as [INAUDIBLE] trading,

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:25.700
or you want to lock value on a
blockchain that's not volatile.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.400
And there's also a
business case where,

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.550
if it does go above a dollar--

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:31.860
the coin goes above
$1 or below $1,

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.150
you can either issue more
and keep the difference

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.600
or buy that coin and
keep the difference.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.250
And you can potentially--
if it's small enough,

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:43.890
you can invest that in a
bank and you can get interest

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.410
on the collateral.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.870
But I do agree with you.

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.300
The problem comes
along when you have

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.730
this huge scale of a trillion.

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.180
Then at that point--

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.230
I don't know if it's a
trillion, the $10 trillion,

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:00.100
a couple billion or whatever.

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:04.650
But when you run into
the same type of scenario

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:09.180
where the US dollar went off the
gold reserve or we just became

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.600
untethered to the
reserves of the coin.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.360
Because it's so
widespread and ubiquitous,

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.737
that stability is now--

00:47:17.737 --> 00:47:19.320
GARY GENSLER: So is
your thought being

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.680
that if it really grew
and it was accepted

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:26.250
in commerce that
maybe it wouldn't

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.830
have to be tethered
to the Fiat currency,

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:30.960
it would then become--

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.280
trust the trusted?

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.970
The way that the paper
currency became trusted.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:39.910
And Richard Nixon
in 1971 could say,

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.400
we're no longer going
to follow Bretton Woods.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.210
Or in 1933 when FDR
and our country said,

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:49.110
we're going off
the gold standard.

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.693
STUDENT: With that,
you would probably

00:47:50.693 --> 00:47:54.770
need to create some kind of
central authority that manages

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.092
monetary policy [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:57.092 --> 00:47:59.300
GARY GENSLER: I think you
raise an interesting point.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:04.610
I think we're well,
well before that.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:07.010
I think right now, though,
the interesting thing

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:11.060
is there's a lot of
entrepreneurial activity

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:14.740
in stable value tokens.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.710
My observation is one
of the leading reasons

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:19.540
was stated right here.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.970
In the crypto exchange
markets, which

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.820
we'll talk about next Tuesday,
in the crypto exchange markets,

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.280
a lot of people
want to go and trade

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.380
crypto to crypto and
not crypto to Fiat.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.120
And what are some of the
regulatory or economic reasons

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.220
they don't want to
trade crypto to Fiat?

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.380
Tom?

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.160
Taxes?

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:39.850
Anything else?

00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:44.266
That's another big thing
that the government--

00:48:44.266 --> 00:48:45.943
STUDENT: It could
potentially be traced.

00:48:45.943 --> 00:48:47.360
GARY GENSLER: It
could potentially

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.740
be maybe more readily traced.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.360
STUDENT: KYC and AML.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.480
GARY GENSLER: So KYC.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.865
You want to remind the class
what those letters mean?

00:48:55.865 --> 00:48:58.308
STUDENT: Know Your Customer
and Anti Money Laundering.

00:48:58.308 --> 00:49:02.710
GARY GENSLER: So there's a
whole regime around the world--

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.750
in the US, it's called
the Bank Secrecy Act--

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.550
but around the
world about knowing

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:12.460
one's customer, tracking anti
money laundering and so forth.

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.440
One of the dominant things
in crypto that's going on--

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.160
maybe mistakenly, maybe just
because it's an early stage--

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.980
is that some people who
have crypto assets feel,

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.900
I don't want to trade
that for a Fiat asset.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.130
I don't want to trade it
to euros or dollars or yen.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:33.120
Because then, it's more
likely the official sector

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.695
can track me for taxes.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:40.650
I think there is a false notion
that if I sell something crypto

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.740
and I buy something
else crypto, I

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:46.700
do not have to report my
gains or losses in my taxes.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.625
Now the US has
clarified that you do.

00:49:49.625 --> 00:49:51.500
But for a couple of
years, people were going,

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.868
well, maybe it's just what's
called a like kind exchange,

00:49:55.868 --> 00:49:57.410
like selling one
piece of real estate

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:58.970
for another piece
of real estate.

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:02.750
By the way, if you sold
gold and bought silver--

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:06.980
gold for silver, that was not a
like kind exchange under US tax

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.060
law.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:11.120
But they were tax advisors going
around saying, well, there's

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.935
some ambiguity.

00:50:12.935 --> 00:50:14.810
Maybe you don't need to
pay your taxes if you

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:17.230
went from Bitcoin to ether.

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:20.590
The tax bill that was passed
in December, that's called

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:24.697
the Trump tax bill,
that closed that window.

00:50:24.697 --> 00:50:26.030
One of the few things it closed.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:34.170
But I think because of illicit
activity, because of taxes,

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:36.440
there's still a lot of
people that would say,

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.000
I'd just rather go
crypto to crypto.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.220
But there's one other
thing, the reason

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.040
why people might want a stable
value token about the payment

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.550
system.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:47.150
We talked about it last week.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.960
Do I see a hand up?

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.035
Are you going to help me out?

00:50:49.035 --> 00:50:50.660
STUDENT: I was going
to say, it's quick

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.222
and it's very cost efficient.

00:50:52.222 --> 00:50:54.680
GARY GENSLER: So it's quick
and it might be cost efficient.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.660
We talked about--
and I had a chart

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.420
about using crypto
as a bridge currency

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.120
to move cross-border payments.

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.720
If you're moving from US
dollars to Mexican peso,

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.410
that can take 2, 3, 4 days
in correspondent banking

00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:11.120
systems and the like.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.920
But what if you
use from US dollars

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.490
to crypto to Mexican peso?

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.520
Very legitimate
use case that can

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.310
lower your cross-border
payment down

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:25.040
to seconds rather than days.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.340
Very legitimate use case that
may be stable value tokens

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.410
would be a good use case.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:34.070
So again, if
anybody's interested

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.150
in the different
design characteristics,

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.390
it's interesting, there's
a professor over at Harvard

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:42.295
that came to see.

00:51:42.295 --> 00:51:44.420
He teaches Harvard Business
School, came to see me,

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.930
that he's creating a non
collateralized seigniorage

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.030
based stable value token.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.040
So just even here
in Cambridge there's

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.430
a bunch of people looking at
trying to create things and do

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.988
things, and a lot of energy.

00:51:58.988 --> 00:52:01.280
They're always asking me,
what's a real blockchain use?

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.170
Some of it's just in this area.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.820
Hugo, and then we'll move on.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.110
STUDENT: One other
thing that with a couple

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.410
of the Fiat collateralized
ones that you don't have up

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:09.100
on there.

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:12.320
So like Gemini, the exchange
recently created one,

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.590
and Circle created one
that Coinbase adopted.

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.910
And those are both
on top of Ethereum.

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:20.000
And I think actually--
at least with Gemini.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.670
I'm not positive
about that Circle one.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:28.040
Coded into the smart contract
is the ability to freeze tokens.

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.690
So you could say that's an
AML type of thing, right?

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:38.600
If I see something weird
with transactions with GUSD,

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.945
then they could actually
stop and seize tokens.

00:52:41.945 --> 00:52:43.820
GARY GENSLER: So what's
the mood of the class

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.180
around stable value tokens
that can be frozen right

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.440
in the smart contract?

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.220
Does that seem in the
spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto?

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.360
What's that Hugo?

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:53.920
No?

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:54.420
Ross?

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.760
STUDENT: I have a question.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.290
Who's they?

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.650
STUDENT: Gemini, whoever
wrote the smart contract.

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.820
GARY GENSLER: Whoever
controls the smart contract.

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.780
In that case, that would
be a crypto exchange

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.912
run by-- who's Gemini run by?

00:53:07.912 --> 00:53:09.120
STUDENT: Winklevoss brothers.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.990
GARY GENSLER: A couple
of identical twins.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:13.070
Not the Genslers.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.290
Well, the Genslers
weren't in the movie

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:21.920
and didn't make a lot
of money on crypto.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.835
The Winklevoss twins, by
the way, who were at the--

00:53:24.835 --> 00:53:28.290
the wonderful story with
Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard,

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:29.990
if you remember the
Winklevoss twins,

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:33.200
and they're rowing,
part of a rowing elite,

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.070
too, have made a lot
of money in crypto.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:41.460
And we'll talk a little bit
about them next Tuesday.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.990
So then central banks
and cryptocurrencies.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:47.390
There was-- we talked
about this the other day.

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.820
There's four things
they're really doing.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:52.400
They're monitoring and studying.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.060
Some are restricting the use,
like the Central Bank of China,

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.120
some are trying to do payment
system experimentation.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.000
We talked about
Singapore and Canada.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.430
Those are real
blockchain initiatives,

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:06.350
the payment systems.

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:09.950
School's still out as to whether
they need to use the blockchain

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:11.730
technology.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:14.250
But they are seriously
leaning in, particularly

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.380
in Singapore and
Canada, saying there

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.270
might be a more
resilient payment

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:21.870
system if we use a decentralized
distributed blockchain

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:29.000
technology based on Quorum or
Quarta or Hyperledger Fabric.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.310
I think we're a few years away
from them sort of coming--

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.670
is there enough there?

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.900
Enough there there
that it would be better

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.220
than traditional databases?

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.890
But they are definitely
putting a lot of energy--

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:43.880
and even the European Central
Bank, with the Bank of Japan,

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:47.000
has an initiative as well.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.700
But in the fourth category,
central bank digital currency

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.350
initiatives, I
caution everybody.

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:54.120
You don't necessarily need
to use blockchain technology.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.120
This is the part of
the course to say,

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.280
this is something
clearly inspired

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:03.380
by Satoshi Nakamoto's innovation
and inspired by stable value

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:05.730
tokens.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:08.700
But when we talk about the
bank of Sweden's initiative

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.200
and some of these
other initiatives,

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.060
you'll find that,
to my knowledge,

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.478
they're not built on
blockchain technology.

00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:17.520
That doesn't mean they
couldn't be in the future,

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.530
but I think they're
important, because they're

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.260
really important to
blockchain and money

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.070
and how central banks are
thinking about this area

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:28.780
right now,

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.750
We talked about this last week,
the first wave of payments

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:34.050
were all on Ethereum.

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:37.090
And as I said, they've
moved on from Ethereum.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:40.540
And the second wave of the
payment system initiatives

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.060
are all permission blockchains.

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.850
And now they're looking
at a third wave.

00:55:45.850 --> 00:55:48.670
If there's further questions
about how central banks are

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:51.100
looking, I'll take
them now, or we'll

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:55.510
go on to the central
bank digital currencies.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:56.310
Please.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:57.977
STUDENT: What do
central banks currently

00:55:57.977 --> 00:55:59.668
use to manage whose
deposits are whose?

00:55:59.668 --> 00:56:00.710
GARY GENSLER: Whose what?

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.300
STUDENT: Like if it's Morgan
Stanley's deposits or Goldman

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.800
Sachs' deposits, when
they exchange deposits

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.730
within the central bank, what do
they currently use to manage--

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.450
GARY GENSLER: They use various
forms of traditional databases,

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:15.240
and I'm not going to
pretend that I know exactly

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.740
each of those databases.

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.520
But usually, for
interbank money,

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.940
as you've talked about Morgan
Stanley or Goldman Sachs,

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:27.120
they would call it the Real
Time Gross Settlement System,

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.020
RTGS system.

00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.670
But the actual underlying
database structure

00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:35.520
frankly probably goes
back to batch processing.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.560
Most of them are still
batch processing.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.220
In the US, I think we'll
roll out a faster payment

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:45.530
structure in 2020.

00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:48.410
And Sriham who was
visiting with us,

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:52.370
was on a whole big advisory
group to the Federal Reserve

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:53.430
to do that.

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:56.210
Does that help a little bit?

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:59.060
But the question really is,
could blockchain technology

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.180
inspire the next generation
for the mid 2020s

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:04.010
for any of these countries?

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:07.310
To have 24 hour,
seven days a week,

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:10.430
but also no one
central place where

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:13.820
the ledger is kept, with
multiple parties sharing

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.480
the ledger.

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.983
And as Alin said,
but wait a minute,

00:57:16.983 --> 00:57:18.400
wouldn't a central
bank still want

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.440
to have authority
over the protocol?

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.730
The protocol amongst
20 or 50 banks.

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:27.970
And the answer is
probably yes, but they're

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:30.640
trying to explore what's
the most resilient system.

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:36.020
So central bank
digital currencies.

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.720
Central banks, of course,
already issue digital reserves.

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.550
So the real question is this.

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:43.550
Should access be
given to others?

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:47.400
Should it be expanded
to the retail public?

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.882
And so these were the
ones we chatted about.

00:57:49.882 --> 00:57:51.840
And we're just going to
go through four of them

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.660
quickly just to say--

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:59.820
you had a little reading on
each of Ecuador, Senegal, Sweden

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.570
and the Philippines.

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:06.900
These are the opportunities
that the central bankers even

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.300
talk about.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.460
Basically, in
Sweden's perspective,

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.860
they want to stay in the
business of providing

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.160
a means of payment.

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.520
And the krona is so barely used.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.466
Nobody's here from Scandinavia?

00:58:22.466 --> 00:58:24.440
No.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.750
The krona is so barely
used they want to keep

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:31.690
it having some influence.

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:35.070
I'm trying to think if
I put that chart in.

00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:37.110
I'm going to skip over
a couple of things.

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:40.080
No, I didn't put the
chart in, so I apologize.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:43.140
So what challenges do you
think are really there

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.670
from our readings?

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:46.620
Which of these challenges
do you think scares

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.810
the central banks the most?

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:51.340
Is it financial stability?

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:55.630
Is it changing the credit
intermediation of banks?

00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:56.905
Is it monetary policy?

00:58:56.905 --> 00:58:59.750
Is it a payment structure?

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:01.370
Or is it all of the above?

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:02.452
Alin.

00:59:02.452 --> 00:59:04.273
STUDENT: I guess
financial stability.

00:59:04.273 --> 00:59:05.690
GARY GENSLER:
Financial stability.

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:07.400
Basically, a run on the banks.

00:59:12.078 --> 00:59:12.620
I don't know.

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.660
I would say that in
my conversations--

00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.520
and Robleh Ali has
many more of them.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.340
But my conversations
with central bankers,

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.970
it's a mixture of the first
one-- the one Alin did say.

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:26.660
And then, basically
the third one.

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.340
Credit allocation.

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:32.360
That they feel like if we insert
the central bank more directly

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.250
into taking retail
deposits, are we

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.270
going to be inserting
the central bank more

00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:40.820
into credit allocation?

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:45.580
Or in essence, if we shrink
the need for commercial banks,

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.650
are we somehow shrinking
the credit allocation

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:50.890
in the economy?

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:53.340
So in normal times,
they worry, in essence,

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.580
about credit and the
extension of credit.

00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:59.340
And in crisis, they
worry about being--

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.310
that it would
destabilize the system.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:07.000
That's been my experience
talking just in these eight

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.530
months to central bankers.

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:10.030
Isaac?

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:12.730
STUDENT: The central bank is
taking the deposits, rather

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:14.410
than the commercial bank.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:17.020
Wouldn't that just be reflected
in a change of the interest

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:17.520
rate?

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.812
Because they would have
the underlying funds.

01:00:19.812 --> 01:00:21.520
And so that might just
flow back through.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.890
When the central bank is
determining the federal funds

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:25.093
rate, it would be adjusted.

01:00:25.093 --> 01:00:27.760
And so corporate borrowers would
be able to borrow [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.080
GARY GENSLER: So what
Isaac is saying is,

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.300
couldn't you just address
this as a central bank

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.930
through interest rate policy and
some differential interest rate

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:37.410
and the pricing of money?

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:40.700
And I think some would
contend you could.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.920
But on the other side--

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.420
anybody want to
take the other side?

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:49.510
The question really is
is, does the central bank

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:50.695
want to start making loans?

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.780
Now the US central bank
has a $4.5 trillion

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.150
balance sheet, as we
talked about two days ago,

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:00.380
and owns about $2--

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:04.780
a little less than $2 trillion,
$1.5 trillion of mortgages.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.820
So in a sense, the
central bank is already

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.070
making a credit decision.

01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:11.840
They're lending to
the mortgage market.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.340
But the question is, do you
want to go even further and have

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:18.060
the central bank picking
individual companies

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.180
or individual
homeowners to lend to?

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:26.040
And that's what-- if it
got to any scale or size,

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.050
they talk about.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.780
Of course, they could just lend
to the commercial bank system,

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.708
and then the public would be
lending to the central bank,

01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:34.250
and the central bank
would be lending

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:37.180
to the commercial banks.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.605
So the design considerations--
and we didn't talk about these.

01:01:40.605 --> 01:01:43.380
These eight design
considerations

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.000
are all in the loop.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.140
Does everybody get it?

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.280
Only a few people get it.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:52.080
It's a token or
account and so forth.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.390
This little money
flower that Garrett

01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:56.700
has put out there--
and central banks

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.025
talk about the money flower.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.180
Where is Bitcoin on this?

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.843
Who wants to tell
me where Bitcoin is?

01:02:04.843 --> 01:02:06.260
We'll bring it
back to blockchain.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.460
Eilon.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.988
STUDENT: Private digital
tokens, wholesale only.

01:02:13.988 --> 01:02:15.030
GARY GENSLER: Wait, wait.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:16.690
So where am I pointing?

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:18.040
STUDENT: Blue and orange.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.450
GARY GENSLER: Blue and orange.

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:20.790
Oh, it's written there.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:22.690
You mean right there.

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:25.045
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
without the red.

01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:26.860
GARY GENSLER: Without
the red, right here.

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.680
Private digital
tokens, wholesale only?

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.010
No.

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:35.200
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.610
GARY GENSLER: Tell me
where you want me to point.

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:41.760
So you're saying
it's orange and what?

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.192
And blue.

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:45.530
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:51.530
GARY GENSLER: It is
widely acceptable.

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:56.870
Bitcoin's widely accessible,
meaning anybody can get it.

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.060
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:03:01.095 --> 01:03:03.435
GARY GENSLER: I would say
you can put any form of money

01:03:03.435 --> 01:03:04.810
into one of these
little blocks--

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:10.910
government backed and
not government backed.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.380
Where is stable value tokens?

01:03:14.808 --> 01:03:15.350
Look at this.

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:17.612
You're the closest, and I
can't remember your name.

01:03:17.612 --> 01:03:18.320
STUDENT: Connery.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.500
GARY GENSLER: Connery,
where's stable value tokens?

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.795
It's not central bank issued.

01:03:22.795 --> 01:03:23.670
I'll give you a hint.

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.780
So it's not in the green.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.966
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
private digital?

01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:32.758
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

01:03:32.758 --> 01:03:34.110
It's private digital tokens.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.610
You could make it
wholesale only,

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:40.460
or you can make it widely
accessible like this.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] but they
can be, and most of them are,

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:48.280
central issued even if
it's not central bank.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.603
I mean, I guess it depends on
how you define central bank.

01:03:52.603 --> 01:03:54.020
It's not a sovereign
central bank,

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.840
but it's one entity that
issues a token that's

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.100
tethered to the US dollar.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.300
It holds the US dollar.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.100
GARY GENSLER: So I think
it's an excellent point.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:10.220
A stable value token that
is backed by a Fiat currency

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:12.620
is not central bank issue.

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.170
I would say that it's
not in the light green.

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:20.750
But it's highly dependent
on the central bank.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.290
It's highly dependent on putting
deposits in commercial banks.

01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:28.910
Tether, which purports to
be a little over two $2,

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:33.110
$2.5 billion crypto which
is all backed by US dollars,

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:35.960
at one point in
time last year, they

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:39.050
lost some of their
commercial bank accounts.

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.650
Meaning the commercial banks
would not take their dollars.

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:45.350
The commercial banks in many
countries said, forget it,

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:48.110
I can't have you
as a customer, I

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:51.720
can't follow you for any money
laundering and otherwise.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.550
And so in essence, you
are highly dependent,

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:59.570
if you're a custodial stable
value, on the central bank.

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:00.480
I agree with that.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.110
But I think you're
not not central bank.

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:04.455
[INAUDIBLE] a little--

01:05:04.955 --> 01:05:06.260
STUDENT: It's just central.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.427
GARY GENSLER: It is central.

01:05:07.427 --> 01:05:09.160
Right.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.390
So there's a lot of
paradoxes and irony

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:14.600
in the blockchain crypto space
as to how centralized something

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.160
it is and how decentralized.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:21.200
And from Satoshi Nakamoto
is a very decentralized way.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.760
So we're going back to these.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.495
And so Ecuador.

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.520
Anybody read the Ecuador thing?

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.240
Want to tell us a
little bit about--

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.040
Leonardo?

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:37.250
STUDENT: Well, I think it
was a story of failure.

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:39.462
GARY GENSLER: A
story of failure.

01:05:39.462 --> 01:05:43.150
STUDENT: Because [INAUDIBLE]
issue the [INAUDIBLE] money.

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:46.030
It was backed by
the central bank.

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:48.460
But the central bank had
no credibility or trust

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.870
from the users.

01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:51.760
So it never took off.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.050
So the government of Ecuador
had just defaulted a few years

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.720
before they launched this.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.740
The economy was [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.080
So they issued something
where people didn't really

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.840
know whether it would still
be there within a few years.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.130
The usage was
extremely disappointing

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:12.030
compared with the
initial expectations.

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:14.440
STUDENT: But another interesting
point in that article

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.050
was that financial
institutions were not

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.420
obliged to use it whatsoever.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:21.820
And I sort of
wonder if there had

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:27.010
been a minimum level of balance
sheets at these institutions,

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:29.500
where they were required
to have a minimum level

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:34.450
of the cryptocurrency,
could that

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.408
have helped it a little bit?

01:06:36.408 --> 01:06:36.950
I don't know.

01:06:39.508 --> 01:06:41.050
STUDENT: That's
[INAUDIBLE] they also

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:42.730
failed to manage expectations.

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:45.280
Because even in the
first year, what they

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.440
are saying, what
they are claiming is,

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.710
there are going to be
500,000 users or something.

01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:57.310
[INAUDIBLE] turns out just
5,000 accounts or users came up.

01:06:57.310 --> 01:07:02.650
So it's a great
story of failure.

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:03.760
[INAUDIBLE]

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.990
STUDENT: Bitcoin was also these
matching benefits and costs

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:09.650
that were associated
with the project.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:14.360
They kind of [INAUDIBLE]
calculations were made.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.540
The benefits were
less than $1 million

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:21.100
compared to almost $7
million [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.450
From the start, from
the outset, the design

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.112
wasn't conceived in
an appropriate manner.

01:07:26.112 --> 01:07:27.820
GARY GENSLER: And
again, this is somewhat

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.610
inspired by crypto finance.

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:36.355
No blockchain technology
involved in it.

01:07:36.355 --> 01:07:38.730
Which, by the way, is going
to be true for the next three

01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:40.290
examples as well.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.220
But it's relevant.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.680
This is sort of also
inspired by initiatives

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.360
like [INAUDIBLE] and so forth.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.052
It's like, how do we get more
inclusion and use dollars?

01:07:48.052 --> 01:07:49.260
Kelly, and then we'll go to--

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.680
STUDENT: I just feel
like it was less of a--

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.330
I feel like it was
less of an attempt

01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:57.300
to take some new digital
currency initiative

01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.450
and more of an attempt
to make profits.

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:03.720
Because they said that
basically the state

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.430
had a monopoly on this.

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:10.260
And as Leonardo mentioned, there
was previously hyper inflation.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.980
So once they discovered that
it wasn't really getting

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.308
them the profits they
wanted [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:16.350
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:16.975
STUDENT: Right.

01:08:16.975 --> 01:08:19.260
So I'm sort of wondering--

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.819
the motivation I
don't really think

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:24.062
was to do a proper job
on the technology side.

01:08:24.062 --> 01:08:27.502
GARY GENSLER: And you're
probably right about that.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:28.960
One good thing that
came out of it,

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.470
they finally sort of admitted
that they shouldn't maybe

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:34.800
be in the monopoly, and they
let-- mobile phone payment

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.979
alternatives were authorized
for the phone companies.

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:39.779
But I'm not close enough
to Ecuador to know

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:42.210
whether that was really done.

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.250
Maybe it's now just
a duopoly of a couple

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.479
of phone companies doing it.

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:48.810
So they might have just
shifted some economic rents

01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:51.990
from the government to a
couple of major companies

01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:55.300
that are friends of the
government or something.

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:56.649
The Philippines.

01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:58.120
I think there was a reading on--

01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:03.910
anybody want to say
something about-- anybody

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:05.261
from the Philippines?

01:09:05.261 --> 01:09:07.203
No.

01:09:07.203 --> 01:09:08.870
Anybody want to say
something about what

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:10.743
happened in the Philippines?

01:09:10.743 --> 01:09:12.410
And you're going to
see something that's

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:13.760
similar about this in Senegal.

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:20.125
There's a software
provider called eCurrency

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:24.729
Mint Limited in Ireland that
is marketing around the globe

01:09:24.729 --> 01:09:28.578
to do digital Fiat currency.

01:09:28.578 --> 01:09:30.120
I think they're
careful and they call

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.700
it digital Fiat currency
rather than the central bank

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:33.510
digital currency.

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:35.640
But nonetheless,
every time there's

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.520
a press release, whether from
the Philippines or Senegal

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.100
or elsewhere, somewhere
in the press release

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:45.600
you see blockchain
technology use for--

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.689
I've done my best to read
everything I can on these two

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:52.680
since last summer, when I
stumbled upon them in July.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.610
I do not believe that either
are using blockchain technology.

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.740
But they're sort of using
the gloss of the terminology.

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.350
But it's still--

01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:03.450
Senegal, more than
the Philippines,

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:08.160
is something that central
bankers are looking at.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.290
Importantly, it's issued
by a commercial bank.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.890
It's not technically
issued by the central bank.

01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:18.120
The central bank has actually
put out a statement and saying,

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.890
this is a test, and
a learned thing,

01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:21.570
and a regulatory sandbox.

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:24.000
The central bank is sort of
saying, all right, we'll let--

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.390
this is a little bit more
akin to private banknotes

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.220
in the 19th century in the US.

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:33.910
And I'll flip to
the Senegal one.

01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:38.320
This is in the West African
economic and monetary union.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.120
So there is a monetary
union, I think,

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:45.260
of 14 countries all
using a currency.

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.190
It's called the Franc, I think.

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:49.270
The F--

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:50.928
STUDENT: They call
it the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:51.970
GARY GENSLER: What is it?

01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:53.860
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
They use [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:55.690
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:56.640
Have you ever used it?

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.470
Do you know it?

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.600
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.810
GARY GENSLER: So one
country in a 14-nation block

01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:06.340
said, we can maybe get
more financial inclusion.

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:06.923
Good.

01:11:06.923 --> 01:11:08.590
I think there's a
good motivation there.

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.330
We can get more
financial inclusion.

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:13.690
We can put [INAUDIBLE]----
did I say it right?

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:15.940
[INAUDIBLE] on an
electronic platform.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.830
We'll use this
software provider out

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:21.680
of Ireland that keeps
knocking on our door.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.060
And we'll see if we can
push it out a little bit

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:26.860
under some e-money regulations.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:35.440
Technically, it's e-money
under pre-existing regulations.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.185
But I would say a lot of
central bankers are kind of--

01:11:38.185 --> 01:11:40.810
elsewhere around the globe sort
of watching, what does that do?

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:42.220
What does that mean?

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:47.250
Does it increase
financial inclusion?

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:49.110
And probably the
most interesting one

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:51.450
really is in Sweden.

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.747
Sweden has said, these
are the benefits.

01:11:53.747 --> 01:11:55.080
These are written in a document.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.420
They've written now the
third document on this.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.190
It came out a
couple of weeks ago.

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:01.690
It was not assigned reading
because it just came out,

01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:03.780
and it's 50 or 60
pages, if anybody

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.500
wants to log through it.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.380
They say, it's going to
continue the public access

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.810
to the risk free guaranteed
means of payment.

01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:16.730
That's the key thing to them.

01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:20.320
You have cash in your
pocket right now--

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.480
krona-- but very
few people have it.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:27.590
So few people have it that
most retailers in Sweden

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:31.460
are now saying, I
will not accept krona.

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.710
And it's not such a big
country that a bunch of people

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:38.580
want to own krona
for a store of value.

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:41.170
So the total outstanding--

01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:42.510
is there a question?

01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:45.750
STUDENT: Because like all the
companies that are listed,

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:48.650
they're listed in
kronas in Stockholm.

01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:53.440
So how come it's not used at
all but the stock markets use it

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.040
widely?

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.540
GARY GENSLER: The
stock market what?

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.880
STUDENT: Like the
companies which are listed,

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.593
they're listed in kronas.

01:12:59.593 --> 01:13:00.510
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:03.030
STUDENT: So like how come
it's not used at all?

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:04.890
GARY GENSLER: It's not used--

01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:06.810
no krona is used digitally.

01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:09.630
I'm saying paper
krona is not used.

01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:10.950
Paper krona.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:12.600
But they're saying,
we maybe want

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.420
to make sure that
there's a government's

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:21.050
direct relationship to
electronic government money.

01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:21.890
The properties.

01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:23.570
They've said-- they
were willing to put

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:25.310
a comprehensive
range of services

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:26.960
in, make it widely available.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.480
They've answered the
design considerations.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.980
And they actually
say that they're

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:33.443
looking at putting
interest rate on this.

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.360
They think that putting
an interest rate on it

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:38.270
makes sense.

01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:40.520
And that it should
have e-identification.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.435
They say, it will be traceable.

01:13:42.435 --> 01:13:44.060
They've already said
in their documents

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.110
they're not going to go with
totally anonymous e-money.

01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:53.700
This is out of their report.

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:58.290
But as you can see, the
blue line is Sweden.

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:00.420
That their total
outstanding cash--

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.880
this is physical,
tokenized cash--

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.040
was 4% of their GDP.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.430
It's now less than
2% of their GDP.

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:10.980
The US and Europe would
be the green line.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.470
We're up to about 10%.

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:17.090
But as we talked
about on Tuesday,

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:22.820
8 of those 10 points in
the US are $100 bills.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:28.230
And 4 or 5 of the 10 points in
the US are outside of the US.

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:29.730
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
is part of this

01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:32.670
because bank
deposits or reserves

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:38.040
or what we would hold involves
in dollars in the United

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:38.690
States?

01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:42.114
The banks here are
holding in Euros.

01:14:42.114 --> 01:14:44.580
GARY GENSLER: No, this
would be cash that's

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.700
outside that the public holds.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.610
Or the public can--

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:51.330
STUDENT: Not held in banks.

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:52.710
GARY GENSLER: That is correct.

01:14:52.710 --> 01:15:00.700
So if it's-- if it's cash
that JP Morgan is holding

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.640
physically, just because they're
putting it in that daily ATM

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.410
machine, it might be included.

01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:08.470
STUDENT: Or like the
x number of dollars

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:11.142
in everyone's bank accounts
[INAUDIBLE] bank deposits.

01:15:11.142 --> 01:15:13.100
GARY GENSLER: That's
[INAUDIBLE] bank deposits.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] M1.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:19.970
GARY GENSLER: This is actually
only about half of M1.

01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:24.175
This is the $1.6 or
$1.7 trillion of--

01:15:24.175 --> 01:15:25.960
it's about $1.8 trillion.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:33.360
$1.8 trillion in the US, of
which $1.6 trillion or $1.5

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.530
trillion is $100 bills.

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.110
There's only $200
to $300 billion

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:45.700
of US currency, paper currency,
that is not $100 bills.

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.040
And well over half of
$100 bills are outside

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.230
of the US per Federal
Reserve statistics.

01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:52.510
I think 57%.

01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:53.980
How they trace
that, that would be

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.870
another story for another day.

01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:59.170
But Sweden doesn't have
a bunch of people holding

01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:01.630
the equivalent of
$100 bills or 500 euro

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:04.390
notes as a store of value.

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:06.220
And so you see a
decline of their paper.

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.440
You see the retail
merchants aren't taking it.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.850
People aren't using it.

01:16:09.850 --> 01:16:11.740
So Sweden feels
compelled to say,

01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:14.290
I want to do something here.

01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:18.310
Tuesday, we're going to be
talking about crypto exchanges.

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:20.800
It's a bit of a setup
also for Thursday

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.200
when we've got our outside
speakers I keep chatting about.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.737
I think Talida--

01:16:27.737 --> 01:16:29.320
Talida had to leave
early today, but I

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.112
think Talida is going
to send you a message

01:16:31.112 --> 01:16:35.110
or put up on the website,
Jeff Sprecher and Kelly

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:37.090
sent a list of readings.

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:39.130
I guess they're used
to being-- they're

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:40.630
not actually used
to doing-- they're

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:41.995
doing this as a favor for me.

01:16:41.995 --> 01:16:44.620
I got to know him very well when
I was at the Commodity Futures

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.910
Trading Commission.

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:49.590
They're rolling out the--

01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:52.910
both a crypto exchange
and a payment alternative.

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:54.470
And so they sent
a bunch of things

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:56.178
that they thought you
might want to read.

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:59.635
So we put them up on the
website midday today.

01:16:59.635 --> 01:17:01.760
I know that you've got a
lot of other things to do,

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.410
and it's getting to
that time of year

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:05.668
where there's fewer and
fewer things you're reading.

01:17:05.668 --> 01:17:07.460
But what we're trying
to do on Thursday is,

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.760
I'm going to open up with
a little fireside chat.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.192
They want me to ask them a few
questions for 10 or 15 minutes.

01:17:14.192 --> 01:17:15.650
And then we're
going to open it up.

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:17.570
It's all going to be your time.

01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:19.580
They're with us about an hour.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.190
Now we might encourage
them to stay till the end,

01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:24.800
but they're here
from 2:30 to 3:30.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.900
Now I know we always
start at 2:35.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.960
But if they're ready
to go at 2:32 or 2:33,

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.220
I might start with them and
start the fireside chat.

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:37.180
And then it's going to be
you're asking them questions.

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:40.220
So to the extent that you
read the things that they

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.812
sent around, better for you.

01:17:42.812 --> 01:17:45.020
I will say this in advance,
because one or two of you

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.875
have already come
saying, I want to see

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.250
if I could go work for the
company that owns the New York

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.530
Stock Exchange and owns
[INAUDIBLE] and everything.

01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:53.840
I will be glad to
send whatever resumes

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.310
or anything you want
to Jeff and Kelly.

01:17:56.310 --> 01:18:00.830
I'll act as a clearinghouse and
send it if that's your goal.

01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:06.290
But in advance, I'm not going
to give their private emails

01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:08.160
to you and everything like that.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.120
But I think that would be
an interesting conversation

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.400
next week.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.140
So central banks play an
important role in the economy.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.650
We already live in
an electronic age.

01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:23.510
But they really are absolutely
at the epicenter of money

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:26.930
and how money's been defined
for 300 or 400 years.

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:31.070
Payment systems and Fiat
currencies have had challenges.

01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:32.960
I still continue to
think blockchain--

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.580
I told you, I'm
not a maximalist,

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.820
but blockchain technology
can be a catalyst for change.

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:42.740
Central bank digital
currencies is evidence of that,

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:45.270
even if it's not based
on blockchain technology.

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:50.210
I think it's partly inspired
and urged on by this.

01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:53.210
It doesn't solve what
blockchain technology

01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:55.370
would do for it, but--

01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:58.860
I think that central banks
by and large are monitoring.

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:01.640
They're exploring
payment systems,

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.240
and a handful are looking
at the central bank

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.650
digital currencies.

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:08.360
I think-- and this is
my own prediction--

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.160
that with 180
countries, somebody,

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.660
Sweden might be
the one to do it,

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.930
will be there to do some
central bank digital currency.

01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:18.050
Venezuela says they're
doing one backed by oil.

01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:19.910
So it might be the other end.

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:21.590
Iran says they want to do one.

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:23.000
They would avert sanctions.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.880
We didn't talk about that,
but sanctioned countries

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.170
are looking at ways
to avert sanctions.

01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:32.030
So there could be countries
in distress, countries looking

01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:36.080
to avert sanctions, or, you
know, kind of first tier

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.470
economic countries like
Sweden that are looking at it.

01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:42.010
So I will see you next Tuesday.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.270
ANDREW LO: So far, the
stock market is down.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.770
But on the other hand, if you
look at the three-month T-bill

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.049
rate, it's up about
60, 70 basis points.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.480
So that's not bad.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.790
Looks like there is some
sense that liquidity is going

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.552
to be good for the market.

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:44.710
And I guess we'll wait and see.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.797
But clearly, the
Fed is making a--

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.960
the Fed is making every effort
to maintain liquid markets.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.480
We should keep in mind--
those of you who are starting

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.340
to panic and
thinking, gee, really,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.530
all hell is about
to break loose--

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.140
keep in mind that interest rates
are still pretty low overall.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.180
Obviously, the Fed
cutting rates is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.910
going to mean that the overnight
borrowing rate between banks

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.360
and the Fed is low.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.420
But if you look at
commercial paper--

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.560
if you look at a variety of
other indicators of borrowing

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.820
rates, they're relatively low,
to the extent that markets

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.560
are, quote, "frozen."

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.810
It really means that the
banks and other agencies

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.550
are waiting to figure
out what's going

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.270
to happen with regard to the
rescue package and other market

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.330
events before they
start to lend again.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.030
And there's nothing
structurally wrong

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.930
with their particular
business models,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.380
nor is it the case that we
somehow run out of money

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.749
or we've all lost these assets.

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.790
Investors right now are
waiting on the sidelines.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.530
And you can tell
from market dynamics

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.500
that there's enormous
amount of fear that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.940
is really affecting markets.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.250
And this is exactly
the kind of reaction

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.310
that the Fed was trying to
forestall two weeks ago when

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.530
the money markets
broke the buck.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.710
And hopefully, they will
still be able to do so.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.690
But you can tell
that it's building.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.150
And market fear, as
measured by things

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.970
like the stock market
and bond markets,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.100
that's still a concern.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.430
So we'll wait and see.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.060
But so far, it seems
like the developments

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.020
are as we pretty much expected.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.560
There really isn't any
huge surprises going on.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.530
Any questions?

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.033
Yep?

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:39.490
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
share my experience.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.120
It's like about six
years ago in Argentina,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.690
we had this crises that
it was similar to this,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.990
in the sense that the
whole country disappeared.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.600
We had five
presidents in a week.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.400
We defaulted.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.150
The government defaulted.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.940
Half of the public
companies defaulted.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.760
We devalued our currency.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.170
It was really chaotic.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.950
And still, I don't
know how we survived.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.090
And two years afterwards, I went
into working to this investment

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.960
fund.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.740
And we just started
buying companies

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.840
that were really in sale.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.710
And when he says that
this creates opportunity,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.880
it sort of feels a little
naive or something like that,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.945
but it really creates
opportunities.

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:30.290
So those who survive can have
really good choices afterwards.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.560
So I don't know.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.942
What I'm doing now is
trying to take a deep breath

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:37.829
and flow through the crisis.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.870
ANDREW LO: Yeah, I think
that's very good advice.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.510
And in fact, in terms
of opportunities--

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.600
I think that right
now, because everybody

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.082
is transfixed on the
problems with the economy,

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:50.790
people aren't thinking
about opportunity,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.748
because they're scared.

00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:54.210
And I wish I could fast
forward and give you

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.737
my last lecture for
this course now,

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.320
because it's actually
pretty relevant.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.810
The last lecture of the
course is where I actually

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.334
bring in some evidence
about psychological biases

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:05.250
that affect all of us.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.208
And in particular, there's
some recent evidence

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:09.510
in the neurosciences
that explain

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.210
why it is that when we
are stricken with fear,

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.610
it almost paralyzes us.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.329
Actually, physiologically
it can paralyze us

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.519
in terms of
decision-making ability.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.350
So I don't want to
talk about it now,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.310
because that's going
to be the last lecture.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.730
And I feel we have to
cover the material.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.490
But it's true that when
you're in the midst of it,

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.060
it's very difficult
to think rationally.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.020
But I'll give you one
example of, I think,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.640
a wonderful idea that
nobody has mentioned but is

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.440
perfect for an MIT audience
or an MIT entrepreneur.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.560
One of the problems that we
face right now is the unknown.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.880
We don't know what
CDOs and CDSes and all

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.950
these complex
securities are worth.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.190
Wouldn't it be wonderful to
have a website that did nothing

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.960
more than post the
prices of transactions

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.470
in these securities
over a period of time,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.840
really as a means of
providing information

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.500
to the marketplace about what
kinds of deals are being done

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.360
and at what prices?

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.160
We don't have an
organized exchange.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.110
So that's another
idea is to create

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.510
a kind of an eBay for CDOs.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.340
It may not work.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.210
It may be naive.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.340
It may be something that
somebody has already

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.060
thought of.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.040
But these are the
kind of innovations

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.720
that the market is crying for.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.550
And I promise you, if
you are the first one

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.280
to the market with one
of these innovations,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.860
my guess is that that's going
to be a billion dollar idea,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.410
because everybody
right now is looking

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.980
for some means of getting
transparency and liquidity

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.820
into these marketplaces.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.600
And so if you could be the
first, or second or third

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.240
even, to come up with
that mechanism for being

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.150
able to provide pricing
information just

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.490
a little bit better
than nothing at all,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.042
you can actually
do incredibly well.

00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.750
That's an example--
very simple example--

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.260
of how technology can actually
transform that market,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.640
because most of
that market right

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.950
now is still paper and pencil.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.460
It's just really
relatively backward,

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.240
from a technological
perspective.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.740
OK.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.824
Yeah?

00:06:13.824 --> 00:06:16.184
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
transparency, why do you

00:06:16.184 --> 00:06:19.834
think the banks push to get rid
of mark-to-market accounting?

00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:21.750
ANDREW LO: Well, I'm
glad you brought that up.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.708
We're going to talk about
that in this lecture.

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:25.040
That's a very important point.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.074
First of all, I want to
define mark to market.

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:28.490
And we're going
to talk about that

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.949
and the difference between
forward and futures contract.

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:32.490
But let me give you
the short answer.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.390
And then I'm going to spend the
rest of this lecture hopefully

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.370
justifying it.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.830
The idea that some
banks have proposed

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.200
to suspend
mark-to-market accounting

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.040
is probably the
worst idea I've ever

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.515
heard of in this entire crisis.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.390
Now let me not mince
words and explain what--

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.660
the idea of not
marking to market

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.150
is a little bit like telling
a crowded theater, where

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.840
you smell smoke and you
see flames on the stage--

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.090
instead of letting people
get out of that theater,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.802
it's like telling everybody
in the theater, all right,

00:07:18.802 --> 00:07:21.010
we're not really sure exactly
what the smoke is from,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.530
but we want everybody
to sit down, relax,

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.590
take a deep breath, and let us
think about it for another half

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.590
an hour, and then we'll decide.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.983
That's what suspending
mark-to-market will do.

00:07:31.983 --> 00:07:34.730
AUDIENCE: So do you think
when the SEC has come out

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.813
and said that companies
now can use their judgment

00:07:36.813 --> 00:07:40.516
to [INAUDIBLE]
sale prices, do you

00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:42.520
think that's going to
happen [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.520
ANDREW LO: Well, it's a
little too soon to tell,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.480
because we don't know exactly
what the treasury will do.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.240
The SEC can say
whatever they want.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.980
The bottom line is,
is there a market

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.580
for these securities at prices
that these companies come up

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.480
with?

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.890
I may think that my ideas are
the most valuable in the world.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.510
That doesn't make it so.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.902
And in the same
way, corporations

00:08:01.902 --> 00:08:04.110
that feel that their securities
are the most valuable

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.390
in the world, that
doesn't make it so.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.830
What makes it so is what we said
on the very first day of class.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.610
And that is, what?

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.190
What determines the
value of security?

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:14.820
Exactly.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.660
You all-- the market.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.550
And so if nobody wants to
buy or sell at any price,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.640
then that's not really a price.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.370
A price is a number at which
two mutually consenting adults

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.924
agree to transact.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.090
And if you can't find two
mutually consenting adults

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.631
to agree to transact,
you can come up

00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:33.690
with all sorts of really
interesting numbers,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.549
but those aren't prices.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.400
So we're going to talk about
that exactly in this lecture,

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.460
because what I want to do
is to describe to you how

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.400
forward contracts and
futures contracts work.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.961
You've heard of
both terms, I think.

00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:48.960
We've talked explicitly
about forward contracts,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.640
but we haven't
talked about futures.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.400
The innovation of
futures contracts

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.450
is exactly this
mark-to-market issue.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.810
So let's get to
the topic for today

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.990
and talk about
forward and futures.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.240
So in this lecture,
what I'm going to cover

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.540
is the definition of forward
and futures contracts.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.290
And then I want to
show how to value them.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.760
The valuations of
these contracts

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.210
will also use net
present value formulas,

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.490
but it'll be used in a
somewhat different way.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.937
So that's why we want to
spend extra time going over

00:09:16.937 --> 00:09:18.020
these kinds of securities.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.510
They're different from what
we've looked at so far.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.250
There's some
motivation from why you

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.800
might want to consider these
contracts that I've got up here

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.760
in the slide.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.860
But really, the motivation
is pretty simple.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.080
And actually, the
motivation is brought home

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.870
by current events because
of the uncertainty

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.120
in markets right now.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.690
The first example-- your
company, based in the US,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.320
supplies machine
tools to customers

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.940
in Germany and Brazil.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.250
Prices are quoted in
each country's currency,

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.850
so fluctuations in the euro,
dollar, and the Real dollar

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.640
exchange rates have a big
impact on the firm's revenue.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.700
How can the firm reduce
or hedge these risks?

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.580
This is an example where
you're making machine tools.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.209
You have no idea what exchange
rate markets are going to do.

00:10:03.209 --> 00:10:04.500
And that's not really your job.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.360
You don't really
care about that.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.830
But the fact is
that it does have

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.930
an impact on your
company's performance,

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.240
because a large part
of your revenues

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.540
are going to be coming in
in these foreign currencies.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.780
So what you'd like to
do is to figure out

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.720
a way to eliminate that
kind of uncertainty,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.765
or at least reduce it.

00:10:23.765 --> 00:10:25.140
And there are many
other examples

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.640
here where an individual has a
particular objective in mind,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.990
and market fluctuations are
so extreme that they end up

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.720
being a distraction and,
in some cases, a decrement

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.970
to the business opportunity.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.860
The idea behind a
forward contract

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.350
is to try to reduce
or, in some cases,

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.690
eliminate that
kind of fluctuation

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.530
by finding a counterparty
that's willing to deal

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.480
with you to eliminate
that uncertainty,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.750
because that counterparty
faces the opposite uncertainty.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:03.180
So this is an example of just
how big the uncertainty is

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.560
that we're talking about.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.030
If you take a look at exchange
rates from 1995 to 2003,

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.780
you can take a look at the
dynamics of these currency

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.410
movements.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.690
They are extreme in some cases.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.570
So if you're a company
manufacturing machine parts,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.670
you have no idea how
to deal with this.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.730
You're not a currency
forecasting firm.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.250
And so what you'd
like to be able to do

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.650
is just get rid of it,
or at least reduce it

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.330
to the point where you actually
don't have to think about it.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:42.180
And to give you a sense of how
significant this problem is,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.429
this is the sales for
Caterpillar from 1980 to 1989.

00:11:47.429 --> 00:11:49.470
And most of you have heard
of Caterpillar, right?

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.460
They manufacture tractors and
other kind of heavy machinery.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.730
This is their sales figures.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.440
But you can take a
look at what happens

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.110
when you take their sales
figure and you denominate it

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.730
in US dollars.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.090
That's a pretty big difference
between US denominated

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.180
and foreign currency
denominated levels.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.640
So what we want to do is
to address that concern

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.690
by using financial markets
in a particular way.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.270
Now there is an issue regarding
futures and forwards as to

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.270
whether or not the people
who are in the markets

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.827
are hedging or speculating.

00:12:26.827 --> 00:12:29.160
And so we're going to talk a
bit about that a little bit

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.410
later on.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.380
But before we do that, we need
to develop some terminology

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.000
for what these contracts are.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.890
But I want to raise that
as an issue upfront,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.760
because it's very controversial.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.520
There are some people
that argue that it's

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.480
all these evil speculators that
are causing market dislocation

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.520
and we ought to just
get rid of them.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.510
And I'm going to
argue that you really

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.120
can't, because
speculators provide

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.550
an enormously valuable service.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.860
They are the opposite
side of the same coin.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.350
So it's like trying to do
applause with only one hand.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.930
The sound of one hand clapping
is not particularly loud.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.200
So there are a number
of ways of hedging.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.540
Obviously, using futures,
forwards, options, and swaps

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.210
are what we're going to be
focusing on in these next three

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.530
lectures.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.340
But you can also think about
insurance, diversification,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.470
you can match assets
and liabilities

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.380
in terms of their
duration, or you

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.470
can match sales and
expenses across countries

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.030
to try to reduce
your currency risk.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.080
And frankly, that's one of the
reasons why companies often set

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.590
up production facilities
in countries where they

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.410
do a lot of business, because
this is a natural hedge,

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.230
in the sense that they're
generating expenses, as well as

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.100
revenues in the same currency.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.250
And so that cancels itself out.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.850
But you can't always
easily do that.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.590
And you certainly
can't do that quickly.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.020
And if you're a foreign company
trying to do business today,

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.901
life is very, very
interesting, shall we say.

00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:02.400
So you want to be
able to hedge now.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.650
You don't want to
wait a year or two

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.984
when you are building that
plant to be able to do that.

00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:11.400
Now what we're
going to talk about

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.050
is whether or not it's possible
to hedge with derivatives.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.870
But there are various
different views

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:24.210
on the impact of derivatives
for non-financial firms.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.300
One extreme is that derivatives
are extremely efficient tools

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.430
for risk management.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.570
And the other, espoused by
none other than Warren Buffett,

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.390
is that derivatives
are financial weapons

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.250
of mass destruction.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:43.500
And the truth is actually both.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.670
Both of these statements,
I think, are correct.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:53.070
So from uranium-238, you can
get a nuclear power plant

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.620
that can provide power for
huge areas of the country

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.320
and that do today.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.760
Or from uranium-238, you can
build a dirty thermonuclear

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.610
bomb that can be very bad.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.880
So the point is that
technology, in and of itself,

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.030
has no particular good
or bad properties.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.410
It's how you use it.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.260
And so derivatives are
definitely more complicated

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.940
and more sophisticated.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.890
This is not the kind of thing
you want to try at home,

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.070
unless you are a
professional in how you

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.854
use these kind of instruments.

00:15:24.854 --> 00:15:27.270
And so that's one of the reasons
why we want to spend time

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.870
on these particular securities.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:31.434
OK.

00:15:31.434 --> 00:15:32.850
There are a couple
of other views,

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.780
too, regarding whether or not
hedging should be done at all.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.100
One view, which we'll
talk about in more detail

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.690
towards the latter
part of the course

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.210
when we get into corporate
financing decisions,

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.950
is that hedging for a
company should be irrelevant.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.880
If you're running a company,
even if your company's assets

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.780
are in foreign denominated
currencies and changes

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.280
in those currencies cause huge
swings in your company value,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.900
there is an argument to be
said that you shouldn't bother

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.460
hedging, because as long as
shareholders of your company

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.780
have free access to the
market, they can hedge.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.170
So anything you can
do, they can do.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.680
At least, that's the argument.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.680
Now the counterargument
is that that's not true,

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.180
because most people
who buy shares,

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.070
they don't know enough about
what the company is doing

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.444
to be able to
hedge, nor are they

00:16:25.444 --> 00:16:29.150
set up to trade in some of
these kinds of hedging vehicles.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.150
But the frictionless
model would say

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.950
that you shouldn't
bother hedging,

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.570
because what investors
want you to do

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.550
is to focus on your business.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.730
And hedging is just
something that, if they

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.680
are concerned about,
they can do on their own.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.860
The alternative view is that
hedging creates a lot of value,

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.030
because it reduces uncertainty
for a company's cash flows.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.450
It focuses the company
on its core competencies,

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.240
as opposed to other factors
in the marketplace that

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.490
are causing volatility.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.470
It also reduces the
chances of getting

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.090
into financial distress.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.640
And if we believe that
financial distress creates

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.750
these huge costs that can't
be easily recoverable, even

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.380
through the bankruptcy process,
then you ought to hedge.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.670
Now there are lots of examples
of all of these perspectives

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:16.569
in the industry.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.920
I'll give you three of them.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.160
Homestake Mining is
a mining company that

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.950
mines precious and base metals.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.690
They have an explicit
corporate policy

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.930
that says, we do not
hedge, because shareholders

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.110
will achieve maximum benefit
from such a policy of not

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.370
hedging.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.660
OK.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.456
Sorry, yeah.

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:38.580
AUDIENCE: Is there a
difference in hedging strategy

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.923
when it's an input production
versus production output?

00:17:42.923 --> 00:17:46.220
For example, an oil company
hedging gasoline exposure

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.075
versus [INAUDIBLE] company
hedging gas [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:49.075 --> 00:17:51.200
ANDREW LO: Well, there is
a difference in the sense

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.950
that typically when you're
producing an output,

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.570
there's no point
in hedging that,

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.945
because that's actually the
output that you're producing.

00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.050
You're a gold company.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.100
You're producing gold.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.320
The only question about
hedging is whether or not

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.780
you feel that there's some
temporary mispricing that you

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.000
want to be able to take
advantage of, given where

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
markets are today versus
where you think they'll

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.330
be three months from now.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.469
But effectively, the
output is what you're

00:18:13.469 --> 00:18:14.510
supposed to be producing.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.060
So their argument is that
we're producing gold,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.910
why would you want us to
hedge the price of gold?

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.790
We're a gold company,
so you're supposed

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.817
to be getting the risk of
gold with a gold company.

00:18:26.817 --> 00:18:29.150
So it's typically the inputs
that they're talking about.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.270
But on occasion, they may be
talking about outputs as well.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.270
And the argument here is that
you shouldn't be hedging that.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.610
Now the American Barrick
has another view.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.650
Their view is that hedges--

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.990
they want to provide
financial stability.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.070
And so by hedging
their output exposure,

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.130
they're actually providing that
stability, because right now,

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.670
for example, gold prices
are extremely volatile,

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.734
because there's a
flight to quality,

00:18:54.734 --> 00:18:56.150
and then people
change their mind,

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.460
or another group
decides to sell.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.350
And so the prices are
moving back and forth

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.640
and back and forth.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.310
That output uncertainty
creates volatility in earnings.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.980
And we all know
that shareholders

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.360
like stability in earnings.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.520
So that's another view.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.260
Now the first company,
Homestake Mining,

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.280
would say, look, if you
don't like the heat,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.860
get out of the kitchen.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.952
We're a gold company.

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:21.660
If you don't want the
volatility of gold,

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.450
then don't buy a gold company.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.310
Put your money in T-bills.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.750
And so that's another view.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.890
And then, of course, we've
got Battle Mountain Gold,

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.670
which is a company
that hedges up to 25%.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.820
So their argument is
that a recent study

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.439
indicates that there may
be a premium for hedging.

00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:42.230
But they're not quite
sure, so they're just

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.063
going to go partway.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:51.410
It's not clear what the answer
is, because largely, the issues

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.380
depend upon how the
public will react

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.060
to this kind of uncertainty.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.160
There are some
people that are quite

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.920
rational about their
exposures, and they want

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.357
to have the volatility of gold.

00:20:02.357 --> 00:20:04.190
But they don't put all
their assets in gold,

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.810
because they
understand that there's

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.101
a limit to how much volatility
they're willing to bear.

00:20:08.101 --> 00:20:12.620
So maybe 5% of their portfolio
is in precious metals, 10% base

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.020
metals, so on and so forth.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.730
They do the asset allocation.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.500
But there are other
perspectives that

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.020
say, you've got to worry
about volatility of earnings,

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.120
you want to have a
stable share price.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.600
And then they engage in
that activity as well.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.850
There's some empirical
evidence that I thought

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.830
you might be interested in.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:38.592
A couple of academics,
Guay and Kothari--

00:20:38.592 --> 00:20:41.050
SP Kothari is a faculty member
here in our accounting group

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:42.920
who's on leave--

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.860
published a paper just
about five years ago

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.060
where they took a random
sample of 413 large companies

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.110
with average cash flows
of about $700 million.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:21:01.470
And 57% of those firms
used derivatives in 1997.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.120
Now that's 11 years ago.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.510
So this is dated information.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.060
If you went and re-did
the survey today,

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.820
my guess is that
that number, 57%,

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.190
will have gone up
by quite a bit.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.400
But I don't know for
a fact that it has.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.942
But the idea behind
the survey was just

00:21:18.942 --> 00:21:20.900
to get a sense of how
many companies really are

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.760
making use of hedging programs.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.410
And it's become much, much
more significant than before.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.920
Part of the reason that
it's not 100%, I suspect,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.030
is that it's not that easy to
implement some of these hedges,

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.420
because the concepts
are rather subtle.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.960
You'll see, when we go over
it in this lecture, how

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.160
straightforward you
think it is to hedge.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.000
Some of the ideas
are a little subtle.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.230
And so it's not a simple
asset class purchase decision,

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:55.490
like I'm going to buy bonds,
I'm going to sell stocks.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.145
It requires a certain level
of expertise and comfort.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.360
So let's talk about that now.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.841
Let's talk about derivatives.

00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:06.840
There are going to be
three kinds of derivatives

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.054
we're going to focus on.

00:22:09.054 --> 00:22:10.470
Forwards and
futures-- that's what

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.490
we're going to talk about in
this lecture and the next.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.490
Then in lecture 10, we're
going to talk about options.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:20.130
And then there's a third class,
which we probably won't get to

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.310
in this course, but you will
get to in 402, as well as

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.540
in investments.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.770
And that is swaps.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.680
The idea behind a forward
and futures contract

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.080
is that it's a contract
to exchange something

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.390
in the future.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:44.110
So today, we agree on engaging
in a specific transaction

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.100
sometime in the future.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.670
And the difference between a
forward contract and a futures

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.349
contract really has to do
just with the issue that

00:22:54.349 --> 00:22:55.890
was raised the
beginning of the class

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.267
by [INAUDIBLE], which
is mark-to-market.

00:22:58.267 --> 00:23:00.100
But let's not worry
about that for a moment.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.700
Let's just focus on
the contract itself.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.730
So a forward or futures contract
is, as the name suggests,

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.620
an agreement that we enter
into today-- you and I--

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:16.920
to engage in a transaction,
say, six months from now.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:22.490
So all we do today is agree
to do that transaction.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.450
And in agreeing to
do that transaction,

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.280
we have to specify
a couple of things.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.140
One is we have to specify
what we're going to transact

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.854
and at what price.

00:23:31.854 --> 00:23:33.520
And the second thing
we have to agree on

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.800
is when we're going
to do the transaction.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.110
Once we sign the
document, we are both

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.850
obligated to follow through.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.830
So this is not an
option in the sense

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.850
that we can choose not
to do it or to do it.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.310
Once we sign the
forward contract today,

00:23:54.310 --> 00:24:00.220
it is a legal, binding contract
so that we are agreeing today

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.630
to engage in that transaction
six months from now.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.930
Now if it ends up
that we default--

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.800
we don't have enough money,
we declare bankruptcy--

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.740
then that contract, like
all other contracts,

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.180
will have to go to court and be
dealt with by the legal system.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.790
But assuming that we
are not in default,

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.300
we will have to perform-- we
are obligated to perform--

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.340
on that contract,
like any other.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.660
It's a binding agreement.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.410
With an option, on
the other hand--

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.784
we're going to get to this in
more detail in lecture 10--

00:24:29.784 --> 00:24:32.080
with an option, we do not
have to follow through

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.710
with the transaction.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.820
In other words, the
buyer of the contract

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:41.060
has the right but
not the obligation

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.520
to exercise that option.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.860
That's why it's
called an option.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.690
So that's a key distinction.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.510
So let me be very
explicit now and now focus

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.500
on a forward contract.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.570
A forward contract
is a commitment

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.330
to purchase, at a
future date, a given

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.740
amount of a
commodity or an asset

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.270
at a price agreed upon today.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.230
So first thing we
do, draw a timeline.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.950
Today is date zero.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.740
That's when we enter
into the agreement.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.120
And to be clear, because
a forward contract always

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.380
has two parties--

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.970
a buyer and a seller--

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.100
let's just use,
as the convention,

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.790
that the buyer of
the forward contract

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:27.860
is the party that has agreed to
buy whatever in a future date.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:34.550
So the price that we agree
to is fixed, as of today.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.670
And that's known as
the forward price.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.240
If the particular commodity
that we're talking about

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.580
happens to be alone, then it
will be a forward borrowing

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.310
rate that we agree to today.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.461
So it's either a
rate or a price.

00:25:51.461 --> 00:25:53.210
And it's typically
called the forward rate

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.160
or the forward price.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.170
And the buyer of
the commodity is

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.560
said to be long the
forward contract.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.900
And the other counterparty--
the counterparty that

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.510
is selling the
asset-- is said to be

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.380
short the forward contract.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.662
Now these terms are, in
some sense, arbitrary.

00:26:11.662 --> 00:26:14.120
But there is a logic to them
that I'll explain in a minute.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.734
Yeah, question?

00:26:15.734 --> 00:26:23.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
forward contract?

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.160
ANDREW LO: A revolving loan.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.410
Well, I would call
a revolving loan

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.280
a sequence of forward
contracts, because it revolves

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.749
and constantly updates.

00:26:32.749 --> 00:26:33.290
That's right.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:34.780
Yeah.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.860
So for the moment,
let's just focus on one,

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.890
and then we'll talk about
how we can extend that.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.270
So this is a very,
very standard set-up.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.690
And in terms of
long versus short,

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.960
there's a reason why we
use that terminology.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.170
Obviously, the
ambiguity is the fact

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:58.280
that a forward contract
actually has no value on the day

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.480
that it's struck.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.630
So to say that one side is long
and the other side of short

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.360
is, in a way, a little bit
unnatural, because in fact,

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.540
the value of the contract
that's struck is zero.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.560
So you're either long
zero or short zero.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.630
Well, who cares?

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.080
But there's a reason why
we call the buyer long

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.100
and the reason we call the
seller of the asset short.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.290
It's because tomorrow,
if the value of the asset

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:30.120
goes up beyond where the current
price is, then the person who

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.090
has agreed to buy the
asset at this price

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.920
is going to make money.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.690
So when the price goes up--

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.720
when the spot price,
the price today and then

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.570
the price tomorrow spot
price-- when that goes up,

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.200
the person who was holding
it long will profit.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.170
And the person who
is short will lose.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.460
And so that makes sense.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.440
When prices go
up, long positions

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.020
tend to be profitable,
and short positions

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.340
tend to be unprofitable.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.325
That's why we use
the normalization.

00:27:58.325 --> 00:27:59.700
Now right then
and there, I think

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.283
I've described
something that may have

00:28:01.283 --> 00:28:02.580
slipped by you a little bit.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:07.110
So I want to just beat this
down and make sure that we all

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.430
understand it completely.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.190
The price that I'm talking
about going up or down

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.600
is not the forward price.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.920
It's the futures price.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.440
Excuse me, it's the
future spot price.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.070
Today's spot price for oil
is, let's say, $100 a barrel.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.800
Suppose that we enter into an
agreement six months from now

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.690
to purchase oil
at $110 a barrel.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.930
So the forward price of
that contract is 110.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.560
Today's spot price is 100.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.400
When we have agreed to
that contract, you and I,

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.330
the value of that
agreement is worth zero.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:47.800
It's got to be worth zero.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.010
The reason is that if it's
not at all worth zero,

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.930
then you and I
aren't going to be

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.760
willing to enter into
that contract today,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.280
because that means either I'm
losing and you're winning,

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.750
or you're losing
and I'm winning.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.520
So we won't strike that deal.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.420
Let me give you an example.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:08.140
Suppose that I propose
to buy oil from you

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.730
six months from now
at $40 a barrel.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.340
Now that's a legitimate
contract, right?

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.200
In other words, I
can propose that.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.300
And if you and I,
we agree to that,

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.930
that transaction
will be carried out.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.730
How many people would
agree to that today?

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.490
Nobody.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.910
You would?

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:29.610
All right.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:30.920
Seriously?

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.106
No.

00:29:32.106 --> 00:29:33.600
AUDIENCE: You're buying?

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.020
ANDREW LO: I'm buying
at $40 a barrel.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.690
No.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.900
Because given that oil is at
100 and given that there's

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:45.030
nothing in the news or in
any kind of projection that

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.690
suggests that we're going
to find tremendously large,

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:51.604
untapped oil reserves
or that somehow oil

00:29:51.604 --> 00:29:53.520
is going to become less
relevant in six months

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.240
time, being able to
buy oil at $40 a barrel

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.970
six months from now is
an incredibly good deal.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.800
If I can find a
deal like that, it's

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.030
got to have a lot of net
present value to me today.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.610
If I can find a
piece of paper that

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.070
allows me to buy oil six months
from now at $40 a barrel,

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:15.460
that piece of paper, we all
agree, has positive NPV.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.470
So in order for you to agree
to sell me that piece of paper,

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.760
you're basically
giving me money.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.020
You're not going to do that.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.359
So we're not going to
get that deal done today.

00:30:26.359 --> 00:30:28.900
On the other hand, suppose that
we have a piece of paper that

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.730
says, I will buy oil at $250
a barrel six months from now.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.460
I suspect all of you would
be delighted to sell me

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.464
that forward contract.

00:30:38.464 --> 00:30:40.630
I'm not going to do that,
because that's ridiculous.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.127
That price just makes no sense.

00:30:42.127 --> 00:30:44.210
And that means you're going
to get a lot of value.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.990
So if both you and
I agree that we want

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.840
to do a deal regarding oil--

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.690
you're an oil producer,
I'm an oil user,

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:57.730
I want to lock in some price
for oil six months from now--

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.520
we're going to haggle
until such time

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.360
as we reach a price for that
transaction six months from now

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.930
that seems fair to
both you and me.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:08.990
When we do that--

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:12.880
when we reach that
price-- $110, let's say--

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.200
that's a price where the
present value of that contract

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.060
is worth nothing.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.900
So both you and I have
found a price, such

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.930
that we're happy to
take it or leave it.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:30.040
If we made it 115, then I might
not be so willing to do it.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.480
You might be happy about that.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.630
If we made it 105,
I'm happy to do that,

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.760
but you think that you're
not getting a good deal.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.490
So the way that a forward
price is established

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.510
is like any other price.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.550
We put it up for auction.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:46.690
We set a system where supply and
demand determines that price.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.638
And when that price is struck,
the contract is worth nothing.

00:31:51.638 --> 00:31:52.610
Question?

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.068
AUDIENCE: Could
you argue that it's

00:31:54.068 --> 00:31:56.498
based on the price
of a futures contract

00:31:56.498 --> 00:31:59.900
and not of the
market [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.302
Let's say they're in the
range [INAUDIBLE] $130

00:32:03.302 --> 00:32:06.056
and we enter into
[INAUDIBLE], wouldn't that

00:32:06.056 --> 00:32:07.710
create a little bit
of a problem there?

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.430
ANDREW LO: Yeah, it would.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.050
Let's not talk about that
yet, because we haven't talked

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.670
about futures prices yet.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.950
So we're only talking about
forward prices right now.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.600
We're going to come
back to future prices,

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.224
and arbitrage is
going to come into it.

00:32:17.224 --> 00:32:18.656
But I want to do
it step by step.

00:32:18.656 --> 00:32:20.280
So let's hold off on
that for a minute.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:20.780
Yeah?

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.612
AUDIENCE: So when there's like
a natural gas company that sells

00:32:23.612 --> 00:32:25.040
[INAUDIBLE] for
next year, that's

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.359
forward contract [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:26.359 --> 00:32:27.150
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.260
That's right.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.990
And companies are delighted
to do that, because this way,

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.270
they know what their
costs are going to be,

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.910
as opposed to who
knows, it depends

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.760
on what happens with
this rescue package,

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.510
or it depends on whether
or not we get hit

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:41.340
with a terrorist attack or not.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.230
That creates so
much uncertainty,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.980
companies don't want
to deal with that.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.400
So if I use oil in my
production facilities

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.330
and I can lock in at 110
for a six month period,

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.230
that's OK with me.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:53.880
I'm willing to do that.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.405
Yeah?

00:32:55.405 --> 00:32:57.780
AUDIENCE: Considering that
the trend of the global market

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.790
is upwards in the long term,
I suspect that it makes sense,

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:06.050
especially to try to
short in the short term,

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.850
that would be there--

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.600
exceptions when I want to try
and do it in the long term

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.507
as well?

00:33:11.507 --> 00:33:13.840
ANDREW LO: Well, that's a
very tough question to answer,

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.298
because it depends upon what
your forecast is for long term

00:33:16.298 --> 00:33:17.100
prices.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.140
And the longer the term
is for your forecast,

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.215
the more inaccurate
your estimate goes.

00:33:21.215 --> 00:33:22.590
So the question
is whether or not

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:23.700
you really want
to take that risk

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.825
and make those projections.

00:33:24.825 --> 00:33:27.090
In fact, this is one of
the reasons why companies

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.640
don't want to do that and
they'd rather lock in the price.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.940
Companies feel like they're not
in the business of forecasting

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.956
prices in the long term.

00:33:34.956 --> 00:33:36.330
They're producing
oil, or they're

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.280
using oil as an input to
their production process.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.790
So they basically just want
to eliminate that uncertainty

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.260
if they can get a
reasonable price.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.810
And by reasonable-- I
just gave you an example--

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:48.930
a $10 premium over
a six month period

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.170
where we have uncertainty
about both supply and demand

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.594
may be reasonable to
certain corporations.

00:33:55.594 --> 00:33:57.085
Yeah?

00:33:57.085 --> 00:34:00.067
AUDIENCE: Is there a
limit on how much can

00:34:00.067 --> 00:34:03.049
be done in a forward contract?

00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:06.266
And the example I sort of have
in mind is over the past few

00:34:06.266 --> 00:34:08.516
years, we keep reading how
Southwest has hedged on its

00:34:08.516 --> 00:34:10.842
fuel, but the other
airlines haven't.

00:34:10.842 --> 00:34:13.818
So was there some sort of
financial or legal perspective

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:16.300
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.800
ANDREW LO: Certainly
not anything

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.925
from a legal perspective.

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:22.300
For a financial
perspective, that

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.830
depends upon the
particular company

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.860
and the shareholders and
the balance sheet and so on.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.659
But no, there's
no limit, as long

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.987
as you can find a mutually
consenting adult that's

00:34:30.987 --> 00:34:32.320
willing to do the deal with you.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.030
That's it.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.530
All right.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.021
Yeah?

00:34:34.021 --> 00:34:35.395
AUDIENCE: Does it
have to be more

00:34:35.395 --> 00:34:36.814
expensive than
the current price?

00:34:36.814 --> 00:34:39.230
ANDREW LO: Well, no, it doesn't
have to be more expensive.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.050
So the question is, does
the forward price always

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:42.675
have to be more than
the current price?

00:34:42.675 --> 00:34:44.420
No, it doesn't.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.880
It depends upon what the
expectation is for what's

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.380
going to happen in the future.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.550
It turns out with oil, typically
it goes the other way--

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:56.010
that these oil prices
generally are rising over time.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.870
However, there are situations.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.340
For example, it may be that
within the next few weeks,

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.470
if there is more
of an expectation

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.380
that business will
slow down worldwide,

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.740
then we would expect oil
prices to decline over time,

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.350
because the demand
is going to decline.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.960
If that's the case, then
oil producing companies

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.390
may be delighted to
do a deal at par.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.850
So if the current price
of oil is $100 a barrel,

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.384
they may be delighted to
say, OK, six months from now,

00:35:22.384 --> 00:35:24.050
I think the economy
is going to go down,

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.660
I'm willing to sell you oil
at $100 a barrel six months

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.640
from now, let's lock it in.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.090
That's possible.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.120
So what does that tell
you about the price

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.090
of oil today versus the
price of oil six months,

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.950
in terms of the forward prices?

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.880
That tells you that the market
is providing information

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.630
about the future.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.080
So future price
forecasts are implicit

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.130
in these forward prices.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.880
In just the same way that when
we look at the yield curve

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.710
and we see the implicit forward
rates for future borrowing,

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.920
when you look at forward
prices of commodities

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.990
and other instruments,
that's giving you

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.020
information about what
the market is telling you

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.090
that it thinks will happen
six months from now.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.710
So if you see forward
prices for oil at $90,

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.470
whereas today it's at
100, that's telling you

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:16.110
either people are expecting
to find lots of oil

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.570
in the next six months,
or it's telling you

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.880
that there's a
forecast that demand

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.650
will decline precipitously
over the next six months.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.590
OK.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:30.550
So the features of forward
contracts are the following.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.990
They're customized.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.470
So we have to enter into
this contract counterparty

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:36.190
by counterparty.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.100
In other words, this
is not a share of IBM

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.235
that anybody can buy
and sell and is the same

00:36:41.235 --> 00:36:43.360
whether you trade it in
the New York Stock Exchange

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.660
or in London or anywhere else.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.430
A forward contract is
a customized agreement

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.950
between two parties.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:54.910
The second feature is that
it's typically nonstandard,

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:59.240
so we can do as much of it or
as little of it as we want.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.260
And also, it doesn't
trade on exchanges.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.560
These are known as
over-the-counter securities.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.600
It doesn't trade on
an organized exchange.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.010
Two people trade with
each other over a counter.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:14.280
That's the customization part.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:14.883
Yeah?

00:37:14.883 --> 00:37:16.591
AUDIENCE: You said
that there's sometimes

00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:20.306
a circular effect on prices
on certain commodities.

00:37:20.306 --> 00:37:22.771
For example, if I
think that copper

00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:25.564
is going to be more expensive
six months from now,

00:37:25.564 --> 00:37:27.824
then I'm going to buy
more copper today, which

00:37:27.824 --> 00:37:30.112
is going to drive
up the price, then

00:37:30.112 --> 00:37:32.179
it's going to make it
lower in the future?

00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:33.720
ANDREW LO: If you
drive up the price,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.774
why would you make it
lower in the future?

00:37:36.774 --> 00:37:38.238
AUDIENCE: Because
my demand for it

00:37:38.238 --> 00:37:43.120
would be substituted now
instead of six months from now.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.440
ANDREW LO: Well, it's not clear
that it would make the price

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.240
lower, because if
you're doing it,

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.740
that may indicate
that there's going

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.840
to be a shortage,
because you're trying

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.500
to get ahead of that curve.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.200
And therefore, the
price may stay that way.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.860
So I'm not sure I
understand your question.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.870
Are you worried about
price manipulation,

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.880
or are you worried
about the fact

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.770
that the futures prices
or forward prices

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:09.280
don't reflect current supply
and demand conditions?

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.610
AUDIENCE: I'm just trying
to think that if I expect

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:16.040
a certain price to
go up in the future,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.040
rather than hedging against--

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.040
the inflammation
that's in that price

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.574
is based on the
inflammation of the price

00:38:24.574 --> 00:38:27.552
right now, so I'm going to
substitute my demand for--

00:38:27.552 --> 00:38:29.010
ANDREW LO: OK, I
see what you mean.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.850
So let me rephrase the question.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.300
Your question is, if you think
the prices are going to go up

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.430
for a particular
input-- say, copper--

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.190
then rather than
buy it six months

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.020
from now at the
potentially higher price,

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:45.450
you might decide to do it
sooner by buying it now.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:46.440
Right.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.500
That's a perfectly sensible
thing to do with one exception.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:55.240
And that is that when you buy
it now, you have to store it.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.970
And copper, oil, other
kinds of factor inputs

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.470
are typically not
the kind of things

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.380
that are costless to store.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.880
So you can either do that, buy
it now, store it, and then use

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.240
it later, or you could do
a financial transaction

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.310
that will have the same effect.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:20.110
And so that idea is going
to be exactly how we

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.514
price these things.

00:39:21.514 --> 00:39:22.930
So I'm going to
come back to that.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.471
Hold onto that
thought, because we're

00:39:24.471 --> 00:39:26.800
going to use that
approach to figure out how

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.100
to price a forward contract.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.641
So far, I haven't told you how
the forward price comes about.

00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:32.800
All I've said is, the
market determines it.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.750
Like before, we're going
to want to work out

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.200
the logic for what the market
is doing when it figures out

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.100
what that price is.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.710
And it will actually be
exactly the calculation

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.780
that you just proposed.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.230
So in other words, either we
transact in the forward market,

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.900
or we do it directly
in the spot market.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.500
Those are our two choices.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.230
And in the end,
it's going to have

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.540
to be the case that
those two choices, which

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.910
lead to the same
cash flows, they

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.180
have to have the same price.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.982
And that's how we're going
to get the forward price.

00:40:00.982 --> 00:40:01.364
Yeah?

00:40:01.364 --> 00:40:02.560
AUDIENCE: Do you have
to have cash on hand now

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.167
to enter into a
forward contract?

00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:04.750
ANDREW LO: No.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.458
AUDIENCE: So that
could be another reason

00:40:06.458 --> 00:40:08.150
why, if you're an
airline, for example,

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.820
you wouldn't want
to buy millions

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.760
and millions of dollars worth of
gas if you can't afford it now?

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.120
But if you can't
afford it now, you're

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.810
really talking more about a
short term kind of a borrowing

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.270
situation, because
presumably, you're

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.020
going to have to pay
for it at some point,

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.390
particularly when you use it.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.610
But you're right that if
you don't have the cash now,

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.340
then one way you can do it is
enter into a forward contract

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.510
when you know you'll
have the cash later.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.946
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:33.445
Because American
Airlines, I'm sure,

00:40:33.445 --> 00:40:36.520
couldn't afford to buy five
years' worth of fuel today,

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.442
because they just don't have
enough assets to do that.

00:40:39.442 --> 00:40:40.150
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.630
So you can't buy
that-- not only that,

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.900
where are you going to put it?

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.020
Five years' worth of
oil is a lot of oil.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.990
And it's very, very expensive.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.930
So your consideration
is absolutely right.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.980
The borrowing cost, or the
opportunity cost of capital,

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.790
is also part of the equation.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.730
So if we think about
all the ingredients

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.340
that have to go into
determining the forward price,

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.750
one is the cost of storage.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:08.300
The other is the borrowing cost
implicit in that-- the cash--

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.740
because a forward contract
requires no money down.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.080
So this is one of these
true financial deals

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.460
with no money down.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.040
The problem is that it's
not always a short profit.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.870
Yeah?

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.165
AUDIENCE: You may also not
have the product to sell.

00:41:22.165 --> 00:41:25.890
For example, in the
case of soybean or food,

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.690
you may enter into
a six month forward

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.750
and I still did not
harvest a product.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:31.750
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.160
So you may want to wait
for the uncertainty

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.590
to resolve and get a better
sense of what your needs are.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.220
Yup?

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.053
AUDIENCE: So if between
the buyer and seller

00:41:38.053 --> 00:41:40.750
they have a different or
asymmetric information,

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.500
is it possible that the
overall forward contract

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.650
has positive NVP?

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.650
ANDREW LO: Well, let me
put it to you this way--

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:53.020
the forward contract may
have an expected value

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.770
for one party or the other
based upon what they know.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.380
But in principle, the NPV--

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.140
that's an objective
NPV-- has to be zero,

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.020
because if it's not
zero, then one party can

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.860
take that contract and basically
sell it to a third party

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.080
and make money off of it.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:11.800
See what I mean?

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.570
In other words,
your question is,

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:16.270
if two parties have
different information,

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:18.830
is it possible that the
contract has different value?

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:21.380
Well, certainly they have
different value to each party.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:25.690
In other words, if I'm willing
to buy oil forward contracts

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:29.320
from you, I must think
either that oil prices

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.490
are going to go way up--

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.652
that's my view-- or
I just need the oil,

00:42:32.652 --> 00:42:34.360
and I want to get rid
of the uncertainty.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.000
But both of those are possible.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.370
If you're selling me this
oil forward contract,

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:42.370
the two possible reasons
you might want to do it

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.200
is because you've
got a lot of oil

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.720
and you want to lock
in a price for selling

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.550
that oil six months from now--

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.070
that's one possibility--
or you have

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.070
some asymmetric information--
some private information--

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:57.160
that oil prices are
going to go down.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.060
So both of those
interpretations are legitimate.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.390
But the statement that I made
that the price of that contract

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.840
has to be zero, that's a
statement not about your views

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.310
or my views or her views.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:12.970
It's a statement about the
market price of that contract

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:16.247
if we were to auction it off
to people in the marketplace.

00:43:16.247 --> 00:43:17.830
If we were to auction
it off to people

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.290
in the marketplace in general,
it would have to sell for zero,

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.119
because if it were positive,
then I would be benefiting

00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:27.660
and the person who's
selling it to me

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.050
would be losing
out and vice versa.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.200
So we can have our own
speculative motives

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.940
for doing the deal.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.610
But when the price is
set, the way that it's set

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:44.055
is not just based upon simple
expectations of you and me.

00:43:44.055 --> 00:43:46.430
But it's the market that's
determining the forward price.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.873
Yeah?

00:43:46.873 --> 00:43:48.289
AUDIENCE: Then
what's the function

00:43:48.289 --> 00:43:52.137
of the over-the-counter market
for the forward contract?

00:43:52.137 --> 00:43:53.720
ANDREW LO: The
over-the-counter market

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.480
is that you and I
are the ones that

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.194
are entering into the deal.

00:43:57.194 --> 00:43:58.610
And so we're signing
the contract.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.260
So it's between us.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.470
But my point is that if the
forward price that we are using

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:07.010
to strike that deal
is so one-sided,

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:10.010
then it's going to be
very clear from the market

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.700
that that's a stupid contract
for one of us to enter into.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.790
So it's a private transaction
between you and me.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.220
And for that matter, if
it's a private transaction,

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.170
you're right that
it could be the case

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.810
that we can make up any price.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:28.560
Let's say $200 a barrel.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:34.740
Would you ever see a contract
that's at $200 a barrel?

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:40.350
No, because that would
mean that either you or me

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.130
is being really stupid.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:44.605
Now we're perfectly
allowed to be stupid.

00:44:44.605 --> 00:44:47.970
The Constitution
guarantees that right.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:51.810
But it's unlikely, because
we know, both you and I,

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.100
how oil is doing.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:57.450
And therefore, the price will be
set to make that contract worth

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:58.680
nothing.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.340
If it were not worth
nothing, then one of us

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.260
is making a very bad deal.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.080
And money is going to be
exchanged from one party

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.561
to the other.

00:45:08.561 --> 00:45:09.060
Yeah?

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.410
AUDIENCE: Does this
always have to happen

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.594
between a buyer and a seller,
or could that be in communities?

00:45:14.594 --> 00:45:15.760
ANDREW LO: Could it be what?

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.301
AUDIENCE: Could it
be in communities?

00:45:17.301 --> 00:45:19.480
ANDREW LO: I'm going to
get to that in two minutes.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.520
Right now, it's only
between buyer and seller.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.900
That's a forward contract.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.990
With the futures contract,
that's a different story.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.200
Another question?

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.320
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering, does this actually

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.141
assume physical
delivery of the asset?

00:45:31.141 --> 00:45:32.140
ANDREW LO: Yes, it does.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.410
Yes, it does, although
if it doesn't have to.

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.914
If the contract that you
strike as a forward contract

00:45:36.914 --> 00:45:38.830
is one where you don't
want physical delivery,

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.110
you can make it a
pure bet-- a side bet.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:44.290
But in fact, typical forward
contracts that are entered into

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:47.200
are for physical delivery
of the actual commodity

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.120
being agreed upon,
because that's

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.320
why people enter into them.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:54.100
They need the oil or
the gas or the copper.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:54.692
Yeah?

00:45:54.692 --> 00:45:56.050
AUDIENCE: What does [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:57.430
ANDREW LO: So let
me get to that.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.230
I want to make sure we get all
the other questions answered,

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.400
though, before I go down.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.110
The last point
that I want to make

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.960
is that with a forward
contract, because it's

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.460
a contract between
two parties, there

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.930
is significant
counterparty risk,

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:14.490
meaning there is a risk
that you don't pay up

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:17.434
on your end of the deal
or that I don't pay up

00:46:17.434 --> 00:46:18.350
on my end of the deal.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:24.270
There is a significant risk
that one of the parties reneges.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:28.590
So this is not a riskless
kind of a contract.

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:32.100
It has significant default risk.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.580
How significant depends
upon the counterparty.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.380
If you're dealing with--

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.420
I hate to say this--
but a AAA counterparty,

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.850
then the risks should be small.

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:46.286
But we all know what
AAA means these days.

00:46:46.286 --> 00:46:47.910
It used to be the
case that when you're

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.250
dealing with a AAA
counterparty, you had

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:52.714
very little counterparty risk.

00:46:52.714 --> 00:46:54.630
But if you're dealing
with a counterparty that

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.877
doesn't have the same kind
of financial wherewithal,

00:46:56.877 --> 00:46:58.710
then you're going to
have to bear that risk.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:01.770
And it's up to you to
decide, is it worth it to you

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.060
to take that risk?

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.120
Yeah?

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:08.525
AUDIENCE: So in event of
the very [INAUDIBLE] market

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:13.962
fluctuation [INAUDIBLE],
somebody will lose in the end

00:47:13.962 --> 00:47:15.270
upon the settlement.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:21.027
So is it common for people that
participate in this to hedge

00:47:21.027 --> 00:47:23.332
their positions as well?

00:47:23.332 --> 00:47:24.377
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:24.377 --> 00:47:25.960
ANDREW LO: To hedge
counterparty risk?

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.580
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.580
ANDREW LO: It is common.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.380
And you know how they do it?

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.850
They don't use a
forward contract.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:33.080
They use a futures contract.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.221
So we're going to get there
in just a few minutes.

00:47:35.221 --> 00:47:36.970
Maybe I should go
faster, given that there

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.130
are all these questions that
are anticipating the futures

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.630
contract.

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.046
Or maybe it's just
that all of you

00:47:42.046 --> 00:47:43.780
are scared to death
of counterparty risk,

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:46.447
given what's going on, that
you just want to get rid of it.

00:47:46.447 --> 00:47:49.030
So let me go quickly through an
example of a forward contract.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.655
Then I'll get to your point, and
I"ll show you how you go about

00:47:51.655 --> 00:47:56.172
hedging that risk by essentially
doing a transaction every day.

00:47:56.172 --> 00:47:57.880
But I want to make
sure we all understand

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.870
the concept of a forward first.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.300
So here's an example.

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.170
The current price of soybeans
is $160 a metric ton.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:07.750
That's the current spot price--

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.590
the price today.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.150
And there's a tofu
manufacturer that

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:17.335
needs 1,000 tons, not now
but three months from now.

00:48:17.335 --> 00:48:18.960
And they want to make
sure they can get

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.940
that 100,000 tons at that time.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.320
So they might enter into
a three-month contract

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.570
to buy 1,000 tons at 165 tons.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.570
So they're going to offer
the seller of the soybeans--

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.580
the soybean farmer--

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.265
they'll offer them a
little bit of a premium--

00:48:38.265 --> 00:48:43.030
a $5 premium-- in order
to lock in that price.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:44.980
Now it doesn't have to
always be a premium.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.979
In certain cases, there
could be a discount.

00:48:47.979 --> 00:48:50.020
And there are different
names for those that I'll

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.890
talk about in a few minutes.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:54.180
But for now, it's at 165.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.070
And it's what the
market seems to agree

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.320
is an appropriate price
three months from now.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.370
So you've all
identified, I think,

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:05.080
the issues with a
forward contract.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.020
There are two issues.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.070
One is illiquidity, and the
second is counterparty risk.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.590
Illiquidity means,
suppose that I no longer

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:12.820
want to be in the contract--

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.690
I want out.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.910
Well, it's not easy
for me to get out.

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.820
I can't sell my
contract unless I

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:26.550
find somebody else who wants to
buy soybeans at 165 tons three

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:27.442
months from now.

00:49:27.442 --> 00:49:28.650
I can't get out of it easily.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.110
I can go back to
the farmer and say,

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.120
would you mind
canceling the contract?

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.020
And they'll probably say,
well, it depends, where

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.890
is the price of soybeans today?

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.380
If the price of
soybeans is at $180,

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.270
I'm happy to cancel
the contract.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.820
If the price of soybeans
is at $50, sorry,

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.250
you're stuck with the agreement.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.080
So the illiquidity is an issue.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.780
But then of course,
counterparty risk

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.610
is another issue that
we have to deal with.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:54.360
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:54.360 --> 00:50:00.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] trying
to hedge the quantity.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.720
It's not the actual price.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.960
Do companies do that where
they want to guarantee

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.784
that there will be a supply?

00:50:05.784 --> 00:50:06.450
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:07.560
Well, it's both.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.510
They want to guarantee
that they have enough

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:11.676
to be able to produce
whatever they need to produce.

00:50:11.676 --> 00:50:14.300
So they need a certain
amount of input.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.450
But they won't want to
guarantee it at any price.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:20.490
They want to be able to
figure out a reasonable price.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.510
So in this example of
the tofu manufacturer,

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.400
they need 1,000 tons
in three months.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.260
That's definite.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.754
That's the quantity
that they need.

00:50:29.754 --> 00:50:31.170
The question is,
what's the price?

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:34.950
If the current spot
price is at $160,

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:37.020
then they need to
make a decision.

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.690
In three months
time, do they think

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:44.400
that the price will be
greater or less than 165?

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.750
If they think that it may
be much more than 165,

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:50.220
then they'll enter into it.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.720
But if they think
that there's going

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.480
to be a huge crop of
soybeans, because we've

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.450
had a lot of rainfall
and a lot of sunshine

00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.400
and there's no problem
and we're going

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.952
to have a glut of soybeans, then
they may not do this at all.

00:51:02.952 --> 00:51:04.410
They may just say,
huh, we're going

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.550
to wait three months
to see what happens.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.180
Of course, if it turns out that
between now and three months

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.590
from now there is
some kind of bacteria

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:17.100
that kills half the soybean
crop, now it's $190 a ton,

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.040
then they're in trouble.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.220
So as a tofu
manufacturer, you got

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.950
to ask yourself the
question, how well

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.980
do you know the soybean
market, how much

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.730
are you willing to bet your
firm's franchise on soybeans

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.740
being available at the
price that you want

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.570
to pay three months from now?

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:37.880
OK.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.160
So it's both price and quantity.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:41.660
All right.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.450
Now we're going to get
back to [INAUDIBLE] point

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:48.290
about being worried
about counterparty risk.

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:50.510
And let's just talk
about counterparty risk

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:53.420
in very, very plain detail.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.330
Suppose that we enter into
that soybean contract.

00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:58.910
So today, we agree
to buy soybeans

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:03.280
three months from now, as a tofu
manufacturer, for $165 a ton.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.490
All right, now let's
fast forward one month.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:11.500
We've got two months to
go in our agreement--

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.270
in our forward agreement--

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:18.790
and all of a sudden, something
happens in the soybean market,

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:24.610
and the spot price for soybeans
has now dropped to $100 a ton.

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:28.750
Huge glut that has hit the
market, because the weather

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:36.790
was unexpectedly nicer, lots of
rainfall, just tremendous crop

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:37.820
output.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:42.660
So we got $100 a
ton for soybeans.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:50.020
Now to the tofu manufacturer
who's looking to do this deal,

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:55.270
is he in better shape or worse
shape in that circumstance?

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.770
Why?

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:59.160
Why is he in worse shape?

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:03.270
He's agreed to buy it at
$165, price is at 100.

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:04.800
But what's the big deal?

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.670
He was willing to
do that a month ago.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:09.170
What's that?

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:10.420
Same shape.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.240
Same shape.

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.910
We agree?

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:15.327
Worse-- why is it worse?

00:53:15.327 --> 00:53:17.035
AUDIENCE: Because his
competitors already

00:53:17.035 --> 00:53:19.170
have access to [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.230
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.310
So what do you think the
competitors are going to do?

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:24.030
Exactly.

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:28.430
The competitors are going
to drop the price of tofu.

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.350
Soybeans have come
down in price.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:33.260
The competitors are going
to cut the price of tofu.

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.570
And here you've
got a manufacturer.

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.610
If you argue that he's
in the same shape,

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:40.910
that means that he's going to
keep the same price of tofu

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:44.417
and he's going to pay $165
for what's worth $100.

00:53:44.417 --> 00:53:46.250
Basically, he's going
to go out of business,

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:49.520
because his competitors
are going to eat his lunch.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.010
They're going to
charge 40% less,

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:53.960
and he'll have
zero market share.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.480
And he may be able to withstand
that for a period of time,

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.430
but not for a sustained
period of time.

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:03.260
So this particular manufacturer
of tofu is thinking,

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:08.420
well, I could buy soybeans
at $100 on the market now

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:12.540
and I got two months before
I have to make good on this,

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.020
what if I just walk away
from this forward agreement?

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:19.870
Now legally, he's not
supposed to do that.

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:25.900
So what that means is that if
he does do that, he can be sued.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.470
And from the tofu
manufacturer's point of view,

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:32.800
he might be thinking,
well, they can sue me

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:36.160
and we can figure it out, or I
can follow through the contract

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.130
and I'll go out of business,
so if I'm faced with those two

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:41.290
choices and that's
my only choice,

00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:44.340
I'm going to renege
on that contract

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.820
and let them sue me
and see what they get,

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.470
maybe we'll settle
out of court, maybe we

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:51.240
won't, who knows
what will happen,

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.680
I'm willing to take that risk.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.970
That's a calculation.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:58.630
It's a business decision
that has consequences.

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:00.820
But it's got consequences
for both parties.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.720
Now imagine you're the soybean
farmer dealing with this tofu

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.160
manufacturer.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.750
And you're rubbing your hands,
because you locked in at $165

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.290
a ton.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:13.990
But two months from
now when you go

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:17.860
to deliver these soybeans,
you find out the warehouse

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.210
is not accepting it.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:22.030
And you can't get this tofu
manufacturer on the phone.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:23.710
He's not returning your calls.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:24.690
What do you do?

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:25.190
Yeah?

00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:26.810
AUDIENCE: This is currently
happening with oil.

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:29.193
A lot of people locked in
at $5.00 a gallon and now

00:55:29.193 --> 00:55:30.296
it's above $4.00.

00:55:30.296 --> 00:55:33.047
So the oil companies are
scared that everyone's

00:55:33.047 --> 00:55:33.880
going to stiff them.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.796
ANDREW LO: Absolutely.

00:55:34.796 --> 00:55:37.150
There's counterparty
risk that comes

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:40.733
about when you've got dramatic
changes in economic conditions.

00:55:40.733 --> 00:55:41.719
Yeah?

00:55:41.719 --> 00:55:44.677
AUDIENCE: But as far as
I know, the system only

00:55:44.677 --> 00:55:47.873
gave you the [INAUDIBLE] deposit
[INAUDIBLE] amount of the risk

00:55:47.873 --> 00:55:48.892
that you want to buy.

00:55:48.892 --> 00:55:49.600
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.880
So now you're talking
about collateral.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.700
In order to be able to enter
into a forward agreement,

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.440
you might, before you
even start talking, say,

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.700
you know what, I'm not going to
do business with you unless you

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.420
put up some money--

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:06.880
so money as a kind of collateral
for making good on it.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.070
And if you don't
make good on it,

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:11.270
I get to keep the collateral.

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:13.386
Now the question is, how
big is the collateral,

00:56:13.386 --> 00:56:14.260
and what is it worth?

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:17.010
AUDIENCE: So you say, what
reason do you want to buy?

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:20.510
If you just want to buy
a $30 risk [INAUDIBLE],

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.986
so you put $30
[INAUDIBLE] want to buy.

00:56:22.986 --> 00:56:25.446
But you, from the
beginning, can say, how much

00:56:25.446 --> 00:56:26.775
[INAUDIBLE] do you want to buy?

00:56:26.775 --> 00:56:28.900
ANDREW LO: Well, but the
thing is that they may not

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:29.733
be willing to do it.

00:56:29.733 --> 00:56:31.300
So let's do the
example of soybeans.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:36.090
Soybeans at $165 a ton
multiplied by 1,000 tons

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:38.910
is $165,000.

00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:40.122
Right?

00:56:40.122 --> 00:56:44.280
AUDIENCE: I can put [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.170
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:50.280
So in order to do the deal,
maybe you would agree to put

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.790
$5.00 a ton of
deposit as collateral.

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:55.410
OK?

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:56.940
That sounds good, right?

00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.860
And as a counterparty, I
might be happy with that.

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.370
OK, now say the price of
soybeans drops to $100 a ton.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:08.680
And you've put $5.00 down as
earnest money as collateral.

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:13.570
And so from your perspective,
as long as the price goes down

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:16.090
by more than $5.00,
you're going to walk away.

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:18.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but I lose the $5.00.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:18.350
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:19.302
You lose the $5.00.

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:20.260
I'm the soybean farmer.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:21.640
Great, I got $5.00 a ton.

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.640
What's that going to do?

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.700
That pays for my postage.

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.380
That doesn't do anything for me.

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:31.030
So given that I'm worried
about your counterparty risk,

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:34.960
I'm going to say, you know
what, I don't want $5.00 a ton,

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.630
I want you to pay
me $160 a ton now,

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.000
I want you to deposit that
in the bank and put it

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.530
in collateral.

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:43.750
Would you be willing to do that?

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:47.509
AUDIENCE: Depends on
the rate and the--

00:57:47.509 --> 00:57:48.300
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.510
It depends upon what you think
the risks are that the price is

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:53.800
going to go down quite a bit.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.780
But in general, you're not going
to want to tie up $160 a ton

00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:01.110
for three months if you don't
have to, because that costs you

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:01.620
something.

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.690
The opportunity cost
is the interest rate.

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:05.219
Yeah?

00:58:05.219 --> 00:58:07.260
AUDIENCE: Why don't I just
make a contract saying

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.600
I would buy at a
10% markup instead

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.480
of setting a specific price?

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.830
Does it no longer [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:15.874
ANDREW LO: Well, no.

00:58:15.874 --> 00:58:17.040
You could certainly do that.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.110
But it's not clear that that
really makes any difference.

00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:20.280
10% markup over what?

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.570
You have to define something.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:22.903
AUDIENCE: The price at the time.

00:58:22.903 --> 00:58:25.500
ANDREW LO: Over the
prevailing market price.

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.320
You could do that.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:30.810
Right.

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:32.050
What's the benefit of that?

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:34.720
That doesn't lock in anything.

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.120
It may lock in the supply, but
it doesn't lock in the price.

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.800
You still have
price uncertainty.

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.880
So if you do that, unless
you're worried about a shortage,

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:46.540
you can always get something
for 10% above the price,

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.990
at least I think you can.

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:51.460
Markets are pretty crazy.

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.670
But if I were to tell you that
no matter what commodity we're

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:58.060
talking about, I'm willing to
pay 10% more than the market

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.290
price, my guess is that
everybody here would

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:01.540
be pretty happy to sell to me.

00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:03.090
Right?

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:03.646
Yeah?

00:59:03.646 --> 00:59:06.322
AUDIENCE: But these [INAUDIBLE]
evaluated by anybody.

00:59:06.322 --> 00:59:10.275
So are these just contracts
between producer and supplier?

00:59:10.275 --> 00:59:10.900
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.580
AUDIENCE: So they're like
longstanding agreements

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.360
and I'm just--

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:12.640
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.181
That's right.

00:59:13.181 --> 00:59:15.640
These are not
governed by any agency

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.280
or any kind of standardization.

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.640
And you now see the problem
with these contracts.

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:25.900
These contracts work if the
two parties know each other,

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:28.750
they've done business for
years, there's a lot of trust,

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.750
you don't have to worry
about counterparty risk,

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:32.500
you've got the right
amount of collateral,

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:36.210
you've got the right
rating, on and on.

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:37.950
It's complicated.

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:40.351
Isn't there a way to
make this simpler?

00:59:40.351 --> 00:59:41.850
And the answer is
that there's a way

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:45.500
to deal with all of your
objections-- all of them.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.390
Let's create a new
contract called a futures.

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:52.290
A futures contract is
exactly like a forward

00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:55.360
with a few exceptions.

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.510
Exception number one, we're
going to standardize a futures

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:00.040
contract.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.490
One contract applies
to a fixed amount

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:06.940
of the commodity of
a fixed quality that

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:11.110
is known in advance and
is decided objectively.

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:16.990
It expires, or it
settles, on a fixed date.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:21.010
And there is a futures price.

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:25.470
And the price is
determined on an exchange.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:29.520
OK, so that's one
set of changes.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.570
But the other set of
changes is really important,

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:40.860
which is that we are going
to mark to market every day.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.980
Now what does mark
to market mean?

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.290
If you've got a
futures contract--

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:49.540
or rather, if you've got
a forward contract that

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:54.520
expires in three months,
initially it's worth nothing.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:01:00.110
But over time, as the
spot price fluctuates,

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:03.780
that forward contract has value.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:07.200
But no money changes hands.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.400
And so because no money
changes hands, and apart

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.180
from collateral, you can
have a really big mismatch

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:19.480
in the value of the contract
to one party or another.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.020
So let's go back to
the soybean example.

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.420
I start out by agreeing
to buy soybeans

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:30.120
from you at $165 a metric
ton three months from now.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.340
And the spot price today is 160.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.170
All right.

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:43.600
A month from now, let's say,
the spot price is down to 150.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.180
What do you think
that contract is going

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.229
to be worth at that point?

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.172
Yeah?

01:01:53.172 --> 01:01:55.241
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:55.241 --> 01:01:56.240
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:56.600
$15.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.530
How did you get $15?

01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:01.341
AUDIENCE: It's the difference
between the future price

01:02:01.341 --> 01:02:03.320
and the spot today.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.340
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:08.140
I've agreed to buy it for $165.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:15.530
The spot price two months
from maturity is $150.

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.840
That's $15 difference.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.410
And so this piece of paper
obligates me to buy it

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:24.030
for $15 more than today.

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:26.900
So from my perspective--
the buyer--

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:31.890
the contract is worth not
zero, but it's worth negative

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:34.560
$15 divided by the
rate of interest,

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.390
because I don't have
to pay the $15 today.

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:39.450
I have to pay the $15 at
maturity, at settlement.

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:43.530
For you, the farmer who sold me
that contract, that contract--

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:48.720
to you, it's worth $15 per
1,000 metric tons divided

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.390
by the appropriate discount
factor-- the interest rate--

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:52.710
for that three months.

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:56.910
Now to say that it's worth that
really means it's worth that.

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:58.800
For example, if
you decide that you

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.380
want to get out of the
soybean farming business

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.880
and you want to
take that contract

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.880
and sell it to one of
your fellow farmers,

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.530
they'll pay you $15 divided
by the appropriate interest

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:13.147
rate per 1,000 metric tons.

01:03:13.147 --> 01:03:14.730
You will be able to
sell that contract

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:15.771
for that amount of money.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.530
So after date zero, as
the spot price fluctuates,

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:27.800
this forward agreement ends
up taking on economic value,

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.520
because the prices fluctuate.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.100
If we allow that
price fluctuation--

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.350
if we allow the value
of that contract

01:03:36.350 --> 01:03:38.880
to get really, really big--

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.010
in my crazy example, if the
spot price goes down to 100--

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:45.170
well, then that piece
of paper is worth a lot

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:46.550
to you, the farmer.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:51.230
And it's worth a lot to me to
be able to get rid of that loss.

01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:52.550
That's a big loss.

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:57.110
The bigger the loss, the more
likely it is that one of us

01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:58.440
is not going to perform.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.120
Why?

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.020
Because the collateral-- if we
have a collateral of $5.00 per

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:08.120
1,000 metric tons, that $5.00
is going to become meaningless

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.490
pretty soon, because I'm
looking at a loss of $50.

01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:17.780
If it goes down
from $165 to $100,

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.060
I'm looking at a
really big loss--

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.370
$65 per metric ton.

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:24.770
$5.00 means nothing to me.

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:28.220
So the bigger the
fluctuations away

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:33.630
from the initial forward
price, the bigger

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.190
the potential for
counterparty risk.

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:40.630
So if that's the case, let's
you and I agree on something.

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:44.510
Why don't we agree that
every single day, we

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:50.350
will strike a new contract
with a new forward price,

01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:53.390
and then we'll just pay
each other the difference

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.450
day by day?

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:57.340
So in other words,
in your example,

01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:00.760
let's say it's $165 today.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.750
We agree on that.

01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:05.410
The spot price is at $160.

01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:11.180
Let's say tomorrow the spot
price goes down to $155.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.380
OK, you know what, let's you and
I agree I'm going to just pay

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:21.280
you $5.00 divided by the
interest over the next three

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.546
months minus a day, and then
let's cancel the contract.

01:05:26.546 --> 01:05:28.980
And let's start a new one.

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.870
And let's say that
now, today, we're

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:37.010
going to agree to
not $165, but $160.

01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:38.480
The spot price is at $155.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.704
Let's agree to $160.

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:43.690
OK?

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.180
And now another day passes by.

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.970
And let's see the price goes
down yet again, now down

01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:52.984
to $155.

01:05:52.984 --> 01:05:54.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] $5.00.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.170
ANDREW LO: Yes.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:57.130
Right.

01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:01.000
Or I give you $5.00,
you give me $5.00.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.430
Every single day,
we exchange money.

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:06.370
And every single day, we
get rid of the old contract

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:11.620
and we do a whole new one with a
new forward price that reflects

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.840
current market conditions.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.587
If we do that--

01:06:14.587 --> 01:06:16.920
well, first of all, it's going
to be a pain in the neck,

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.045
because we have to do a
lot of contracts every day.

01:06:19.045 --> 01:06:20.720
But suppose we did that.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:24.520
If we did that every day,
then what we would be doing

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.860
is essentially always figuring
out what today's market

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:34.840
price is for soybean delivery
on that settlement date.

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:41.740
That's what it means
to mark to market.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.460
At every single day, the
price of the contract

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:49.350
reflects today's
market valuation,

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:52.140
not when we did the
contract at the beginning

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.670
of that three-month period.

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:56.610
Every single day as we
get closer and closer

01:06:56.610 --> 01:07:01.410
to settlement, we are
revising the forward price

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:03.360
to reflect all the
information that's

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.760
accumulated up to that point.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:09.600
And I'm either paying
you, or you're paying me.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.420
We're changing
money every day so

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:20.010
that the value of the agreement
is never that far out of sync

01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:23.390
from the market's value.

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:26.360
That way, we can protect this
kind of counterparty risk,

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.920
because then the only risk
I'm going to have with you

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.100
is the risk that comes from
a one-day fluctuation, not

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.600
three months.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.040
Prices can move a
lot in three months.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.585
But by that time, we will have
changed money back and forth.

01:07:41.585 --> 01:07:42.460
And so you know what?

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.379
When you add up all the
money that's changed hands

01:07:45.379 --> 01:07:47.170
over the course of the
entire three months,

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:50.590
if we struck a new
forward contract every day

01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:53.050
and then we added up all the
money that went back and forth

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.591
and did the interest
rate just right,

01:07:54.591 --> 01:07:55.889
you know what we would get?

01:07:55.889 --> 01:07:57.430
We would basically
get the same thing

01:07:57.430 --> 01:08:01.240
as if we had gotten a
forward contract on day one

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.420
and held it to maturity.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:06.440
But the difference is that
during that three-month period,

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.420
you and I, we've
never had to worry

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:13.970
about either party reneging,
because the amount of cash that

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:17.779
is owed to one party or
another has gotten so big

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:20.500
that it makes it
worthwhile to walk away.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:25.470
So a forward contract
is a situation

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:27.990
where you don't mark
to market every day.

01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:31.740
You allow the value of that
contract to go up and down

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.529
and up and down to
wherever the spot

01:08:34.529 --> 01:08:38.069
price determines that
it does, in relation

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:39.750
to that forward price.

01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:41.850
With the futures
contract, you can

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:46.740
think of a futures as a
sequence of forward contracts

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:51.180
where you cancel the forward
contract every period

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:56.381
but pay the difference that was
won or lost relative to the day

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:56.880
before.

01:08:59.689 --> 01:09:03.819
So there's one more piece
that I have to tell you about.

01:09:03.819 --> 01:09:06.189
And that is that-- somebody
asked about an intermediary

01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:07.490
with forward contracts.

01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:10.910
Forward contracts
have no intermediary.

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:13.500
But futures contracts do.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.189
Some clever person figured out
that all of these other changes

01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:19.859
that we want to implement
to create a futures contract

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:25.010
is great, except that there
is still this lingering

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:29.630
concern that somehow you
don't show up tomorrow

01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:35.890
when I want to basically do a
deal and update my contract.

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:38.229
So they came up with
a brilliant idea

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:42.700
of establishing an intermediary
called the Futures Clearing

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.229
Corporation.

01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:47.350
The Futures Clearing
Corporation is an organization

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.250
that sits between you and me.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:56.110
And what it does is simply
serve as the counterparty.

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:59.010
So I'm not dealing
with you or you or you.

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:00.930
I'm dealing with one
organization that stands

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.700
in the middle of everybody.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.650
I'm dealing with
that organization,

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:06.960
and you're dealing
with that organization.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.380
And as long as that
organization makes sure

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:14.970
that there are two sides
to every transaction--

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:17.790
more or less, two sides
to every transaction--

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:21.480
then that will reduce
the risk even more.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.630
So not only are the
contracts standardized,

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:28.230
not only are they
mark-to-market every day,

01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:32.910
and not only do we re-establish
this price every day,

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:36.510
but we then now have the safety
of a clearing corporation

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:39.150
that we know will always be
there to transact with us.

01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:41.790
So the market is
highly, highly liquid.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.160
OK.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:45.990
Now-- question?

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.490
Yeah?

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.448
AUDIENCE: Are there any
industries or companies

01:10:48.448 --> 01:10:52.420
that use forwards
rather than futures?

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.170
ANDREW LO: There are some.

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:56.870
In fact, oil companies,
airline companies,

01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:00.562
and other major
producers or suppliers,

01:11:00.562 --> 01:11:02.270
they prefer forwards,
simply because they

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:04.436
don't want to deal with
these mark-to-market issues.

01:11:04.436 --> 01:11:06.860
And they've dealt
with their suppliers

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.007
long enough that
they trust them.

01:11:09.007 --> 01:11:11.090
And so they've got
standardized forward agreements

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:14.520
that are customized to
exactly what they want.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.240
For example, a futures contract
has very specific settlement

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:17.920
dates.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.670
If those settlement
dates don't correspond

01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:22.220
with when you need
the particular input,

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:25.180
then you don't want to use that.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.320
But by and large,
the futures contracts

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.740
eliminates a lot of these issues
with forward contracts so that

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.850
for liquidity, for
transparency, for safety--

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:36.929
all of those reasons--

01:11:36.929 --> 01:11:38.970
they are actually preferred
to forward contracts.

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:41.580
But forward contracts
are still very popular.

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.650
For example, there
are some markets

01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:45.450
where forward
contracts are actually

01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:47.040
even more popular than futures.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.410
One example-- currencies.

01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.600
For a variety of
reasons, currencies--

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:57.480
where you trade with banks for
different foreign currencies

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.600
in the future, the
futures exchanges

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:05.250
have much lower volume, in terms
of dollars traded or yen traded

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:08.160
or cable traded, than
the banks dealing

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.110
with these forward contracts.

01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:11.104
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:11.104 --> 01:12:12.479
AUDIENCE: Looks
like in this case

01:12:12.479 --> 01:12:15.497
the interest rate risk is also
a [INAUDIBLE] of the future.

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:16.080
Is that right?

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:16.990
ANDREW LO: The
interest rate is what?

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:19.100
AUDIENCE: Interest rate
risk is also a risk.

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.220
ANDREW LO: Yes,
interest rate risk

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.094
is definitely a part of
it, because remember,

01:12:22.094 --> 01:12:24.900
we have to divide
implicitly by the interest,

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.960
because we're getting paid not
now, but in three months or two

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.690
months or 29 days and so on.

01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:30.940
So we're going to get to that.

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:34.160
In fact, let me
do some examples,

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.660
and then we're going to talk
about how interest rates figure

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.580
into this explicitly.

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:42.200
So here's an example
of a futures contract.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.050
NYMEX-- the New York Mercantile
Exchange, it's called NYMEX--

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:48.990
trades crude oil futures.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:52.310
Now there are lots of
different kinds of oil.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:55.350
And there are futures
contracts that are designated

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:56.740
for a particular kind.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:00.480
So crude oil light is one.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.360
Another one is Brent crude oil--

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.190
oil from the Brent Seas.

01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:08.700
And each different kind of
oil has a different contract.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:12.990
Remember, we have to standardize
the underlying commodity.

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:19.650
So NYMEX crude oil futures
with delivery in December 2007

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:27.090
at a price of $76.06 a barrel
on July 27, 2007 where there's

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:31.620
51,475 contracts traded.

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:34.410
So this is a simple example
of an actual contract that

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:38.490
was traded in the good old days
when oil was only $75 a barrel

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:40.690
a year ago.

01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:43.270
Each contract is
for 1,000 barrels.

01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:46.210
So that's part of
the standardization.

01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:49.060
The tick size--
tick size meaning,

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:53.260
what is the denomination that
prices will change when they

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:54.910
change up and down--

01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:58.180
it's a penny a barrel.

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:00.130
So in other words,
with 1,000 barrels,

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:02.350
if it moves a penny
a barrel, that

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:05.290
means the contract, which
is for 1,000 barrels,

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:08.530
moves in $10 increments.

01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:10.990
So when you buy one
of these contracts,

01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:15.520
you are buying
1,000 barrels of oil

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.610
to be delivered to
you in December.

01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:22.120
That's what one of
these contracts means.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.020
Now you actually have to
put up some collateral

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.130
for these as well.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.700
But think about it.

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:37.580
If it's $75 a barrel and it's
1,000 barrels per contract,

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:42.920
then how much oil are you
controlling with one contract

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.642
in dollar terms?

01:14:44.642 --> 01:14:46.510
Yeah, it's $75,000.

01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:49.990
That's a lot of money
for one contract.

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.050
Look at how much collateral
you have to post.

01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:54.490
The amount of
collateral that you

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:58.090
have to give your broker to
buy one of these contracts

01:14:58.090 --> 01:15:00.430
is $4,050.

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:05.290
Now by the way, that collateral
has increased by about 50%

01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:06.616
as of this morning.

01:15:06.616 --> 01:15:07.990
The New York
Mercantile Exchange,

01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:11.080
Chicago Board of Trade,
and other futures companies

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.540
have increased margins
across the board

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:17.230
for most of the futures
contracts because of concerns

01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:21.190
about liquidity and viability.

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:24.340
Maintenance margin says that
once you establish an account

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.860
and put the $4,000,
they know the money is

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:30.550
going to go down or up as the
price of oil goes down or up.

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:34.380
But at all points in time, you
have to keep at least $3,000

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:34.880
in there.

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.230
So in other words, the $4,000,
you could lose some of that

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:41.620
and it could go down
to $3,500 or $3,250.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:45.580
But if it goes
below $3,000, you're

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.830
going to get a phone call
from your broker that

01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:50.710
says, you need to
deposit more money,

01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:52.990
you need to bring it
up to $3,000, that's

01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:56.110
what you need to do to
maintain the account.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:59.782
And you know what happens if you
don't return that phone call?

01:15:59.782 --> 01:16:01.600
They get rid of the contract.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.970
You're out of the market.

01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:06.550
If you don't wire that money
into the account by end

01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:09.400
of business on the day
you get the margin call,

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.943
they have the right, and they
will close out your contract.

01:16:13.943 --> 01:16:17.022
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:17.022 --> 01:16:19.230
ANDREW LO: Well, it depends
on what your position is.

01:16:19.230 --> 01:16:21.540
No, you have whatever
money you have left.

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.620
But you no longer have
the position in oil.

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.100
So if that $3,000
goes down to $2,500,

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.500
that's still your
$2,500, but you no longer

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:33.800
have a position in oil anymore
at the end of business.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.060
That's one of the beauties
of a futures contract,

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.704
from the perspective
of the counterparty.

01:16:38.704 --> 01:16:40.120
It's that they
don't have to worry

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.470
that you're going to run away.

01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:45.822
The most they can lose is one
day's worth of fluctuation

01:16:45.822 --> 01:16:47.030
in the value of the contract.

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:52.180
That's why for a
$75,000 agreement,

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:55.540
you only have to put down
$4,000 earnest money.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.130
In the case of that
soybean farmer,

01:16:57.130 --> 01:17:00.340
think about how much money you
really would be comfortable

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:02.770
requiring the
counterparty to put down

01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:05.816
if you're going to exchange
no money for three months.

01:17:05.816 --> 01:17:07.690
Three months, you never
see the other person.

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:09.010
You don't know whether
they're still alive.

01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:11.410
You don't know what's going
on with their business.

01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:14.200
You're going to actually have
them put up a lot more money.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.180
With the futures
contract, you only

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.280
have to put up enough
money to make sure

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:24.235
that on a daily basis, you're
not getting taken advantage of.

01:17:24.235 --> 01:17:24.734
Yeah?

01:17:24.734 --> 01:17:26.435
AUDIENCE: How's that
initial margin set?

01:17:26.435 --> 01:17:28.810
ANDREW LO: The initial margin
is set exactly the same way

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.720
that the margin was going
to be set with collateral

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.440
for that soybean contract.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.410
It's the amount
of money that they

01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:40.300
think is enough to cover
any daily fluctuations

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:43.370
in the underlying
futures contract.

01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:46.840
So if the underlying
price moves by a lot,

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.940
what do you think that
will do to the margin--

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.572
make it go up or down?

01:17:51.572 --> 01:17:52.500
Up.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.480
So now do you know why
all of the exchanges

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:57.240
decided to increase
their margin?

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.030
Fluctuations have
started going up.

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:04.050
And also, people's credit,
in general, have gone down.

01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:04.722
Yeah?

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:06.388
AUDIENCE: Just going
back to your answer

01:18:06.388 --> 01:18:11.118
to [INAUDIBLE] physical
goods, if you and I can enter

01:18:11.118 --> 01:18:15.054
into a futures contract
[INAUDIBLE] traded,

01:18:15.054 --> 01:18:17.162
isn't physical delivery
not really expected,

01:18:17.162 --> 01:18:19.622
especially with the margin cost?

01:18:19.622 --> 01:18:21.580
Just by [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:23.330
ANDREW LO: Yes, so
with futures contracts,

01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:26.030
the majority of the people
that use futures are not

01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:27.620
looking for physical delivery.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.550
But with most of the
commodity futures contracts,

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:33.290
you actually have to specify.

01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:38.810
So there have been
stories of speculators

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:44.060
that forgot to check the box
that says Cash Settled Only

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.390
that have gotten
tons and tons of corn

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.350
dumped on their front lawn.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.050
That has happened.

01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:53.510
It's been a while,
but it's happened.

01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:55.730
Most futures contracts
are cash settled.

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:57.865
Cash settled means
no physical delivery.

01:18:57.865 --> 01:18:59.240
But there are
certain people that

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.860
actually want the physicals.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.620
And so they will transact
in the future markets

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.900
to get physical delivery.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.410
OK, that's it for today.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:09.860
We will see you not Monday,
because that's Columbus Day.

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:12.800
But I'll see you a
week from Monday.

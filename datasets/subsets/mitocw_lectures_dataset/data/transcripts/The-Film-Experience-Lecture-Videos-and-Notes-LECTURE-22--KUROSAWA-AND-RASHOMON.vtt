DAVID THORBURN:
Kurosawa's Rashomon

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.430
is a particularly
dramatic example

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.980
of a film that
understands itself

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.590
to have the kind of
claim on its audience

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.590
that the greatest art
has always imagined

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.852
itself to have on its audience.

00:00:38.852 --> 00:00:41.060
So I want to begin by talking
very briefly about what

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.210
I call the moment of Rashomon.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.340
There's a bit of
confusion, or at least

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.400
chronological confusion, or
inconsistency in the principle

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.880
that we end the course with a
film that was made and shown

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.880
internationally before
the last two films

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.840
that we've seen in our course.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.170
My reasons for that, as I
partly explained in an earlier

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.170
lecture, had to
do with my desire

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.720
to show a certain
continuity amongst forms

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.580
of European cinema and the
link between Jean Renoir,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.970
and the Italian neorealists,
and the French nouvelle vague

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.090
is so intimate that
it seemed to me

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.400
important to show you that
progression in sequence.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.840
But if we had been going by
strict chronological order,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.510
we would have introduced this
Kurosawa film a bit earlier,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.290
because it was made in 1950.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.660
And in 1951, it won an important
international prize, The Golden

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.910
Lion, the highest prize
available at the Venice Film

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.160
Festival in 1951.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.390
And this had a seismic effect
on movies around the world.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.610
The dramatic and
powerful subject matter

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.010
of Kurosawa's film of
course riveted attention.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.740
But even more than that, the
freedom and imaginative energy

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.550
of his stylistic
innovations in the film

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.350
had a profound impact on
filmmakers around the world.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.480
And when the film was shown at
Venice in 1951, another effect

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.000
it had when it won the prize
was to introduce Japanese cinema

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.330
to a wider world.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.400
It was the first significant
Japanese film, Kurosawa,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.420
the first important
Japanese director

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.830
to gain a reputation
outside of Japan itself.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.920
In fact, there are many
film buffs, and especially

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.320
specialists in
Japanese film, who

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.850
are somewhat resentful
of Kurosawa's eminence,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.650
even though no one denies
that he is an eminent

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.730
director, because there
are other directors.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.420
The two I've listed under
item 2 in our outline

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.470
are the most dramatic
examples, Mizoguchi and Ozu,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.250
who are often thought to be
his superior, even greater

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.750
directors than Kurosawa.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.400
This is a debate of nuances.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.730
All three of these
directors are major artists.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.350
But it is true, I think,
and it is widely recognized

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.520
that Kurosawa was the director
who crossed that barrier more

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.170
immediately, more
dramatically than any other,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.250
and opened the world, not
just to Japanese cinema,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.190
in some degree, but opened
the world in some longer

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.670
sense to Asian cinema
more generally,

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.190
that the so-called
Western world,

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.830
the European and
American cinema universes

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.260
had been fairly
oblivious to Asian cinema

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.200
and certainly to Japanese
cinema prior to this.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.280
And the appearance of Rashomon,
its enormous impact in 1951,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.820
began to change that.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.820
So that what was demonstrated
in moment when Rashomon

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.300
won this reward, won The
Golden Lion at the Venice Film

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.950
Festival, was a
reinforcement of a principle

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.580
I've been discussing throughout
the semester, the notion

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.860
of film as an international
medium, the notion

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.110
that directors from
different national cinemas

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.040
were now being deeply
influenced by directors

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.910
from other nations,
and that film itself

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.840
was in some deep way, a
global phenomenon, even

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.270
an international form.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.230
And I think it was in
the '50s and early '60s

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.130
that this idea began to
become more widely embraced

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.190
by film goers in the United
States and in Europe,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.240
but perhaps especially
in the United States.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.860
And one mark of
this, the emergence

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.530
of cinema as a fully recognized
independent art form.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.310
Obviously people
had thought this,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.010
and many directors had
achieved artistic distinction

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.760
before this.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.850
But I'm talking about the
public understanding of movies,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.900
the way people in different
cultures actually recognized

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.000
and thought about movies.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.370
It was as if this is the moment
in which movies were understood

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.090
to enter the museum
in a certain way,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.450
to earn in a public
sense, the status

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.480
that more traditional
art forms had had.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.105
And one of the explanations for
why this would have been so,

00:05:25.105 --> 00:05:27.230
why it would have had such
a powerful impact-- now,

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.110
I think I mentioned last
time that this insight was

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.930
partial in the United
States-- especially,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.200
that is to say, in the
'50s and early '60s,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.280
it began to dawn on movie
critics and scholars

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.510
of whom there were only a few
at that time and then movie

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.240
audiences that European films
and Asian films, especially

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.270
Japanese films, might
have great artistic value.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.730
But it was a longer
time before Americans

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.540
began to realize that their
own native forms of films

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.310
had had a similar
kind of authority.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.350
So this moment, in
the early 1950s,

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.320
was a deeply significant one.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.889
Let's remember historically
what it represented in Europe

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:08.930
and in the United States.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.610
It's the moment of the emergence
of Italian neorealism, which

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.620
itself begins to establish a
kind of very powerful claim

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.960
on people's attention.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.150
One irony of
Rashomon's success was

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.440
that it was not very
successful in Japan

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.380
when it was released in 1950.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.600
And the producer, the
production company

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.360
responsible for the film was
very dubious about entering it

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.220
in the competition, didn't think
it was a significant film, even

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.720
though it transformed
Kurosawa's career

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.150
because of the immense
recognition it finally got.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.060
And Kurosawa
himself recognized--

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.640
he'd been making films for
almost a decade before that,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.550
but Rashomon was his most
ambitious film to that point,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.310
and it also incorporated
more innovative strategy,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.175
visual strategies than
any he had tried before.

00:06:56.175 --> 00:06:59.240
It established him as an
international director.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.410
And I mentioned the names
of two other directors

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.230
just from different
traditions as a way

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.240
of reminding you of another
feature of this phenomenon,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.390
another reason, as I
began to say earlier,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.440
for why this moment was
such a significant one.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.910
And the term I use here is
modernism, modernist cinema.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.450
Remember, one of the ways
to understand this idea

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.380
is to recognize that a
great revolution in the arts

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.210
had occurred at the turn
of the 20th century,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.187
the end of the 19th, and at
the turn of the 20th century.

00:07:30.187 --> 00:07:31.520
We've talked about this earlier.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.960
It's the movement
we call modernism.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.620
It's the moment of Picasso.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.070
It's the moment of
James Joyce, and it

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.820
was a kind of revolution in
both visual art, literature,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.480
music took place in this period.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.340
And among the characteristics
of this modernist

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:58.100
movement was a newly complicated
and self-conscious attitude

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.080
toward narrative itself,
toward storytelling.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.110
So modernism in literature
and in art involved,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:11.690
among other things if not
a hostility or antagonism,

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.840
at least a kind of
skepticism about

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.670
inherited traditional categories
and ways of doing things.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.370
And one form this
took in narrative

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.030
was to dislocate or
disorient the narrative line.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.640
Instead of telling a story
in a chronological sequence,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.289
a lot of the great works of
fiction of the modernist era,

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:37.700
books by writers like
Joseph Conrad, or Proust,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.780
the great French
novelist who was so

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.340
preoccupied by memory
and human subjectivity,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.640
or the great German
novelist, Thomas Mann,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.790
a number of other great
figures that we could mention

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:55.110
began to construct stories in
which chronological order was

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.610
profoundly disrupted.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.870
And they also began to
create stories in which there

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.870
were multiple narrators.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.020
And the effect of
multiple narrators

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.910
begins-- even if you do
nothing more than have

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.670
multiple narrators, you
begin to raise questions

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.360
about the veracity,
the truthfulness

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.940
of any single perspective.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.760
And you will understand
when you look at Rashomon

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.630
why this movie embodies
many of these same modernist

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.290
principles.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:29.130
But the point is that
cinema, as a narrative form,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.650
lag behind these more
traditional arts.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.940
And it really wasn't
until the 1950s,

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.730
and partly because of
films like Rashomon,

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.360
that it began to be
recognized that the movies too

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.170
could embrace and embody
the principles of modernism.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.840
So one way to understand
what happened in the 1950s

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.970
is to recognize that directors
like Kurosawa and Ingmar

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.920
Bergman, the great
Swedish director,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.950
and Fellini, the great
Italian director,

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:02.310
and the inheritor and expander
of the neorealist tradition,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.090
going far beyond
a narrow realism,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.080
that directors like that
began to create films

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.420
that in a formal sense,
in a structural sense,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.780
and also in terms
of their content

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.840
had the kind of complexity,
nuance, and skepticism,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.510
and even the philosophic
self-awareness

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.530
that was characteristic
of high modernism

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.404
at the turn of the 20th century.

00:10:28.404 --> 00:10:30.320
So it's as if what was
going on was the movies

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.810
themselves were now asserting
themselves as a modernist art.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.750
I don't mean as a
contemporary art.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.320
I'm referring specifically
to the modernist movement,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:46.420
and to the dislocated,
and much more demanding

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.750
kinds of narrative
strategies that

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.330
are characteristic of
the modernist movement.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.000
So Rashomon played
a fundamental role

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.040
in this sort of
transformation of what

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.800
we might call the cultural
understanding of movies

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.040
among ordinary people, as well
as among scholars, critics,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.690
and other filmmakers.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.935
I want to mention
one other point.

00:11:05.935 --> 00:11:10.400
I'll give you a kind
of note to clarify

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.390
some of what I've
been implying, some

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:18.370
of what I implied when I
talked about Mizoguchi and Ozu

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.250
as directors who were
often even more highly

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.840
regarded than Kurosawa.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.850
I'll leave that to each
individual film goer.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.680
All three directors are
astonishing and remarkable.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.310
But it wouldn't be
appropriate to talk, even

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.200
about this single
film, Rashomon,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.090
without paying respects to
those two great directors whose

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.430
dates I've put on your outline.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.380
I won't talk about individual
films by these directors,

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.750
but I urge you all to look
them up, read about them

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.770
in David Cook's history
of narrative film,

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.770
and think about
experimenting by extending

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.680
your knowledge of
Japanese cinema

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.650
by trying films by these
two remarkable directors.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.110
One of the things that's
characteristic of all three

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.910
of these directors, of
Kurosawa, even more fully

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.310
of Mizoguchi and Ozu, Ozu
most fundamentally of all,

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.940
is that their films are
marked by a kind of impulse

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:19.650
toward stylization, toward
fabular, fable-like equations

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.360
that distinguish
them in some ways

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.980
from Western, from European,
and American films.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.030
And I think that one
explanation for this

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.390
has to do with the longer
artistic traditions

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.300
of Japanese society.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.460
Japanese film grows out
of theatrical traditions,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.930
like kabuki theater,
or Noh drama,

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.560
N-O-H drama, both of which have
profoundly stylized and fable

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.910
like qualities.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.710
They're anti-narrative,
in some sense,

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.110
and any of you who have ever
had even a minimal experience

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.290
with either of these two
theatrical traditions

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.230
will understand
what I'm discussing.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:03.970
These are theaters of
gesture and of very decisive,

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.223
symbolic representation.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.880
What we would think of as
sort of realistic characters

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.260
or realistic stories
are not a part

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.410
of these very
ancient traditions.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.830
These theatrical traditions
go back hundreds, even

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.170
thousands of years.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.830
So there's a tradition in
Japan of a kind of stylized,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.980
of symbolic representation.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.670
And you'll see, I
think, how in Russia,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:40.040
how powerfully this principle
operates in Rashomon.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:45.200
Even when film itself emerged
in Japan in the silent era,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.150
it emerged in a
slightly different way.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.440
And one of the most interesting
features of silent film

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.870
tradition in Japan was the
appearance of a character who

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.320
has no counterpart
in Western cinema,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.930
a character called a
benshi, B-E-N-S-H-I.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.260
Any of you heard of it?

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.890
None.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.910
Well, he essentially was
a narrator and explainer,

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.600
and he stood next to the movies
in a way and gave explanations.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.670
He said now, we will
introduce the villain.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.060
Now, we will introduce-- he was
like a kind of intermediary,

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.050
a narrator or a
concierge who mediated

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.770
between the audience and the
text, who gave the audience

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.270
information.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.920
Again in one sense,
we might think of it

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.850
as an anti-narrative tradition,
as a tradition in which things

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:35.010
are presented or spoken rather
than literally acted out,

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.540
and certainly one in which
the details of a story

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.650
are less important than
its general outline.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.519
So when we talk
about stylization,

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.060
one of the things
we're talking about

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.960
is an impulse
toward what we might

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.770
think of as generalized argument
instead of specific argument,

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.390
an impulse to have one
moment stand symbolically

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.710
for many other
moments, and what we

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.700
might think of as
a simplification

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:08.350
or a distillation of reality
into certain symbolic moments

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.000
that are thought to be
emblematic in certain ways,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.770
but don't necessarily
have a realistic feel.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.650
And you'll see almost instantly
when this film begins,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.640
there's a kind of prologue.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.860
And then when the film
makes a transition

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.590
into the first sequence that
takes place in the forest,

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.130
you'll begin to see what I mean
when I say that the film seems

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.230
to enter into a kind
of symbolic realm

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:39.620
in which your sense of reality
is in some sense undermined,

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.250
as if you're entering into
a dream or a symbolic space.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:48.340
Kurosawa, talking about
that astonishing sequence

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.540
at the beginning
of Rashomon, said

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.830
that camera's complex
movements and the movements

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.530
of a character
himself-- everything

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.630
is in motion in that
remarkable opening sequence.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.790
Some people have called it the
most visually poetic sequence

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.060
in the history of movies.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.640
Kurosawa called
this moment a moment

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.550
in which the camera was shown
to be penetrating into a space

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.260
where the heart loses its
way, as if you're penetrating

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:25.250
into an ancestral space,
into a space that's

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.280
dreamlike in fundamental ways.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.070
So the very opening
of the film, or almost

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.020
the very opening of
the film establishes

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.956
this kind of complexity.

00:16:35.956 --> 00:16:37.830
I don't want to exactly
call it an ambiguity,

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:42.816
but this complexity about
the nature of the reality

00:16:42.816 --> 00:16:43.690
that you're watching.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.730
And this is even before
the film proceeds

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.130
to present essentially
four different accounts

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.690
of the same event, these
four different accounts

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.710
conflicting with each
other in a variety of ways.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.840
So these abstracting,
or symbolizing,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.570
or stylizing narrative
and dramatic traditions

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.960
lie behind and shape the
movies in Japan, even movies

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.579
like Kurosawa's, which
embrace the camera's freedom

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:15.930
in a way that's much
more characteristic

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.786
of Western directors
than of Eastern ones.

00:17:20.786 --> 00:17:25.000
Ozu, the second of
the two directors

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.510
I've listed on your
outline, is especially

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.020
famous for holding his
camera almost stationary

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.660
for a tremendously long time.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:37.960
And in fact, he's
sometimes called a director

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.180
who tries to create
a zen aesthetic,

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.350
because the camera is so
quiet, and so stationary,

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.540
and relatively inactive.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.400
It's a style that lays
tremendous emphasis

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:56.820
on the nuances of facial
expression and vocal tone.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.950
And both Mizoguchi and
Ozu do, in some sense,

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.450
have an even greater
sense of stylization

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.036
in many of their films
than Kurosawa does.

00:18:06.036 --> 00:18:07.410
But I don't want
to oversimplify,

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.360
because they are also capable of
very great, realistic moments,

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.230
and they have a
moral realism that's

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.560
at least as powerful in their
films as Kurosawa himself.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.900
Kurosawa's career is
a very remarkable one.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.520
And I wish I had time to
talk about it in detail.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.060
Organizational structure
of Japanese cinema

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.110
was not unlike the
structures that

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.950
developed in Western
societies in the United States

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.290
or in France.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:40.140
There were
essentially monopolies

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.700
of not a small number, but
a relatively larger number

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.270
of film production companies
operating at different levels

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.150
of significance.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.050
So they were second
rate, and then they

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.040
were second level and third
level production companies,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.600
as well.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.170
But all of them operated
in a similar way.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.620
The director was a more
dominant than major figure

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.540
in this system, and
surrounding each director

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.470
were a group of workers and
a group of creative people,

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:14.070
including usually performers who
went with a director from film

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.960
to film, as well as
his technical people.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.890
They would often use the same
people to write their music,

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.970
and the same crew to work on the
film-- if they could succeed,

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.440
get the same cinematographer.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:32.230
And Kurosawa's-- so Kurosawa's
group was called the Kurosawa

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:36.350
gumi, G-U-M-I. It means
the group, or cadre.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.290
The Kurosawa group worked
on a series of films.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.840
I don't mean it was
always identical.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.220
There were changes, but
it was a stable group

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:50.700
unified especially by Kurosawa's
vision and supervision.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.960
And I've listed here a few of
his most famous and fundamental

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.420
films besides Rashomon.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.580
Ikiru, maybe his greatest
film, a realistic film

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.080
set in the modern world.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.460
The title means
to live, and it's

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.310
about a man who discovers
that he has only a few months

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.810
to live.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:12.880
And it stars the
actor Takashi Shimura,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.640
who plays the
woodcutter in Rashomon.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.470
The other actor that
you'll see in Rashomon

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.890
that is one of
Kurosawa's favorites

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.810
and appears again and
again in Kurosawa's films

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.520
is the actor Toshiro Mifuni.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.240
Rashomon, he plays the bandit.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.070
You'll see what a
remarkable figure he is.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.220
So I've only listed a
few of his films here,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.250
but among his most
important, Rashomon, Ikiru,

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.970
Seven Samurai--
many people would

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.780
say the greatest of
all samurai movies,

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.770
and probably the greatest
of all Western movies,

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.330
because it puts most
American Westerns to shame.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.770
It's influenced by
American Westerns,

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.180
as Kurosawa himself
acknowledged.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.770
And it was itself, that
film, made in 1954,

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:04.670
remade as an American film some
years later under the title,

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.080
The Magnificent Seven.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.290
And it was so
successful that a sequel

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.730
was made, something like The
Magnificent Seven Return.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.520
And in fact, one of the deep
features of Kurosawa's work

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.530
is that many of
his films have been

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.420
remade by other
directors, both American

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.920
and European directors.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.490
Rashomon was made
14 years later,

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:28.990
remade 14 years later, with
Kurosawa given screenplay

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.750
credit in a film directed
by Martin Ritt in the United

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.120
States called The Outrage.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.470
And it retells the story that's
at the heart of Kurosawa's

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.510
film.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.420
It starred Paul Newman among
others, and Edward G. Robinson,

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.490
among other significant
American actors.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.120
Throne of Blood I mentioned,
because many people see it

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.570
as the most successful of all
adaptations of Shakespeare.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:22:00.110
It's a Japanese kabuki-ized
version of Macbeth starring

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.149
Toshiro Mifune.

00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:02.940
And many people think
of it as the greatest

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.490
of all Shakespearean
adaptations.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.460
Yojimbo is a samurai film,
a much more straightforward

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.730
samurai film in many
ways than Seven Samurai,

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.040
also stars Mifune, and it has
brilliant, brilliant sword

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.110
fight sequences in it that
anticipate the kind of thing

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:24.710
that is now common in Asian
cinema, but much less trivially

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.640
done in Kurosawa's than in
many of these later films that

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.690
merely seem to want to
entertain us by their sword

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.190
play and the physical
grace of their actors,

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.180
but don't connect
nearly so powerfully

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.380
as Kurosawa's films do to a
profound and serious historical

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.280
setting and story.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.940
Yojimbo was also made into an
American movie called Last Man

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.600
Standing, in 1966.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.750
I mentioned Kagemusha, only
because it's a later film,

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.190
and many people
admire it, because it

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.490
shows that Kurosawa was working
effectively, even in old age.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.660
He made another film in
1985, one of his final films

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.890
called Ran, R-A-N, which
is a remake of King Lear.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.820
And these two older films,
later films, Kagamusha and Ran,

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:22.510
show Kurosawa's visual sense,
visual imagination to great

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.380
effect, but they feel
stylized in the way that

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.340
they're-- stylized may
not be the right word.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.970
They feel abstract in a way
that earlier, Kurosawa's films

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:33.470
do not.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.630
They are extraordinary
spectacles,

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.740
but they don't have the
same interest in character,

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.470
the same focus on
character that his earlier

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.750
films, despite their
stylisation, seem to do.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:50.870
I've saved most of my time to
talk about Rashomon itself,

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.160
because it's such a central
and significant film.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:00.900
And I hope when you watch
it, you'll not be impatient,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.350
and especially that
you watch for the ways

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.280
in which from
sequence to sequence,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.510
the visual style alters.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.910
It's a very demanding
film, in that sense.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:17.170
Let's begin by talking a little
bit about the problem of rape

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.810
in cultural stories,
because I think

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.200
that one of the problems with
responding fully to Rashomon

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.770
is that we, especially
in the Western world,

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:35.910
are newly struggling with
notions of gender identity

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:45.080
and of the legacy
of patriarchy that

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.160
put us in a fraught and
complex position in relation

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.880
to stories like
that of this film.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.410
And I want to confront it
right in the beginning.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.160
As some of you may know,
the story of Rashomon

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.160
is the story of a rape.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.240
There are four
different-- a rape occurs

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.560
at the center of
the film, and there

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.180
are four different
accounts of what happened,

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.330
of how the rape occurred.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.830
And the film is
partly a meditation

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:13.070
on what motives do the
different tellers have

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.130
for putting this particular
spin on the story?

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.460
And part of what's subtle and
disturbing about the movie

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.170
is that when the first
testimony is given,

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.090
it's not fully clear
yet to us that we should

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.960
be skeptical of the testimony.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:33.276
And I think the first time-- one
of the people whose testimony

00:25:33.276 --> 00:25:34.650
we heard is the
murderer himself,

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.550
or the rapist himself,
the Mifune character.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.070
He's the first one to testify.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.570
And as he's
testifying, it begins

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:46.456
to dawn on an attentive viewer
that maybe his testimony

00:25:46.456 --> 00:25:48.330
is self-serving in
certain ways, that there's

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.470
certain things he's saying
that maybe we shouldn't fully

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:52.530
accept.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:57.180
And then, when the next account
comes, our sense of skepticism

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.490
is reinforced and fortified.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.420
We begin to worry.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.600
And then the film itself
reminds us of the fact

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.760
that these tales are
problematic, because the film's

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.750
structure is so interesting.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.740
Roughly every 10
minutes or so, I've

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.250
timed most of them-- a
little less than 10 minutes

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.160
in some cases, a little
longer than some--

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.200
you'll have an extended
narrative sequence which

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.580
will last about 10 minutes.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.010
Usually it's the
testimony of one

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:34.050
of the people appearing
before the court.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:39.360
And then after that
happens, the film sort of

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.820
shifts into another mode.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.510
And the way you can tell
is that it shifts back

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.790
to the scene with
which the film opens.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.180
All the way through the
scene, it's marked by this.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.740
The structure of
the film is marked

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:55.240
by this return to a
scene at Rashomon gate,

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.270
which I'll explain in a moment.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.710
So one point that I'm
trying to get to here

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:08.670
is the idea that as
we watched the film

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.640
and we begin to weigh the
accounts that different people

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.920
give of this rape,
many of us are

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.520
likely to feel
uneasy and disturbed,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.090
because one of the things
that disturbs me in the film

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.220
is the woman's
reaction to her rape.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.870
She feels terrible shame.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.220
It's as if she felt--
and there seems

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.720
to be an impulse in the film
that certainly some people have

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.426
certainly gotten there.

00:27:31.426 --> 00:27:32.800
At least they
perceive an impulse

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.690
in the film or an impulse in the
narrative to blame the victim.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.260
In some sense,
what I'm suggesting

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.290
is not that that response
is inappropriate,

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:49.170
but that it's a little bit off
key, off center, because if you

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.230
recall the idea that the
film is deeply stylized,

00:27:52.230 --> 00:28:01.540
and it's set in an ancestral
past, in a medieval Japan,

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:07.320
in a moment of terrible
social breakdown in which

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.080
vestigial or ancestral attitudes
towards sexuality and gender

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.580
are being mobilized or awakened.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.880
And if we understand
it in that way,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.600
we can begin to recognize
that our own discomfort

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.210
with the subject matter is a
discomfort that the film itself

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.300
may even be aware of and
may even be encouraging.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.590
And as you're watching the
film, watch how, in some sense,

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:37.780
especially in one moment
where the victim of rape

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.450
makes an appeal to
her husband right

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.320
after-- there's a
sequence where we

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.580
see her embracing her husband
and looking into his face.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.930
Now the problem is she's
giving this testimony,

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.370
and there's some reason.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.300
It's after the fact,
and there's some reason

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.870
to doubt what she's saying,
especially as the film goes on.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.640
Nonetheless, it's a
moment of great power.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.710
And that moment at least
mobilizes a sympathy

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.930
for the victim of rape.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:10.020
That is very significant,
because you hear so little

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.140
of it elsewhere in the film.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.020
Not that the woman
is treated badly,

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.560
but she's subjected
to the same suspicions

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.280
as the other central characters.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.190
But there's a larger
thing to think about,

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:27.320
a larger way in which we
can accommodate ourselves

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.740
to the slight
discomfort we might feel

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.410
at turning a story of rape
into a philosophic discourse

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.530
as this film does.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.380
And here's how we might do that.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.320
Let me just remind you
that stories about rape

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.720
are at the heart
of many cultures.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.500
How many of you have
heard of the story

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.220
of The Rape of Europa?

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.380
It's a Greek myth.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.260
None of you?

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.720
In many ways, it's the story
of the foundation of Europe.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.960
Zeus disguised as a white
bull, the great Greek god,

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.480
the god of all gods.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.850
One of Zeus's best habits or
the most remarkable habits

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.680
in these mythological
stories is that when

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.520
he gets a yen for
a human female,

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.880
he will disguise himself
as a creature of the earth

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.050
and go down and rape her.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.720
And he does this with Europa.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.240
The rape of Europa is a
kind of symbolic story

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.460
which later Europeans
actually took

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.890
as one of the founding tails of
how Europe itself was founded.

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.910
Can you think of another story
in which Zeus was a rapist?

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.840
How many of you know
the story of Leda

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:38.310
and the Swan, about which Yeats
wrote such beautiful poems?

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.250
Again, Zeus, the god of
gods, disguises himself

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:45.840
as a great spawn and swoops down
on lead of this beautiful woman

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.080
and rapes her in
the guise of a swan.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.410
And there's a brilliant, almost
pornographically powerful poem

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.440
by W. B. Yeats in
which he describes

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.030
this terrible moment of rape.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.960
It's one of the great
poems of the Western world,

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.410
and it's about this rape.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.000
So what I'm reminding you
of is that the misogyny,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.560
that you may sense there
is a misogyny that's

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.840
embedded in culture.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.620
It's a misogyny that's
embedded in all the stories

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.370
that human beings tell,
in many of the stories

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:21.300
that human beings tell
themselves about the world,

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.210
about the relations
of men and women,

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.740
and often, especially about
the foundations of society,

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:36.050
so that this meditation
on human frailty

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:43.170
and human deceit focused on
a rape from that perspective

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.910
is one of many such stories.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.580
Not a unique object at all.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:51.350
And it seems to
me that that's one

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:56.060
of the ways in which we can
recognize that what Kurosawa

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.980
is doing is part of
a long, and complex,

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:06.600
and in many ways, very
disturbing habit of mind

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.000
that many, many cultures share.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.890
The title-- Rashomon.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.430
Western students are
often puzzled by it.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.970
It's a reference to
the name of the gate,

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.547
but the word gate
is complicated too,

00:32:20.547 --> 00:32:22.130
because it's not an
American gate that

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.450
just opens and closes.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.690
It's a great, massive
entrance to the city of Kyoto

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.450
in the southern part of
Japan in the late 11th

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:31.890
or early 12th century.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.460
It's a period of
complete disillusion

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.700
and destructive poverty,
political chaos.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.110
And the broken down
condition of the gate,

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:47.537
which you get long shots of,
you see this massive structure.

00:32:47.537 --> 00:32:49.120
There's a terrible
rainstorm going on,

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.120
under which certain people come
to get shelter from the rain.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.840
And that is Rashomon gate.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.070
And it's broken down
condition symbolizes

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.790
the broken down
condition politically

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:05.670
and socially of the society
that is represented there.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.520
And again and again,
the characters

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.850
gathered beneath the gate
to protect themselves

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.300
from the weather and
gauge in conversation

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.080
about human nature.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.260
Are human beings innately evil?

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.480
Do they always lie?

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.740
Can we never trust them?

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.280
And one of the characters
who carries on this discourse

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.710
is a priest who has an
idealizing tendency, which

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.570
another of the
character's a commoner.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.640
He's called the commoner.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.540
He's an ordinary man is
constantly mocking and arguing

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.160
against.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.720
It's almost a kind
of argument that

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.530
reminds me in some ways of
the argument between spirit

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:46.360
and flesh in
Cervante's Don Quixote,

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.160
in which Sancho
Panza is constantly

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.770
reminding the idealizing
Quixote of the miserable

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.260
actuality of the world.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.200
Look, when you get
stabbed, you bleed.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.940
When you haven't
eaten, you're hungry.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:04.860
The world is real in a way
and miserable in some respects

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.510
in a way that
idealists don't like.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.250
And so that's a kind
of argument that

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:13.060
runs through these interludes
as the film goes on.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.170
So the title refers
to the Rashomon Gate,

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.800
and Rashomon Gate is
itself a massive symbol

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.850
for the breakdown of order for
the miserable circumstances

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.350
that individuals
find themselves in.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:27.731
And one of the things you'll
see is that it's chilly.

00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:28.230
It's cold.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.719
It's raining like mad,
a tremendous torrent,

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:34.179
a downpour incidentally
created partly by fire trucks.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.570
In his autobiography,
Kurosawa talks

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.090
about how difficult
it was to create

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.350
this sense of an
immense ongoing,

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.139
almost a tsunami of
rain, and he talked

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:47.969
about the technical
difficulties of doing so.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:51.500
Very impressive rain, the
most impressive rainstorm

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.480
in the history of
movies, I think.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.030
So these people are gathered
beneath the gate in order

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.040
to protect themselves, and the
gate's symbolic significance

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.950
is important.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:07.740
We will notice that
one of the things they

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.300
do when they get
cold is they go over

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.110
to certain parts
of the building.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:15.820
It's a wooden structure already
half broken down and in decay.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.530
And they'll break off banisters
or other pieces of wood,

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.360
and break them up,
and burn them up.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.540
And the implication is if
things go on like this,

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.300
pretty soon the
whole gate will have

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.060
been consumed by people who have
tried to take shelter under it.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.500
So it's a symbol of the
breakdown of social order

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:39.120
and of the society.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.300
I've already
mentioned the medium.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.280
The Japanese word is miko.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.320
And I mentioned it
here, just because I

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.130
wanted to be sure
all of you understood

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.420
what was going on there.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.750
The husband is dead when
the testimony begins.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:36:02.860
He's a samurai who was the
husband of the rape victim.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.000
And as the story unfolds,
you'll get the basic facts,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.490
but even when the
film is over, there

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.690
are many fundamental things you
won't be able to have decided.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:16.640
And I think that's certainly
part of Kurosawa's point.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:24.720
So the medium is just this
clairvoyant type apparently

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.450
real characters believed in
and socially recognizable

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.510
in late medieval
Japan, a character

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.960
who claims to have
access to the words

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.620
and beliefs of dead people.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.310
So the dead man testifies.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.200
And another way of
reminding you that we're

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.660
looking at a very
stylised, a story that

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.920
isn't in a narrow
sense, realistic at all.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.290
The visual style of
a film is especially

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:54.070
remarkable and
astounding, in some ways.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:59.720
It's almost as if each form of
testimony has its own style.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.390
And you might want to watch the
way in which Kurosawa builds

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:13.970
his eclectic and dynamic way
in which Kurosawa's editing

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:18.980
camerawork use of music
combine to a kind of almost

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.670
constant visual excitement.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.750
One of the most remarkable
things about the film

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:27.090
is how many sequences in it are
without dialogue-- extended,

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:31.450
wordless sequences,
truly entirely cinematic.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.450
The opening sequence--
almost the opening sequence--

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.770
the first extended
sequence in a forest, which

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:41.230
comes after the sort of
introduction, which I've

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:44.170
described earlier,
is a magnificently

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.780
clear example of that process.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.080
And one of the things that you
may notice in that sequence

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.180
especially is the way in
which you become increasingly

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.100
disoriented about the direction
in which the woodcutter is

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.300
going.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.160
He's apparently narrating the
story, and his narration sort

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.276
of segues into a
visual experience,

00:38:04.276 --> 00:38:05.900
as happens again and
again in the film.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.274
And the visual
experience we have

00:38:07.274 --> 00:38:10.270
shows him going into the woods,
walking, and then discovering

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:13.390
first the woman's hat, and
then discovering other things,

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.610
and discovering a body, and
then running away in fear.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:19.390
And as he penetrates
into the woods,

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.470
one of the things that happens
is the camera is always moving.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.850
And the camera becomes as
interested in the forest

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.195
itself, in this
densely wooded forest

00:38:28.195 --> 00:38:30.910
and in the play
of light and dark,

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:35.200
because the sunlight comes
through the wooded canopy

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:42.120
in odd and profoundly
visually powerful ways.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.310
You begin to have a sense
that the camera is at least as

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.580
interested in the woods
and in the play of sunlight

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.400
as it is in the motions
of the woodcutter.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.450
And the whole
sequence has a kind

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.910
of profoundly lyrical,
but also in some degree,

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.910
disorienting sense
that as Kurosawa said,

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:05.840
you're entering a space that's
dreamlike, that's dangerous,

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:10.380
a place where the heart will
lose its way, as if you're

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.950
entering a symbolic space,
not a realistic space--

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:19.600
a stylized space
in some deep way.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.440
And there are a couple
of specific strategies

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:27.940
that Kurosawa uses in the
film to reinforce, I think,

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:33.010
our sense that he's
engaging every element

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:37.480
of his cinematic palate in
order to create his effects.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.970
One thing he does, he violate
certain rules, especially

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:42.470
at the time where
it would have been

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.170
tremendously shocking to
professional directors.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:47.210
One thing he does
in the film was he

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:51.240
points the camera at the sun,
and he creates sun effects.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.110
That was a no-no.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.920
It was a sort of a rule that
directors should never do that.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.180
Kurosawa does it.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.533
And you watch how he does it.

00:39:57.533 --> 00:39:59.420
It's very powerful.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.940
It also has a
disorienting effect,

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.470
the effect of making us
understand more deeply what

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.170
it's like to work our way
through the incredible dense

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:13.350
forest in which
the crime occurs,

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:17.830
as if the forest itself is
a space so complex and so

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:22.800
private, so cut off
from the outer world

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.880
that almost anything
could happen there--

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.280
a space of dream,
a space of terror,

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.130
a space of symbolic fable.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.392
And there are a
couple of other things

00:40:33.392 --> 00:40:35.600
I wanted to mention about
the way his camera behaved.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.880
One is that Kurosawa uses here
a device at certain points

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.080
in the film, a very
interesting device.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.110
The official name for it,
the fancy name for it,

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.130
the technical name for it is he
makes what is called an axial

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:53.030
cut, A-X-I-A-L. It's really
a form of a jump cut--

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:56.980
that is to say, an abrupt edit
which you're not fully prepared

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.580
for.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.950
A jump card, as you
know, breaks the action

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.650
in mid-stride, or in
mid-action, and then jumps

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:08.000
to something else in
a way that's slightly

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.330
disorienting that eliminates.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.070
It's elliptical.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:15.520
It eliminates connection
or transitions.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.020
But the axial cut does
this in a very dramatic way

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.840
that also calls attention to
the apparatus of the movies.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.320
The most dramatic places in
which this occurs in the film

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.930
are certain scenes in which you
see the samurai husband tied

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.820
up, sitting on the
ground, tied up like this,

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:32.980
kneeling on the ground.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.060
And the camera's at
some distance from him

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.910
and moved toward him, but
it doesn't move toward him

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:45.240
in a smooth trucking motion
characteristic of most films.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.190
What it does is
it moves forward,

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.660
and it stops, and then it jumps.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.380
It moves forward.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.122
And what you feel
is it leaps forward.

00:41:52.122 --> 00:41:53.580
And what's happening,
of course, is

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.500
that he stops the
cameras forward movement,

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.422
moves it further, makes a cut.

00:41:58.422 --> 00:41:59.880
So the effect is
the camera moves--

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:04.240
not that the camera's
jerky, but it's

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.000
as if it's speeded
up in some sense.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.530
We can feel that the camera
is becoming elliptical.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.990
So say this fellow in the front
is the person I'm focusing on.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.180
I'll be here.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.770
You'll see this shot.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:20.840
And then you'll see this shot,
and the effect is very abrupt.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.110
Watch how it happens.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.670
One effect, one consequence
of this kind of a shot

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.200
is that watching it, you can
feel how mechanical it is.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.790
You begin to think
to yourself well,

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.164
how could that
have been created?

00:42:32.164 --> 00:42:34.040
You're aware of its
mechanical qualities.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.350
That is to say, you
become partly aware

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.990
of the apparatus behind
the making of the movie.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:41.040
It's a moment of
self-consciousness

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.045
that other elements on
the film also reinforce.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:49.020
So the visual
style is profoundly

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.260
eclectic and dynamic.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.300
I've mentioned the axial code in
pointing the camera at the sun.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.770
Maybe I'll mention
one other device.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:03.180
One of the other technically
intricate, and at the time,

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.990
revolutionary thing
that Kurosawa did was he

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.870
violates what's called
the 180 degree rule.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.800
And the 180 degree
rule essentially

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.260
has to do with your sense
of spatial orientation

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.760
within the frame.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.840
Essentially the 180
degree rule holds

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.920
that if you're showing
characters moving

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.790
in this direction, so you're
showing a character moving

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.910
this way, you won't
suddenly, if you're still

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:28.710
going in the same direction,
show him walking this way,

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.470
because it disorients
the viewer.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:40.200
In our film, in Rashomon,
there are certain moments.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.680
There are hints of it in
that opening sequence,

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.970
that lyrical, first
sequence in the forest

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.070
that I mentioned in which
you can see that the camera's

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:52.290
own movements complicate,
and in some sense,

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.120
confuse our sense of where
the woodcutter is going.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:59.350
And it's in that sequence and
some other places in the film

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.150
as well, where the 180
degree rule is violated.

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:05.852
And the effect again is to
disorient us, is to feel gee,

00:44:05.852 --> 00:44:07.560
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.130
This guy doesn't know
whether he's coming or going.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.930
What kind of a space is he in?

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:15.160
Again, violating certain
conventions of traditional

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.070
filmmaking in order
to create new effect.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:22.460
And the consequence
of these choices,

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.370
the impact of these
choices in 1951,

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.820
when the film won its
prize, was profound.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:35.300
I want to say one other thing,
another aspect of the film's

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.600
structure, which I've
described him perfectly.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.900
And I apologize for being
so tongue tied about it.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.920
But as I tried to
describe earlier,

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.400
the basic structure of the
film becomes fairly clear.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.810
What happens is
you get testimony.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:50.860
Then there are interruptions
in which you-- essentially, all

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.030
four of the primary
pieces of testimony

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.990
takes place in the past.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:00.710
So what we have are flashbacks,
but competing flashbacks.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:05.430
And at various points, the film
returns to our scene of reign

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.060
at Rashomon Gate
in which the people

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.640
under the gate, the three people
under the gate-- two of them

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.230
are actually partial
participants.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:14.950
The third, the
commoner, is just a kind

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.060
of listener to the story,
although a profound commutator

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.070
on it.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:21.600
The Sancho Panza
type who says, look.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.660
The world is miserable.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.930
Why should you believe anyone?

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.900
And the priest is
constantly resisting him.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.230
Well when we return
to these moments--

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:31.890
so we return to Rashomon
Gate several times,

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:32.960
many times in the film.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.610
And every time we return
to that spot, where are we?

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.660
We're in the present
time of the film.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.370
So one of the things
the film does,

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:42.000
it creates what I call
a drama of the telling

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.721
of the story in which the
conversation that's going on

00:45:46.721 --> 00:45:50.080
underneath Rashomon Gate
is a kind of metacommentary

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.410
on the story that
we're watching.

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.330
The characters inside
the film comment on well,

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:56.240
can we believe her?

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.250
Is this credible?

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.590
Why did she say this?

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.510
And the effect of
this metacommentary

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.750
is to create essentially
a separate story.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:04.970
What's the separate story?

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.310
It's a philosophic topic.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.630
The topic is the
telling of stories.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.450
In other words,
this interruption

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:15.980
creates a new kind of moral
and thematic complexity

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.200
in the film, something
that's characteristic

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.730
of the great novels
and fiction works

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.240
I mentioned earlier
in the lecture that

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.350
appeared at the turn
of the 20th century.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:30.000
Not is the principle of
unreliable narration being

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.700
introduced, and the principle
of competing flashbacks being

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.200
introduced, and the principle
of dislocated chronology being

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.450
introduced-- all of those
things are operating.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.230
But what is even more
important about it

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:44.430
is that these moments
of conversation

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.880
amongst those three
characters at Rashomon Gate

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.110
also constitute a kind
of philosophic meditation

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:54.930
on the nature of storytelling
and the nature of truth.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.450
And they actually say oh,
how can you believe a person?

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.580
Or what is truth?

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.240
How can we believe
what anybody says?

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.960
So the film calls
attention not only

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.650
to the profound subjectivity
of human responses

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:11.130
and the profoundly
unreliable nature of memory,

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.910
but also the extent to
which individuals themselves

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:17.320
have reasons developing
from their egos

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.880
to distort and tell
stories that are more

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.590
flattering to themselves
and so that by the time

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.240
we come to the end of the film,
it isn't clear at all, when

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.280
the film is over, whether
there is a truth, whether there

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.390
is any final truth
that we can embrace.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.940
The issues are not
finally resolved.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.970
But what is resolved for us is
the idea that human reality is

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:40.580
immensely complex,
that human beings

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.160
are endlessly deceitful,
that the stories

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.790
they tell about themselves and
others may not be trustworthy.

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.150
So in other words,
the film opens out

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.850
into a kind of
philosophic profundity

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:55.450
that's partly a function
of its structure.

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:59.070
So it's another example, one
of the most remarkable examples

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:02.450
that we've seen in our course,
of what I call organic form,

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:08.700
of a text whose structure helps
us understand what it's about

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.260
and whose structure is
part of what it means,

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.620
whose structure is
essential to its meaning.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.290
We couldn't imagine this
film as a straightforward,

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:17.990
chronological sequence.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:20.640
It wouldn't be able
to do what it does.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.240
So what I mean by the drama
of the telling of the story

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.580
is literally that.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.900
That is to say,
there's a second story,

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.840
a second subject matter
in these interludes--

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.720
let's call them interludes in
these interruptions in which we

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.360
return to the present
time, get out of the past.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.940
And those interludes are an
extended, philosophic, and

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:44.020
moral conversation
about human nature,

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.670
about the nature of
our human capacity

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:53.260
to understand the
world, and our capacity

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.680
to talk about it, to narrate
it accurately and fully.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.440
So this drama of the telling
of the story, this drama

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.560
of the screening, this drama
of the making of the story

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:07.080
is as important a dimension of
the film as its actual story,

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.950
as the actual story
that it wants to tell.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.700
I have two other points to make
about this remarkable film,

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.290
and I'll be done.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.160
The first is that one of the
things I think you'll notice,

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.532
as the story goes on, and
as different people give

00:49:24.532 --> 00:49:25.990
different accounts
of what happened

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:31.300
is that the actual physical
conflict between the two

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:35.840
male characters, which one would
expect to be grand and heroic,

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.880
is almost always
clownish and unheroic.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.160
We expect this great-- he's
a samurai warrior, after all,

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.930
and the man he's
doing battle with

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:49.990
is a very famous or infamous
bandit, criminal-- so

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:53.570
gifted a criminal
that he's famous.

00:49:53.570 --> 00:50:00.320
And one realizes in
retrospect that when

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:06.170
the criminal, the Toshiro Mifune
character, gives his testimony.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:09.630
In the beginning, in the
early part of the film,

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.920
he's exaggerating his
own martial genius.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.370
Although we don't fully
realize that at first,

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.300
but it becomes clearer
and clearer to us

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.080
as the film goes on
that he has a motive

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.640
to exaggerate his heroic
stature, and his strength,

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.510
and so forth.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:26.540
Not to mention, a motive
to exaggerate and maybe

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.890
to lie about the
woman's reaction

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:31.526
to his forced attentions.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:45.490
So all of that is an essential
part of our understanding

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:51.270
of what is at
stake, I guess, when

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:55.630
we think about the
various subject

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:59.120
that Rashomon gestures toward.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:05.549
So the clownish, unheroic
behavior of these fighters

00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:07.090
is something to
note, because there's

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:09.960
a deep skepticism
in the film itself

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.450
about all forms of
human aggrandizement.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:19.520
There's a skepticism that the
film shares with the commoner

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.050
who maybe is too negative
about human nature, who thinks

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.800
human beings are
completely abject,

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.550
and that this is the
justification for the most

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:33.400
selfish kind of behavior,
because no one can behave well.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.529
I have hardly
exhausted the film,

00:51:35.529 --> 00:51:37.070
but I hope I've said
some things that

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:40.220
will be valuable and useful
to you on your first viewing.

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:43.830
But let me end by talking about
the ending, because the ending

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:47.250
of Rashomon presents us with a
problem similar to the problem

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:51.690
that we confronted in a film
like The Last Laugh, Der Letzte

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:54.400
Mann, in which there
seems to be a kind

00:51:54.400 --> 00:52:01.020
of optimistic or reassuring
ending to this film.

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.710
The film has been
very dark and rainy.

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:04.220
And in fact, one
of the ways you can

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.380
tell that the film
has changed registers

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.480
is that the rain
finally disappears.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.590
Well as you're watching
the ending, which

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:15.940
is quite explicit, even heavy
handed about its attempt

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.680
to return us to a sort of
more hopeful view of mankind,

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.610
you should ask yourself, does
it deserve to be deleted?

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.920
All through the '40s,
when Kurosawa was first

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.190
learning his trade, he began
to direct early in the '40s.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:35.710
And this film in 1950 is
his first real masterwork.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:37.910
He's become more and more
confident and ambitious

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:40.280
as a director
during this period,

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:44.500
but he hadn't displayed his
full capacities as a director

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:49.640
until this point, most
accounts of his career suggest.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.020
But during this
period, in the 1940s,

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.870
Kurosawa took up
part of himself what

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.140
he regarded as a
social project, which

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.720
was to try to help renovate
Japan after the devastations

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.840
of the war.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.510
And his films of the
'40s almost always

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:10.900
try to suggest various
forms various ways

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:14.740
in which people could behave
decently and heroically--

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:18.430
if not heroically, at
least decently in an effort

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:21.770
to renovate and
reconstitute a damaged

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:23.540
society, a broken society.

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:29.270
One of the reasons that the
breakdown of ancient Japan

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:33.370
is so powerful in
Rashomon, no question,

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:37.200
is that Kurosawa and his cast
believed that in some sense,

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.330
there was a symbolic analogy
to be made between conditions

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:46.150
in Japan, actual Japan in
the 1940s and early '50s,

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:49.730
and the broken, terrifying
conditions of society

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:55.520
in the 11th and 12th
centuries in the past parable

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.530
that the narrative
is telling us.

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:01.780
And this film continues
that tradition.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:05.870
But I think many, many
viewers, I among them,

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:09.840
have the feeling that this
is more wish fulfillment

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.270
on Kurosawa's part than reality.

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.650
And one could say from an
artistic standpoint then,

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:17.210
one might conclude that
it's a weakness in the film.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:19.900
I think I might say
that the film might

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.230
be more powerful, more
truthful to itself,

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:28.990
that the ending that's tacked
on may undermine its deepest

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:31.510
energies in disturbing ways.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:38.930
So it's another example in
which commercial and social

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:43.970
imperatives may be interfering
with the artistic integrity

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:45.370
of the text.

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:48.720
But it's significant,
important to understand

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.450
that this was a tendency that
was present in Kurosawa's

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:53.760
work all the way
through the '40s,

00:54:53.760 --> 00:55:00.910
and that therefore, it's a kind
of expression of a moral sense

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:04.390
that the director
had that begins

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:08.480
to become less powerful
after Rashomon,

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.370
although he remains a
deeply moral director.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:13.190
So the ending is a
question, and you

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:18.490
might want to ask yourself
how you would respond

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:22.770
to the question of the relevance
of the ending to the rest

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:26.020
to the rest of the film.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:30.820
Let me end with a reminder about
maybe what is, in some ways,

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:34.910
the most powerful
aspect of what happens

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:36.700
when you're watching Rashomon.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.200
I've said that you
feel that you've

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:43.570
entered into if not a dream,
into a kind of uniquely

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:45.600
stylized space in
which what happens

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.730
resembles what
happens in real life,

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:52.360
but also distills what
happens in real life,

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:56.080
highlights it in a way that
isn't true of actuality.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:01.830
And I think you feel
this mythic tendency

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.540
all the way through the film.

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:13.820
In a certain sense, one way
of capturing what I'm saying

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.480
is to say that
there is a tension

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.230
in the film between this
impulse to be mythic,

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:20.190
to tell a story
that it understands

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:24.040
to have a fable-like
significance and its sense

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.070
of the complexity and
concreteness of actuality.

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:31.650
That is to say, so there's this
wonderful, constant tension

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:35.640
in the film between the
enormous persuasiveness

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.481
of the individual
images that you see.

00:56:38.481 --> 00:56:40.480
But you sense also that
you're in a world that's

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.960
not totally real.

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:45.010
So the tension I'm trying
to get you to feel,

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:46.900
you can feel it in the dialogue.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.650
But especially you can feel
it in the visual images,

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:51.640
in the visual
texture of the film.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.990
You can feel a kind of
tension between an impulse

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:56.290
to mythologize,
and to fable-ize,

00:56:56.290 --> 00:57:00.190
and an impulse to show the
world in its deepest and most

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:05.220
concrete elements, in its
most authentic actuality.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:08.080
And the tension between the
two-- gee, this is so real.

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.730
Gee, this is so unreal.

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.420
This is so fable-like, is part
of the secret of the movie.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:17.650
And one way you can feel it
with an immensely intense power

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.870
is sometimes when you
see the way the film

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:22.830
deals with human flesh,
there are certain scenes,

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:26.650
for example, where a woman's
hand will be on a man's body--

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:30.850
talk about how you can be
erotic without offending anyone.

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.100
There's a moment where you
can see the woman's fingers

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.720
pressing into the man's flesh.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:40.240
It's an immensely erotic and
powerfully concretizing moment.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.860
It reminds you of flesh.

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:46.210
It reminds you of film's
power to capture actuality

00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:50.120
with a vividness that goes far
beyond what words can ever do,

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.550
the visual power of movie.

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:53.630
And that's what I mean
when I say that there's

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:57.910
this constant tension in the
film between the mythologizing

00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:01.570
tendencies of the story, and
of Kurosawa's imagination,

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:04.250
and what we might call
the breaking tendency,

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:11.080
the concretizing tendency
of the film medium,

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.850
which has this
capacity to register

00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:17.800
the gross, concrete
reality of our experiences

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.410
with a detail and a power
that no other medium can.

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:24.020
Now this sense of tension
between a story that

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.770
wants to be a fable and a story
that wants to persuade you

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:30.060
of its concrete
reality is part of what

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:35.920
makes the film so memorable
and so significant.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.190
LORNA GIBSON: All right,
so I guess I should start.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.430
So I think last time we
were talking about cell

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520
structure and cell geometry.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.180
And I got as far as
putting this image here up.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.520
And I talked a little
bit about how this works.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.430
And I was going to go
over it again and then

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.290
write the notes down today.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.410
So we'll start from there.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.743
So we're going to do a little
bit more on cell structure

00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:48.390
today.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810
We're going to talk about
some topological laws

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.160
for cellular materials
for polyhedral cells.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.940
And then we'll start talking
about modeling honeycomb

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.830
materials, and talk
about how we look

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.550
at the mechanical
properties of honeycombs.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.830
So I think where we
left off last time was

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.310
we started talking about
mean intercept length.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.210
So the idea is that
with-- hello, hello--

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.260
if you have a honeycomb, it's
fairly easy to define the cell

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.890
shape in terms of the ratio
of the cell edge lengths,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.490
h over l, and the angle
that the inclined cell

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.360
wall is to the vertical one.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.470
But for a foam it's a
little more difficult.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.720
And what people do is they
measure this mean intercept

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.220
length.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.870
So last time I talked
about it briefly.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.910
So the idea is you take an
image of the structure you're

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.310
interested in.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.060
You sort of draw out the
outline of a planar surface.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.400
And then you put on
that a test circle.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.770
And you superimpose on the
test circle equidistant

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.710
parallel lines.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.610
So say we start off
at theta equals 0.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.840
We then count how many
times the cell walls

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.020
intercept those lines.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.490
And we get a number of
cells per unit length.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.890
And that gives us an intercept
length for that orientation.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.680
Then we rotate it
around a little bit,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.900
say 5 degrees or something.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.740
And we measure a new intercept
length for that orientation.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.590
And we keep doing it all
the way around, 180 degrees.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.780
And then you get--
then what you do

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.170
is you plot those points-- if I
can find my little pointer-- we

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.020
plot those points.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.350
And it will form an ellipse.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.160
And the major and minor
axes of the ellipse

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.290
correspond to the principal
dimensions of the cells

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.480
on that plane.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.000
And then you can do the same
for perpendicular planes

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.140
and form an ellipsoid.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.920
And you can get the three
principal dimensions.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.630
You can also get the
orientation of the cells

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.890
by getting the orientation
of this ellipse,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.750
or the ellipsoid in
three dimensions.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.900
So let me just write down
some notes that kind of

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.870
summarize all of that.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.070
So I'm going to say that for
foams, we characterize the cell

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.940
shape and orientation by using
these mean intercepts-- mean

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.862
intercept lengths.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.595
So we consider a circular
test area on a plane section.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.305
So you want to use a
circle and not say,

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:34.305
a square or a rectangle.

00:03:34.305 --> 00:03:35.520
Because if you
had a square, then

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.311
you'd have different
total lengths of line,

00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:39.360
depending on what
orientation you took it.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.510
So you want to use a
circular test section.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.420
And then you draw
equidistant parallel lines.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.780
So for example you might
start at theta equals to 0.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.480
And then you count the number
of intercepts of the cell walls

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.260
with the lines.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.600
So if we say that Nc
is the number of cells

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:39.260
per unit length of line, then
we can get the intercept length

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.490
for that orientation.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.950
Say for theta equals to
0, it works out to 1.5/Nc.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.957
So it's not just 1/Nc,
because you may not

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.540
be cutting the cell--
you know, you're

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.620
cutting the cell-- say you've
got a three dimensional

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.360
cell like this.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.520
You're cutting it at
different places along here.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.980
So people have worked out
the stereology of that.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.710
And there's a constant that's
1.5 that fits into there.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.920
So then you just
repeat that process

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.606
for different
increments of theta.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:25.430
So you increment theta
by some amount, something

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.076
like say, 5 degrees.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:28.700
And then you repeat
that whole process.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.920
And then you plot
a polar diagram

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.980
of the intercept
lengths versus theta.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.680
And you then fit an
ellipse to the points.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.750
And if you did it in 3D,
you'd have an ellipsoid.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.100
And then the principal
axes of the ellipsoid

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.193
are the principal
dimensions of the cells.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.220
And the orientation
of the ellipsoid

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.020
is the orientation of the cells.

00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:45.460
Hello.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.903
And you can write the
equation of the ellipsoid.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.400
So it would be something
like Ax1 squared plus B

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:25.950
x2 squared plus Cx3 squared plus
2Dx1x2 plus 2Ex1x3 plus 2Fx2x3.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.171
And that would all equal 1.

00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:33.212
And you can write those
coefficients as a matrix.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.000
And if you do that, the
first three, A, B, C,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.860
are the diagonals, and D,
E, F are the off diagonals.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.090
And you can also represent
this is a tensor.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.045
And if you do, it's
called the fabric tensor.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.000
So the fabric-- I think they
use that term for other types

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.250
of materials-- it says
something about the orientation

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.270
of the material.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.830
And if you have
this matrix here,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:39.330
if D, E, and F are all
of 0, then A, B, and C

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.516
are the principal
dimensions of the cell.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:55.620
So if all non-diagonal
elements are 0,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.980
then A, B, and C are the
principal dimensions.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.960
Are we good with how this works?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.954
So it's kind of a crank
and churn kind of thing.

00:09:19.954 --> 00:09:21.620
But it gives you a
way of characterizing

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.440
the cell shape and
the orientation

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.925
of the cells in the foams.

00:09:50.334 --> 00:09:52.000
So the next thing I
wanted to talk about

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.810
was the connectivity
of the cells.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.190
So imagine we have
an array of cells.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.760
And if we have an
array we have vertices

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.400
that are connected by edges.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.220
And edges surround faces.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.730
And the faces enclose the cells.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.450
And there's something called
the edge connectivity, which

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.840
is usually given the symbol Ze.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.051
And that's the number of
edges that meet at a vertex.

00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:15.300
And there's a face connectivity,
and that's the number

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.290
of faces that meet at an edge.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.610
And it's very common
for honeycombs

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.710
to be three connected.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.850
So Ze is 3.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.870
And it's common for foams
to be four connected.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.410
And there's some
topological laws

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.618
that are kind of interesting.

00:10:28.618 --> 00:10:32.540
And so we'll get into those
after this bit on connectivity.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.800
So for the connectivity
we have vertices,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:49.750
which are connected by
edges, which surround

00:10:49.750 --> 00:11:00.780
faces, which enclose cells.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.400
So we're going to talk about the
vertices, the edges, the faces,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.130
and the cells.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.470
So the edge connectivity,
Ze, is the number

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.030
of edges that meet at a vertex.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:48.060
And for a honeycomb, say a
hexagonal honeycomb, Ze is 3.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.689
So I have a little
honeycomb here.

00:11:49.689 --> 00:11:51.980
If we look at the number of
edges, there's three edges,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.060
connect at a vertex.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.790
So Ze is 3.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:00.920
And for a foam, Ze
is typically four.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.230
So I'll just say typically here.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:13.750
And if I go back, if you
look at the sketches here

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.770
of the rhombic dodecahedra
and the tetrakaidecadedra,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.970
if you look at the
tetrakaidecadedra,

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.470
you can see the number of edges.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.590
So here's one edge.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.160
Here's another one here.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.202
There's another one here.

00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:26.409
And there's another one here.

00:12:26.409 --> 00:12:28.860
So that's the four edges that
are meeting at that vertex

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.420
there.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.940
So if you look at
arrays of cells,

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.670
you can convince yourself that
Ze is typically 4 for a foam.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:44.864
And then we also have the
face connectivity, Zf.

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:47.030
And that's the number of
faces that meet at an edge.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.925
And that's typically
three for foams.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.280
And so again if you
look at these pictures

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:23.110
you can sort of see how the
face connectivity is three.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.350
So if you look at this bottom
one here, there's faces here.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.725
And then there's another face--
well, let's see if we can--

00:13:31.725 --> 00:13:35.210
it's kind of hard to show.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.210
If you look at this one
here, there's this cell.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.950
There's that face there.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.180
And then there's another
one coming out of the page,

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.450
I think.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.040
OK.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.998
So that's connectivity.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.195
And the next thing are some
of these topological laws.

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:16.920
So the first one I'm
going to talk about

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.410
is called Euler's law.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.850
If you remember Euler
from buckling, same guy.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.980
So Euler's law relates the
number of vertices and faces

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.410
and cells and edges for
a large array of cells.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:41.790
So we can relate the
total number of edges,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:52.940
so I'm going to call that
E, vertices V, faces F,

00:14:52.940 --> 00:15:00.710
and cells C. That
total number is

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.290
related by Euler's law for
a large aggregate of cells.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.380
So in 2D Euler's law is
that the total number

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.020
of faces minus the
number of edges

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.943
plus the number of
vertices is equal to 1.

00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:38.160
And in 3D, you just add a minus
the number of cells in front.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.040
So minus the number of
cells, plus the number

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.130
of faces, minus the
number of edges,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.710
plus the number of
vertices is equal to 1.

00:15:56.764 --> 00:15:58.180
So there's some
interesting things

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:04.080
you can figure out
using Euler's law.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.000
And one of the things
I wanted to look at

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.980
was if we had an
irregular honeycomb that

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.220
was three connected.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.160
So say we have a
honeycomb that's not just

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.430
a regular hexagonal honeycomb,
or not even one that's

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.460
got repeating hexagonal cells.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.990
But say we had a honeycomb
where some of the cells

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:26.500
had 5 sides to them, some of
them had 7, some of them had 6.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.750
You can ask, what's the average
number of sides per face?

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.340
And you can use Euler's
law to figure that out.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.900
So we're going to look at
an irregular three connected

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.180
honeycomb.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.840
Let's see, I can
start that up here.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.440
So when I say
irregular, I mean we've

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.710
got cells with different
numbers of sides.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.969
So we have an irregular-- oops.

00:17:05.969 --> 00:17:07.094
You OK, Greg?

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.700
--that is three connected.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.426
And what is the average
number of sides per face?

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.290
And I'm going to
call that n bar.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.300
So we're told that
it's three connected.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.760
So that's saying that the
edge connectivity is 3.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.720
So there's three edges
coming to each vertex.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.560
So imagine that you had just
a regular hexagonal honeycomb,

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.870
like this.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.050
Here's our vertex here.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.030
And there's our kind of three
edges that come into it.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.530
And each vertex is going to
have half of each edge, right?

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.410
Because the next
vertex-- each edge

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:15.130
is shared between two vertices.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:20.770
So if Ze is equal to 3, then
the number of edges per vertex

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.199
is 3/2.

00:18:22.199 --> 00:18:24.240
Because each edge is shared
between two vertices.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.310
And I'm also going to define
something I'm going to call Fn.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.692
And Fn is going to be the
number of faces with n sides.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.000
So I could have some number
of the cells have six sides,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.650
some number have five sides,
some number have seven sides.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.320
So these are-- Fn is
the number of faces

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.190
with some particular
number of sides, n.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.610
So if we have Fn is the
number of faces with n sides,

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:19.690
then if I sum up n times
Fn and divide it by 2,

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.400
that's the number of edges.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.100
So imagine I have
all these faces.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.980
I take n times Fn.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.100
So say we had four
five-sided faces.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.340
That would be four of those.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.820
There's be 20 edges associated
with that, 20 sides.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.556
Then I have some
number of six-sided,

00:19:37.556 --> 00:19:38.680
some number of seven-sided.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.730
I add them all up.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.350
And I have to divide by 2
to get the number of edges,

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.367
because each edge
separates two faces.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.490
OK.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.960
And then I can use Euler's law.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:13.980
So I can say F minus E
plus V is going to equal 1.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:19.720
And here I've got an F minus
E plus-- I can put V here.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:26.470
V's going to be 2/3 of
E. So I've got that.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:35.050
So that's the same as F
minus 1/3 of E is equal to 1,

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.080
like that.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.960
And then for E I can
substitute this thing here in.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:48.870
So that gives me F minus 1/3
of the sum of n times Fn over 2

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.290
is equal to 1.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.680
And then what I'm going to do
is multiply everything by 6

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.010
so I can get rid of
my denominator here.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:02.150
So 6F minus sum of
nFn is going to be 6.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.230
And then I'm going to
divide that through by F.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:14.710
So that's 6 minus sum of
nFn over F is equal to 6/F.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.530
And then if I let F go to
a large number-- so say

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.270
I've got a large
aggregate of cell.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.780
I've got lots of faces.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.060
I'm going to let F become large.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.650
So if F becomes large, then
6/F is going to tend to 0.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.890
Let me get the other rubber.

00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:41.600
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.944
LORNA GIBSON: Mhm?

00:21:42.944 --> 00:21:46.501
AUDIENCE: That's-- F is like
the total number of faces,

00:21:46.501 --> 00:21:48.610
not the total number
of faces per cell.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.490
LORNA GIBSON: F is the
total number of faces.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.360
And Fn is the number
of faces with n sides.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.949
We've got some number with
5 sides, some number with 6,

00:21:55.949 --> 00:21:56.740
some number with 7.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.940
So we're almost at the end here.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.860
So 6/F goes to 0.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:15.280
And so that says that the
sum of n times Fn over F

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.970
is equal to 6.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.640
And that just is n bar.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.970
That is the average
number of sides per face.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.250
This is your-- kind
of your total number

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.190
of sides in the whole thing.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.500
And you're dividing by
the total number of faces.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.550
So that is the average
number of sides per face.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.460
So what this is
saying is if you have

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.280
a three connected honeycomb,
the average number

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.770
of sides per face is always 6.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.300
So that if you introduce
a cell with 5 sides,

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.480
somewhere you have to
introduce a cell with 7 sides,

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.605
so that they compensate
and you come back out to 6.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.440
And I have a little
soap bubble picture here

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.460
that kind of illustrates that.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.142
So here we have
a soap honeycomb.

00:23:25.142 --> 00:23:27.100
So you can make these
just by putting two glass

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.460
sheets close together
with a soap bubble froth

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.590
in between them.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.810
And you can kind of see
in this picture here,

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:38.570
they've numbered how many sides
each cell or each face has.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.150
So here's one with
5, here's one with 7.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.531
And I'm not going to add
these up all together.

00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:45.530
But you can kind of see
that the 5's and the 7's

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.946
kind of compensate
for each other,

00:23:46.946 --> 00:23:49.650
and that the average
works out to about 6.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.292
And this is true for a
large aggregate of cells.

00:23:52.292 --> 00:23:53.750
So if you only have
a few, it's not

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:54.640
going to work out perfectly.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.764
You need to have a large
aggregate to have it work.

00:23:56.764 --> 00:23:57.820
Yeah?

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.892
AUDIENCE: And that
5, 7 balance doesn't

00:23:59.892 --> 00:24:02.290
have to be touching, right?

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.430
LORNA GIBSON: No,
no, no, overall.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.000
Yeah, overall.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.910
And, you know, you could
have one with 4 sides,

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.190
and you'd need two 7's
or one 8 or something.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.470
But you'd need to have that
balance out and match up.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.170
OK.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.380
So that's the Euler law.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.400
Now there's a couple more
of these kinds of things.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.910
There's something called
the Aboav-Weaire law.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.736
And so the Aboav-Weaire is
sort of related to the Euler

00:24:41.736 --> 00:24:43.110
because it's
looking at this idea

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.690
that if you have a three
connected honeycomb, if you

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.590
introduce a 5-sided cell,
you have to introduce

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.980
a 7-sided cell to compensate.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.000
And what Aboav noticed
was that generally

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.530
cells with more
sides than average

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.535
have neighbors with
fewer sides than average.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.456
Let's see.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:27.380
So we'll say the introduction
of a 5-sided cell

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.290
requires the introduction
of a 7-sided cell.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.280
And I'll just put-- this is
all for a 3 connected net, a 3

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.175
connected honeycomb.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:53.310
So that generally, cells
with more sides than average

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.310
have neighbors with
fewer sides than average.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.140
And in 3D, you could say the
same thing about the faces.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.630
The cells that have more faces
than average have neighbors

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.690
with fewer faces than average.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.280
So Aboav made
observations of this.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.940
And it was Dennis Weaire
who made a proof of it.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.270
And the equation that
they came up with

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:14.400
relates the average number of
sides in the cell surrounding

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.980
a candidate cell.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.230
Let's see-- are we going to
be able to put it in here?

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.150
Maybe.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:29.670
So say you have a candidate
cell and say it has n sides.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.740
So you look at one particular
cell and you say, count up,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.540
it's got n sides around it.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.870
And then you count up the
number of sides of all the cells

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:38.820
surrounding it.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.490
It has n neighbors
because it has n sides,

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:46.500
so then the average number
of sides of the n neighbors

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.795
is called m bar.

00:27:48.795 --> 00:27:50.392
It has n sides.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:28:13.520
So then the average number
of sides of its n neighbors

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.490
is m bar.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:25.940
And m bar is equal to 5 plus
6 over n for a 2D honeycomb

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.950
kind of cell structure.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.110
OK, so that's the
Aboav-Weaire law.

00:28:36.146 --> 00:28:37.895
And then there's one
more of these things.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.915
The last one is
called Lewis' rule.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.000
And Lewis looked at biological
cells and 2D cell patterns,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.110
and he found that
the area of the cell

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.730
varied linearly with
the number of the sides.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.580
And he found just an
empirical relationship.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.341
It looks like this.

00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:20.090
We can say what
everything is in a minute.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.730
So he found that the area of a
cell with n sides, that's A n,

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.040
was linearly related
to the number of sides,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.280
so this n over here, and
naught's just a constant

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:39.620
and A n bar is the area of the
cell with the average number

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.220
of sides.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:56.253
So here, A n is the area of
cells with n sides and A n bar.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.470
And then n naught
is just a constant.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.450
And he found that for 2D
cells n naught was equal to 2.

00:31:22.805 --> 00:31:24.430
And if you look at
voronoi honeycombs--

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.430
remember last time we
talked about those voronoi

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.370
honeycombs-- you
can show that this

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.860
holds for voronoi honeycombs.

00:31:57.362 --> 00:32:02.210
And then you could write a
3D version of this as well.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.860
And in 3D, it's the volume
and faces instead of the areas

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.330
and the number of sides.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:11.210
So you can say that the
volume of the cells with f

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:14.010
faces relative to the
volumes of the cells

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:16.070
with the average
number of faces,

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:20.000
they vary linearly with
the number of faces.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.677
So there's sort of an exactly
analogous expression here.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.790
And here, this f naught
is another constant.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.320
And in 3D it's about equal to 3.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.190
So these are all just kind of
interesting topological rules

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.070
that are nice to know about.

00:33:00.306 --> 00:33:00.805
OK.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:16.696
Yeah?

00:33:16.696 --> 00:33:17.770
AUDIENCE: Basic question.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.752
In two dimensions,
what is a face?

00:33:20.752 --> 00:33:21.990
Like what does that refer to?

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.770
LORNA GIBSON: So-- and let me
put my little slides again.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:35.570
So say we have some
honeycombs like this, then

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.570
say we look at this guy.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.764
So that's a vertex
there, that's an edge,

00:33:39.764 --> 00:33:41.680
and this thing in the
middle here is the face.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.690
So in 2D, the face and the
cell is kind of the same thing.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.310
All right?

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.810
And then--

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.602
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] sides,
what's different with the edge?

00:33:49.602 --> 00:33:50.810
LORNA GIBSON: It's not quite.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.060
Like if I count up
the number of edges,

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.230
I say one, two,
three, four, five,

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.310
and I count those up like that.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.540
But if I say sides of the
face-- see that's a face

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.060
or it's a cell-- I would
say that had six sides.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.320
Right?

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.690
So typically when people
say it has-- a cell

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.840
or a face has so many sides,
they count up how many

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.130
all around it.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.406
But because each side
is-- or each edge

00:34:15.406 --> 00:34:17.489
is-- shared between two
faces, the number of edges

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.440
is actually half that.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.040
Right?

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.275
Because there's one edge, but if
I count up the number of sides

00:34:25.275 --> 00:34:27.900
for this face and I count up the
number of sides for that face,

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.760
I'm counting that twice.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.250
So it's a little bit--
so I try to see edges

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.070
when I'm talking about
adding them all up

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:38.070
and I try to say sides
when I'm talking about,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.610
here's a face, how many
sides does it have.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:41.110
OK?

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.276
It's a little bit confusing.

00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:44.960
Anybody else?

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:51.361
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what is n bar naught?

00:34:51.361 --> 00:34:53.610
LORNA GIBSON: n bar naught,
did I put an n bar naught?

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.709
Oh, that's where I
didn't erase this enough.

00:34:56.709 --> 00:34:57.250
There you go.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.210
It's just n naught.

00:35:01.926 --> 00:35:02.425
OK.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.470
So we've been talking
about the structure

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.530
of the honeycombs in the foams.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:27.990
And what we
ultimately want to do

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.984
is be able to model
the mechanical behavior

00:35:29.984 --> 00:35:31.900
or the thermal behavior,
some sort of behavior

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.660
of the cellular material.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.420
And for looking at
mechanical behavior,

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.150
there's three main
approaches that people take.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.700
So you have to model
the structure somehow.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.076
So there's three
main approaches.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.503
And the first one is
to use the unit cell.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:59.300
So say, for example,
for the honeycombs,

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.380
if you have a hexagonal
honeycomb you'd just

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.260
use that unit hexagonal cell.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.990
And that's what we're going
to do probably starting later

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.722
on today.

00:36:10.722 --> 00:36:12.930
So for the hexagonal honeycomb,
it's kind of obvious.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:16.070
You would use a unit cell,
the thing's periodic,

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:20.290
you figure out how that unit
cell behaves, you're all set.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:24.490
For a foam, it was not so
obvious a unit cell to use.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:26.560
But the thing-- people
use different things,

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.060
but one of the common ones they
use is a tetrakaidecahedron.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.000
So the nice thing about
the tetrakaidecahedron

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.980
is that it packs to fill space.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.690
So it's a repeating single cell.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.320
Packs to fill space.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.190
But, in fact, real foams
aren't tetrakaidecahedrons,

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.880
so this is a bit
of an idealization.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:52.580
So we'll just say foam cells
are not tetrakaidecahedrons.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:09.070
OK, so that's one approach.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.270
And then a second approach
is to use something

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.530
called dimensional analysis.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.050
So in dimensional
analysis, what you

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.730
want to do here,
with this technique,

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.830
is model the mechanisms
of deformation and failure

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:28.420
in the structure.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.220
But you don't necessarily
represent the cell geometry

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.290
exactly.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.630
And so what you do
is, you say one thing

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.060
is proportional to
another and there's

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.870
some constant of
proportionality,

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:41.820
and you just wrap all of those
constants of proportionality up

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.020
at the end.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.900
So for instance, when
people look at foams,

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.470
the geometry of the foams
is kind of complicated.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.090
There's cells with
different number of faces,

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.880
there's different sizes of
cells, it's kind of a mess.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.540
So we could just say
the geometry is complex

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.800
and it's difficult to model.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:13.130
And with dimensional
analysis, instead what we do

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.840
is we model the deformation
mechanisms and failure

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.190
mechanisms.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:22.700
And you can get quite a bit
out of just modeling those.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.594
So when we look at modeling
foams, we're going to do this,

00:38:49.594 --> 00:38:50.760
and you'll see how it works.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.350
And then the third method is
to use finite element analysis.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.800
So this is a numerical
technique and it's a very

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.570
standard numerical technique.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.270
And one of the nice
things about this

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.064
is you can apply it
to random structures.

00:39:35.064 --> 00:39:36.730
So for example, those
voronoi structures

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.400
we saw, if you want
to try to see--

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.190
say you had a certain
amount of material

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.140
and you had a honeycomb that was
a regular hexagonal honeycomb.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.100
You had the same
amount of material

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.120
and you put it in a
voronoi honeycomb,

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.140
and you want to know how does
having a random material affect

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.800
the properties relative
to the uniform material?

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.350
You could figure that out
using finite element analysis.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.058
So you can apply it
to random structures.

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.820
And another thing you can do
with finite element analysis--

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.560
and people in the
orthopedics end of the world

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.610
often do this-- if you're
interested in trabecular bone,

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.720
that porous type of bone I
showed you the first day,

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.400
people can take micro-computed
tomography images of trabecular

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.520
bone and they get a file which
basically says, every voxel,

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.560
says if it's solid or it's void.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.870
And you can use
those files as input

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.910
to a finite element analysis.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.910
And so you can analyze exactly
how a piece of a trabecular

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.520
bone would deform.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.580
So it's nice for that.

00:41:12.164 --> 00:41:14.330
So one of the things we're
going to talk about later

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.610
is we'll look at the
structure of trabecular bone

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.630
and the sort of mechanics
of trabecular bone,

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.510
and I'll show you some results
that a former student of mine

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.690
did, where we look
at-- say you have

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:27.730
a sort of intact structure
of a certain density

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.460
and then you reduce the density
by fitting the cell walls

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.890
or you reduce the density by
removing cell walls-- because

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:36.140
in osteoporosis sometimes the
walls resorb all together--

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.890
and you can see what
residual strength you

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.630
would have for some given
amount of density loss.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.690
So it's good for looking
at that kind of a thing.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.735
You can also use it for
looking at local effects.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:53.707
So you can look at
defects, for instance.

00:41:53.707 --> 00:41:55.290
So if you think of
the trabecular bone

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.802
as having missing
trabeculae, that

00:41:57.802 --> 00:41:59.260
would be a defect
in the structure.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.710
You can look at that.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:02.230
You can look at size effects.

00:42:06.905 --> 00:42:09.740
So when we were studying some of
those metal foams, some of them

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.910
have very large
cells, and if you

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.390
have a small sample
relative to the cell size,

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.870
you may only have four or five
cells across the dimension.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.360
Where you've cut
the cells, you've

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.000
got edges that are
less constrained

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.704
than in the bulk of the material
because at the outer edge

00:42:23.704 --> 00:42:24.370
you've cut them.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.030
They're not connected
to anything else.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:29.300
And so you can look at edge
effects that relate to the size

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.712
effects in foams as well.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.030
So these are basically
the three approaches

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.462
that people use for
modeling cellular materials.

00:42:58.462 --> 00:42:59.920
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.700
going to start with
looking at honeycombs

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.660
and we're going to look at these
hexagonal kind of honeycombs

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.870
like this.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.210
And one reason to
start with them

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.400
is that they have this
unit cell structure.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.440
And if you can analyze how that
unit cell deforms and fails,

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.770
you can say something
about the whole structure.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.830
And it turns out
that the honeycombs,

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.960
they deform and fail by the
same mechanisms as the foams.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.680
So if you can understand
through this simple structure,

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.370
it gives you a lot of insight
into how the foams behave.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.644
So if I deform this a little
bit, the cell walls bend.

00:43:30.644 --> 00:43:33.060
And you can show that if you
deform this guy a little bit,

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.430
the cell walls bend.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.000
And so you can learn a lot
by looking at the honeycombs

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.435
and then sort of applying
that to the foams.

00:43:39.435 --> 00:43:41.060
So we're going to
start off-- so that's

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.740
the end of the section
on sort of the structure

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.920
of the cellular
materials-- and now we're

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.617
going to look at modeling
the mechanical properties

00:43:48.617 --> 00:43:50.450
and we're going to start
with the honeycombs

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.210
and then we're
going to do foams.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:56.450
So when we talk
about the honeycombs,

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.080
we've got this
hexagonal structure here

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.700
and we're going
to call properties

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.090
in this plane the
in-plane property.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.130
So if I load it this
way on or that way on,

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.940
those are in-plane, and
if I load it that way on,

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.050
those are out of plane.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.060
So think of the cells
are in the plane

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.520
and the prismatic direction
is the out of plane.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.290
And clearly, the
honeycombs are going

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.150
to have similar properties
this way and that way,

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.900
but they are going to have very
different properties that way.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.024
So we're going to start
with the in-plane behavior.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:54.380
So the honeycombs have
these prismatic cells

00:44:54.380 --> 00:45:04.590
and they're widely available in
different materials, polymers,

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:05.860
metals, ceramics.

00:45:15.226 --> 00:45:17.280
And they're used in a
variety of applications.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.540
So one of the most common is
to use them in sandwich panels.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.410
So I brought a couple of
sandwich panels with me today.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.340
So here's a couple
of sandwich panels

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.560
that have honeycomb cores.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.550
This one's an aircraft
flooring panel.

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:38.870
It's got carbon fiber faces and
a Nomex core, honeycomb core.

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:41.000
And this is an
aluminum honeycomb.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.860
It's got aluminum honeycomb
core and then aluminum faces,

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.020
and it's kind of amazing how
stiff that little panel is.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.840
And each of the pieces is
really not that stiff at all,

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:51.670
but the thing put
together is quite stiff,

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.630
and we'll talk more about that
when we get to sandwich panels.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.047
So it's used in sandwich panels.

00:45:57.047 --> 00:45:58.505
They're used for
energy absorption.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.170
So sometimes you'll see there's
some natural disaster area

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:09.930
and they fly in
helicopters and they

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.977
drop big crates of
supplies, and they

00:46:13.977 --> 00:46:16.060
will have it like a pallet
with a big crate thing.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:19.450
Often they have a honeycomb,
like a metal honeycomb, that

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:20.930
is kind of oriented this way.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:24.174
So the pallet would be like this
and the honeycomb's like that.

00:46:24.174 --> 00:46:25.840
And the idea is that
when they drop it--

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.150
they sort of bring it down
as close as they can--

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.340
and then the
honeycomb absorbs some

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.300
of the energy from the impact.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.977
And they're also used, I think,
sometimes in car bumpers.

00:46:36.977 --> 00:46:38.560
So they're used for
energy absorption.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.374
And they're used as
carriers for catalysts.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.400
So the catalytic
converter in your car

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.840
looks like this, this is
kind of the material that's

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.400
used in the catalytic
converter in your car.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.610
And the way that works is, the
cell walls here are actually

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.680
porous and they're coated
in the platinum, which

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.980
is the catalyst, and
half of the cells

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.250
are blocked off on this end.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.440
So every other cell on
this end is blocked off

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:12.280
and then every other cell
over here, the opposite ones,

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.300
are blocked off.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.320
And so the gas is
forced down a channel

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.830
but then through the wall and
then out the next channel.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:21.450
And that's where the
reaction actually occurs,

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:22.970
is in the cell wall.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.440
So they're used
as carriers there.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:33.160
And some natural materials
also have a cellular structure,

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.285
have a honeycomb structure.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.380
So for example, things
like woods and cork

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.232
have a honeycomb structure, too.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:48:00.760
So I said the mechanisms
of deformation and failure

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.060
in the hexagonal honeycombs
parallel those in foams.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.980
So we can learn
a lot about foams

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.790
by understanding the honeycombs.

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:34.460
And then, similarly,
the mechanisms

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:43.540
of deformation and failure
in triangulated honeycombs

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:46.268
parallel those in the
lattice materials.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:53.200
Remember I brought those
lattice materials in?

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.550
The sort of trust
type materials.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.450
The triangular honeycombs
have a behavior

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:01.030
similar to those
lattice materials.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.700
OK.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.470
So let me scoot over here.

00:49:30.371 --> 00:49:30.870
OK.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.910
So let me scoot out of this one.

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.030
OK.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.130
So here is our kind
of hexagonal geometry.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:06.000
This is kind of an
idealized geometry here.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.120
And, as we talked about in
this section on the structure,

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.900
we're going to call
these vertical walls,

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.840
we're going to say
they have a length h,

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.094
the inclined walls have a length
l, the wall thickness is t,

00:50:17.094 --> 00:50:19.760
and there's going to be an angle
between the horizontal and that

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.110
inclined wall of theta.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:24.370
And I'm going to
define three axes here,

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:28.130
an x1, an x2, and an x3 axis.

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:32.900
So the x1, x2 plane is
the in-plane and x3 is out

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:33.630
of plane.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:34.130
OK?

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.750
So if we load our
honeycomb up, we

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.250
get stress strain curves
that look like this.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.690
So the ones on the left
here, over here these three

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:47.250
are all in compression,
and the ones on the right,

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:48.810
these three are all in tension.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:52.490
OK, so let's talk about
the compression ones first.

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:54.630
And let's start at the top.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.870
This is in elastomeric
material, so

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.720
like one of these
rubber honeycombs.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.870
This would be a material
that yields plastically,

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:02.850
so like an aluminum honeycomb.

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:06.240
And this would be a honeycomb
that fails in a brittle manner,

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.860
like one of those
ceramic honeycombs.

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.510
OK?

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.290
So if we go up to
the elastomeric one,

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:15.770
up here, if I compress it I get
a linear elastic part first,

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:18.630
and then at some point,
I get a stress plateau

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.430
where the stress is almost
constant for strains

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:22.940
that are quite large.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.160
And then finally,
the stress starts

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.800
to rise quite sharply
at the end here.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.610
So the strain here
goes from 0 to 1.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:32.150
So that's a strain of 100%.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.930
You've completely
flattened the thing there.

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:36.400
So that's a large strain.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:40.150
So initially, when we're
loading it up to smaller strains

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:44.210
like this, we've got linear
elastic behavior and these cell

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:45.510
walls bend.

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:47.617
And you can relate
the modulus here--

00:51:47.617 --> 00:51:49.200
let's see where'd
my little arrow go--

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.200
you can relate this Young's
modulus here to the bending

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.420
of those cell walls.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.350
And we're going
to-- I don't know

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.180
if we'll finished that today--
but we'll start that today.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.986
Then-- oops, lost my
arrow, where'd my arrow

00:52:00.986 --> 00:52:04.060
go-- then at the
stress plateau here,

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.470
that plateau is related
to collapse of the cells.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:09.610
So if I have my little
rubber honeycomb

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.160
and I load it, at some
point, the cell walls buckle.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.810
So you see how
they've buckled there?

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:17.100
And that stress plateau,
I can smush that

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.170
to quite large strains that
are roughly constant stress.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:20.920
OK?

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:26.449
So what's happening here is
that we're buckling the cells.

00:52:26.449 --> 00:52:28.490
And as we go along here,
the buckling deformation

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:29.910
gets bigger and bigger.

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:34.270
And then if I smush it and
I've got it kind of like that,

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:36.470
at some point it becomes
much harder to press it

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:38.740
together again because the
cell walls are now touching

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.980
each other and they're
pressing against themselves,

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.563
and to get a certain
amount of strain,

00:52:42.563 --> 00:52:44.720
it gets much more
difficult to do that.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.340
And the stress required to
do that gets much bigger.

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.350
And that's what leads to this
last piece of the stress strain

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:53.650
curve here, which is called
densification because you've

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:55.060
almost eliminated the pores.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.780
It's hard to eliminate
them entirely

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.780
but the porosity
has gone way down

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.480
by the time you're up there.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.560
So this type of
stress strain curve

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.570
where you've got linear
elasticity and then

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:07.880
a stress plateau and
then the densification

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:12.000
is classic for compressive
behavior of cellular materials.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.740
So elastomeric ones will
have a plateau that's

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.220
related to elastic buckling.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.630
I lost my arrow again.

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:18.960
There we go.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.000
If we had a metal
honeycomb, we'd

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.560
again have linear elasticity
related to cell wall bending.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.280
This plateau here
would be related

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.850
to yielding of the cell walls.

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:29.320
So say we had
aluminum honeycomb,

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.810
the aluminum could yield,
and that would again

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:33.330
cause this stress plateau.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:35.230
And then we get densification.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:38.030
If I had a brittle honeycomb
like the ceramic one,

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:40.076
we'd have initial
linear elasticity.

00:53:40.076 --> 00:53:41.700
Then you've got a
stress plateau that's

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.690
kind of a lot of
up and down here.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:47.650
And the serrated nature
is related to the fracture

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:49.154
of individual cell walls.

00:53:49.154 --> 00:53:51.570
So it goes up and down because
when you break a cell wall,

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:54.900
the stress drops off, and then
the other cell walls will try

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.520
to pick the stress up again.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.550
And so each one of those
little up and downs

00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:00.849
corresponds to
breaking a cell wall.

00:54:00.849 --> 00:54:02.640
But if you kind of took
an average of that,

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.220
you can see there's
a stress plateau

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.300
and then there's the
densification region.

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.740
So in compression, the shape
of the curves is very similar

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.660
and the mechanism of the
plateau varies a little bit.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:17.322
So let's see if I can
write some of that down.

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:25.785
So in compression, we can say we
have three regimes of behavior.

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:37.785
So we've got the linear
elastic regime initially

00:54:37.785 --> 00:54:40.243
and we're going to see that's
related to cell wall bending.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.030
Oh, thanks.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:46.661
And then we've got
a stress plateau.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.840
And for elastomeric
materials, that's

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.500
caused by buckling of the walls.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:01.170
For metals, it would
be caused by yielding.

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:04.435
And for ceramics, it would be
caused by a brittle crushing.

00:55:10.286 --> 00:55:11.661
And then we've
got densification.

00:55:21.844 --> 00:55:23.760
And that's related to
the cell walls touching.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.960
And if we increase the ratio of
the thickness of the cell walls

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.950
relative to their
length, we're going

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:46.680
to increase the
stiffness, so the Young's

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.570
modulus of the honeycomb.

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:52.540
The stress plateau I'm
going to call sigma star.

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.410
And we decrease
the strain at which

00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:59.290
that densification occurs, which
I'm going to call epsilon D.

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:02.590
So you see over on the right
hand side of these plots

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:05.515
here, that strain there is the
densification strain, epsilon

00:56:05.515 --> 00:56:28.110
D. So that's in compression.

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:32.400
And these materials are very
often loaded in compression.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:38.190
In tension, we still get
linear elasticity initially.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:39.940
And that's going to,
again, be related

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.350
to the bending of
the cell walls.

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:50.530
But if we look at
the stress plateau,

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:53.770
if you look at these three
curves here on the right,

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:56.920
the stress plateau only exists
if the material has a yield

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.400
point and you get some
plastic yielding there.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.710
If you have an elastomer,
if I pull on this--

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:03.840
you don't get
buckling in tension,

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.500
so you're not going to get
a stress plateau in tension.

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.170
And for a brittle
material like one

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:10.910
of those brittle honeycombs, if
you pull that in tension, you

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.076
would just get a crack
propagate and the thing would

00:57:13.076 --> 00:57:15.770
break into two pieces and so
you don't get a stress plateau

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:17.020
there.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.460
So the stress plateau
in tension only

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.640
exists if the material yields.

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:41.230
So you don't get any
buckling in tension.

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.600
And for a brittle honeycomb,
you would just get fracture.

00:57:55.625 --> 00:57:56.125
OK?

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:04.150
These inclined walls
are going to bend.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.510
We're going to see that in
more gory detail in one minute.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.290
If you can wait one minute.

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:10.780
OK.

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.930
So are we good with a
stress strain curves yet?

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:14.842
AUDIENCE: More of an
abstract question,

00:58:14.842 --> 00:58:23.490
but is it possible [INAUDIBLE]
to get collapse this way

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:25.334
before the plateau?

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:30.960
LORNA GIBSON: I
haven't seen that.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.810
But maybe it it's
possible, I don't know.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.390
I don't think so, but maybe.

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.741
Anybody else?

00:58:37.741 --> 00:58:38.240
OK.

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:45.180
OK, so here's some
photographs of honeycombs.

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.330
So these ones are white but
these ones are just the same.

00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:51.190
So most of them are just a
regular hexagonal honeycomb

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:54.680
and one of them is this
funny shaped honeycomb here.

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.640
These two guys at the top,
these two here, are unloaded.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.720
And then the rest of
them have some loading.

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.677
So if you look at this
one down here-- so here

00:59:02.677 --> 00:59:04.510
I'm taking the honeycomb
and I'm loading it.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:07.240
This is the x1
direction, that way on.

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.520
And if you look
very carefully, you

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.720
can see what happens is
these vertical walls just

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.720
move sideways and
that is going to zoot,

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.920
with the sound effects.

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.510
And then the-- I can't
help making sound effects--

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:23.310
and then these guys here bend.

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:25.750
OK, so this guy here--
it's maybe a little hard

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:27.460
to see it on the image
but it's actually

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.320
a little bit bent there.

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.840
So that's loading
it this way on.

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:35.580
And then similarly, if I take
it and I load it that way on,

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.710
that's the x2 direction.

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:39.770
And now these guys
here, the vertical guys,

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:41.430
are just going to
compress a little.

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:43.150
But these guys here,
the incline guys,

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:44.730
are still going to
bend a little bit.

00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:46.300
And I've got some
schematics that's

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.161
going to show that
a little bit better.

00:59:48.161 --> 00:59:50.410
And then if I shear it, if
I took it like this and I--

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.868
I can't do it because my hands
aren't glued to the rubber--

00:59:52.868 --> 00:59:56.050
but if I could sort of
shear it this way on,

00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:59.230
then you would get this
kind of deformation here

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:00.590
and that also involves bending.

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.131
You can imagine
these guys here would

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:04.810
bend if I do that to them.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:07.560
And then the buckling
deformation looks like this.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.140
If I scooch that like
that, it should look kind

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.030
of like that picture there.

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.697
OK?

01:00:14.697 --> 01:00:16.530
So that's kind of what
the deformation looks

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.200
like for these
sorts of honeycombs.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.510
So these were elastomer rubbers.

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.130
These are just some images
from an aluminum honeycomb.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:26.620
So here's, the top one's
the undeformed honeycomb,

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.710
the middle one's loading
it in the one direction

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:30.600
from left to right,
and the bottom one's

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.100
loading it in the two direction
from top and bottom like that.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:34.740
OK?

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:39.470
So you can imagine that
you've got little cell walls.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:42.810
If you load it up high enough,
those walls are going to yield

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:45.840
and we're going to see that
the yielding in the walls

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.400
causes the formation
of something

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.900
called plastic hinges
and the walls can rotate

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.670
and they can produce
these kind of shapes.

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:53.530
OK.

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:57.090
So then this is sort of a
schematic stress strain curve

01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:57.870
here.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:00.120
And this is showing what
happens if you increase

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.959
the thickness of the walls
relative to the length,

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.500
or you increase the
relative density,

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.600
you increase the volume
per action of solids.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.040
And this kind of shows
the different regimes.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.730
So over here-- well
let's, first of all,

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:12.480
start with the different
relative density.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.840
So this one here is the
lowest relative density,

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.240
then this is higher,
and higher, and higher.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.950
And not too surprisingly,
the more you

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:20.860
increase the density,
the more material

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:23.580
you've got, the stiffer it is,
the stronger it's going to be.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.180
And the more
material you've got,

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.720
the sooner it's
going to densify.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.724
If you've got more
solid in here,

01:01:28.724 --> 01:01:30.390
you're going to reach
that densification

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.510
strain at a smaller number.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:36.550
OK, so the shape of the
curves looks like this.

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:38.830
And you can define these
three kind of regimes.

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.010
So everything in here
is linear elastic,

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.880
everything in this
big sort of envelope

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.470
here is the plateau region,
and everything up here

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:47.910
is this densification region.

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:51.230
So this is just a bigger
picture kind of plot.

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:55.560
OK, so let me skip
through all of that.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.830
All right.

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:00.110
OK, where are we?

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:01.200
Chalk?

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:01.980
Here we go.

01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:56.210
OK, so I think I mentioned
this before, but let

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:58.080
me just go over it again.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.340
So there's three
types of things that

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.110
affect the properties,
the mechanical properties,

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:04.269
of the honeycombs.

01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:05.810
And probably the
most important thing

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:07.518
is the relative density
of the honeycomb.

01:03:09.804 --> 01:03:11.970
So remember, we said this
was the same as the volume

01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:16.560
fraction of solids, and
for a hexagonal honeycomb,

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.210
you can show that's equal to
the thickness to length ratio

01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:27.970
times h over l plus 2 divided
by 2 cos theta times h over l

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.130
plus sin theta.

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:39.150
And if you have regular
hexagons, so h over l

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:43.650
is equal to 1, all the
sides are of equal length,

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:48.740
theta is equal to 30
degrees, the relevant density

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:55.640
is 2 over 3 times t over l.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.390
So it just goes
linearly with t over l.

01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:01.720
The thickness to length
ratio of the walls.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.570
So it depends on how
much solid you've got.

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:05.130
Depends on the solid properties.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.240
So the Young's modulus of
the solid, yield strength

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.680
if it's a metal, some
sort of fracture strength

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.360
if it's brittle.

01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:32.280
It also depends on
the cell geometry,

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:38.760
which we can describe
with h over l and theta.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:53.800
So if we think of a cell here--
that's our edge length h,

01:04:53.800 --> 01:05:00.160
that's our edge length l,
that's our angle theta,

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.570
here's the cell
wall thickness t,

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:06.360
and then we've got some set
of solid properties here.

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:11.700
OK?

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.940
So that's kind of the set up.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:18.140
And we're going to define
x1, x2 axes like that.

01:05:52.554 --> 01:05:54.470
And we're going to make
a few assumptions just

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:56.320
to make life a
little bit simpler.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.230
So we're going to assume
that t over l is small,

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:03.685
so that also means the
relative density is small.

01:06:03.685 --> 01:06:05.060
And what that
means is that we're

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.100
going to be able to neglect
axial and shear deformations.

01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:18.550
So you can imagine,
if I have a thin wall

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:21.160
and I'm applying loads that
produce moments and produce

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.010
bending, if the wall
is very thin then

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:26.910
the axial and the
shear deformations

01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:28.720
are going to be small.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.670
I'm also going to assume
the deformations are small.

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:37.200
And what that means
is that I'm going

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.217
to neglect any changes in
the geometry of the cell

01:06:40.217 --> 01:06:41.175
during the deformation.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.197
And I'm going to assume that the
cell wall is linear, elastic,

01:06:55.197 --> 01:06:55.780
and isotropic.

01:07:20.302 --> 01:07:22.010
And we're going to
start off with looking

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.370
at in-plane behavior,
and we're going

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:27.670
to start with the
elastic moduli.

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:30.930
And if we look at
the elastic moduli,

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:33.160
we're going to be talking
about Hooke's law.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.470
And Hooke's law and the elastic
behavior of the material

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:39.330
can be described by a
set of elastic constants.

01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:43.280
And if you recall, the number of
independent elastic constants,

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.760
how many constants you need
to describe the material,

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.530
depends on its symmetry.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.740
And these materials
are orthotropic.

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:52.550
So the regular
hexagonal honeycomb

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:54.480
is actually
transversely isotropic,

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.686
but imagine that h
was not equal to l,

01:07:56.686 --> 01:07:58.870
then it would be orthotropic.

01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:01.100
So remember, orthotropic
means that you

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:05.830
can rotate the structure 180
degrees about three mutually

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:08.170
perpendicular axes and the
structure looks the same.

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:10.396
So if I take this and I do
that, it looks the same,

01:08:10.396 --> 01:08:12.770
and if I do that, it looks
the same, if I-- no matter how

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:16.359
I rotate this, about three
mutually perpendicular axes,

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.399
the structure remains unchanged.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:19.446
So it's orthotropic.

01:09:38.847 --> 01:09:40.430
So I'm going to write
down Hooke's law

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:44.180
for our orthotropic
material, and then we'll

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.740
talk about the constants
that we're going to work out.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.677
OK, so this is Hooke's law
for our orthotropic material.

01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:26.190
And let me just remind you
what our notation is here.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.768
So epsilon 1 is epsilon 1 1.

01:11:38.768 --> 01:11:42.576
Epsilon 2 is epsilon 2 2.

01:11:42.576 --> 01:11:46.020
Epsilon 3 is epsilon 3 3.

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:50.245
Epsilon 4 is gamma 2 3.

01:11:50.245 --> 01:11:53.670
Epsilon 5 is gamma 1 3.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.300
And epsilon 6 is gamma 1 2.

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.710
So these are the normal strains
here, epsilon 1, 2, and 3,

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:03.010
and these are the shear strains
here, epsilon 4, 5, and 6.

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:05.690
And you remember this convention
where the subscripts add up

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:06.210
to 9.

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:09.880
So 4 plus 2 plus 3 is
9, 5 plus 1 plus 3 is

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:12.800
9, 6 plus 1 plus 2 is 9.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.654
And then the stresses
are a similar thing.

01:12:22.616 --> 01:12:26.560
So sigma 1, sigma 2, and sigma
3 are the normal stresses.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:32.720
And then sigma 4, sigma 5, and
sigma 6 are the shear stresses.

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:47.045
And for the in-plane
moduli, so we're

01:12:47.045 --> 01:12:49.300
dealing with the x1,
x2 plane, there's

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.320
four independent
elastic constants.

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:12.420
So we could think of it as
E1, E2, a Poisson's ratio 1 2

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:16.390
and a shear modulus
in the 1 2 plane.

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:17.440
OK?

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.560
And the compliance
matrix is symmetric,

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.494
so there's the reciprocal
relationship between the moduli

01:13:22.494 --> 01:13:23.535
and the Poisson's ratios.

01:13:56.550 --> 01:14:07.770
And then the notation I'm going
to use for Poisson's ratio,

01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:10.310
I'm going to say
that mu i j is minus

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:13.810
the ratio of the strain
in the j direction divided

01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:17.201
by the strain in
the i direction.

01:14:17.201 --> 01:14:17.700
OK.

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:22.800
So what we're
going to do next is

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.180
we're going to calculate
some of the elastic moduli.

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:29.560
I'm going to show you the
derivation for E1 star

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.514
and mu 1 2 star, and you can get
the other two in a similar way.

01:14:33.514 --> 01:14:34.930
So I'm not going
to do all of them

01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:37.780
but next time we'll do the
derivations for the Young's

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.700
modulus in the Poisson's ratio.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.400
OK?

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.840
And then we're going to
talk about the out of plane

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.620
direction later and we'll get
the moduli for the out of plane

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.790
direction as well.

01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:48.770
OK?

01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:51.460
So I think I'm going to
stop there for today.

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:55.070
And then we'll start doing
the derivations next time.

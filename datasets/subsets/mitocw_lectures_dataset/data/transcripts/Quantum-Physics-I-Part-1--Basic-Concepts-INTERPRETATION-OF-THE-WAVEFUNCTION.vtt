00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.958
PROFESSOR: interpretation
of the wave function.

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:06.313
--pretation--

00:00:09.652 --> 00:00:12.989
the wave function.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.130
So you should look at
what the inventor said.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.200
So what did Schrodinger say?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.180
Schrodinger thought
that psi represents

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.804
particles that disintegrate.

00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:33.845
You have a wave function.

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:37.690
And the wave function is
spread all over space,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.450
so the particle has
disintegrated completely.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.470
And wherever you find more psi,
more of the particle is there.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.030
That was his interpretation.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.500
Then came Max Born.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.970
He said, that doesn't
look right to me.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.970
If I have a particle, but I
solve the Schrodinger equation.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.209
Everybody started solving
the Schrodinger equation.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:10.130
So they solved it for a particle
that hits a Coulomb potential.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.560
And they find that the
wave function falls off

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.888
like 1 over r.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.010
OK, the wave function
falls off like 2 over r.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.840
So is the particle
disintegrating?

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.310
And if you measure, you get
a little bit of the particle

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.610
here?

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.500
No.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.810
Max Born said, we've
done this experiment.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.990
The particle chooses
some way to go.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.740
And it goes one way,
and when you measure,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.120
you get the full particle.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.940
The particle never
disintegrates.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.090
So Schrodinger hated
what Max Born said.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.790
Einstein hated it.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.140
But never mind.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.220
Max Born was right.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.220
Max Born said, it
represents probabilities.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.810
And why did they hate it?

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.420
Because suddenly you
lose determinism.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.580
You can just talk
about probability.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.600
So that was sort of funny.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.650
And in fact, neither
Einstein nor Schrodinger

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.210
ever reconciled themselves
with the probabilistic

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.110
interpretation.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.630
They never quite liked it.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.110
It's probably said that
the whole Schrodinger cat

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.600
experiment was a
way of Schrodinger

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.240
to try to say how ridiculous the
probability interpretation was.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.340
Of course, it's not ridiculous.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.040
It's right.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.170
And the important
thing is summarized,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.860
I think, with one sentence here.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.790
I'll write it.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:49.450
Psi of x and t does not tell
how much of the particle--

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.650
is at x at time t.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.372
But rather--

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.926
what is the probability--

00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:11.320
probability--

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.833
--bility--

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.268
to find it--

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.930
at x at time t.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.970
So in one sentence,
the first clause

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.960
is what Schrodinger
said, and it's not that.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.840
It's not what fraction
of the particle you get,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.510
how much of the
particle you get.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.000
It's the probability of getting.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.370
But that requires--

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.270
a little more precision.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.440
Because if a particle
can be anywhere,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.400
the probability of being at one
point, typically, will be 0.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.090
It's a continuous
probability distribution.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.520
So the way we think of this
is we say, we have a point x.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.355
Around that point x, we
construct a little cube.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.180
d cube x.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.320
And the probability--
probability dp,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.100
the little probability to find
the particle at xt in the cube,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.925
within the cube--

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.048
the cube--

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:43.010
is equal to the value of the
wave function at that point.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.172
Norm squared times
the volume d cube x.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.130
So that's the probability
to find the particle

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.750
at that little cube.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.100
You must find the square
of the wave function

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.340
and multiply by the
little element of volume.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.860
So that gives you the
probability distribution.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.270
And that's, really, what
the interpretation means.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.510
So it better be, if you
have a single particle--

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.580
particle, it better be that
the integral all over space--

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:34.790
all over space-- of psi
squared of x and t squared

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.260
must be equal to 1.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.790
Because that particle
must be found somewhere.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.080
And the sum of the probabilities
to be found everywhere

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.190
must add up to 1.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.730
So it better be
that this is true.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.370
And this poses a
set of difficulties

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.440
that we have to explore.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.500
Because you wrote the
Schrodinger equation.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.350
And this Schrodinger
equation tells you

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.050
how psi evolve in time.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.930
Now, a point I want to emphasize
is that the Schrodinger

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.280
equation says, suppose
you know the wave function

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.750
all over space.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.790
You know it's here
at some time t0.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.910
The Schrodinger equation
implies that that determines

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.800
the wave function for any time.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.870
Why?

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.620
Because if you know the
wave function throughout x,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.560
you can calculate
the right hand side

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.930
of this equation for any x.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.980
And then you know how
psi changes in time.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.280
And therefore, you can
integrate with your computer

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.050
the differential equation
and find the wave function

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.310
at a later time all over space,
and then at a later time.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.120
So knowing the wave
function at one time

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.265
determines the wave
function at all times.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.110
So we could run into a
big problem, which is--

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.390
suppose your wave
function at some time t0

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.400
satisfies this at
the initial time.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.211
Well, you cannot force the wave
function to satisfy it at any

00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:24.710
time.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.380
Because the wave function now
is determined by the Schrodinger

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.640
equation.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.640
So you have the possibility that
you normalize the wave function

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.290
well.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.570
It makes sense at some time.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.630
But the Schrodinger equation
later, by time evolution,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.130
gives you another
thing that doesn't

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.200
satisfy this for all times.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.730
So what we will have
to understand next time

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.690
is how the Schrodinger
equation does the right thing

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.350
and manages to make
this consistent.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.700
If it's a probability at
some time, at a later time

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.510
it will still be a
probability distribution.

WEBVTT

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:15.380
PROFESSOR: Since z, that's
straight up.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:23.150
And that is going to provide
for you a cell that has the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.380
shape of a square prism.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.960
This would be a1.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.360
This would be a2.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.330
And this would be a3--

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.960
I'm sorry, this would be c.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820
And if you took the choice for
the third translation as 1/2

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:48.050
half of a1 plus 1/2 of a2 plus
some amount z up above the

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.340
base of the cell, and then
redefined a T3 prime that

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.590
would be equal to--

00:00:57.936 --> 00:00:58.390
sorry.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.640
What am I doing here?

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:03.830
Yeah.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.300
This is right.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.760
1/2 of a1 1/2 of a2,
and z straight up.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:18.200
Define a T3 prime as 2T3
minus a1 minus a2.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.510
And that will define for you,
again, a cell in the shape of

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.420
a square prism with a1 and a2.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.620
And now the translation that
went up directly over the

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.940
center of the base
of the net below.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.890
Twice that minus a2 minus a1
brings you back to a third

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.740
translation T3 prime that's
normal to the base.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.890
So both cells have
the same shape.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.790
This is a primitive.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.180
This is a body-centered
tetragonal lattice.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.540
And the symbol that's used to
represent the body-centered

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.620
lattice is I. One of the few
cases, again, where one has to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.150
be bilingual.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.860
The German word for
body-centered is

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.110
innenzentriert.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.620
So there's Schoenflies
at work again.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.600
So primitive body-centered
represented by I.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.040
And that brings us to one final
case, and that is the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.933
plane groups that have
a hexagonal shape.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:42.690
And here we have a funny
situation in that the same

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.070
choices of the third translation
do not work for

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.075
all of the plane groups.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.610
If you have a base
to the cell--

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.690
and again, the two edges
of that net are

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.340
identical by symmetry--

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.820
if it has a three-fold axis in
it and nothing else, than

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.020
there are two choices.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:27.520
You can either have T3 be equal
to 0a1 plus 0a2 and an

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.860
amount z straight up.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:46.130
And that will give you a cell
that is a primitive cell.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.650
This would be a1.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.570
This would be a2.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.040
And just as we did for
tetragonal, we'd call the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.080
third axis c, This will work
for a three-fold axis.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.630
So there is a space group P3.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.970
This will also work for all
of the other groups.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.280
So there's P3M1 and a P31M.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.490
And a P6 will work.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.530
And a P6mm will work.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.340
So look it here.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.490
We've got five additional space
groups in addition to

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.200
the lattice type.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.430
This is the primitive
hexagonal lattice.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.930
For a three-fold axis, we
have another choice.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.420
We could pick T3 so that it
took the origin three-fold

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.200
axis and put it directly
over this one.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.060
Looks as though you could have
a different distinct lattice

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.230
if you move the origin lattice
point over the three-fold axis

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.450
that sits at a location
1/3, 2/3.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.680
This one is at 2/3, 1/3.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.930
Let me demonstrate, I think
convincingly and clearly, that

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.600
those two choices are exactly
the same thing.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.380
And the way that I can show that
is, once again, to draw

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.180
this net a1, a2.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.730
And suppose I pick the part of
the offset of T3 that is

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.190
within the plane of the net as
going from this lattice point

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.364
to this one here.

00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:40.410
Then if I go twice that
translation T3, that's gonna

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.270
put me directly over this
three-fold axis.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.460
And if I go three translations
T3, I'll be directly over the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.430
lattice point on the
ground floor.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.030
So putting the original lattice
point over this

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.760
three-fold axis or this
three-fold axis is exactly the

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.650
same thing.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.500
And I can change one into the
other just by flipping this

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.120
thing 180 degrees.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.090
So it's obviously
the same choice.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.760
This description of T3, if I
define the direction of c now

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:25.040
as 3T3 defined in this fashion,
minus a1 minus a2, is

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.860
gonna be a funny situation.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.220
It's gonna be a peculiar sort of
double body-centered cell.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.230
Of course, along the long
diagonal of the hexagonal

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.810
cell, I'll have one lattice
point that's 1/3 of the way

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.510
along that long diagonal, and
another interior lattice point

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.405
that's 2/3 of the way along
that long diagonal.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.340
OK.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:06.680
This double body-centered cell,
so to speak, actually

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.860
can be redefined in terms of
a primitive cell, not a

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.900
primitive cell that is this
particular description of a

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.170
primitive hexagonal lattice.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.420
This is not a primitive
hexagonal lattice.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.060
But suppose I go from this
interior lattice point along

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.370
the long diagonal of the
cell to this location

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.660
and call that a1.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.590
Remember that there is a
three-fold axis sneaking down

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.410
through the center of this
triangle, goes through the

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.190
lattice point, and comes
out the center of

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.440
the triangle below.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.070
If I go up to this lattice point
and up to this lattice

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.440
point, I have three translations
that are

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.270
straddling the three-fold
axis.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.880
And that three-fold axis rotates
one into the other.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.150
So this new definition of
a cell that is in fact

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.050
primitive a1, a2--

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.445
and they're all equivalent
by symmetry.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.620
I always get in trouble when
I try to draw it, but that

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.070
actually defines a cell
with a shape that

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.580
we've not seen before.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.420
That is a cell that has the
shape of a rhombohedron.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:31.200
And as I say, I always get in
trouble when I try to draw it.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.520
It's got three translations
like this and three

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.380
translations skewed by 60
degree sitting on top.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.720
Everybody can see that's a
rhombohedron, can't you?

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.370
Say yes.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.530
Be nice.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.890
So this is another primitive
cell that's a choice for this

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.160
triple cell.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.060
And this consequently gives
its name to this lattice.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.680
This is called a rhombohedral
lattice, regardless of whether

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.220
you pick the primitive cell in
the shape of the rhombohedron

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.110
or this peculiar double
body-centered cell.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.230
So this is a rhombohedral
lattice.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.350
And this is represented in a
space group symbol by the

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.950
letter R, standing
for rhombohedral.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.870
So just the three-fold axis
with this choice of

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.200
translations, that would
be space group R3.

00:09:22.132 --> 00:09:23.382
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:26.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.360
a1 like this. a2 like this. a3,
I'm taking a right-handed

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.150
system, comes from the centered
lattice point.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.950
So let me draw it
in projection.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.770
It's easier to see.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.320
Here's the outline of
the hexagonal net.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.410
Here's the three-fold axis.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.366
And I've taken a1 coming
up like this.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:52.130
I've taken a2 coming up out
of the board like this.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:56.402
And I've taken a3 coming
out like this.

00:09:56.402 --> 00:09:56.770
OK.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.850
So these are the three edges
of the rhombohedron.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:09.830
Notice that I cannot have that
lattice with a lot of the

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.190
hexagonal plane groups.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.020
I cannot do it for
six-fold axis.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.280
Because a six-fold axis--

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.630
P6 and P6MM have a six-fold axis
here and three-fold axes

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.280
in the middle of the cell.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.870
So I cannot have a rhombohedral
lattice for P6 or

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.800
P6<M. The primitive hexagonal
lattice is the

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.280
only thing that works.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.430
And then we have this curious
situation with the two

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:43.100
alternative settings of point
group 3M in a hexagonal net,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.530
P3M1 and P31M.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:58.050
For P3M1, I have symmetry 3M
at both the origin lattice

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.600
point and in the center of
these two triangles.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:10.430
So for P3M1, in addition to a
three-fold axis, I could put

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:17.560
in 3M1, stack up plane
group P3M1.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:23.810
But I cannot do this for 31M.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.310
That's impossible.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:30.190
Because if you look at P31M,
there is symmetry 3M at the

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:35.360
origin and only symmetry 3 in
the center of the triangles.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.650
So if I try to pick this as a
third translation for plane

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.670
group P31M, I'm taking symmetry
3M and plopping it

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.790
down on top of symmetry 3, and
that wrecks the plane group.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.630
So for the rhombohedral
lattice, I can

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.520
only have 3M1 or P3.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.750
P6 has a six-fold axis at the
origin lattice point.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.370
The two centers of the triangles
are three-fold axes.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:09.020
So primitive for the six-fold
axis, either P6 or P6MM, is

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.270
the only choice.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.470
So if anybody's counting--
and I wasn't--

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:35.320
we've got 11 lattices so far.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.020
And the only ones that we
haven't been able to get by

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:45.990
simple stacking of the plane
groups are the systems that

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.640
you all know as your
favorites.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.720
The cubic or isometric stems
for the fact that the

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.390
translations are identical
in all three directions.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:12.660
Let me quickly dispose of
those by starting with a

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:21.010
four-fold axis coming out of one
face of a tetragonal cell

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.040
and saying now if this is a
cubic symmetry, I have a

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.540
three-fold access that comes
out, sort of, in the direction

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.450
of a body diagonal.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.690
But this three-fold axis is
gonna rotate that four-fold

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:40.220
access to this direction
and to this direction.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:45.660
We've seen that if I look down
along the diagonal of a

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:51.710
equally axed tetragonal prism,
the three-fold axis takes this

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:56.480
face, rotates it into this
face, and rotates

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.360
it into this face.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.470
So I have to have a four-fold
axis coming out of every one

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.520
of the faces.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.200
And having that arrangement of
four-fold axes means that not

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.400
only will the two translations
be identical in the base of

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.750
the cell, as is the case for
tetragonal, but if I put in

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.230
that three-fold axis as an
extender, all three edges of

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:25.070
the cell have to be identical
by symmetry.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.550
So I can do this for a primitive
tetragonal lattice.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.480
And that's gonna give me a
primitive isometric lattice.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.320
I can do this for a

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.920
body-centered tetragonal lattice.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.870
So that would be indicated by
the symbol I. So it's a

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.815
body-centered cubic lattice.

00:14:46.815 --> 00:14:51.030
And if you add up everything
we've done to this point,

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:59.400
there are 13 space lattices,
a very unlucky number.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.310
And as you all know,
there are 14.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.950
We've missed one.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.490
So what have we not done?

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.480
We stacked up all the plane
groups in all possible ways.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:17.220
We've taken the four-fold axes
out of the face normals, all

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.680
three face normals of
a tetragonal cell.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.670
And that forced it to become
a cubic lattice.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.219
What have we done wrong?

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:39.680
Actually, we can get the
fourteenth space lattice by a

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.680
little bit of sleight of hand
that is not obvious.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.190
Let's say that this is the base
of a tetragonal lattice

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:52.910
that we used as the parent
for our cubic lattice.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.790
Let me change that primitive
square in the base of the

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:04.330
tetragonal cell and change it
into a centered square.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.670
There'd be no reason for doing
that for a plane group.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.260
But let me notice now that if
this is the direction of a

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:16.620
four-fold axis, rather than
having the three-fold axis

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.830
come out of this direction
relative to this super double

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.120
square, I can make the
three-fold axis come out in

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.370
this direction.

00:16:28.265 --> 00:16:29.660
Ah-ha.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.740
So what I have now is a cell
that is centered, has a center

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:40.030
in the base and has translations
that are

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.155
perpendicular to the
base like this.

00:16:42.155 --> 00:16:46.040
And if this is the direction of
the four-fold axis and this

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.780
is the direction of the
three-fold axis, that

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.950
three-fold axis is going to put
a centered lattice point

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:59.480
on the remaining faces
of the cube.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.810
So it's only if I notice I can
make a double square base to

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.819
the cell again, put the
three-fold axis of a cubic

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.819
symmetry along the direction
of the body diagonal, I

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:16.470
generate lattice points in the
middle of the other faces as

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.579
well, and this gives me the
lattice known as F, the

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.090
face-centered cubic lattice.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.880
And the edges of the cell here
are all identical, equivalent

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.510
by symmetry.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.720
So they're labeled a1, a2, a3.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.900
Have you ever seen a lattice
constant for a

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.160
cubic crystal a0?

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.270
Has anybody ever seen that?

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.440
A lot of people do it.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.110
And if you see that notation in
a publication, you will be

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.016
entitled to sneer
at it knowingly.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.780
It's logical, three,
two, one, zero.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.710
By extrapolation, if you've
got an a3, an a2, a1, you

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.630
gotta have an a0, right?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.730
Well, not necessarily.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.810
That sort of algebra
doesn't apply to

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.280
labeling of cell edges.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:30.900
It comes from a curious
historic precedent.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:38.660
Come back, again, to the fact
that for literally more than

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:43.240
100 years, people developed
symmetry theory and had a

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.150
pretty good idea that crystals
were based on packing of

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.520
units, molecules, whatever they
were, that were on the

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.490
nodes of a lattice.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.300
But they couldn't measure the
size and shape of the lattice.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:01.070
And that was the brilliance of
the famous experiment by Max

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:07.740
von Laue because that, in one
fell swoop, show that the

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.780
mysterious radiation x-rays
were just electromagnetic

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.120
radiation of a very
short wavelength.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.670
And that's what he really
gained notoriety for.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.470
But at the same time, he proved
for the first time,

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.940
unequivocally, that crystals
were based on a lattice.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.230
And that was the other side
of his double-edged

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.480
accomplishment.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.660
Up until that time, people
learned about crystals by

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.950
studying the morphology and
measuring the angles between

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:47.130
crystal faces and recording
different faces on a crystal.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.500
I mean, I can just see one of
these old guys working a

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.060
little bit before his wife made
him come down and sit for

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.880
supper because it was
getting cold.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.900
And he'd let out
a, whoop, huh?

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.015
A 13 27 face.

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:00.800
What the hey.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.950
It's a new face on potassium
tartrate, something like that.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.560
This was the way these guys
got their jollies.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.380
And on the basis of the angles
between faces, as I said on

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.980
several occasions, they could
determine a ratio of axes, a

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:22.340
ratio of a to b to c, if their
assignment of indices to faces

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.830
were correct.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.565
And how did you know?

00:20:25.565 --> 00:20:28.840
Well, along came x-rays, a and
you could measure for sure.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.620
So what people started doing
to distinguish a to b to c

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:43.790
ratios determined from crystal
morphology, they put the zeros

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:53.750
on it to indicate real values
from diffraction.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.400
And when little people came
afterwards and they didn't

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.830
realize the reason for doing
that-- nobody's done this for

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.510
over 100 years because everybody
determines lattice

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.910
constants using diffraction--

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.810
but some people have
seen these zeros.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.120
So they say, I'm not doing
proper notation.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.720
And you know how furious
crystallographers get if you

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.380
don't use proper notation.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.760
So let me write a0
as the lattice

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.690
constant of my cubic crystal.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.200
You see this commonly.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.580
And there's been no need
for it for 100 years.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.662
So anyway, that's the origin
of the subscript zero.

00:21:31.662 --> 00:21:35.080
There are a lot of dumb things
that take place among normally

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.330
rational people.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.230
I said a moment ago--
and I crossed my

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.650
fingers when I said it--

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:52.460
that c is the label that is
assigned to the unique axis,

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.120
the axis that is unique
because of symmetry.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:09.530
Sometimes you see monoclinic
crystals, which have a

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:13.780
two-fold axis and/or a mirror
plane perpendicular to the

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:24.770
two-fold axis, labelled with
this as b, this is a, and this

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:28.460
as c, and the angle between
them-- that's the general

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.680
obtuse angle--

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.930
as beta.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:39.060
There is a story behind
this lapse of

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.250
standardness in notation.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:48.660
How do people decide on what
proper notation is?

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.510
Well, there is an organization
called the International Union

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.630
of Crystallography, which
is the equivalent of the

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.510
International Union of Pure and
Applied Physics and the

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.050
International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.440
And they meet every
three years.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.950
And there are special
commissions for people who

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:11.730
like to fight and argue out
conventions and nomenclature.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.100
And this is such a silly
abomination that there was a

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.920
move made when they came out
with their new edition of

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.330
international tables to change
this and do it the way you do

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:27.410
for all of the other crystal
systems, namely a, b with

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.850
gamma between them, and c coming
out this way as the

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.340
direction of the
two-fold axis.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.775
And this would be the
mirror plane.

00:23:33.775 --> 00:23:36.510
And that would put this in
accord with tetragonal and

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.920
hexagonal and everything else.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.570
And it was logical and seemed
the right thing to do.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.040
So how do people decide
on nomenclature?

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.650
This is something that people
fight with with more passion

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.810
than anything else in science.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.310
So you make a proposal.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.100
The proposal goes to the
national committees of

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.720
crystallography in countries
over the world.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.620
They discuss it.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.600
They fight about it.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.650
They vote on it.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.560
Then it comes back to the
International Union.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.760
And finally, if everybody seems
agreed, they present it

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.330
at the next meeting of the
International Union Of

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.530
crystallography for a vote.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.830
And that's exactly what happened
with the proposal to

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.370
standardized notation.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:22.400
This took place maybe, I don't
know, in the 1950s.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.380
Everybody was in favor.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.740
The discussion proceeded
rationally.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.850
Then this little guy jumps up
in the front row, short of

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:38.140
stature, balding of head, with
a very piercing nasal voice.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.710
And he gets up and he enters
into this diatribe.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:47.310
b-axis unique was good
enough for Curie.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.930
b-axis unique was good
enough for Mauguin.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.080
B-axis unique was-- and all
the names were French.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.960
Actually, he wasn't French.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.535
He was Belgian.

00:24:56.535 --> 00:24:58.810
So he went on and on and on.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:05.790
And he so cowed this group of
300 rational delegates, that

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.300
they didn't cave in entirely.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.160
What they did was they entered
every entry for monoclinic

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:20.060
crystals in the international
tables twice, once with this

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.390
set of labels, once with
this set of labels.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.440
And to indicate that this was
the preferred notation, this

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.720
is labeled the first setting.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.590
And to indicate second-class
citizenship no matter what

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:38.500
Curie, Mauguin, Bravais, and all
of these other guys felt,

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.090
this was called the
second setting.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:43.090
And I'm not kidding.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.390
I'll bring in a copy of the
international tables for x-ray

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.560
crystallography.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:55.034
Every entry for a monoclinic
crystals is in there twice.

00:25:55.034 --> 00:25:57.364
AUDIENCE: And no one in the past
50 years has tried to get

00:25:57.364 --> 00:25:58.770
rid of the second set?

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.010
PROFESSOR: No.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.530
Actually, the reason is
it is expensive to

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.590
revise these tables.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.000
And I brought in on the first
day, you don't remember, my

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.340
copy of international tables
for x-ray crystallography,

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.730
which is about this
big and cost $100.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.440
And then the new version
which is twice as large

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.500
dimensionally, four times as
heavy in terms of weight, and

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.760
I think about eight times
as expensive in

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.220
terms of actual cost.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.900
So you don't do this casually.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.880
If there's something actually
new comes out, you make a

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.590
little supplement that
people can stick

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.965
in the pages somewhere.

00:26:35.965 --> 00:26:36.935
AUDIENCE: Don't they still have

00:26:36.935 --> 00:26:38.390
PDFs nowadays or something?

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.350
PROFESSOR: The last volume came
out before PDF, before

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:50.690
very intensive use of computers
for such data.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.540
The journals now are
all done online.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.300
You submit papers online and
they're archived online as

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.270
well in addition to hard copy.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.490
But that's something that was
before the time of the

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.105
publication of the last
set of volumes.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.550
Well, I am almost done with
talking about lattices.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.780
But I have a thought question.

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:21.780
You've all heard of this castle
in Ireland that has

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.330
this famous rock in the side
of the castle called the

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.600
blarney stone?

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.420
And you, to get the gift of gab,
have to lean over this

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:36.770
rather dangerous wall and
somebody holds your ankles and

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:41.260
you go down and you kiss
the blarney stone.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.190
And that gives you supposedly
the gift of gab.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.460
But kissing is a dangerous
occupation.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:53.465
You've all heard about kissing
disease mononucleosis?

00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:56.960
And with all those people
smooching the blarney stone,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.590
I've always been afraid the
blarney stone might

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.700
come down with mono.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.500
And if the blarney stone became
ill in this session,

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.260
would it have to be

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.230
transferred to the Mono Clinic?

00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:14.108
I don't know.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.560
All right.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.260
Here in all their glory are
the 14 space lattices, or

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:27.000
Bravais lattices as they're
finally called.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.420
The labels a, b, c, et cetera,
are not on them, but the c

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.950
axis is vertical.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:38.000
You'll see that the hexagonal
rhombohedral lattice is shown

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.120
referred to hexagonal axes.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.140
In the international tables,
you will find all the

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:49.890
information both referred to
rhombohedral lattices and to

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.950
the triple hexagonal
cell as well.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:29:01.730
Now, into these lattices one
should drop those of the 32

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.730
point groups that the lattices
can accommodate.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.915
That's gonna be a lot
of additions.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:18.050
Besides that, there is the
option of having the symmetry

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.390
elements of the point group
not intersect at a common

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:26.230
point, but interleave them as we
did, for example, with the

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:35.380
glide planes in P2GG, and
in some of the other

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.310
two-dimensional plane
groups as well.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.710
Then we would do what we also
did in two dimensions, take

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:44.910
the mirror planes and replace
them by glide

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.260
planes, one or the both.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.650
And you might think that we
really have an enormous amount

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.360
of work to do.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.710
We haven't considered any
symmetry combinations that

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.370
involve a horizontal
mirror plane.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:03.270
For example, we look at what
symmetry 2 requires and we

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:10.560
found the primitive monoclinic
lattice, and the side-centered

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.140
monoclinic lattice, and the

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.200
body-centered monoclinic lattice.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.870
So there's more than one lattice
type into which we can

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.170
drop a given point group.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:24.480
But what would you have if
you had a mirror plane

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.130
perpendicular to the
two-fold axis?

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:31.420
What kind of lattice
will that require?

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:31.720
OK.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.600
Let me, in one masterful swoop,
convince you that we

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:43.380
have done almost the better
part of the work.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:51.220
Let us ask what does inversion
require of a lattice?

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.670
What does the symmetry of
inversion, which didn't appear

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.020
in any of the plane groups at
all because that's inherently

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.270
a three-dimensional point
group operation?

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.040
Well, think about it.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.080
All inversion says is that, if,
hey, there's a translation

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.860
that goes up this way, there
should be another translation

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.830
minus T in the opposite
direction.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:13.010
And any lattice whatsoever can
make that claim and satisfy

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.520
that requirement.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.510
So let me now just quickly say
that if we have derived the

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.950
lattice types, and by
implication the space groups

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:28.460
as well, for a two-fold axis,
for a four-fold axis, for a

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:34.160
six-fold axis, and so on, we
have automatically satisfied

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:40.040
the requirements for any point
group that results when you

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.130
add inversion to a two-fold
axis, when you add inversion

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:47.730
to a four-fold axis, or add
inversion to a six-fold axis.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:53.350
So it turns out that the
requirements of a six-fold

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.770
axis, which gave us the
primitive hexagonal lattice,

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:01.830
are also met by 6 over M. The
requirements of a four-fold

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.835
axis, which gave us the lattices
primitive tetragonal

00:32:05.835 --> 00:32:12.640
and body-centered tetragonal,
are also satisfied for 4 over

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.910
M.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.890
So, any one of the
point groups that

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:21.480
differs from the 11--

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.860
from the 10 two-dimensional
symmetries--

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:32.650
namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, M,
2MM, 3M, 4MM, and 6MM--

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.850
any symmetry that you get by
adding inversion to those

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.410
two-dimensional point groups is
automatically going to be

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.640
happy in the space lattices
that we've

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.140
derived to this point.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.960
So we have done an enormous
fraction of the work that's

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:52.540
required to derive space
lattices, and the

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.520
space groups as well.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.730
So there is not too much
more to be done.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.500
And what I will do for probably
the next meeting is

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:09.820
to derive a few of the space
groups for the lower

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.600
symmetries which are not too
complicated, just to show you

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.730
how the game plays out.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:18.410
And then I will mention a little
bit about the special

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:22.440
idiosyncrasies of the
orthorhombic brick-shaped

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.070
cells where there is nothing
more distinct about one

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.120
direction and the other.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.470
All the inter-axial angles
are 90 degrees.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.180
The translations are general.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:37.190
So there are peculiarities in
notation there that are unique

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.440
to the orthorhombic system.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.760
And then I want to spend,
perhaps, one class talking a

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.350
little bit about crystal
chemistry.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.210
Have any of you had a class in
solid state chemistry or

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.620
crystal chemistry?

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.100
OK.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.980
One.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.260
One of the main uses of space
group theory is the

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.480
description of crystal
structures.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.010
So I think I might, as a minor
digression, take an hour to

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:10.719
talk about packing and some of
the concepts used to describe

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:15.620
the close-packed structures and
ionic structures and give

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:21.120
you a problem that ask you, as
I already did, to generate a

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.834
structure, simple-minded
two-dimensional structure, and

00:34:23.834 --> 00:34:25.980
do some interpretation of it.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:31.710
So, I think this will be worth
saying a little bit about just

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.900
so that one of the main
applications of symmetry

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:39.590
theory does not escape without
any discussion at all.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:46.310
We will, after about two more
lectures, have a complete

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:49.440
change of direction and start
talking about properties of

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.770
crystals and how these
properties are impacted by the

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.929
fact that crystals
have symmetry.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.730
So we're gonna use some of our
results in symmetry, but not

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:07.540
all that much, but develop
remarkable mileage in

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.950
predicting anisotropy in
crystals just on the basis of

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.550
the symmetry which that crystal
possesses, that

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.250
certain physical properties as
a function of direction are

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.910
weird surfaces that have lumps
and noses and bulges in them.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:28.060
And certain properties have this
anisotropy universally,

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.670
regardless of the chemistry or
composition of the crystal.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.940
Given the symmetry of the
crystal, the anisotropy has to

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.310
be in this fashion.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.650
We'll be able to show that some
properties simply cannot

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:42.860
exist, period, regardless of
composition and structure in

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.890
materials that have certain
symmetries.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:48.070
So that'll be the direction
we take off in.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.830
I mentioned at the beginning of
the term-- you've probably

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:51.740
forgotten--

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.870
there is a lovely book on
tensors and physical

00:35:55.870 --> 00:36:01.320
properties by a gentleman named
J. F. Nye, N-Y-E. And

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.000
the title of the book
is Physical

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.250
Properties of Crystals.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:12.330
This is a nice place to go
for further reading.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.950
We will go through roughly
half of Nye's book with a

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.610
little more emphasis on the
consequences of symmetry than

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.870
what he does.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:25.630
But if you want to do some extra
reading, I asked the

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.240
Coop to stock this book.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.550
But I suggest that you not
rush out and buy it.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:34.910
It's available in paperback,
which means it's cheap, but

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.150
only relatively so.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.030
There's no such thing as
a cheap technical book,

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.340
paperbacked or not,
these days.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.120
It's also on reserve
in the library.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.590
So, see if you need
the extra help.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.220
See if you would like to
do some reading in Nye.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.460
And make sure you want to before
you go out and put your

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.640
money down at the Coop.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.540
The last part of Nye
is an elegant,

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.310
beautiful part of the book.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.580
It deals with the thermodynamic
relations

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.230
between different properties.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:09.140
And it's a unique treatment
that is developed by Nye.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.680
We won't do any of that, but
it's a nice thing to have.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.330
So don't rush out and
spend your money.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.980
But if you want additional
reading and just going to the

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.890
reserved book collection is not
enough, then Nye is not at

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:26.750
all a bad copy of
a book to have.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.810
I think most of you have
probably seen Nye, not the

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.890
book but the man.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:38.360
How many of you have seen the
famous Bragg bubble raft movie

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.780
on disk locations, where he
floats sheets of bundles and

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.900
sheers them and you see his
dislocation go zipping across?

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.000
At one stage in that movie,
there's an assistant who

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.940
tiptoes, trying to be
unobtrusive, across the

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.470
background.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.730
But the camera catches him
scurrying behind Bragg.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.330
That's Nye.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.730
So if you've seen the
movie, you've seen

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.800
what Nye looks like.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.150
OK.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.040
I'll call it quits
there for today.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.610
And we'll see you next
week on Tuesday.

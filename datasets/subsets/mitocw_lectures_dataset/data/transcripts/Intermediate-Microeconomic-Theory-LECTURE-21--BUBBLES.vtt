00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:11.750 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Let me get started

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.661 align:middle line:84%
by asking if there are any
questions from last time.

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:84%
You know I really
like questions.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So just to be
clear, I do have a question.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So just to be clear,
for the pollution

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
stuff for the last time, there
are a bazillion prices, right?

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.678 align:middle line:90%
There's not just one price.

00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: There
was one price for permits.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:90%
The model is simple.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.918 align:middle line:84%
So there's only one
dimension of pollution.

00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We kind of
did it as a partial equilibrium

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So the consumers
would take a price

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
as given and deciding
how many permits to sell.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The single firm in that example
would take prices as given

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and decide how much to produce.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But in the equilibrium,
there would

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:90%
be a common price for permits.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
In that case, I'm a bit
confused about something.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:84%
If you have permits and stuff,
if you have 1,000 people,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
if you have one person
selling a permit,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
if that person sells a
permit to have more pollution

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
be polluted, then that pollution
gets spread out over everyone.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So the price that someone
would be willing to sell

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
would be much lower
than the actual price

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that person carried out
pollution or something.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Or am I thinking about it wrong?

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No, no, no.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So that part is
missing from the model

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
because we only had one consumer
or we talked about the consumer

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
as a representative consumer
and everybody wanting

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:90%
to do the same thing.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But you're right, there
could be a potential conflict

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:84%
of interest if you're
all supposed to pay--

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
well, there's something called
the Lindahl equilibrium that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
was just going to take us to
far off the path of the lecture

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
that actually elicits
from each household

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
their willingness
to pay for pollution

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and then adds up
those numbers to get

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
the sum of the
willingness to pay.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, that number
is, quote, "compared"

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to what the firms are willing
to pay for the input costs.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way the
generalization would go.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a good question.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Other questions.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So just to remind you all,
this is the last lecture 21,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:84%
the last lecture I'm giving,
although I will have class

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
on Tuesday, which is another
review session focusing mainly

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
on the material that we've
covered since the last time,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
trying as I usually do
in those review sessions,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:90%
to bring the pieces together.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's the class schedule.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Then, for the reading list
today, for the lecture

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
today, there are these
two starred papers.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And one is this Abel, Mankiw,
Summers, Zeckhauser paper

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and how it's like one or two
slides in the lecture today.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
We didn't spend a lot of
time on it in the lecture,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:84%
but it's listed there as
a supplemental reading,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:90%
along with my own paper.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll spend a little more
time on my own paper.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I'm kind of treating
you guys as you are,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:90%
as fully functioning economists.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So you should be able to
read the Abel, et al, paper

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and understand it without me
going over it this lecture.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And the previous one
had that style to it.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, last time was
the first time, I think,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't finish
the lecture material

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and asked you nevertheless
to go ahead and understand

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
the lecture and to read
the starred reading.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So I did not do this too,
too much at the beginning

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:90%
of the course.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
But now that you're
truly trained,

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:90%
I think you're more independent.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, feel free to ask
me questions about those

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
at any time,
including next time,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
if it comes up
because it's material

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that we really haven't
covered much in the lectures

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:90%
but I started.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So meaning, I do expect
you to understand it.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, for the
review sheets, we

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:84%
were doing the failures
of the welfare theorems.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
The way these review
questions are written,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:90%
they're largely review.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like telling
you what you need to know.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to ask you
when the answer is given,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.550 align:middle line:90%
but I'll give it a try anyway.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:84%
It says, you should know
well the formal statement

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
of the first welfare
theorem and conditions

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:90%
under which it holds.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think I'll
just take volunteers.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Can someone tell me the
roughly or even more

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.705 align:middle line:84%
carefully the statement of
the first welfare theorem?

00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:90%
There are two welfare theorems.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.197 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
If I remember correctly,
the first welfare theorem

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:84%
is something like assuming
local nonsatiation

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
it's convexity,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
but there's second
conditions that I forget.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
But to mean, local nonsatiation
and something else.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Then, the practical Walrasian,
like, price equilibrium

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.607 align:middle line:90%
is pretty optimal.

00:05:49.607 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:90%
If I remember right.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
It was local nonsatiation and
a statement about rationality

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:90%
of consumer preferences.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So very, very weak,
which is probably

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:90%
why they're hard to remember.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
But the local
nonsatiation is there.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, the pollution we've
already started talking about.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Pollution permits.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Why did we need those
permits in the first place?

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:90%
What was it that we did wrong?

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Since the first welfare
theorem is supposed to hold

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and even assuming
local nonsatiation,

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.525 align:middle line:90%
what why did it fail in the end?

00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is it really like
a market for pollution?

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So like, people's preferences
don't get accounted for there.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yep.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's a missing
market problem.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:84%
We assume their L goods and
their markets in all of them

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:84%
when we do the proof of
the first welfare theorem.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we
kind of left one out.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So there aren't
prices there to guide

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
the solution of the market
to the situation where

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
the marginal rates of
substitution over households

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
are equated to the marginal
rate of production across firms.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So that that's the
nature of the problem.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.845 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, I thought
I indicated one other.

00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
What about the second
welfare theorem?

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Can anyone state it, including
some of the assumptions that

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:90%
are needed?

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:48.865 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.865 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:90%
I can take a stab at this one.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So the second
welfare theorem says

00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that basically any optimal
point is supported by some while

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.788 align:middle line:84%
raising equilibrium
up to transfers.

00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And some assumptions that
we need for that are we

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
need convex open
consumption sets.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:84%
We need convex closed
production sets

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.260 align:middle line:84%
with this concave
transformation function.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
We need concave and locally
nonsatiated preferences.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think the last
one is basically

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.293 align:middle line:84%
just like a budget constraint
in some sort basically.

00:08:28.293 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.890 align:middle line:90%
It's some interiority condition.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.797 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:08:32.797 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so this one takes a bit
more in terms of assumptions.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, I showed
in the lecture

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
two pictures of
illustrative examples

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:90%
of where things could go wrong.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
One had nonconvexity
in the preferences,

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and the other had
nonconvexity in production.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it helps
to give the math intuition.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:84%
When we did the second
welfare theorem,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
we were kind of getting those
shadow prices by solving

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
the Pareto problem and
then essentially using them

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
as candidates for the
Walrasian or equilibrium

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
or the equilibrium
with transfers.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And those shadow prices
are marginal conditions.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They are derivatives
having to do

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:84%
with differentiating the
Lagrangian with respect

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:90%
to constraints.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Another way to put that is
the candidate for prices

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
are essentially
margin utilities.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Weighted margin utilities, at
least in the Pareto problem,

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
would be equated to a
common Lagrange multiplier.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I meant by
marginal utility pricing,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that the Lagrange multiplier
becomes the price.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of amazing because
it's all teeny tiny local.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Once we find the candidate
we want, all we need to do

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
is look at the derivatives
for very small movements

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.580 align:middle line:84%
around that point and then
kind of separate the problem

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:90%
globally.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
that at those prices,

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.493 align:middle line:90%
households and firms are max--

00:10:33.493 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's true, but
they're not only just

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
maximizing locally, they
could, in principle,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
choose things that are very far
away from that local point that

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:90%
are global.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was the point
of those two figures

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
with the nonconvexity
in preferences

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
or, alternatively,
nonconvexity in production,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
you could see how
locally things look fine.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you drift
pretty far away,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
you find another
point that either

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
maximizes profits or
maximizing utility,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:90%
depending on the example.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So all of this
stuff we're learning

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
was kind of worked out
by British economists

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and then formalized
by Paul Samuelson.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
It's called the sort
of marginal analysis

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:90%
way of doing economics.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So that that's
essentially all I want

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to do in terms of
reviewing from last class.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.239 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other
thing-- yeah, question.

00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:40.864 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:40.864 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
When I mentioned the
first welfare theorem,

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
we just assumed that
the preference are

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:90%
original and the nonsatiation.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And we say that the
production is a nonempty.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And we don't consider whether
the production function

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:90%
is convex or not.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But I notice that if the
production function is

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
nonconvex, we see
there might not have

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:90%
any competitive equilibrium.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.290 align:middle line:84%
For example, when the
production function is now

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:90%
convex, then the--

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
yeah, then the slide 3 showed
that the point which consumers

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:90%
want to be maximizing utility.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, it
was not at the producers

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:90%
to maximize their profits.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So in this situation, can we
say that was at equilibrium?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.443 align:middle line:84%
It looks like there was no
equilibrium in this situation.

00:12:55.443 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a good question.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And it gives me an
opportunity to clarify.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:90%
There are two theorems.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:84%
One, if a competitive
equilibrium exists,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's optimal, that's
the first welfare theorem.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that only
needs local nonsatiation

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:90%
and rationality.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And the reason-- and it's
true, when there's production,

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and there are no assumptions
about production,

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
but the intuition
for why it works

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
is you're given so much
information already,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:84%
namely this competitive
equilibrium exists.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So what's ever going on,
firms were maximizing profits,

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and that added up
to demand and so on.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So all that stuff is
kind of implicitly given

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
in the statement of the
problem, if the conditionality,

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:84%
if a competitive equilibrium
exists, then something else

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, I get it.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.717 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:54.717 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, I slipped
up too when I

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
was going through those
examples because I'd

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
forgotten that I'd switched
to the second welfare theorem.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So the second welfare
theorem is the starting point

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:90%
is Pareto optimal.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And I should have, when I
went over those figures,

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
emphasized how it was
the single-best point

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
in the whole space and could not
be Pareto dominated, and then

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
settled into the second
part of the second welfare

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
theorem, which is
then you can maybe not

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.287 align:middle line:84%
decentralize if you
lose the convexity.

00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:90%
I like questions.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:90%
I know it's the last class.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.730 align:middle line:84%
By the way, please come ready
to ask questions next time.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a much more
fun way to review

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
what we've done in the
course than it is for me

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:90%
to lecture all over again.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
That said, I should lecture
all over again, I guess.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Here's lecture 21.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, without exaggerating,
this one, like the last one,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
is kind of exciting, both for
the topics that are covered

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and because it's building
on material that you now

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.470 align:middle line:84%
know that was spread out
throughout the course.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I suppose a better
title for this one

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.200 align:middle line:84%
would have been monetary
economics or cryptocurrency.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But Bubbles is a
more appealing title.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you will see,
bubbles can exist,

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:84%
meaning something has
value that has no value.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:90%
And they can be optimal.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And that also creates a
scope for monetary policy.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So these things look really
different from the welfare

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:90%
theorems that we just did.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, the
reason that it's happening

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
is either that we have a
version of incomplete markets

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
or we have an infinite
number of commodities.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But rather than
reiterating those theorems,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:84%
so this is the monetary
economic slide.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you in words how
we can get fiat money to have

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
value, even when it's worth
much more than the paper it's

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:90%
printed on.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
kinds of agents

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.450 align:middle line:90%
moving in opposite directions.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Some are moving west,
as in the top line.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Others are moving east,
as in the bottom line.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And every period, they hit
one of these trading posts.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So the sequence experienced
by the people traveling west,

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:84%
if they start with one,
then next period they're

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
going to have 0 goods,
that's their endowment.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Then one good and so on.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And the guys going in
the opposite direction

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:90%
have the opposite sequence.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Whenever they're able to trade
at these vertical lines, which

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
are trading posts, one agent
has one and the other has 0.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, the basic
idea is somehow

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:84%
the guy with 0 goods also
has these pieces of paper

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:90%
called fiat money.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And they give them up.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
They have value, and they get
one sum amount of the good

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
from the person who
has the real commodity.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's a trade going
on between goods and money.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have to extend the
commodity space to include

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:90%
these pieces of paper.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, the guy
that basically got

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:84%
the money is willing to
take it because he or she is

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
about to experience in the
next period 0 real endowment.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But they can spend the money
to a person with one who

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:90%
was in turn willing to take it.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you this model
at the end of class.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:90%
And we'll work some things out.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's an example of
an economy with endowments

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and preferences that is pretty
awful if there's no money.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.365 align:middle line:90%
But it's much better with it.

00:17:39.365 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, yeah,
at the end, we'll

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:84%
even talk about
optimal monetary policy

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
in that setup of why
the Fed should be

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:90%
controlling the interest rate.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a similar model down
here, if you can see it.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You have people going one
direction or the other.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.900 align:middle line:84%
When they meet, though, they
stay together for two periods.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So this person's
endowment goes a

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:84%
in the first period, 0
endowment of the good

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:90%
in the second period.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:90%
The opposite is true.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:90%
This one has 0 and then B.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So over these two periods,
they can borrow and lend

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is just like a snapshot
of a two-period intertemporal

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:84%
economy with
borrowing and lending,

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
which they will want
to do because they

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
have extreme endowment
positions of the real good.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't end there.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
After they're paired like
that, one goes to the east,

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:90%
the other goes to the west.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you think like a
is a very, very big number

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and b is a very small
number, this economy

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
starts to look like
the one above it,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.070 align:middle line:84%
where they're going
from large number

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
to something almost 0, large
number to something almost 0.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And the person below going
in the other direction

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:90%
has the opposite pattern.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So this economy displays
both real credit,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:84%
borrowing and lending and
real goods, and fiat money.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in the economy we
live in, we arguably have both.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.810 align:middle line:84%
We have fiat money,
and we have borrowing

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:90%
and lending and credit markets.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, we go
to this third economy,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.480 align:middle line:90%
where there are two locations.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Agent 1 is always residing
in the first location.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Agent 2 is always
residing in the--

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Agent 4, I'm sorry, is residing
in the second location.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And these other two agents
labeled 2 and 3 switch

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:90%
locations.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:84%
2 goes from 1 to 2, then
back to 1, et cetera.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:90%
And 3 has the opposite pattern.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
You can kind of create this by
taking this so-called turnpike

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and bending it around so that
it meets like a merry-go-round.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And that would create something
very similar to this economy.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So much more fun, you
can see at date 1 and 3,

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Agents 1 and 2 are
paired with each other.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that
borrowing and lending,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
simple two-period
loans, are possible.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And depending on endowments
and preferences, desirable.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So we have short-term
credit, two-period debt,

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.570 align:middle line:90%
but also watch this.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Now say 1 issues an
IOU to 2, a promise

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:90%
to pay in the fourth period.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
2 travels and passes it along
to 4, 4 passes it along the 3,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and 3 passes it
along to 1, who was

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:90%
the initial issuer of the IOU.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
other network chains

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:90%
like that in this economy.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:90%
And those would be debt.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:90%
They're private IOUs.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:90%
They're not fiat money.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But they would facilitate
exchange and act

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.190 align:middle line:90%
like privately issued monies.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, you do have to redeem
your force in the model

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
to pay back the loan
in the fourth period.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, those IOUs
circulate in the population.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is a real
economy, no fiat money.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But there is a kind of money
circulating private debt

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:90%
with high velocity.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:84%
That IOU passes hands
every single period.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It has the highest single
velocity in the whole economy.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Velocity is the amount
traded per unit time divided

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.070 align:middle line:90%
by the stock.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Another implicit thing
going on in this comparison

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:84%
is, depending how often
agents meet with one another,

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.420 align:middle line:84%
you could evolve from
a monetary economy

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:84%
with valued fiat
money to the point

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that the credit markets get so
good, especially with privately

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:84%
issued debt, that you don't
need fiat money at all.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So don't tell the
Federal Reserve.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
be happy about it.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:90%
But that tension is there.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of the
issue with digital assets

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and cryptocurrency is that it's
kind of filling in the market

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:84%
and can lead us to a
situation where the fiat

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:90%
money is no longer valued.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, you get the
same thing in this model.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
a meets b for two periods, then
three periods, then n periods.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So they're together so
much, the residual gap

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
is not enough to create
valued fiat money.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So these slides then
go back to the issue

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of either monetary policy
or distributed ledgers.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We talked about distributed
ledgers throughout the class

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:90%
off and on.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that wasn't effective
because it pops up

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
in different spots,
depending on the lecture.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
1 passes it to 2,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:84%
2 passes it to 4,
to 3, and back to 1,

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
there's another path over
here where 3 issues it to 4,

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:84%
4 gives it to 2, 2 gives it to
1, and 1 passes it back to 3.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that you
don't need both of them.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But if the amount of
short-term circulating debt

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
is not coordinated, then
you can run into troubles.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Another way to say that is
there are multiple equilibria,

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.050 align:middle line:84%
a continuum of
equilibria, but you

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:84%
need to coordinate on the
amount of the privately

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:84%
issued currencies that are about
to circulate in the economy.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And if these are informationally
decentralized locations,

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
if they're not
supposed to know what's

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
going on in the other
location, then there's

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:90%
no way they can coordinate.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So one of the advantages
of distributed ledgers

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:84%
would be, especially if you
write smart contracts on them,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:84%
that you can solve this
coordination problem.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where we're
going with digital assets,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
except people aren't
thinking about it yet.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to end up
with financial crises,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.770 align:middle line:84%
not because digital
assets are bad,

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
but because there's a
coordination problem.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, we have a
solution in the ledgers.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not crazy to link
this to central banks

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
because I mentioned
once to you IOUs that

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.160 align:middle line:90%
circulated in Medieval England.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Those were those willow sticks.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they
were issuing pieces

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.555 align:middle line:84%
of paper, promissory notes as
IOUs, that were circulating

00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:17.310 align:middle line:90%
in the population.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And in London, those
bills of exchange were--

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
well, all of England and
especially in London,

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:84%
there were markets
for those bills.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But occasionally,
they would crash.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's actually
what gave rise

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to one of the first
central banks in the world,

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:84%
the Central Bank
of England, where

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:84%
it would buy up those bills
that were falling in price.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
That's the way
monetary policy used

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
to work when the
Fed buys treasuries.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But they may have created
the wrong institution

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:48.870 align:middle line:84%
because the problem likely was
the coordination problem, not

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the private
markets were intrinsically

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:90%
flawed.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And the other aspect that
we're going to cover today

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
is that fiat money
can be introduced.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
worth nothing, it's

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:90%
going to have a positive value.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
create other problems.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's
totally stable.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It could be moving
around, which brings us

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.160 align:middle line:84%
to the other kind
of money, Bitcoin,

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
which was introduced
to be a money

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:90%
and to replace fiat money.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
That's what really made
the central bank so annoyed

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:84%
with the whole
Nakamoto experiment.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They were threatened by Bitcoin.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:90%
So a bit historical here.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:90%
I kept it in for a reason.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
When I first started teaching,
I grabbed this slide,

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.370 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with
the price of Bitcoin

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:84%
moving from $100
to $147 in 2013.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.940 align:middle line:84%
People were already talking
about how ridiculous that was.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't tied to anything.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So the value was
completely indeterminate.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
But remember, fiat
money is just like that.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.480 align:middle line:84%
When you have the head
of the Federal Reserve

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Bank of New York, Dudley,
saying the problem with Bitcoin

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:84%
is that it has no
fundamental value,

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:84%
don't throw stones if
you live in glass houses

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
because fiat money
has the same problem.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's just that
in the US, fiat money

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:90%
is respected and not unstable.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, back to
the $100 to $147,

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I can't see your
faces very well,

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
but you may be a bit puzzled
because if you looked at what

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:90%
the value is now, it's $19,372.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So over here, at the low
end, the price was so low,

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.430 align:middle line:84%
it looks like it's 0 now
when we change the scale.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
it jumped up in '17,

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was, and
hit about $19,000.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:90%
And this is the most recent--

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I kind of did this because
I told you I was aware

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
of the price three days ago
was the highest on record.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
As of yesterday, it's
back down about $200

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.730 align:middle line:90%
below the highest point.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, these are
almost identical spikes.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
it's going to go?

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.200 align:middle line:90%
You want to buy?

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, what determines
the value of this stuff?

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So maybe only that
it's used in exchange.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Would that pin down the value?

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And now you're going
to see the model.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is the overlapping
generations model.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned last time we have an
infinity of goods and infinity

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.690 align:middle line:90%
of households.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Nobody lives forever.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
generation after another.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:84%
We saw last time
a version of that,

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that we could have a
competitive equilibrium where

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
the price of the second
good was 1, everyone

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
had 2 units of wealth, and they
could all end up in autarky.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was a way
to Pareto dominate

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:90%
the competitive equilibrium.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So that is true here in
this is more general setup.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of a
better-known setup

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
because this is
Samuelson's model, which

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:90%
he created at MIT, by the way.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:84%
You have two-- let's
simplify the lifetime.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:90%
You're either young or old.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.710 align:middle line:90%
So no middle-aged people.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:90%
No people living 100 years.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:90%
They just live two periods.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:90%
How many of them?

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put a little
population growth in the model.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's an initial
population L0 at date 0.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Then, L1 at date 1
is 1 plus n times L0.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's a rate of
population growth of n.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:39.060 align:middle line:84%
L3 is 1 plus nL which
is 1 plus n squared L1.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So if the initial
population is 1,

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:84%
then the total population
satisfies this equation.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.832 align:middle line:84%
It'll be interesting
and annoying

00:28:50.832 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to have to keep

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:84%
track of the number of
people all the time.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to want
to divide by the numbers.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So the algebra
gets to be a pain.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'll show you, at least
in one case, how to do it.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.760 align:middle line:90%
And then it will be more clear.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:90%
There's only one good period.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But per period, there's an
infinite number of periods.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously an
infinite number of people,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.600 align:middle line:84%
even though no one lives
more than two periods.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a constant return to
scale production technology

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
that maps the level of the
capital good, real physical

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
savings, as it were, and
the current labor supply

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:90%
into output of the single good.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And because it's constant,
returns to scale,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:84%
we know that if we multiply
the inputs by a scalar,

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:84%
the output gets
multiplied by a scalar.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
We do the following
trick and let the scalar

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:90%
be the population itself.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:90%
We divide by labor.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So L over L goes to 1, k over
L is now termed little k.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Its capital per capita.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And output would
scale by 1 over L.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's like putting
that L over here

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720 align:middle line:90%
on the left-hand side.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:90%
We have output per capita.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So we can write basically
a production function

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:84%
F, which maps output y,
little y, from capital.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:90%
So there are two goods here.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:90%
There's labor and capital.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.780 align:middle line:90%
They're both used in production.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So the capital stock is brought
in from the previous period

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:90%
and then used in production.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.080 align:middle line:84%
The marginal product
of capital is

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
rental rate on capital

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:84%
or it looks like
an interest rate.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And the wage is going to
be the residual of what

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:90%
isn't paid out in capital.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I could have written down
an explicit expression

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:84%
for the wage, which would be
the marginal product of labor.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But because we have
constant returns to scale,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:90%
we know there are no profits.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And since there are no
profits, the payments

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:84%
to the factors of production,
labor and capital,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:90%
adds up completely to output.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.990 align:middle line:90%
And firms make no profits.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
expressions for the wage

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and for the rental
rate on capital.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But note, that in turn,
because it's a function of k,

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:84%
It's output less whatever the
marginal return on capital

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.430 align:middle line:84%
was times the total amount
of capital involves k,

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and k involves r.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can write this
as a function of r.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Here's a simple
two-period max problem.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Utility today plus beta
times utility tomorrow.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:90%
And how do they do that?

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
They're endowed with
1 unit of labor today.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.930 align:middle line:90%
They get the wage.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can either eat it or
save it, real physical savings,

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.590 align:middle line:90%
or call it capital stock.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Likewise tomorrow, they
don't have any income.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:90%
They're old.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:90%
They're not working.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But they do have that
saving, and the saving

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.760 align:middle line:84%
is going to earn interest
at rate little r.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So whatever capital is brought
in to next period, when they're

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.000 align:middle line:84%
old, it's going to have
a rate of return of rt

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.480 align:middle line:84%
plus 1 for the second period
because they were born at t

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:90%
in they're old at t plus 1.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So savings times 1
plus the interest rate

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.350 align:middle line:90%
would be their consumption.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
It kind of looks like Social
Security, except here these

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:84%
are real physical
savings, the only thing

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.350 align:middle line:90%
so far that they're able to do.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.350 align:middle line:84%
No money, no Social
Security, nothing.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get a
savings function as a solution

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
to this problem that's going
to involve the prices, namely

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.260 align:middle line:90%
the wage, and the interest rate.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Each household will
take the prices

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.660 align:middle line:84%
as given, as we always do in
a competitive equilibrium,

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and solve for s.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But that s is, in turn, through
the production function,

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.530 align:middle line:84%
going to generate
the interest rate.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And the level of capital
will also determine the wage.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:90%
So what is in equilibrium?

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:84%
If things are going
to add up properly,

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.600 align:middle line:84%
then we take the savings
function-- we just

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:84%
did this-- the savings function
of an individual person at day

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
t times the number
of persons at day t,

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:90%
that's the population Lt.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:84%
This is total savings,
which is going

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:11.215 align:middle line:84%
to be the total capital stock
used in production tomorrow.

00:33:11.215 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
interest rate came from.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It's paid out, supplying a
factor of production tomorrow,

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:90%
namely that capital.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.280 align:middle line:90%
So this is market clearing.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You might imagine from
Vollrath's law, the only thing

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
we need to worry about if
we're going to clear savings

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:84%
equal to the
capital stock, we're

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:84%
also going to clear the labor
market and everything else.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But let's just focus
on the capital stock.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, take this equation here
and divide through by Lt.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Then we have little s on
the right and kt plus 1

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:90%
over Lt on the left.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of
weird because we'd

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:84%
want to normalize by the
actual population in t plus 1,

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.650 align:middle line:90%
which is Lt plus 1.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So this will be kt plus 1 over
Lt multiplied by Lt plus 1

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.912 align:middle line:90%
over Lt plus 1.

00:34:02.912 --> 00:34:04.120 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't change anything.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:04.945 align:middle line:90%
That's just 1.

00:34:04.945 --> 00:34:08.620 align:middle line:84%
But we take that thing in the
denominator, the Lt plus 1,

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and stick it under the k,
and that makes it a little k

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:16.639 align:middle line:84%
because that's the per capita
capital stock at t plus 1.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
After you did that,
with Lt plus 1 over Lt,

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and we know that's already
going up at rate 1 plus n.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
So that's where this
first term is coming from.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's painful
to hear me go over it

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.110 align:middle line:84%
verbally because it's
all just algebra.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But this little trick is going
to get used four more times.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.889 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to draw
your attention to it.

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:44.389 align:middle line:84%
The capital stock
per capita needs

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to take into account
the number of people.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.840 align:middle line:84%
The number of capita, so to
speak, is changing over time.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.000 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the math
of this expression.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we have
little s on the right.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.182 align:middle line:84%
And we already know
the wage is a function

00:34:58.182 --> 00:34:59.390 align:middle line:90%
of the current capital stock.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
The interest rate is a function
of capital stock next period.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Hence, kt and kt plus 1
are in this expression.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So we can effectively
look for what

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
happens if we start
with initial capital

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:21.410 align:middle line:84%
stock in the whole economy
at date 0, the genesis date,

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and stick that capital,
what's going to be in,

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.160 align:middle line:84%
solve this equation, what's
going to be the capital

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.690 align:middle line:90%
stock tomorrow?

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's meant to
be-- the solution

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.480 align:middle line:84%
is meant to be along this
line denoted as this curve.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Looks like a
difference equation,

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.230 align:middle line:84%
mapping current
into future capital.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.630 align:middle line:84%
If you start with
current capital,

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow's capital at t plus
1, at 1, would be kt plus 1.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Now you do this trick.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back and hit the
45-degree line and start over.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the 45-degree
line, we're putting k1 down here

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.410 align:middle line:90%
on the x-axis.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Start at k1, what capital
we have in the third date,

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.720 align:middle line:84%
read it off the
s-curve and so on.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
it would evolve,

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.020 align:middle line:84%
if this line crosses
the 45-degree line,

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.760 align:middle line:90%
to a steady state called k star.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So after that, the economy
isn't moving anymore.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.780 align:middle line:84%
There are no more
dates on anything.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It's completely settled down.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is a long-run
steady state of the economy,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:90%
with only real savings.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's introduce
pieces of paper that

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:90%
are intrinsically worthless.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But imagine that
they have value.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And let's denote their
value as the price Pt,

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and that is the price of
money in terms of consumption.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the opposite of what
you would normally think.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Normally, we think
of consumption

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:51.650 align:middle line:90%
having a dollar price.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:84%
This is dollars having
a consumption price.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'll keep pointing that out.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So if that consumption price
of money is changing over time,

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:08.290 align:middle line:84%
we put Pt as 1 over Pt,
that would be appreciation.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be a good thing.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if it were
a money price, a dollar

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.450 align:middle line:84%
price of consumption, then
having the price level go up

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.540 align:middle line:84%
would be a bad thing because
it would be depreciating--

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.507 align:middle line:90%
it would be inflation.

00:37:21.507 --> 00:37:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But here, it's a
good thing because we

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:28.530 align:middle line:84%
flipped the numerator
around to be the opposite.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:90%
So this is a rate of return.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a real positive rate of
return if Pt plus 1 is over Pt.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And maybe people want to
hold this piece of paper.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.842 align:middle line:84%
If they're going to hold
these pieces of paper,

00:37:39.842 --> 00:37:42.050 align:middle line:84%
they have to be indifferent
to that and the other way

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:45.020 align:middle line:84%
to store value over
time, which was namely

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:90%
physical savings carried over.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:84%
They would get the interest
rate, the rental rate on it

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:84%
next period and get
the savings back.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So if in an equilibrium, there's
both real savings and money,

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.420 align:middle line:90%
then this equation has to hold.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.840 align:middle line:84%
We can call the bubble,
the title of the lecture,

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.450 align:middle line:84%
the value of money
times its price.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.100 align:middle line:90%
It's in real consumption terms.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you just stick Pt plus
1 equals Bt plus 1 over n,

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:84%
then you can rewrite this
equation too this way

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:90%
because n is constant.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not manipulating the
amount of money in the economy.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm keeping it constant,
although the price is moving.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So then, we have
from 2 this equation

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:84%
about how the bubble, the
real value of the bubble

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:90%
is changing over time.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's related to the
marginal product of capital.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, I could
divide by the population.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.290 align:middle line:90%
We'd have a bubble per capita.

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'll do the same
trick I just did before,

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:84%
with apologies,
but I'm not going

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.190 align:middle line:90%
to go through the algebra.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Take the Lt, divide
through, then

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.760 align:middle line:84%
you have a mismatch
between t plus 1 and t.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Then have Lt plus 1 divided
by Lt plus 1, parse it out,

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and you get this thing, that
the real per capita bubble is

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.860 align:middle line:84%
moving over time, according
to the marginal product

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.430 align:middle line:90%
of capital.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But that arithmetic,
which over here

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:17.570 align:middle line:84%
created the 1 plus n hanging out
there, that extra term, that 1

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:90%
plus n is in this math as well.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And you're just dividing by it.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
n is coming from,

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:90%
that rate of population growth.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:28.670 align:middle line:84%
This is all a big
premise right now.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:32.660 align:middle line:84%
We're just saying, if there
were money, if it had value,

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:36.500 align:middle line:84%
the value of it has to
be increasing at the rate

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that they can earn money in
another way, namely by storing.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you're
getting an equation

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.110 align:middle line:84%
for how the value of
the bubble, hence money,

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.510 align:middle line:90%
must be evolving over time.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, savings can be done in the
two ways, as I've kept saying,

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:90%
but here's the equation.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:56.360 align:middle line:84%
When they're young, we
have the savings function

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of the young people,
depending on the wage

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and tomorrow's interest rate,
times a number of young people.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.450 align:middle line:90%
But they can save in two ways.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:84%
They can save in the
real bubble or they

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.850 align:middle line:90%
can save in the capital stock.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And now, again, doing
that same math as always,

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:16.490 align:middle line:90%
start solving for Kt plus 1.

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Subtract B off of
the right-hand side.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Then divide through by the
appropriate labor term,

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.100 align:middle line:90%
and you get this expression.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the third time
we're doing the algebra.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It should kind of
be obvious where

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:84%
it's coming from because Kt
plus 1 is equal to Ls minus B.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of it is
finding that end term

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and dividing through
by that term.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is just
another way of saying

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.560 align:middle line:84%
that the amount of
capital next period

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:84%
is what it would have been
before in the real economy

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.690 align:middle line:84%
without money, except now
we have bubbles of money

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:52.080 align:middle line:90%
that have value.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to
subtract off the bubble.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of preventing
the capital stock from being

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:90%
as large as it would have been.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So 3, this thing, gets rewritten
at the top of the next slide

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:84%
to be the bubble b So now solve
this thing for b, little b,

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.480 align:middle line:90%
bubble per capita.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It's this thing, and
that's one equation.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And we also know something
about bubbles over time.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.210 align:middle line:90%
As I was saying, we did that.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.680 align:middle line:84%
That was this
thing at the bottom

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.870 align:middle line:90%
of the slide before last.

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:90%
So we have those two equations.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.310 align:middle line:84%
This has to be true
in a steady state.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Should emphasize.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:32.520 align:middle line:84%
There are t's all over the place
here, but in a steady state,

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.850 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
have any evolution.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So the t's are
going to disappear.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:90%
So Kt plus 1 will equal Kt.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.130 align:middle line:84%
There'll be no t on the
b, Kt, blah, blah, blah.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I rewrote 3
hurriedly just then,

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I rewrote it without the t's.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
thing is at the top.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And with the t's, we have
this thing, the second term,

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:56.270 align:middle line:84%
which I've just pasted
in from previously.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to have a
steady state, then these b's

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:01.190 align:middle line:90%
can't be moving around.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So bt plus 1 over bt has
got to be a constant.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And if the left-hand
side is the same,

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:12.380 align:middle line:84%
1, then the right-hand
side has to be the same, 1.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the marginal
product of capital

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.820 align:middle line:84%
has to be equal to the
rate of population growth.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a steady
state with a real bubble,

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.830 align:middle line:84%
then the rate of
population growth

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.470 align:middle line:84%
has to be equal to the
marginal product of capital,

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.210 align:middle line:90%
this thing at the bottom here.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
other ways to see this.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.890 align:middle line:84%
One, take this equation, but let
me rewrite it verbally for you.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:39.310 align:middle line:84%
We have output coming from
the production function.

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Take this k and put it
on the right-hand side.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.450 align:middle line:90%
You can always eat the capital.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:84%
You remember that
medieval village economy

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.860 align:middle line:84%
with seed and storage
and all of that, where

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.480 align:middle line:90%
we talked about the evolution?

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can always eat this, the
harvest, or you can save it.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's like that.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.260 align:middle line:90%
So this k can be eaten.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So you have total
resources available today

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:90%
to be f of k plus k.

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And how do you use that stuff?

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.500 align:middle line:90%
You can eat it or save it.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Eat it today, that's c.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, tomorrow's k,
would be k, except darn it.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.870 align:middle line:84%
We got that population
growth again.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to keep k
constant in a steady state,

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:20.470 align:middle line:84%
the resource requirements to
have a constant per capita

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.320 align:middle line:84%
capital stock
tomorrow are that you

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.310 align:middle line:84%
have to augment the capital
per capita today by n.

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Same trick, fourth time.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.660 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, writing
it that way, we

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.950 align:middle line:90%
want to maximize consumption.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So you solve consumption
equals to f of k plus k

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:41.620 align:middle line:90%
minus k times then 1 plus n.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And where is that
object, that c maximized?

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It's maximized by finding
the first-order condition,

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly where f
prime of k is equal to n.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:55.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's so-called golden rule.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Distressed to see this morning
that this k star is not,

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:90%
however, the previous k star.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a new
golden rule k star.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Should have called the other
k autarky for the economy

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:09.220 align:middle line:90%
without money.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.230 align:middle line:84%
In this case, star
would be the golden rule

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:16.570 align:middle line:84%
k for the steady state
bubble equilibrium.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have
to happen that you

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:21.490 align:middle line:90%
will be at the steady state.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:26.770 align:middle line:84%
If k were greater than k star,
everyone could be better off.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It's as if, if you started at
k greater than the golden rule,

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:84%
the economy's
overaccumulated the capital.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And then to maintain a constant
per capita capital stock,

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:84%
you've got to take
something out of production,

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.720 align:middle line:84%
not eat it, and squirrel
it away for tomorrow.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:48.010 align:middle line:84%
You could actually do better
by increasing consumption

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.860 align:middle line:84%
of the current generation,
having less capital

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.890 align:middle line:84%
stock to maintain,
and then going out

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:90%
to the infinite future.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:45:00.490 align:middle line:84%
None of the future generations
are going to be worse off.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.460 align:middle line:84%
This experiment is
exactly like what

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.030 align:middle line:84%
we did last time with the
infinite number of goods

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:12.160 align:middle line:84%
economy, where we can engineer
a one-time improvement

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.670 align:middle line:84%
in at least one of the
agents by creating something

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:16.420 align:middle line:90%
from nowhere.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we move the
overaccumulation of capital

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:84%
into the current generation
and let them eat it.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, subsequent
generations don't suffer either

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.250 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have to try to maintain

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:34.780 align:middle line:84%
this per capita capital
stock, which was too large.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible
that the economy

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:40.180 align:middle line:90%
can overaccumulate capital?

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to look at two
steady states, the previous one

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.590 align:middle line:84%
without any money
and the new one

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:49.340 align:middle line:90%
with the steady state bubble.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.620 align:middle line:84%
An interesting thing about
the steady state bubble,

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:54.090 align:middle line:84%
this one that we've
already described,

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.420 align:middle line:84%
is that it has the property that
it achieves the golden rule.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's because-- you
can kind of see it here--

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.990 align:middle line:84%
when the bubble is constant
and not depending on time,

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.750 align:middle line:84%
then f prime of k
must be equal to n.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So the golden rule is
achieved in the steady state

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:90%
of the bubble equilibrium.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And that was this top line.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.700 align:middle line:84%
In a steady state with bubbles,
the golden rule is achieved.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to be this point.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's k star,
that's the golden rule

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.020 align:middle line:84%
k, corresponds to a
particular bubble that

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.750 align:middle line:90%
solves the other equation.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.440 align:middle line:90%
That's called a b star.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.420 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
would like to get to.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in the
economy with no money?

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:84%
You're down here at
essentially an autarky value.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is a perfectly fine
competitive equilibrium.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.910 align:middle line:90%
There is no money.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But in it, the economy will
have overaccumulated capital.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And a Pareto improvement
can be engineered

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.320 align:middle line:84%
by reducing the
amount of capital.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.300 align:middle line:84%
How does that happen
in a steady state?

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:59.420 align:middle line:84%
You give other people a way
to save in worthless stuff.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So instead of real
physical savings,

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.015 align:middle line:84%
they're scrambling to get
these pieces of paper.

00:47:04.015 --> 00:47:05.890 align:middle line:84%
The rate of return on
the pieces of the paper

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.110 align:middle line:84%
has to be the same
as physical savings.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.240 align:middle line:90%
It has no intrinsic value.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It has an extrinsic value
because the price of money

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.360 align:middle line:90%
is positive.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, these
perfectly worthless pieces

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.570 align:middle line:84%
of paper, fiat
money, have a value

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.010 align:middle line:90%
in a competitive equilibrium.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And the money's actually helping
to recover the Pareto optimum.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So you see the connection to
the welfare theorems here.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.010 align:middle line:84%
We have an infinite
number of people,

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.200 align:middle line:90%
an infinite number of periods.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.760 align:middle line:90%
The welfare theorems fail.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.100 align:middle line:84%
If you start adding
up the value of wealth

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.990 align:middle line:84%
in the autarky
equilibrium, it goes

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:39.910 align:middle line:90%
to infinity like last time.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why the first
welfare theorem fails.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And the way to
recover optimality

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is to create these
worthless pieces of paper

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:49.060 align:middle line:90%
and let them trade.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It's totally amazing.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's an intrinsic
part of money.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:58.010 align:middle line:84%
However there's a downside
here, which is it's unstable.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So let me just describe
what's going on

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:04.120 align:middle line:84%
without expecting you to be
able to reproduce all the math.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.030 align:middle line:84%
You're plotting, this
was the autarky value.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:10.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the golden rule
value that we want.

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to look at
starting from different points

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:17.060 align:middle line:84%
with the economy evolved to one
or the other of those points.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
equation, depending

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.060 align:middle line:84%
on whether you're above it or
below it for the capital stock

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.140 align:middle line:84%
to evolve, this equation, the
BB, bubble bubble equation,

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.930 align:middle line:84%
has to do with whether you're
to the left or the right of it,

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.640 align:middle line:90%
whether the bubble is evolving.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And these arrows
denote all the forces

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.540 align:middle line:90%
in the underlying economy.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you're lucky and you
start away from the golden rule

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.300 align:middle line:84%
steady state, you would
evolve on a knife edge

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.440 align:middle line:90%
and eventually converge to it.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.790 align:middle line:90%
So this is the good news.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:49.990 align:middle line:84%
The economies that start with
an appropriate amount of bubble

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:middle line:84%
or capital will evolve to
this optimal golden rule,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.840 align:middle line:90%
so steady state.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.750 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
really bad news--

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:02.960 align:middle line:84%
this economy can also evolve
to real savings and no money.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.340 align:middle line:90%
And money inflates away.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It could start with
a positive value.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.080 align:middle line:90%
This is an equilibrium.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
require stupid people.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a fully rational
expectation dynamic path, where

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:18.340 align:middle line:90%
the value of money goes to 0.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, so why
did I show you that?

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I can replace the word fiat
money with cryptocurrency

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and ask what value
it ought to have.

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It's perfectly plausible
to me that you could

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.380 align:middle line:90%
see the price moving around.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it will go to
some constant value

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:37.510 align:middle line:84%
if this Bitcoin is also
useful in exchange,

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the way money is in that
overlapping generation's model.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's going to it's
going to collapse again,

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.670 align:middle line:90%
and the price will go to 0.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.890 align:middle line:84%
All those phenomenon
are perfectly

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:51.400 align:middle line:84%
consistent with Bitcoin playing
a useful role in exchange

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.470 align:middle line:84%
but not able to
find a stable value.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But again, the point
is, and actually we've

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:84%
been emphasizing this,
starting with fiat money

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.780 align:middle line:84%
the way Samuelson did, it's
a property of any money.

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a property of
fiat money and so on.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.340 align:middle line:84%
The Fed worries a lot
about forward guidance.

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.230 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly
telling people

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.880 align:middle line:84%
what they predict to
happen in the future

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.030 align:middle line:90%
so people don't panic.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.130 align:middle line:84%
If you think fiat
money is not going

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to be worth what it
is in the future,

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:18.400 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to want to hold it.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's one
explanation that traders

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.000 align:middle line:84%
have for what's going
on with Bitcoin, namely,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.430 align:middle line:84%
there's just an
ever-increasing amount

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:29.930 align:middle line:84%
of government debt
in the economy.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:34.090 align:middle line:84%
The Fed has bought up all
those securities effectively

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and issued accounts
at the Federal Reserve

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.410 align:middle line:90%
in worthless pieces of paper.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Are you scared now?

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So the market may
be anticipating

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, there aren't
enough real resources

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.990 align:middle line:90%
to pay off the debt.

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:49.660 align:middle line:84%
The only way that
the Fed and European

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.570 align:middle line:84%
governments are going to pay
off the debt is to inflate.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And if the market starts
to expect inflation,

00:50:55.870 --> 00:51:00.070 align:middle line:84%
fiat money is less valued, and
they're shifting into Bitcoin.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's what traders
think is going on.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I switched the
story on you a bit

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.880 align:middle line:84%
because now we have
fiat money competing

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.998 align:middle line:90%
with Bitcoin and vice versa.

00:51:08.998 --> 00:51:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think you
could imagine how you

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.590 align:middle line:90%
could get both in the model.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:84%
So the way you get
both in the model

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:19.630 align:middle line:84%
is to set up an underlying
economic environment

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:21.220 align:middle line:90%
and have gaps.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Say autarky households
aren't smoothing,

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:26.740 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of fluctuations,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.210 align:middle line:90%
fiat money can help smooth.

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But maybe fiat money doesn't
smooth it out entirely.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're left
for tokens like Bitcoin

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to play a role on
top of fiat money.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So you could actually
have both in the model.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not true that one
has to dominate the other.

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:90%
They could both coexist.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And partly what we're seeing
in these cryptosystems

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:52.060 align:middle line:84%
is crypto coins are a way of
transferring fiat money around.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.880 align:middle line:84%
You just create tokens that
get transferred around.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But they're claims on the
underlying fiat money.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But the tokens can
have value because they

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.680 align:middle line:84%
facilitate exchange,
even if they're not

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.570 align:middle line:90%
backed by the fiat money.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:90%
So we could get both of them in.

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is pretty abstract,
this overlapping generations

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:10.900 align:middle line:90%
model.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.390 align:middle line:84%
You might say it's
totally unrealistic.

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:15.340 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's
another interpretation

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.160 align:middle line:84%
of Social Security
with pay as you go,

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.240 align:middle line:84%
namely the young pay
in to Social Security,

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's not sitting there
in some fund or something.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not in a lockbox.

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:29.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just flowing right
out to the old generation.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So people have criticized
Samuelson's model

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:84%
as a not realistic
model of money

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.150 align:middle line:84%
because of the
extreme assumptions

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:41.300 align:middle line:84%
about finite two-period
lives and so on.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.810 align:middle line:90%
But could it be applied?

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, these guys, Abel, Mankiw,
Summers, and Zeckhauser said,

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:50.380 align:middle line:84%
look, we could
actually look to see

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:55.280 align:middle line:84%
whether economies are on an
efficient or inefficient path.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I had started
this on the reading list.

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:01.500 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, you can read this.

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.538 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, I did.

00:53:02.538 --> 00:53:03.580 align:middle line:90%
It's on the reading list.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.680 align:middle line:84%
You should be able
to understand it.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.850 align:middle line:90%
This, you won't understand.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just explaining
what they did.

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.690 align:middle line:84%
They didn't find
any inefficiency,

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:13.540 align:middle line:84%
but a subsequent
person, Geerolf, did.

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:17.710 align:middle line:84%
He adjusted what those guys
did to take out land rent,

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:20.320 align:middle line:84%
having profits of
entrepreneurs divvied up

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.750 align:middle line:90%
into opportunity cost wages.

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And he actually finds that
Korea, Taiwan, Singapore,

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.420 align:middle line:84%
those East Asian
growth economies,

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:35.180 align:middle line:84%
with all that capital, they
were actually inefficient.

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.450 align:middle line:84%
They were accumulating
too much capital.

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:39.480 align:middle line:84%
They were beyond
the golden rule.

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.290 align:middle line:90%
It's really fascinating.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:42.070 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:45.310 align:middle line:84%
The other part is what I was
alluding to at the beginning.

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:49.900 align:middle line:84%
If you create more and
more real financial claims

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that can be traded, then fiat
money can also be vulnerable.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And you could convert
those economies with money

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.000 align:middle line:90%
to economies without them.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you have Bitcoin and
tokens and cryptocurrencies

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and especially
digital assets, which

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:08.500 align:middle line:84%
are claims on real
capital circulating

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:13.600 align:middle line:84%
in the economy as money, you
may end up with that model

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.390 align:middle line:84%
where there is no
valued fiat money.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, that would
threaten central banks.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.640 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
it's a bad thing.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.130 align:middle line:84%
In our terminology,
it could be going

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.860 align:middle line:84%
toward a new
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Other ways to get
money in the model,

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:32.740 align:middle line:84%
you could require
it to pay taxes.

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So even if there's
a last period,

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.990 align:middle line:84%
everyone has to pay
it in, otherwise

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:39.680 align:middle line:90%
it could have 0 value.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So the very first
monetary models

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:45.670 align:middle line:84%
were finite-period models,
but in the last period,

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.280 align:middle line:84%
people have to pay
taxes in money.

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Some governor in Ohio
got a smart idea which,

00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:53.440 align:middle line:90%
is I guess he liked technology.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.100 align:middle line:84%
He is allowing Ohio citizens
to pay their state income

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:59.050 align:middle line:90%
taxes in Bitcoin.

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that'll
stabilize the price.

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And you could require that
money be used for goods.

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.800 align:middle line:84%
We have not been writing
models like that.

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:10.990 align:middle line:90%
This is like fiat.

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Literally, by law, you're
required to use money.

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have to hold it and
have to have acquired it

00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:19.150 align:middle line:90%
earlier in some way.

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:21.760 align:middle line:84%
These are called cash
in advance models.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you have certain types
of goods in the economy that

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.740 align:middle line:84%
require cash, and
those are valued goods

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.710 align:middle line:84%
with a margin utility
of infinite at 0,

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:34.150 align:middle line:84%
then the value of
cash isn't going

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to fall to 0 because
if it were, you'd never

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:38.330 align:middle line:90%
be able to buy those goods.

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
a way of, again,

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.270 align:middle line:84%
a mechanical way of making
sure the value of money

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:44.950 align:middle line:90%
doesn't go to 0.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Like it or not, I'm exposing
you to different modeling

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.650 align:middle line:90%
strategies.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So let me come back to
the starting point, which

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.610 align:middle line:84%
are these agents that
go 0, 1, 0 and 1, 0, 1.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:01.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a spatial
model of money.

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Why is the money going
to be valued here?

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not all
together to trade with one

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:84%
another at some initial date
over all these future paths

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.990 align:middle line:90%
of consumption.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:15.440 align:middle line:84%
They can only trade with
each other when they meet.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is an extreme version
of incomplete markets.

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know what can happen
to competitive equilibria

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:23.180 align:middle line:90%
with incomplete markets.

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.860 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to be optimal.

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, let's write down
the problem of an agent of type

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.460 align:middle line:90%
of I. If you can see this.

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit tiny.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:37.550 align:middle line:84%
We have discounted
utility of consumption.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Consumption and money
are non-negative.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
budget equation,

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:43.610 align:middle line:90%
which reads like this--

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:46.700 align:middle line:84%
they have some endowment,
maybe positive.

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:49.670 align:middle line:84%
This is now the dollar
price, by the way,

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:53.870 align:middle line:90%
of goods, the usual price.

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:56.540 align:middle line:84%
They have the valuation
of their endowment

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:59.390 align:middle line:84%
plus the money they brought
in from the previous period.

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:01.580 align:middle line:84%
They may have to pay
some lump-sum taxes.

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But then the residual can be
used either to buy consumption

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.970 align:middle line:84%
or to take money over
to the next state.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
like sources and uses.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And what's the solution to this?

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Solution, by the way, by
manipulating the money.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.000 align:middle line:84%
The way they determine how much
they're eating today or eating

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.180 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow is to either
cash out the money

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.420 align:middle line:84%
or acquire it and store
it and carry it over.

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So not too surprisingly, you
might expect, and it's true,

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that the marginal-- let
me write it down here--

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that with one exception, the
marginal rate of substitution

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:42.830 align:middle line:84%
in consumption, of consumption
at t minus 1 for consumption

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:46.680 align:middle line:84%
at t, that ought to
equal the price ratio.

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So remember your basic lectures,
consumer theory, two periods,

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:53.900 align:middle line:84%
money is a way to
carry value over

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.280 align:middle line:90%
from one period to the next.

00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like borrowing and
lending, except that it

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:02.760 align:middle line:84%
appreciates or depreciates
depending on the price level.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So you would expect
this equality to hold,

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:09.002 align:middle line:84%
that the tangency involves the
marginal rate of substitution

00:58:09.002 --> 00:58:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and consumption on
the indifference

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:14.540 align:middle line:84%
curve equal to the price ratio
implicit in the budget model.

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was covering
up the inequality

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:20.210 align:middle line:84%
because it could be that
you're holding money.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The marginal utility
of consumption

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.680 align:middle line:84%
today is greater than the
marginal utility tomorrow

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.760 align:middle line:90%
discounted.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.770 align:middle line:90%
So you'd like to eat more today.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So you start driving that money
down, and the money hits 0,

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.600 align:middle line:90%
and you can't go negative.

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And still, the
margin utility today

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:37.620 align:middle line:84%
is greater than the
margin utility tomorrow.

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So these guys actually--
where did it go?

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:42.740 align:middle line:84%
These guys here
experienced that.

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:44.450 align:middle line:90%
They start at 1.

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:46.040 align:middle line:90%
They acquire money.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.900 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
have 0 next period.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:51.170 align:middle line:84%
They start dumping the
money, but they run out,

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:53.160 align:middle line:90%
and they can't go negative.

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So for them,
they're at a corner.

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Guys that come in with
money and spend it,

00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.950 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise they
have no endowment at all,

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:03.110 align:middle line:84%
are nevertheless not going
to have enough money.

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So we can look
for an equilibrium

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:08.690 align:middle line:84%
where for some periods
and some types of agents,

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:11.120 align:middle line:84%
this is at a strict
inequality, namely

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.560 align:middle line:90%
the guys that are hitting 0.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.140 align:middle line:90%
And the other ones 0 endowment.

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And the other ones,
it is that equality.

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Let me draw you the picture.

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So even though it's an
infinite horizon economy,

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:25.370 align:middle line:84%
we can reduce it to
a two-period economy

00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and guess what the steady
state equilibrium is

00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:31.500 align:middle line:90%
going to look like.

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Guys that start with
1 unit would be here.

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.290 align:middle line:84%
If they just ate
their endowment,

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:40.950 align:middle line:84%
they would have consumption
of 1 today and none tomorrow.

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, moving
along the budget line,

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:48.480 align:middle line:84%
at constant prices,
they get money today,

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:52.410 align:middle line:84%
giving up consumption good
today, and get money tomorrow.

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:55.200 align:middle line:84%
If the price level
of money tomorrow,

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.900 align:middle line:84%
price of goods tomorrow is
the price of goods today,

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.510 align:middle line:84%
then they're moving right
along this budget line.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.572 align:middle line:90%
And where would they end up?

01:00:03.572 --> 01:00:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's an
indifference curve.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Here's a tangency.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.890 align:middle line:90%
It's on the budget line.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did I know
it would be there?

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Namely, look at this expression.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the marginal
utility at t minus 1 to t

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:18.830 align:middle line:84%
or the marginal utility
at t to t plus 1.

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.360 align:middle line:90%
There's a beta down here.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow doesn't count so much.

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Beta is between 0 and 1.

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So the utility, margin
utility tomorrow,

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:29.510 align:middle line:84%
is always less than the
margin utility today.

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
could compensate for it

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.050 align:middle line:90%
is the price movement.

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
But if we start with
constant prices,

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
then this expression
is only going

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
to hold if we're able
to adjust consumption.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
We want to get the
margin utility up.

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Consumption at t is
greater than at t plus 1

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:54.170 align:middle line:84%
in order to get the margin
utility up to the point

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
that the marginal
rate of substitution

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:59.980 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
constant price ratio.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, is this a good
thing or a bad thing?

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is going to be
a monetary equilibrium.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.700 align:middle line:90%
The guess is good.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So the path would
be guys with 1 are

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
going to go to c star and then
c double star, then c star, then

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
c double star, with money
moving in the opposite direction

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
from something positive, when
they have 1 they acquire it,

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
to 0, hitting the corner,
back to positive amount again.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So money is going to
alternate over time

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.390 align:middle line:90%
at the individual level.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Consumption is going
to alternate over time.

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
The money is going to have
value at a constant price.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But unlike the overlapping
generations model,

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.810 align:middle line:84%
this one is not a
Pareto-optimal allocation,

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:50.280 align:middle line:90%
even though we have money.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
You actually know
the answer already.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Let me remind you.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.790 align:middle line:84%
How do we determine
a Pareto optimum?

01:01:56.790 --> 01:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's all the guys
that start with, say, 0

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
be called A types,
and all the guys

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that start with 1 unit
of the consumption

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:06.360 align:middle line:90%
are going to be called B types.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.142 align:middle line:84%
And then, maximize the
weighted sums of utility.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.350 align:middle line:90%
We usually have lambdas here.

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:11.160 align:middle line:90%
I apologize.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, they're w's.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the weight on type A.
wB is the weight on type B.

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:19.920 align:middle line:84%
We maximize the weighted
sums of expected--

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.550 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing random--
discounted utility

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.900 align:middle line:90%
for both of them.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.390 align:middle line:90%
We get a first-order condition.

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:27.390 align:middle line:90%
You remember this stuff?

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:28.480 align:middle line:90%
We've done this before.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.420 align:middle line:90%
This is the Pareto problem.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Weighted margin utilities are
going to be equated over agents

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and equal to a constant
Lagrange multiplier.

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.580 align:middle line:90%
You've seen this before.

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
This is a new
application, that's all.

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So the marginal rate,
solving this equation,

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.980 align:middle line:84%
the marginal rates of
substitution over the agents

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.630 align:middle line:90%
have to be the same.

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
But does it pin
down the allocation?

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:50.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:52.050 align:middle line:90%
We're in an Edgeworth box.

01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:55.740 align:middle line:84%
There's one good in the
aggregate available today,

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
one good in the aggregate
available tomorrow.

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
We know the Pareto
optimum has to give

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%
all the guys equal consumption.

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
You can satisfy this
by having type A having

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
constant consumption, type B
having constant consumption,

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.870 align:middle line:84%
but those consumptions don't
have to be equal to each other

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
because things are
going to cancel out

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
of the numerator
or the denominator.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So this picture, marginal
rate of substitution

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
for day t and day tau is
equal to each other for agents

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
type A and type B.
But to review, right,

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
you remember this lecture
when we did the Pareto

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.120 align:middle line:90%
optimum and your Edgeworth box?

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
You can be anywhere
on the contract curve,

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.450 align:middle line:90%
and it's all Pareto optimal.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's off the
diagonal is not Pareto optimal

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.400 align:middle line:90%
in this environment.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And this one is
off the diagonal.

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:49.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's not Pareto optimal.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Where do you want to go?

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:52.930 align:middle line:90%
You kind of want to go here.

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:55.030 align:middle line:90%
And how would you engineer that?

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to generate
a deflation so

01:03:58.090 --> 01:04:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that they're getting a positive
real rate of return on money.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
That's going to make them
want to hold more money

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.310 align:middle line:90%
and eat less today.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
put them at a tangency

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
up here where they
have equal consumption.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
Pareto-optimal allocation.

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a monetary
equilibrium, but it's

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.780 align:middle line:84%
an equilibrium with an
activist monetary policy that's

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
withdrawing enough currency out
of the system in lump-sum taxes

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.050 align:middle line:90%
to create a deflation.

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Deflation isn't bad here.

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It means that the purchasing
power of money is going up.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's all the rest of these
slides I don't have time for.

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
You are able to achieve these
Pareto optimal allocations

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:44.060 align:middle line:84%
but only with an activist
monetary policy, which

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
is deliberately manipulating
the amount of currency

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.310 align:middle line:90%
in the system.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Questions.

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:52.770 align:middle line:90%


01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So welcome to the land
of monetary economics.

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:57.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of fun.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So now you're able to
see in this last lecture

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
how real financial
markets are linked

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
to money markets, the role of
cryptocurrency, controversies

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
involving its price, and how
we as economists can think

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
about these values, and
actually how we would

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:14.710 align:middle line:90%
recommend monetary policy.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And I will add that if
there was cryptocurrency,

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
you would want an activist
amount of manipulation

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
of the amount of
cryptocurrency in the system

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
for the same reason that
I just described to you.

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:34.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:22.230
PROFESSOR: So, good afternoon.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.120
Our subject for all of today
and some part of Monday

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.640
is coherence in
free-level systems.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.180
And what I want to
show you are there

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.690
are certain fundamentally
new and, to some extent,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.210
surprising processes
which are possible when

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.100
you have three levels
and not only two.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.960
Because when you
have three levels,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.360
you have one excited
state which is

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.190
coupled to two ground states.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.270
And that gives us the
possibility of interference.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.790
And actually, all
the special things

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.760
I will tell you about
three-level system

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.730
are related to interference.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.645
Certain phenomena will
constructively interfere.

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:12.290
Other will
destructively interfere.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:25.006
And that leads to a number
of important effects.

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:26.630
The first effect you
want to talk about

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.870
is the possibility
of dark states,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.520
that there are
superposition states which

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.180
are bombarded with two laser
beams, and they're not excited.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.040
Because the amplitudes to go to
the excited state destructively

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.140
interfere.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.820
When you have a
state which is dark,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.750
which cannot absorb the light,
then you already understand

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.140
the possibility of doing
lasing without inversion.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.570
Because if a lot of the
population is in a dark state,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.660
you don't have to invert
excited and ground state.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.160
Because the dark
state doesn't count.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.570
Lasing without inversion is
a little bit more intricate

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.830
than this, but just
kind of the idea,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.330
the notion of a dark
state helps you already

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.360
to anticipate why something
like lasing with inversion

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.010
may be possible.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.120
The dark state is only dark
in a very narrow frequency

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.070
interval of the two lasers.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.360
So if you're a very
narrow resonance,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.910
then you have a very
narrow resonance

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.490
where something goes dark.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.420
But if something goes
dark, it's not absorbing.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.170
And therefore you have
electromagnetically

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.650
induced transparency, which
is a very, very sharp feature

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.740
in frequency space.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.170
And when you have very, very
sharp features in frequency,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.370
you can change the
group velocity of light,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.540
because if transmission and
absorption index of refraction

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.490
changes a functional
frequency very,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.220
very sharply, you have huge
effects on propagation lights.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.390
So kind of all of these
different subjects which

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.880
I want to go through are
different perspectives,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.120
but you will find
similar physics.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.910
It's just we look
at interference.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.760
We look at dark states
in various ways.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.440
And each of them has
created a cottage industry

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.570
and a subfield of itself.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:30.280
So I started to
remind you that you're

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.760
very familiar with the dark
state in the situation where

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.530
we have optical pumping.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.850
If you have two ground
states in an excited state,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.430
and you switch only one
laser, sooner or later you

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.690
will just pump all the
atoms into the state f

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.520
and the state f is
dark, and vice versa.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.490
So what I want to show you now
is that even if both lasers are

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.080
on, then no matter in what kind
of state or superposition state

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.710
you have the atoms,
the atoms see

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.240
light, which is
ready to excite them.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.280
But there is-- and this is
what I want to show you now--

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.560
a coherent superposition state,
which is still the dark state.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:23.340
So the last thing I did on
Monday, I wrote down for you

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.690
our Hamiltonian,
which is nothing

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.840
else in the well-known dipole
Hamiltonian in the rotating

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.650
wave approximation.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.210
And what is important now
is that we have pathways

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.440
with Rabi frequency
omega 1 and omega 2.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.880
And we have one laser fields.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.660
The photons are
created, annihilated

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.680
by the a operator, and
the second laser field,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.080
where the operator
is C and C dega.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.150
So there are two ways how
we go to the excited state.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.700
We can couple from the ground
state f to the excited state

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.950
and from the ground state
to g to the excited state.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.290
So when you shine
on the light, atoms

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.050
may be in some initial state.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.320
They will sort of spontaneously
emit but scatter light.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.260
But then after some
transient, the state

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.920
which is stable against further
illumination, is a dark state.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.720
That's like optical pumping.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.710
So you will optically pump
into the following state,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.390
which I write down for you.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.940
And then we can inspect that
indeed it is a dark state.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.150
It is a coherent superposition
of the two ground states.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.880
And the coefficient
involves the Rabi frequency,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.070
omega 2 of laser 2,
omega 1 of laser 1.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:05.250
And we just normalize it by
taking the quadrature some

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.470
of the two Rabi frequencies.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.530
So this state is
indeed a dark state.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:31.420
So let me show that
to you by looking

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.740
what happens when we
expose it to this operator.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.170
This operator v
in the Hamiltonian

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.230
is the operator which couples
the atoms to light, which

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.010
couples the atom to
the excited state

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.830
and this causes
spontaneous emission.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:07:00.430
So what I want to show
you that is a dark state,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.110
since if you take this operator,
apply it to the dark state

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.690
and ask, is there
any possibility

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:23.530
how you can excite, how you can
excite to the excited state?

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.780
And the answer is,
it will be zero.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:40.930
The dark state has a
component on-- the dark state

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:49.590
has one component in f, and
it has one component in g.

00:07:57.097 --> 00:07:58.180
How did I want to do that?

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:18.100
Sometimes it's easier
to say it in words

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.558
than to write down
a long equation.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.620
The light atom interaction
couples the component

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.630
of the ground state
to the excited state

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:36.330
with Rabi frequency omega 1
and the state f with omega 2.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:41.549
However, in the construction
of the dark state,

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.030
I've made sure that the
amplitude of the component g

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.760
is omega 2.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.900
So therefore when we
apply this operator,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.370
we have omega 1 from the
operator and omega 2 here.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.860
And here we also get
omega 1 and omega 2.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.430
And this minus sign means
the two effects cancel.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:12.780
So therefore, I've
shown you that even

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.550
though in its full frame with
second quantization, photon

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.130
operators and all this,
this coupling is identically

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.250
0 and therefore we
have a dark state.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.910
So this phenomenon of
having a dark state

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:37.530
and populating the dark
state by light scattering,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.890
you have spontaneous
emission into the dark state

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.620
until the scattering light
staggering stops and no matter

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.060
what the initial
state of the atom

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.070
bar where the dark state
is now 100% populated.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.660
This is called coherent
population trapping.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.980
Let me mention that
this coherent population

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.520
trapping can be some good
thing if you want to pump atoms

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.110
into a certain state and then
they stop scattering light.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.080
They're not heated up anymore.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.210
But sometimes you want the
atoms to scatter light.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.990
For instance, in current
laser cooling experiments

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.870
with molecules,
there is a problem

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.820
that the multiplicity of the
angular momentum states, which

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.820
are suitable for laser
cooling in molecules

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.380
is such that you always
have a dark state.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.240
So if you irradiate the
atoms with laser light,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.220
they will not be on
a cycling transition.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.130
The cycling
transition will stop.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.220
So you have to play
additional tricks.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.330
One is to apply a
transverse magnetic field

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.200
that the axis of the laser and
the quantization axis given

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.910
by the magnetic field are
in two different directions.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.980
And then once the atom is
pumped into a dark state,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.670
it will actually precess, Zeeman
precess out of the dark state.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.960
Or magneto-optical
traps for molecules

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.130
use a magnetic field gradient,
which is rapidly switched,

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.450
because when you are
in a dark state for one

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.090
value of the magnetic field, you
just change the sign quickly.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.350
And then the atoms are no
longer in the dark state

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.630
for the new situation
you've created.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.110
So in other words, to have
these wonderful dark state,

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.640
which is a major
intellectual accomplishment

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.680
and eventually was exploited
in many experiments,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.630
for a number of experiments
it's a real nuisance.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.050
And you have to
find ways around it

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.577
to make sure that the atoms are
not stopping scattering light

00:11:44.577 --> 00:11:45.910
and don't stop scattering light.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.250
I gave you the simple
example that the dark state

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.130
exists for resonant excitation.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:01.910
But as you can immediately
show, the dark state

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:08.455
also exists for
detuning of resonance.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:25.285
The only thing which is
important as long as the two

00:12:25.285 --> 00:12:31.850
lasers fulfill the two
photon resonance condition.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.460
So you want the difference
between the two lasers

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.070
is the energy difference
between the two states.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:57.190
Also remember if you
have two lasers which

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:05.340
are very different in power-- so
let's say one Rabi frequency is

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.500
much smaller than the other one.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:20.840
So then the dark state,
the superposition

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.710
which is the dark
state, the dark state

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:27.761
is now predominantly which one?

00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:29.260
The state with the
stronger coupling

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.426
or with the weaker coupling?

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.850
Well, it's the state
with the weaker coupling.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.010
The dark state has
always a larger amplitude

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.550
in the state for which
the coupling is weaker.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.290
And that of course
immediately makes a connection

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.110
to optical pumping.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.350
For instance, if omega 1
the Rabi frequency is 0,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.250
then the dark state
is what we started out

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.140
with a trivial
example, is a state g.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.010
So you see that actually
what I taught you

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.890
about coherent
population trapping

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.920
is nothing else than
extension of the concept

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.770
of optical pumping.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:18.630
OK, so we've talked
about the dark state

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:24.410
as a superposition
of state g and f.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.540
But if you have a
two-dimensional Hilbert

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.590
space given by two
ground states g and f,

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.050
we can now find a new basis.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.540
We have defined the dark state.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.260
But now we can get
the orthogonal state,

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.925
which is the bright state.

00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:52.200
It has a plus sign here and it
has the omega 1 and omega 2,

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.080
the Rabi frequencies reversed.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.490
So this state is now orthogonal.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:15.710
And you can now visualize the
preparation of the dark state

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.210
as follows.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.660
We have the dark state.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.900
We have the bright state.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.085
The bright state, as you
can immediately verify,

00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:31.390
is strongly coupled by the laser
field to the excited state.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.230
So we have an excited state.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.340
The laser fields-- well, its
two laser fields strongly

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.850
couple the bright state
to the excited state.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:48.600
And then spontaneous emission--
two photon lights scattering--

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.330
can take you back to
either of the two states.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:16:02.890
But now you see that the
concept of optical pumping,

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.700
which I started out
with a trivial example,

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.470
is now applying in the
new basis to the bright

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.830
and to the dark state.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.920
And what happens is you
would, by optical pumping,

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.622
populate the dark state
and completely pump out

00:16:15.622 --> 00:16:16.330
the bright state.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.420
Just as a side remark, there
are lots of subtleties.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.270
Most of them you will
probably see by yourself

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.960
by just inspecting the results.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.800
But if you may
ask yourself, what

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.930
happens when the
Raman resonance is not

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.320
made, when the difference
between the two lasers

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.990
is not exactly the
difference between the two?

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.310
Well, then what you have
is you have a superposition

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.850
of ground and excited state.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:50.510
So we have the two
ground states g and f.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:56.600
But the two laser
fields have a phase

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.340
which evolves different from
the phase between g and f.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.510
And suddenly, what you
have is relative-- I mean,

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.079
everything is relative to
the laser field, so to speak.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.740
This plus sign turns
into a minus sign.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.930
So therefore, if you have
pumped into the dark state,

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.550
but now the frequency
difference of the two lasers

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.329
is slightly different from the
frequency difference between g

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:24.140
and f, this mean in
essence that as time

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.470
goes by, with the frequency,
with the detuning away

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.230
from the two photon resonance,
the dark state will now

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.570
precess into the bright state.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.570
And it is only for
the Raman resonance,

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.580
when it is exactly met, that you
have a long-lived dark state,

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.530
a dark state which is a 2
eigenstate of this Hamiltonian.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.030
Yes?

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.054
AUDIENCE: Would
the precession also

00:17:48.054 --> 00:17:49.759
change omega 1 into omega 2?

00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:58.910
PROFESSOR: No, we have
defined omega 1 and omega 2

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.310
as the Rabi frequencies
of the two lasers.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.250
Omega 1 is a Rabi frequency
of the laser which

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.710
talks to, I think, the state g.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.475
And omega two is
the Rabi frequency

00:18:09.475 --> 00:18:11.141
of the laser which
talks to the state f.

00:18:11.141 --> 00:18:13.200
So this doesn't change.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.960
I'm just sort of telling you how
you may want to think about it,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.270
that if you put in all of
the temporal phase factors,

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.450
on resonance, at least in
some dressed atom picture,

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.530
all the phase factors are 0.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.120
Because the e to the i omega
t of the atomic wave function

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.840
is compensated by the
light atom coupling.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.170
And therefore phase
factors just disappear,

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.030
and the state is stationary.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.730
But if you write down what
happens as a function of time

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.030
to the state, and you couple
it as a function of time

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.520
to the laser field,
you will find out

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.240
that there is an
evolving relative phase

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.240
between the light field
and the atomic state.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.600
And the essence of that
is that with these, there

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.060
will be a beat node at which
the dark state becomes bright

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.759
and the bright
state becomes dark.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.560
OK.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:15.460
One important application
of the dark state

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.940
is the STIRAP technique.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:25.715
STIRAP is adiabetic
population transfer.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:48.470
So STIRAP stands for
stimulated-- what is the r?

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.455
Stimulated Rapid
Adiabetic Passage?

00:19:54.455 --> 00:19:56.163
AUDIENCE: I've seen
both rapid and Raman.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.170
PROFESSOR: So we
have two choices.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.290
It's both Raman and rapid.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.170
A is adiabetic, p is passage.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.420
And STI is stimulated,
because it's

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.070
a coherent stimulated process.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.570
The idea is the following.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.860
With this concept
of a dark state,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.900
I can immediately
explain to you how,

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.310
by changing the intensities
of the laser beams,

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:26.410
you can make an adiabetic
transfer from one state

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.570
g to the other state f.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.010
And this is important because
in many atomic physics

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.670
experiments, you
start with one state

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.120
and then you want to
prepare another state.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.220
You always have the option of
having some suitable pi pulse

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.820
and going from one
state to the next.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.610
But the pi pulse has
to be exactly pi.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.440
You have to be careful
what the intensity

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.420
and duration of your pulse is.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.780
But if you can adiabetically
go from one stage

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.650
to the other one,
this is terribly

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.280
robust against pretty
much everything.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.400
And I want to now use the
concept of the dark state

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.270
to tell you how this
population transfer works.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.830
But before I even get
into any explanation,

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.860
the picture is the following.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:17.520
The dark state-- if you
change laser parameters,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.300
you can change which
state is the dark state.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.620
I gave you the simple example
if one laser beam is on,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.740
the state g is the dark state.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.310
If the other laser beam is on,
the state f is the dark state.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.200
So if you switch one laser
beam off and the other one on,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.090
you've changed the
definition of the dark state.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:40.140
And as I want to show you is the
dark state, if we can set it up

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.620
in the situation that the dark
state is the absolute ground

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.430
state of the system, and you
know when you change parameters

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.940
of your Hamiltonian,
adiabeticity

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.660
tells you that you always
stay in the ground state.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.800
See now, even
without any equations

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.950
you understand what adiabetic
population transfer is.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.570
But let's work it out.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:09.250
So we want to understand-- and
this is our adiabetic process--

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:15.950
what happens when the laser
parameters, omega 1 and omega

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.885
2, change slowly.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.950
So for pedagogical
reasons, I will

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.850
drop all the assumptions
I'm making now,

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.930
but let me make them.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:39.310
So let's discuss
degenerate states first.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.010
So g and f are degenerate.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.930
And let me also discuss
blue-detuned light.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.345
And you will see
in a moment why.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:08.760
So that would mean that-- and
let's set up the situation.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.830
We have the state g, f, and e.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:23.230
We have a green laser beam
and an orange laser beam.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.850
And we know already, from
what we have just learned,

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:32.950
that this should be
transformed into--

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.740
and let me just be
more specific here.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:43.720
I said I want to use
blue-detuned light.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:50.850
So now we do what
we just learned.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:56.100
We express things as the dark
state and the bright state.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.730
And here we have
the excited state.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.330
And the beauty of degeneracy
is that dark state

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.080
and bright state are
superposition states,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.220
but since they're
superposition states

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.750
of two states with
the same energy,

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.710
I can draw them without
twisting my hand

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.330
or doing sort of a double line.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.040
Anyway, but now what
happens is the following.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.630
The bright state is
coupled to the excited

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.270
state by the two laser fields.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:28.370
And the question is,
what is the energy

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.580
of the bright state
relative to the dark state?

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.660
Well, if I have a
blue-detuned laser beam,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:44.690
I get an ac-Stark shift,
which increases the energy.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:50.730
So therefore, the state
which sees the light, which

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.990
scatters photon--
scattering photon

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.610
means there is an
excited state admixture.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:59.130
An excited state admixture means
there's an ac-Stark effect.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.820
And the ac-Stark
effect is positive.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:08.310
So therefore, the dark state
is-- the uncoupled state

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.560
is the lowest state in
the ground state manifold.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.520
And even if you would
not generalize it

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.810
to multiple levels and all that,
if there is one dark state,

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.460
it's not upshifted by
the ac-Stark effect.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.765
Whereas every state
which sees the light

00:25:28.765 --> 00:25:31.750
is upshifted by
the ac-Stark effect

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.400
which provides a blue shift.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.270
So the dark state is the
lowest quantum state.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.250
So therefore, we can now
use the general concept

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.670
in quantum mechanics of
adiabetic state transfer

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:57.600
to achieve a perfect 100%
transfer from one ground

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:10.316
state to the other one by
tailoring as a function of time

00:26:10.316 --> 00:26:13.480
our laser fields as follows.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:23.160
We start out in a situation
where the only beam which is on

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:34.260
is-- I want to change that to
orange-- is the orange laser.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.850
And when the orange laser is
on, then the dark state is g.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.390
Then we ramp down
the orange laser.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.470
But we ramp up the green laser.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.340
And we have the situation
that initially g

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.750
and eventually f
is the dark state.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.120
So this is a picture behind
the rapid adiabetic passage

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.270
from state g to f.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.090
I want to point out that the
application of the two laser

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.770
pulse, first orange
and then green

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.490
is called the
counter-intuitive sequence.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.030
Because if you ask
yourself the problem,

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.470
you're starting out
in state g and you

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.480
want to go over to
state f, which laser

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.810
would you first switch
on if you're in state g?

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.950
Well, if you want to
get out of state g,

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.660
you would say first
the green laser

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.820
to go up and then the
orange laser to go down.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.450
So what I just said, first
the green and then the orange

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.640
is called the
intuitive sequence.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.590
But STIRAP works with the
counter-intuitive sequence.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.520
OK.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.778
Any questions?

00:28:13.778 --> 00:28:14.278
Yes?

00:28:14.278 --> 00:28:18.150
AUDIENCE: So what's the
intuition we have with this?

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.560
PROFESSOR: Well, I
gave you the intuition.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.720
I said, you want to
have a dark state.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.480
The dark state is
the ground state,

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.270
the lowest state
of the manifold.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.860
So you want to first make sure
that g is the ground state.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.200
And then you turn
opposite your Hamiltonian,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.770
and eventually f is
the ground state.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.330
And this is exactly
the situation.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.580
f is the ground state
with the green light on.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.730
I've given you the
intuitive picture.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.605
Now I will actually
come back to that.

00:28:42.605 --> 00:28:51.650
There is the kind
of-- it's called

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.850
the magic of the
adiabetic state transfer

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:59.190
that if you always
stay in the dark state,

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.010
if you always stay
in the dark state,

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.090
you never populate
the excited state.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.520
So it looks like
magic that you can

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.730
go from the ground
state to the final state

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.430
without having ever any
population in the excited

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.750
state.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:19.100
And of course, can that be true?

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.960
No, because there is
no coupling direct.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.805
So somehow in this picture
of adiabetic transfer always

00:29:25.805 --> 00:29:29.430
staying in the dark and never
populating the excited state,

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.630
maybe we have
over-emphasized something.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.670
We need a little bit
of excited state,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:37.180
otherwise we cannot go there,
because our Hamiltonian does

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.780
not allow the direct
path from g to f.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.990
So a lot of people
think that STIRAP

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:44.180
is a method where you
can go from g to f

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.860
without going through
the excited state.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.040
I have many, many
people talking about it.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.170
So I want to discuss it
in the next few minutes

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.630
and to some extent demystify it.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:58.710
But since you're asking me-- now
in a black and white picture,

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.900
STIRAP is the way.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.490
I'm correcting
myself in a moment,

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.150
but STIRAP is a way
where you can go directly

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.540
without going through
the excited state.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.840
And this is done by the
counter-intuitive sequence

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.640
where you just want to keep
atoms in the dark state,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.720
whereas the intuitive sequence
is really based on the fact you

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.230
want to take population here,
put population here and the

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.150
stimulate it down.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.040
And this is not what
STIRAP is about.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.910
Other questions?

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:27.410
Yes?

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.860
AUDIENCE: So if there
is very strong coupling

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.720
to a fourth state from the
excited state, because you need

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.660
to-- the population needs to
travel through the excited

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.075
state in STIRAP, it's possible
to spoil the whole process.

00:30:41.075 --> 00:30:42.450
PROFESSOR: We will
talk about it.

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.520
And actually in the next
minute, I want to sort of simply

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.410
calculate how many photons are
emitted during the passage.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.610
And if you now say the photons
have a branching ratio,

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.030
this could be a branching
ratio to you fourth state.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:00.080
But by just calculating what is
the time integrated population

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.990
in the excited state
multiplied with gamma,

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.120
this is the amount
of photons scattered.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.820
And you can say if you try to
do a STIRAP with the bosons

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:13.300
then condensate, every time
you scatter, you heat up,

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.860
you reach momentum states
outside the condensate.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.450
And those momentum states
are your fourth state.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:21.280
So actually, by discussing how
much light scattering happens

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.910
in this transfer,
I will pretty much

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.570
talk indirectly about
how much population

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.480
is going into a fourth state.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.300
So that's what you want
to understand now--

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.800
how true is the magic of the
dark state transfer where

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.920
we can go from one
state to the next

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.421
without ever going
through the excited state.

00:31:38.421 --> 00:31:38.920
Yes?

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.536
AUDIENCE: So are the two laser
frequencies the same for that?

00:31:42.536 --> 00:31:43.370
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:47.460
I actually assumed that-- I
come to that in a second--

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.820
that the two states
are degenerate.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.010
And for all this
dark state busyness,

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.090
we have to fulfill
the Raman resonance.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.420
So if the two states
are degenerate,

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.166
then the two laser beams.

00:31:59.166 --> 00:32:00.902
AUDIENCE: So then
what's the meaning

00:32:00.902 --> 00:32:02.142
of increasing one of them?

00:32:02.142 --> 00:32:04.126
We are satisfied--

00:32:04.126 --> 00:32:06.630
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:11.770
One possibility is that
this is an m equals 0 state.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.460
This is an m equals
minus 1 state.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:17.260
This is m equals plus 1.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.360
And this is sigma plus.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.010
And this is sigma
minus radiation.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.590
So yes, and this
was actually very

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.590
important for the whole
discussion of three level

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:32.530
coherence that this level can
only talk to the green laser,

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.820
this level can only talk
with the orange laser.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.830
And we have two ways
to accomplish it.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.530
One is by frequency difference.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.060
But if you don't have
a frequency difference,

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:46.270
we need polarization
selection rules.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.083
Yes?

00:32:47.083 --> 00:32:50.618
AUDIENCE: It's sort
of a silly question.

00:32:50.618 --> 00:32:54.320
In this particular case, if
I have all my atoms in g,

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.188
can I turn on the green laser?

00:32:56.188 --> 00:32:59.152
Can I optically pump
everything to f?

00:32:59.152 --> 00:33:00.640
Right?

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.657
And so in this
particular case, is there

00:33:03.657 --> 00:33:06.115
an advantage of doing STIRAP
as opposed to optical pumping?

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.410
PROFESSOR: Yes there is,
and we'll talk about that.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:24.080
There is a difference between
transferring population or only

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.490
transferring an amplitude.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:31.370
And so it depends what you want.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.430
If all you want is to
get the atoms from g

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:36.490
to f and you don't care how they
are heated up, so that's OK.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:40.000
But the STIRAP process
is a stimulated process,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.330
so you have momentum k and
here you have the momentum k2.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.290
So you take the atoms
from an initial state

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:52.080
and put them in a very
well-defined momentum state.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.560
So a PEC in one state
after STIRAP transfer

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.590
is in another
state, maybe if you

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.130
have the lasers in a
counter-propagating way

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:01.810
back to zero momentum.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:03.480
Whereas if you do
optical pumping, which

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.810
involves spontaneous
emission, then you always

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.110
have dissipation.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:08.620
You create entropy.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.679
And because spontaneous
emission goes into many modes,

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:17.100
you have many different recoils,
and eventually your final state

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.909
is no longer a single state.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:22.760
It has many different
momentum states involved.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.520
So that's why we've been talking
here about a coherent transfer,

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.380
sort of assuming
that optical pumping

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.340
with spontaneous emission
and the many modes involved

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.100
is not what you want
because of heating.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:40.289
OK, so lots of
interesting questions.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:57.520
First, let's now drop all
the assumptions we've made.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.040
So what happens when we
change from blue detuning

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:00.945
to red detuning?

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.535
Well, for blue detuning,
we use the argument

00:35:17.535 --> 00:35:20.350
that adiabetically we
stay in the ground state,

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.250
but for red detuning
it's a higher state,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.900
and we adiabetically
stay in the higher state.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.590
Same thing.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.570
What happens if f and
g are not degenerate?

00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:52.650
Well, the argument
is the following.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.600
It's the same result, and I
can quickly show that to you

00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:03.060
by saying use the
dressed state basis.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:18.280
You have the state g with Na
and Nb photons in laser beams.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.200
Let me be consistent.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.870
I call the operators
c and Na and Nc.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:26.950
And if you now look
at the state f,

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:33.230
which has one photon less
here and one photon more here,

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.880
those two states are degenerate.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.440
So I was just
showing the situation

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.185
if g and f are not
degenerate, here

00:36:44.185 --> 00:36:46.220
we have a laser beam
with Na photons.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.120
Here we have a laser
beam with Nc photons.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.390
If we include the photons
in our description,

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.590
we have a degeneracy.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.090
And that's what matters.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.180
But what is relevant
of course is

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.450
you have this degeneracy
only when the energy

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.980
difference between g and
f is the energy frequency

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.720
difference between
the two laser beams.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.410
So it is essential, and
you see that again here,

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:10.059
that the two photon
Raman resonance

00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:11.100
condition has to be made.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.030
So we've talked all the
assumptions so we know you can,

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.620
in a general system
you can transfer

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.960
between two hyperfine states.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.835
You can use red or
blue detuned laser.

00:37:27.835 --> 00:37:28.710
Everything is robust.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.520
OK.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:43.315
So STIRAP goes by the
name dark state transfer.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:51.280
And what I want
to address now is,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.650
what is the magic
which is going on?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:38:01.040
How can we transfer
from state g to state f

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.870
without going to
the excited state?

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.660
And the answer is--
I gave it already

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.850
to you-- it's not possible,
because the only couplings we

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.700
have are the two couplings
which I've shown.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.680
But-- and this is sort of the
gist you should carry away.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:29.980
Since the whole transfer
is a coherent process--

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.800
and I will be more
exact in a moment--

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.340
we are not building
up population

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.030
in the excited state.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.550
We're just building
up a small amplitude.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.925
And the population is the
small amplitude squared.

00:38:40.925 --> 00:38:43.520
It's, so to speak,
epsilon squared.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.860
And so you win one
power of epsilon,

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.040
one power of the
small amplitude,

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.850
if you do a coherent
transfer, as compared

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.050
to incoherent
transfer, which relies

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.450
on shuffling over population.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:00.005
And I want to show you
now how this pans out.

00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:00.505
Jenny?

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:05.170
AUDIENCE: But in the limit
of infinitely adiabetic,

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:11.880
infinitely slow, you still
would have the transfer happen

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.240
without ever going into
the excited state, right?

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.530
PROFESSOR: Well, I will show you
that the integrated population

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:23.850
in the excited state goes as
one over the transfer time.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.880
So if you allow an infinite
amount for the transfer,

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.630
you can make the population
[INAUDIBLE] slow.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.510
But ultimately, what
I also want to show

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:36.010
you is that how much you
put into the excited state

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:39.810
depends-- and I think this
is a very satisfying result

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.050
for me-- depends
on your resources.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.746
It depends on your laser power.

00:39:43.746 --> 00:39:45.120
if you have infinite
laser power,

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.180
you can keep the population
infinitesimally small.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.090
And if you have infinite time.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:52.510
But if you go to the lab and
do an experiment and say,

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.360
I want to be done
in 24 hours, well

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.200
this defines your time budget.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.580
And the strongest laser
you have in the laboratory

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.160
defines your laser power budget.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.410
And given those two resources,
there is a small amount.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.470
And I want to give you
an estimate for that.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:08.060
And then we have to discuss,
is that small amount,

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.180
which we get in STIRAP,
does that really

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:14.180
stand out over other methods
to transfer population?

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.665
And the answer will
be interesting.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.130
So let me just say, no.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:30.510
Excited state is needed
as a stepping stone.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:47.420
I want to give you
a quantitative touch

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.680
without doing too much math.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:56.070
So let me just write down
Schrodinger's equation.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:59.570
We have the three amplitudes,
the three states involved,

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.240
e, g, f.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.870
Schrodinger's equation gives
us the time derivative.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.470
c dot f.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:16.700
Since we assumed in the
dressed state picture,

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.860
we can assume everything
is degenerate.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.620
But now we have couplings.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.310
And the only couplings
are-- and this

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.140
is what I was emphasizing--
between ground and excited

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:33.820
state with the Rabi frequency
omega 1 and between the state f

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:38.700
and the excited state with
Rabi frequency omega 2.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.420
So the important part
is-- I can write it down,

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.640
but the third equation is
the one I want to focus,

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:59.000
that you can only build up
population in the final state

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.930
by transferring with
a Rabi frequency omega

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:06.940
two population from
the excited state.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.150
So let me just assume
that Rabi frequency omega

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:13.240
1 equals omega 2
equals omega Rabi.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.250
Let's have a symmetric situation
so I can now completely focus

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.150
how can you get from the excited
state to the final state,

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.750
but how you get from
the ground state,

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:25.240
from the state g to the excited
state is fairly symmetric here.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:32.100
OK, so what we want is we want
that at the end of the transfer

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.200
time, t transfer,
the final state

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.050
amplitude is on the order of 1.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.010
This would be 100%
percent transfer.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:44.060
So therefore, just looking
at the differential equation

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:56.360
above, that means
that this here has

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:04.200
to be 1 divided by
the transfer time.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.990
So therefore, we find that
for this adiabetic transfer,

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:11.920
the excited state
amplitude has to be--

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.900
and I neglect factors
on the order of 2

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:19.220
now-- has to be 1 over the Rabi
frequency times the transfer

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.910
time.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:26.110
So the probability to
be in the excited state

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:28.005
is the amplitude squared.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:33.870
And if you are asking, which I
think is a practical question

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:37.420
and I suggest to use this
as a figure of merit,

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:43.880
when we discuss how well, how
perfectly we have transferred

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.960
population, we can
now ask, what is

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.500
the probability of
spontaneous emission?

00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.160
P spontaneous is the probability
to be in the excited state

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.870
times gamma
integrated over time.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.130
So what we obtain
for that is yes,

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.040
it's proportionate to gamma.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.590
But we have the excited
state amplitude squared.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:20.490
We've multiplied with
the transfer time.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:24.990
So therefore, what we
have in the denominator

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.090
is the laser power
or the Rabi frequency

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:30.627
squared times the transfer time.

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:39.360
So therefore, this
probability to go

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.040
to a spontaneous emission,
which is also the integrated

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:48.320
probability of having
populated the excited state,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:55.010
it goes to 0 in the case that
you have infinite laser power

00:44:55.010 --> 00:45:00.018
or that you're
infinitely patient.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.260
So one question is, how long
can the transfer time be?

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:19.530
And this is actually
setting an limit to it.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.240
We're talking about
a coherent transfer.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:27.410
So the transfer time
has to be smaller

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:31.250
than the coherence
time of your system.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.250
For instance, we do that
all the time in my lab.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.900
If you go from on sublevel
to another sublevel,

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.210
and we have magnetic field
noise, if the magnetic field

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.480
noise is destroying the phase
relationship between the two

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.260
hyperfine states, then
the coherent transfer

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.705
gets interrupted, and
then eventually we

00:45:47.705 --> 00:45:49.455
are no longer talking
about the amplitude.

00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:54.260
We are talking about population
in the excited state.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:46:00.240
OK, so we have this result,
which at least demystifies what

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.680
many people say--
actually I've heard

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.980
truly experienced researchers
in the field to say,

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:09.340
we can do the transfer
without ever populating

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.800
the excited state.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.780
So the truth is what I
just derived for you.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.680
But now we want to
compare it to what

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.745
would happen if you use
an incoherent picture.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.950
If you use an
incoherent picture,

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.990
let's assume we
would use a pi pulse,

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:33.650
put all the population
in the excited state,

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.250
and then we would
stimulate it down.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.980
So we have a pi pulse.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.870
So we build our population.

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:49.768
And then we use a
second pi pulse.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:59.280
Well, we would then have about
unity population in the excited

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.742
state.

00:47:00.742 --> 00:47:05.950
It would emit light
at a rate gamma.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:10.790
And it would take the time of
the inverse Rabi frequency,

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:13.320
the Rabi period, to
stimulate it down.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.280
Now you can say, what
happens if-- maybe that's

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.750
dumb to have a pi pulse and
put all the population in, take

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:26.781
a pi over 20 pulse, put a little
bit population in, stimulate it

00:47:26.781 --> 00:47:27.280
down.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.980
The next batch, the next
batch, the next batch, but you

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.790
get exactly the same result,
because each population which

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:35.790
you've put into
the excited state

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:40.040
had to wait for a Rabi
period to be stimulated down.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.220
So therefore in the
incoherent picture,

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.690
if you sort of transfer
batches of population,

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:49.970
you realize that the probability
for spontaneous emission

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:53.340
or for populating a four state
is independent of the transfer

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:57.110
time, because it cancels out.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:59.770
If you do small
pieces of population,

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.900
you have a smaller
rate of emission,

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:04.330
but you integrate for longer
and the two temporal factors

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:05.450
cancel out.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.610
And now you realize that
the coherent transfer

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:13.234
is more favorable by another
power of omega Rabi times t

00:48:13.234 --> 00:48:14.400
transfer in the denominator.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.080
So that's why people
prefer STIRAP.

00:48:23.745 --> 00:48:24.620
Questions about that?

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.200
Can you suggest
another method how

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:42.840
we could transfer population
from one state to the next?

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.520
I gave you two examples.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:49.640
One was this magic, or not so
magic, dark state transfer.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.430
The other one is
a method where we

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.800
put population, stimulated it
down, next batch of population,

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.420
stimulate it down.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:02.125
What is another process which we
can do to transfer population?

00:49:02.125 --> 00:49:03.520
AUDIENCE: Landau-Zener?

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.270
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.330
AUDIENCE: Landau-Zener?

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:06.330
PROFESSOR: Landau-Zener?

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.970
Actually, the STIRAP
is a Landau-Zener.

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:13.370
The dark state is
always the lowest state.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:15.290
There is a crossing
sort of in between,

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:16.760
but it's an avoided crossing.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.170
Actually, in a way, you
may want to think about it.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.870
The STIRAP is actually
a Landau-Zener transfer

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:24.894
between where the lower
state is a dark state,

00:49:24.894 --> 00:49:26.310
the upper state
is a bright state.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:26.810
Will?

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:28.294
AUDIENCE: I still
have a question.

00:49:28.294 --> 00:49:39.454
So Landau-Zener [INAUDIBLE]
But the STIRAP scheme

00:49:39.454 --> 00:49:41.864
is sensitive to the
run-on resonance.

00:49:41.864 --> 00:49:43.030
PROFESSOR: Absolutely it is.

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.949
AUDIENCE: So how robust is
it against small violations

00:49:46.949 --> 00:49:47.448
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:52.327 --> 00:49:55.100
PROFESSOR: Well, I gave
you already the hint

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.760
when I discussed that if you
are detuned from the Raman

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.250
resonance, this detuning,
at the detuning frequency

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.460
would be between dark
and bright state.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:07.020
So this picture what is
dark and what is bright

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.900
is scrambled up by that.

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.400
So in other words,
as long as you're

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:16.400
inverse detuning is smaller than
the transfer time, you're OK.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.280
Because the dark state
is the dark state.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.210
But if during the transfer
time you turn the dark state

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:22.955
into a bright state,
you've completely

00:50:22.955 --> 00:50:23.830
messed up the scheme.

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:31.180
So in other words, I know people
in this hallway, in my group

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.270
want to STIRAP transfer
between molecules.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.420
And we have to
stabilize our lasers.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.210
So we have automatically
little bit laser fluctuations.

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:41.630
But if you do the
transfer in a millisecond,

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:44.560
it is sufficient to have the
laser frequency under control

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.220
at the kilohertz level.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.440
So that's a requirement.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.320
But back to my question.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.365
We have discussed sort
of an incoherent transfer

00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:53.920
and we've discussed STIRAP.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.500
Can you suggest
another method how

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.351
you can go from one
count state to the next?

00:51:08.091 --> 00:51:10.039
AUDIENCE: We talked
about optical pumping.

00:51:10.039 --> 00:51:12.470
PROFESSOR: Optical pumping?

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.580
Yes, but optical
pumping means we

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.120
really go with
spontaneous emission.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.780
And then we have 100%
spontaneous emission.

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:22.330
So we want a process where
we go from one momentum state

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:23.490
to another momentum state.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.040
Well--

00:51:29.926 --> 00:51:31.144
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:31.144 --> 00:51:32.940
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.939
Optical pumping is a
two-photon process.

00:51:34.939 --> 00:51:36.980
Actually, everything's a
two-photon process here.

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.480
But optical pumping
is actually a process

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.000
where we have a Raman
to photon transition.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.670
The first leg is stimulated.

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:46.440
The second one is spontaneous.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.770
But I would suggest now
what [INAUDIBLE] said,

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:51.240
let's have a two photon
Raman transition.

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:11.010
So we want to go from state g
to state f with two photon Raman

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:12.900
transition.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.770
Let's assume we have
a detuning delta.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.420
So now, do you have
any expectations

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:25.130
whether these-- we
can do a pi pulse.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:28.925
Two photon Raman transition is
a two photon Rabi frequency.

00:52:28.925 --> 00:52:30.710
I'll remind you
in a second of it.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.310
And if you do a
pi pulse in that,

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:34.290
we have half a Rabi
oscillation, which

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:38.840
takes us from cg to f and
we have 100% transfer.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.390
So do you have an
expectation if this Raman

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:47.450
process how will it turn out
to be in our figure of merit,

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.560
how many photons are
emitted from the excited

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.500
state during the transfer?

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.180
Will it be the same as STIRAP?

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.830
Will it be the same as
in population transfer?

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:03.265
Will it be something else?

00:53:03.265 --> 00:53:06.151
AUDIENCE: You have to scale.

00:53:06.151 --> 00:53:08.660
PROFESSOR: It will
scale with the detuning,

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:12.650
but-- OK, what I will do is
actually-- I will in a moment

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:13.650
say, OK.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:14.930
We have a certain laser.

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:18.840
What I'm going to say?

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.260
We have to compare
apples with apples.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.860
And here we have the
detuning as a parameter.

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.640
And what I want to
replace is I will--

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:29.090
what will replace the
detuning by the time it

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:32.450
takes to do the pi pulse.

00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:35.670
So the detuning is
determined by the condition

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:39.430
that we want to do the transfer
in the same time as the STIRAP.

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:42.210
So this will eliminate
the detuning.

00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:44.330
So we want to use
the same resources.

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:47.100
Our resources are
time and laser power.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.520
And we want to use our resources
of time and laser power

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.120
in the same way for the
two photon transition.

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:58.380
So the question is
what happens to-- what

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:01.760
is the answer to the question,
how much excited state is

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:07.226
involved in the two photon Raman
process as compared to STIRAP?

00:54:07.226 --> 00:54:08.350
Do you have an expectation?

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:18.060
Who of you is doing
STIRAP in the laboratory?

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:21.080
A few people, yeah.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.170
Actually, I know that
99-- my observation

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:28.850
is that 99% of the people
say STIRAP is special

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:31.870
because it's a dark
state transfer.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:35.770
And when I started to confront
famous people in the field

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:39.039
and say the two photon Raman
process does exactly the same,

00:54:39.039 --> 00:54:40.330
they were completely surprised.

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.590
Anyway I want to show
you in one equation

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:47.680
that the two photon
Raman process has

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.580
exactly the same integrated
population in the excited

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:56.520
state, and therefore it is as
good-- the two photon Raman

00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:01.740
process performs exactly as
well as the so-called dark state

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:05.350
transfer, where you never go
through the excited state.

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:07.870
And this for me
completely demystifies it,

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:09.520
because the two
photon Raman process

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.220
has in common with the STIRAP
that everything is coherent.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.820
And if everything
is coherent, it

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.410
means we are not
building a population.

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:23.480
We are only building up
amplitude in the excited state.

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.330
So let me just show
you in one equation

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:28.070
that indeed it works
out in that way.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:32.520
It's also a nice way
to quickly recapitulate

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.640
what we learned in
the previous chapter

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.330
about two photon transitions.

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:40.440
So the two photon Rabi
frequency is nothing else

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.280
than the product of the two
Rabi frequencies divided

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:45.270
by the detuning.

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:49.810
And of course as-- if you
use studied larger and larger

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.600
detuning as you said,
everything will slow down.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:57.610
But we know that
the transfer time

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:03.120
will be the inverse of the
two photon Rabi frequency.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.310
And this is delta
over omega square.

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:10.260
So therefore, we will eliminate
delta from our equations

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:16.540
by replacing it by
the time it will

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:22.290
take to perform a pi pulse
between the two ground states.

00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:27.860
OK, so what is the probability
to be in the excited state?

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.330
Well, we've done the theory
of the ac-Stark effect.

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:32.870
We have beaten perturbation
theory to death.

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:35.120
You know the first
order admixture

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.465
is omega Rabi over delta
and the probability

00:56:38.465 --> 00:56:41.610
is omega Rabi squared
over delta squared.

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:46.620
So therefore, the probability
to spontaneously emit a photon

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:51.820
is omega Rabi squared over delta
squared times gamma times t

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.780
transfer.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:57:00.430
And this is nothing else than
gamma divided by omega Rabi

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:04.210
squared times t transfer.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:07.020
So if you use a Raman pulse
to transfer the population

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:11.610
coherently, the
integrated population

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:14.410
of the excited state, which is a
measure for heating and measure

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:17.220
for winding up in the
wrong state, emission

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:20.410
to a false state is inversely
proportional to your laser

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.840
power and inversely
proportional to the time

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.940
you can afford to
do the transfer.

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:30.300
Exactly the same as for STIRAP.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.890
And the limit to the
transfer time in both cases

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:34.503
is set by the coherence time.

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:44.140
Try to tell people who do
STIRAP that a two photon Raman

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.290
pulse would do exactly
the same as STIRAP,

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:48.900
at least in populating
the excited state.

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.210
They will be surprised.

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:53.460
Because here, you explicitly
go through the excited state.

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.570
We don't have a
counter-intuitive sequence.

00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:58.800
We switch on both
lasers simultaneously.

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.560
But I think this for me
illustrates or completely

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.030
demystifies what people have
said about the dark state

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:07.670
transfer and the STIRAP process.

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:13.410
Any question?

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:13.910
Cody?

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.544
AUDIENCE: Why do
people use STIRAP?

00:58:16.544 --> 00:58:17.915
What's the advantage?

00:58:17.915 --> 00:58:22.440
PROFESSOR: Well, why are you
using Landau-Zener sweeps when

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.650
you go from one hyperfine
state to the next,

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:27.599
and why don't you use a pi
pulse with your f generator,

00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:28.640
because it's more robust.

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.634
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:35.350
As you said [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:39.688 --> 00:58:43.090
PROFESSOR: But similar,
if you detune--

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:47.430
if you detune your-- the
condition is the same.

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:50.540
If you have your two Raman
laser and you detune them,

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:53.720
you no longer have
resonant Rabi oscillations.

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.170
You have off-resonant
Rabi oscillations.

00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:00.040
And you will find if you want
to do the transfer in half

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:04.560
a period, you have to
make sure that you don't

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.840
get one cycle of
the beat node or one

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.270
cycle of the detuning
in your transfer time.

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:13.290
So the condition for the
frequency stability for the two

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:15.860
photon Raman and
the STIRAP I think

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:18.970
are pretty exactly identical.

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:20.890
So I think it's pretty
much the robustness.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:25.070
And you have to decide what
you need and what you want.

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:28.120
For instance, if you have laser
beam and the laser beam has

00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:31.660
an inhomogeneous profile,
you cannot meet the pi pulse

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:34.350
condition for the atoms in
the middle and at the edge

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:35.400
of your laser beam.

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:39.060
But in STIRAP you just
provide plenty of extra power

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:43.140
and then everything is robust
against the laser beam profile.

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.832
So there are clearly
advantages like that.

00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:48.390
But all what I point
out is the advantage

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:51.660
is not the population
of the excited state.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:54.300
It's the same.

00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:54.800
Questions?

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:02.150
OK.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:09.550
So this is dark
state and STIRAP.

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:20.290
Our next topic is lasing
or gain without inversion.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:43.100
So in other words,
I want to show you

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.200
what was actually rather
recent accomplishment

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:58.090
that this common belief that you
need population in the excited

01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:00.980
state, which is larger
in the ground state,

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:12.680
for optical gain and
lasing is not true.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.730
Well, it's true for
two level system,

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:17.460
but it's not true when you
have more than two levels.

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.300
And I discuss it here for the
case of a three-level system.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.515
And this is really insight which
came as recent as in the '80s.

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:34.310
One reference is the person
who pioneered a lot of work

01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:37.310
on three-level systems and
provided a lot of insight

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.640
was Steve Harris at Stanford.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:47.520
And this was a paper
in the late '80s which

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.600
enunciated the
possibility of having

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.460
lasing without inversion.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.890
And when you are a
graduate student like me,

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:58.290
who was educated earlier,
you say, gee whiz.

01:01:58.290 --> 01:01:59.910
That's not what I
learned in class.

01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:02.100
But of course it's
often the small sprint.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.130
It's the assumption
for two-level system.

01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:10.760
So the secret behind
lasing without inversion

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:20.534
is that you can have
cancellation of absorption

01:02:20.534 --> 01:02:21.200
by interference.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:30.930
In other words, this belief
that you need inversion

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:34.620
comes that you want that
the stimulated emission is

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.830
stronger than the absorption.

01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:40.060
But if you have a three-level
system, you have to be careful.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.170
We have interference effect.

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:45.910
And what I want to show you is
that we can create a situation

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:49.580
where we have destructive
interference for absorption,

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.740
but we don't have
destructive interference

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:53.820
for stimulated emission.

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:59.320
So therefore, we can now
afford to have more population

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:03.390
in the ground state, because
the absorption out of the ground

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:06.810
state does not have to be
suppressed by minimizing

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:08.700
the population in
the ground state.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.420
We have an interference effect,
which suppresses absorption

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.131
from the ground
state population.

01:03:14.131 --> 01:03:15.880
And therefore, the
ground state population

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.950
can be larger than in
a two-level system.

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.030
I could simply tell you
you can hide population

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:28.200
in the dark state,
end of discussion,

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.880
and you get the basic idea.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.400
But the concept of
lasing without inversion

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.380
is richer than that.

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.330
It's connected to the dark
state, but there is more to it.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:40.690
So that's why I want to spend
the rest of today's class

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.490
in discussing this concept.

01:03:55.870 --> 01:04:03.100
So I want to discuss it in
the simplest possible scheme.

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:12.355
So I want to discuss
first the simple system.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:17.880
In the end, this
is not the system

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.670
in which it has
been accomplished.

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:23.470
But I think what you
realize is I draw you

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:24.830
up a very simple scheme.

01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:27.700
I make all assumptions,
and there is maybe

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:31.100
no atomic, no suitable atom
where you can realize it.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.420
But then I will do what I've
done so often in this class.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.510
I turn around and say, but if
you go to a tri-state basis,

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.300
we can exactly engineer that.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.140
So in other words, if you
need a certain level scheme

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.510
and you don't get it, you
can just take another level,

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.450
put it there with a strong
laser as a virtual level,

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:50.320
and you get the level
scheme you want.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.860
And in a dress
state description,

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.620
you have exactly
the idealized level

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.050
scheme I'm presenting to you.

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:00.330
So therefore with
that justification,

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:05.400
let me just try to give
you the simple scheme where

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:11.512
you can understand
this absorption

01:05:11.512 --> 01:05:12.720
cancellation by interference.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.820
I mean, later in
the end, we want

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.140
to use lambda systems
with two stable ground

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.660
state, two hyperfine states.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.440
That's how all the
research is done.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.005
But now I assume
we have a V system.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:37.080
So we have two excited states
and we have one ground state.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:47.170
And I want to assume that by
coupling through radiation,

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:51.650
spontaneous emission,
those excited states

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:56.320
couple to the same continuum.

01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:10.330
I want to say that this is
an important assumption.

01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:13.910
If you have two states,
hyperfine states,

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:16.080
n equals plus 1,
n equals minus 1,

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.490
which would emit photons
of different circular

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:20.450
polarization, no.

01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:22.480
They are not coupling
to the same continuum.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.620
They would be distinguishable,
and then certain interference

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.430
effects will not happen.

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.660
So eventually, the magic
of quantum interference

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.230
comes if it is absolutely
indistinguishable

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:35.240
which excited state
has emitted the photon.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.650
So we have to really be--
set up something like this.

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:48.330
So it must be fundamentally
impossible to distinguish

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:52.150
photons emitted through
one state or the other.

01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:56.810
So we know already if
we treat the system,

01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:59.840
we couple the atoms
to the continuum.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:02.500
That means in the
end, that those states

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.925
acquire a certain width.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:14.510
And yes, this is a situation
we want to discuss.

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:21.180
So what we have set
up now is a situation

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:26.950
where we have, with
these two states, two

01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:36.280
indistinguishable paths
to scatter photons.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:44.450
So let's say we take
the ground state

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:45.980
and we shine laser light on it.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.260
It's a two photon process.

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:51.510
A photon goes in,
a photon comes out.

01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:55.100
And we can now go
through excited state 1,

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:58.300
through excited state out
then a photon comes out

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:03.480
and eventually we have now the
coupled through this two photon

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.085
process the ground state
to continuum of modes.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.910
But those two processes
to go through e1 and e2

01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:13.640
are indistinguishable.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.890
So I will give you
immediately an expression

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:19.204
where in perturbation theory,
we are not adding intensities.

01:08:19.204 --> 01:08:21.050
We are adding the
two amplitudes.

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:24.649
It's like a
double-slit experiment.

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:31.300
Or in other words, the
situation I want to discuss now

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:33.170
is the following.

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:36.330
We have all of the population
in the ground state.

01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:41.790
We have the two excited states.

01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:45.000
And our laser is
tuned in between.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.319
And now we can scatter light.

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:48.510
We've talked about really
scattering and such.

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:51.470
And you know that for an
infinitely heavy atom,

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:55.359
the emitted radiation is a delta
function at the incident light.

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:57.010
And you will not
know, you can never

01:08:57.010 --> 01:09:01.779
know which excited state was
involved in the scattering.

01:09:01.779 --> 01:09:06.180
So we assume that
we have excited

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.180
state-- which one
is the lower one?

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.510
I think e1.

01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:12.550
This is e2.

01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:16.250
And our laser beam is detuned.

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:20.810
We have a detuning of delta
1 and delta 2 respectively.

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:32.040
So now we have to add amplitudes
when we do perturbation theory.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:42.901
So in second order
perturbation theory,

01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:45.040
for the light
scattering, if you want

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.170
to derive Fermi's golden rule as
we have done a number of times

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:53.790
here, you remember,
the critical part--

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.800
I'm not writing down the whole
expression-- the critical part

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.110
is sort of a product of two
matrix element or two photon

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:04.940
matrix element which takes
us from the ground state

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:08.740
through the light atom
coupling to the excited state.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:14.360
And then from the excited state
why are the coupling eventually

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.880
back to the ground state, which
is now a continuum of modes.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.730
And we sum over
all possible modes.

01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:26.750
And what we have here is
the detuning denominator.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:31.950
Well, if you want to
do a little bit better,

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:34.200
I'm just mentioning
here for completeness,

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.655
we want to add the
imaginary part.

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:44.050
That's more placeholder for a
command I want to make later.

01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:45.580
It's not really essential.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.110
But the new thing I
want to discuss now

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:53.750
is that since we have two
excited states and not one,

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:57.301
we have to sum over
the two excited states,

01:10:57.301 --> 01:10:58.300
and it's a coherent sum.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:18.370
So if I detune between-- if
my laser detuning is tuned

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:21.820
in between, then
delta 1 is positive

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.090
and delta 2 is negative.

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:28.650
So therefore, we do a sum
here with opposite signs.

01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:32.580
And if I can neglect the
gamma, assuming the gamma

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.180
is small or much smaller
than the detuning,

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:41.030
then I'm just adding up two
numbers with opposite sign.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:46.140
And depending now on the matrix
element, if they're identical

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.260
I get a cancellation if
I'm detuning half between.

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.650
But even if the matrix
element are different,

01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:55.500
I will always find a
detuning where the sum is 0.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:03.550
So to the extent that I can
neglect the imaginary part,

01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:08.080
the gamma in the denominator,
I have now this situation

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.660
that this is 0.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:28.910
It vanishes for a certain
laser frequency, omega 0,

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:35.152
tuned between the
levels e1 and e2.

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:48.910
And what I've assumed here is
that the detunings are larger

01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:53.700
than the decay widths, and
therefore I can neglect that.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:54.920
Any questions about that?

01:12:57.730 --> 01:12:58.230
So OK.

01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:00.170
Very trivially,
two excited states

01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:01.660
which are indistinguishable.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.540
It's the modern
version of Feynman's

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.950
double-slit experiment.

01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:09.850
We add up the amplitudes
and by necessity, we get 0.

01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:14.870
But that sounds so trivial,
but it took a Steve Harris,

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:19.080
some genius person to
invent it, to realize

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:28.680
that when we have light at omega
0, it would be absorbed by e1.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.910
It would be absorbed by e2.

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:35.845
But it is not absorbed
in the situation

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:39.860
we have with e1 and e2.

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:46.270
But now we have to make the
connection that the statement

01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:50.670
that we need inversion
for lasing was related

01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:54.210
to absorption, but now we
have cancelled absorption.

01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:56.850
So now what we want
to do is we want

01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:00.090
to create a situation
where we have lasing.

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:03.400
We want to put population
into the excited state.

01:14:06.670 --> 01:14:11.630
But the population
in this excited state

01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:14.940
will be much, much smaller than
the population in the ground

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.510
state.

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:18.680
So you're not even
close to inversion.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.660
So let me draw the diagram.

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.600
We have lots and lots
and lots and lots

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.300
of population in
the ground state.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:34.800
We have 0 population in e1.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:44.100
And in e2, we just
have a little bit.

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:48.610
And now you would say, well,
you don't have inversion.

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:50.660
How can you get lasing?

01:14:50.660 --> 01:15:00.620
But if we have now a cavity
at frequency omega 0,

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:09.550
then you can say the Lorentzian
profile of the excited state e2

01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:11.730
overlaps with omega 0.

01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:15.850
So at least you have some
possibility for the excited

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:20.510
state e2 to decay
into the cavity mode.

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:24.220
And therefore, a very weak
field in the cavity mode

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.260
will be amplified by
stimulated emission

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:29.800
without suffering
any absorption.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.490
So therefore it will be
amplified and we have gain.

01:15:37.670 --> 01:15:41.310
So if you have a
cavity at omega 0,

01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:52.778
we have gain because we have
some stimulated emission

01:15:52.778 --> 01:15:56.178
at omega 0 but no absorption.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.600
Of course, if you
would tune your cavity

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:06.540
to be in a resonance
with e2, you

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:09.000
would have more
stimulated emission,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.720
but you would have
much more absorption

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.470
and you would not be able to
get a net gain for a small probe

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.970
field.

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:16.675
So you would not have lasing.

01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:22.970
So you can say that what
we have achieved here

01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:28.660
in a three-level system,
we have accomplished

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:32.810
destructive interference
for absorption.

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:36.340
But the way how we've put
population just in e2,

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:39.270
we have not any
destructive interference

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:40.860
for the stimulated gain.

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.420
So we have tweaked on
the lasing equation,

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.730
on the laser equation
the absorption part,

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:48.345
but not the stimulated
emission part by interference

01:16:48.345 --> 01:16:49.626
in a three-level system.

01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:58.258
So how can this be realized?

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:11.310
Let me just give you the
first possible realization

01:17:11.310 --> 01:17:15.210
and then I think we should stop.

01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:17.380
We could, in
principle, realize it

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:21.370
with hydrogen and a
DC electric field.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:30.830
Remember, hydrogen has the
1s level, has the 2s level,

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:33.970
and the 2p state.

01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:38.260
And you all had a nice, little
nice homework assignment

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:44.320
that when you have a DC field,
you actually couple 2s and 2p.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:52.050
And if your DC field is
stronger than the Lamb shift,

01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:58.780
you actually create
a superposition

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.910
of 2s and 2p states.

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:08.427
And now, if you tune your
laser right in between,

01:18:08.427 --> 01:18:09.510
you have a dark resonance.

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:19.230
So the situation
is if I would now

01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:24.960
plot the absorption
versus frequency,

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.020
you would find that if you're in
resonance with the upper state

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.750
you absorb, but then
even in between,

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:37.790
there is this notch where
you have zero absorption.

01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:39.650
So for this simple
case with hydrogen

01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:42.690
in a DC electric field,
the dark resonance

01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:47.180
occurs when you
have equal detuning.

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:50.450
You have an equal detuning
for the atom with respect

01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:52.290
to the two states.

01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:57.770
And I like to sort of connect
it to classical physics.

01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:01.050
You know that
absorption is related.

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:04.416
When you absorb, you
have light scattering.

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:05.790
The photons are
not disappearing.

01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:07.470
They're just scattered
into other modes.

01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:09.250
That's what absorption is about.

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:11.850
And classically,
light scattering

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:15.300
comes because you have an
oscillating dipole moment.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.780
But what happens is if you have
this coherent superposition

01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:22.590
and you're right in between,
you have a positive detuning

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:25.430
with one harmonic oscillator
and a negative detuning

01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:27.430
with the other
harmonic oscillator.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:32.030
So if you drive an harmonic
oscillator-- and this is one

01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:34.780
and this is the other--
with positive detuning,

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:37.340
with red detuning,
the dipole moment

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.460
is in phase with
the electric field.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.830
In the other case,
it's out of phase.

01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:44.460
So now you have the
two excited states

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:48.800
and you're driving two equal
but opposite dipole moments

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.560
in those two states.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:55.590
And therefore, the two
dipole moments add up to 0.

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:58.235
Therefore the laser, just
using our understanding

01:19:58.235 --> 01:20:00.610
of a simple harmonic
oscillator, is not

01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:02.230
creating any dipole moment.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:04.110
Therefore, we're not
scattering any light

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:07.540
and therefore we're not
absorbing any light.

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:10.950
So this is how you can now
realize in the hydrogen atom

01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:14.540
using DC magnetic field and
creating this level structure,

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:17.960
you can create lasing
without inversion.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.646
But I will tell you
on Wednesday-- no,

01:20:21.646 --> 01:20:23.020
today is Wednesday--
next Monday,

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.390
next week that we
don't have to deal

01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:27.270
with the difficulties
of hydrogen atoms

01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:28.400
in the laboratory.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.610
We can just use our
favorite alkalize

01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:33.450
and dress the alkalize
up with laser beams

01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:36.280
and eventually create
the same situation

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.770
with an atom which
is experimentally

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:41.420
much simpler to address.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.085
Any questions?

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:47.380
OK, one more week to go.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:49.530
See you on Monday.

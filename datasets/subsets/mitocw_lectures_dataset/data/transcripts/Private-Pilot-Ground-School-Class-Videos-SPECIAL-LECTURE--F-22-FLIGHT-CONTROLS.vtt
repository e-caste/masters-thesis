WEBVTT

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.220
RANDY GORDON: Well,
guys, you have

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.500
picked the coolest independent
activities period class you

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.800
could ever do at ground school.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.900
This is the most
awesome thing possible

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.550
when I saw the course offerings.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.680
So kudos to Tina and
Phil for teaching this.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.970
This is a good, good.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.110
Gig.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.340
I go by Laz.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.780
It's a fighter pilot thing.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.110
All fighter pilots
have call signs.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.950
They're not like what
you see in the movies.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.500
By the way, Top Gun is the worst
movie for any fighter pilot

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.000
to watch.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.660
It's terrible, drives you crazy.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.400
No one is called
Maverick because they're

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.440
the most awesome thing on
the face of the planet.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.940
Never happens that way.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.680
You're always named
for something silly.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.120
So the previous discussion
about crew resource management,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.620
if you're a single seat, you
still have air traffic control,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.470
you have other guys, I am living
proof that that's 100% true.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.640
So I won't get into it too
much, but suffice to say,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.560
if you know the biblical
story of Lazarus,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.720
you know a lot about
how I got my name,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.810
and I'll leave it at that.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.060
Normally that's over
a beer afterwards.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.600
So we're here to talk about
F-22 flight control stuff.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.090
I'm going to give you the
punch line right at the start.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.610
I'm here to tell you that
everything you're learning-- so

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.460
who's actually flown airplanes
here already, like sailplanes?

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.990
So a lot of guys.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.900
So first time then for
probably the other half

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.900
of the class or so.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.400
So here's what I'm
here to tell you.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.200
The same stuff that
you're learning

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.680
with respect to Cessnas and
all this stuff with respect

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.030
to the ground school, there's
no difference between this

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.350
and between my beloved Raptor.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.590
It's the same thing.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.900
So there's great relevance.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.060
And you as MIT guys
have the ability

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.660
to derive and figure out
what makes the Raptor look

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.160
the way that it does, and we
can talk a lot about the flight

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.770
controls.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.660
It's not cosmic.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.740
We can go through that.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.910
So with that, they always
have the standard personal

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.440
background slide.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.259
Here's the gig.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.390
I'll keep it really simple.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.290
I am a test pilot, which
means I am a fighter pilot

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.730
and I'm also an engineer.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.560
It means I like Beavis
and Butthead greatly,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.720
and I read Carl Sagan.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.440
It's the same thing to me.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.020
So as a fighter
test pilot, you live

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.980
in the world of being
a fighter pilot,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.070
but you also have the
ability to understand Matlab

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.040
and to be able to do cool
neat MIT-ish kind of things.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.540
Because all of the
stuff that you're

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.329
working with as a test
pilot are brand new things--

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.810
new weapons, new avionics,
new airplanes, in some cases.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.650
And that's not the world
of a fighter pilot.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.290
Fighter pilots are exceptionally
good at taking this airplane

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.630
to combat and doing the normal
kind of missions with it.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.490
But when there's
something new on board,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.170
that requires an engineer.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.780
So I have a deep,
deep connection

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.710
with this institution.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.130
I finished up here
last year in 2018.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.300
I've done a whole bunch of
other kind of funky stuff

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.920
along the way.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.400
Two combat tours.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.320
That was a lot of fun.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.400
I'll tell you, flying is
one of my great passions.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.550
Flying and getting
shot at and missed

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.960
is my second great passion.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.020
That's much cooler.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.320
And then when you can fly
and you can use that airplane

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.720
to actually protect
people from bad guys,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.880
that's life-fulfilling to go
get a chance to go do that.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.760
So we can talk a little bit
more through that as well.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.310
Test pilots, we get a chance to
fly a lot of different stuff.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.420
So you'll see this 76
different airplanes.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.450
That might sound weird
to the rest of the world,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.790
but in the world of flight
test, that's pretty normal.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.350
And the reason
that's there is it's

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.250
just like-- look, by the
way, warning to the class,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.460
I talk a lot in terms of movies,
Game of Thrones, or whatever,

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.010
television shows and sports
because no matter where

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.230
you come from, those
three topics always

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.700
tend to bring
everybody all together.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.300
So it is just like what you--

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.390
when you've gone car shopping
and you sit in this car and go,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.940
oh, man, I really like the
way this steering wheel feels

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.770
but I hate the way
the radio is set up,

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.680
and you go to another
car and you go, oh, man,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.020
this is great from the sunroof
or whatever but this stinks.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.900
That same kind of
discernment that you

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.630
have when you're shopping
for cars, this airplane

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.160
is a couple hundred
million dollars.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.579
You don't want to
be wrong about that,

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.370
and so you want your
test pilots very, very

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.380
experienced in a lot
of different airplanes.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.360
So I've got a chance
to fly helicopters--

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.080
spectacular.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.590
In pilot training,
I don't know why,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.160
but we send our worst
pilot training students

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.100
to helicopters.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.000
It's the dumbest idea because
helicopters are really, really

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.310
challenging to go fly.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.060
But we've had a chance
to fly helicopters.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.279
Your discussion, Tina,
earlier about right of way,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.820
I was laughing with
that because I've

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.820
flown a Zeppelin, an airship.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.940
It's quite spectacular.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.140
It's a big Lab-Z-Boy couch
with a big trim wheel

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.450
and big engines that actually
pivot on the outside,

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.830
so you can turn the
whole ship based on that.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.680
That's pretty normal
for being a test pilot,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.020
is getting a chance to fly a
lot of different airplanes,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.810
more so than just one particular
airplane your whole life.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.140
Most of my stuff is in fighters.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.740
So I've flown every
frontline fighter

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.330
with the exception of the F-35.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.510
Hopefully I'll fix that soon,
shortly, in a few months.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.310
But a lot of stuff.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.550
So MIT guy, Harvard guy.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.180
Did some stuff.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.430
It's been a good life.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.730
Really, at the end of the
day what I want to impress on

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.710
you is I am 100% zero different
from anybody in this room.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.720
I just have more
battle scars on me

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.430
just from a lifetime
of doing this.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.850
I started off flying Cessnas.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.520
I did that for several
years of my life.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.360
I still do it.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.380
I love it.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.340
Fly sailplanes.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.290
Still do it, love it.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.660
And all the stuff that
you learn with this

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.180
has direct applicability to
the more advanced fighter

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.780
airplanes.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.870
In fact, I'll tell you,
this is actually harder

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.780
to fly than the Raptor, and
we'll talk a little bit more

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.260
about that as we go through.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.760
All right.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.030
So more fun and games.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.530
All right.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.640
So now comes the class
participation part.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.950
My talks are very interactive.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.530
I love hearing what
you guys think.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.150
So we'll do a quick
thought exercise.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.100
I'll try and keep a mental
note because I stink

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.480
at writing on a chalkboard.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.730
But we'll chat through this
just so you can understand

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.409
that there's really not that
much difference from what

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.780
you're learning now to go off
to do something like that.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.560
So why does a Cessna look
the way that it does?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.020
And why does a Raptor
look the way that it does?

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.320
What were the
engineers trying to do?

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.380
And just call them out.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.680
No real-- go ahead, just shoot.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Raptor.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.560
RANDY GORDON: OK.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.230
So explain.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.420
AUDIENCE: You have way more
area that's clear [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.980
RANDY GORDON: So you
brought up two things.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.600
One is the position
of the wing, right.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.620
So in a Cessna, the
wings are obviously--

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.870
well, in a lot of airplanes,
really, not just Cessnas.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.100
But in the Cessna,
the wings are directly

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.870
above you, big Hershey bar wing.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.870
Why did they put the wings
this way in a Cessna?

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.270
You're doing great so far.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.310
Keep going, man.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.960
PROFESSOR: I'm going
to answer that.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.960
Get in or out of a
Cirrus in heavy rain,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.810
and you will immediately see
the value of that Cessna wing.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.190
RANDY GORDON:
Yeah, they did this

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.740
so that my wife doesn't yell at
me in bad weather conditions,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.240
so that you can get
inside the airplane

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.560
with not getting completely wet.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.970
The other part
about the high wing

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.450
is it's great for
visibility, looking down.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.240
Where this is terrible
is if you're turning

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.200
and you have to be able
to see through the wing

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.830
because you're kind
of doing the old--

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.620
looking over the side
to see out the outside.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.260
So that's one
advantage over Raptor.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.100
It's not a high wing or a--
it's kind of a mid wing,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.600
if you will.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.750
But that wing is well after
the cockpit for what reason?

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.990
AUDIENCE: Visibility.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.460
RANDY GORDON: Visibility, yeah.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.030
That's the big, huge reason why.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.740
And then you also brought up
the idea of the swept wings.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.330
Why the swept wings compared
to, say, straight wings?

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.830
AUDIENCE: Well, wouldn't they
have an aerodynamic advantage?

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.530
RANDY GORDON: OK.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.790
What's that advantage?

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.870
AUDIENCE: Something
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.740
RANDY GORDON: Close.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.240
I'll stop picking on you because
you're bold and went first.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.740
Go ahead.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.700
AUDIENCE: Mach.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.140
RANDY GORDON: Yeah, Mach.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.970
So explain Mach.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.960
AUDIENCE: The closer you
get to the speed of sound,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.620
the more compressibility
is important.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.370
RANDY GORDON: Yep.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.220
AUDIENCE:
Aerodynamically, the wing

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.930
really behaves like it's going
at the speed normal to leading

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.430
edge.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.220
RANDY GORDON: Yeah.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.780
So you ever see those
old, the first jet

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.460
airplanes that came out?

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.350
The wings on the
jet airplanes had

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.320
wings that looked exactly like
this, and that was a problem.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.570
I'm going to do something I
said I wouldn't try to do,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.480
but I'll try to do it.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.340
So here's your swept wing.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.950
Here's the arrows that
come over the wing.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.260
And then what ends up
happening is, really

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.440
what you care about is
the air that's going over

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.660
top of the wing, that's normal
to the chord line of the wing

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.160
itself.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.960
You know what I mean
when I say chord?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.230
Just like this imaginary line.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.310
So on a Hershey bar wing,
all of that air hits the wing

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.920
and it goes directly over top
of that chord line of the wing.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.260
So like when we talked
about over here,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.790
the wings have camber.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.000
So what happens to the air as
it goes over top of any wing?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.299
Doesn't matter if it's a
fighter wing or whatever else.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.490
But what happens to the velocity
of the air as it goes over top?

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.150
It goes faster, right.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.640
So if I'm already going
fast and air hits my wing

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.220
and goes over top of
my wing and goes faster

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.160
than the rest of
the airplane, that's

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.950
going to cause a problem when
you get to very high speeds

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.330
approaching Mach because what
ends up happening is you'll

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.250
get a shockwave
forming on that wing.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.590
And the moment you get a
shockwave form in there, that's

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.710
like a big brick
wall to the wind

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.690
and that causes all
types of drag downstream,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.800
slows down the airplane,
all types of things.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.920
So what they found is
I can sweep the wing.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.560
When I sweep the
wing, some of that air

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.790
is normal to the chord line.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.160
So if this is the fuselage
over here, and here's the wing

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.420
and it comes back over
here, some of that air

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.330
is going to be that way,
and some of that air

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.020
is going to actually go out
and go span-wise, if you will,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.710
like this.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.210
So I'm trying to
draw this correctly

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.850
to get the right angles.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.340
But you get my point.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.680
So some of that
air goes span-wise.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.230
Some of the reasons
why you have wing

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.410
winglets, right, to prevent
some of that drag that

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.410
happens at the winglets.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.610
But then also what
you're worried about

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.680
is rather than the full
component of this wind,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.450
you're only worried
about the wind

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.510
that's normal to the flow of the
way the chord line is set up.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.190
So that's why they
sweep the wings.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.690
OK.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.420
So what else?

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.770
Why does a Cessna look this way?

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.980
Why does this look like that?

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.500
Go ahead.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.530
Yeah, go ahead, both.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.490
AUDIENCE: Stealth and
payload and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.810
RANDY GORDON: OK, so stealth.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.070
Payload is an important thing.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.930
Let's talk about the
payload for a second.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.340
Actually, we'll
talk about stealth

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.820
since you brought it up.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.880
So look at that
plan form, and what

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.640
do you notice with
regards to stealth?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.120
AUDIENCE: It's all angles.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.460
RANDY GORDON: All angles, right.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.200
That angle, that
angle, that angle.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.290
AUDIENCE: No right angles.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.930
RANDY GORDON: Yeah,
no right angles.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.950
So the reason is--

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.880
and I'll do my high
tech pizza aid here.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.710
So who's Double E in here?

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.080
Anyone Double E for MIT?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.930
OK.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.920
So if you're a beam of
radar energy, you love this.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.160
You love when you have a
nice flat thing directly

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:31.880
that reflects.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.540
All that radar energy you put
at me goes right back at you.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.690
Now what happens if
I take that panel

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.700
and I go like this a little bit?

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.250
So yeah, there's not so much.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.670
Now I'll really
mess up your mind.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.770
What happens if I do that?

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.710
And now you have to start
dealing with angles and edges.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.920
The Raptor is this constant
fight between the Double E guys

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.940
and the aeronautical engineers.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.400
When you make an
airplane like this

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.810
and you make angles
like this, and you

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.820
make it there's no right angles
or whatever else like that,

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.280
you're exactly right, it
greatly reduces the stealth.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.990
Now, this is not Wonder
Woman's airplane.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.610
It's not like you
just become invisible

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.870
and no one can see you.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.920
But it's very, very
hard to see on radar.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.760
But there's a challenge
in that because when

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.730
you make an airplane that looks
like this, which the Double E

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.730
guys tend to like,
the aeroengineer guys

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.450
tend to hate because it
makes the airplane unstable.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.250
So we'll talk about that.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.560
This airplane, very, very
stable, very, very stable.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.060
OK.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.330
What else?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.240
A couple other things.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.820
So why is the Raptor
look this way?

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.030
Why does the Cessna
look this way?

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.010
Go ahead.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.460
AUDIENCE: I feel
like the Cessna is

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.650
designed to be produced with
cheap commodity materials.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.700
The Raptor uses exotic metals.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.360
RANDY GORDON: Yep, titanium,
whole types of stuff, right.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.870
So this is an airplane
people buy commercially.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.090
If you were Jeff
Bezos, you would never

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.050
purchase this airplane
because it is hyper expensive.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.840
My jets were test
jets, which means

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.530
they were very different, almost
like hand-built custom F-22s.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.490
Each one, $300 million
to $400 million a piece.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.370
Scary in terms of how
much it actually costs.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.800
The canopy on this thing,
probably worth more than about

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.670
10 of these all put together.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.630
The payload part-- you
brought up payload, too.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.150
So the other part about the
stealth, if you can see here,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.470
I've got doors.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.400
So there's a big main weapon
bay door, big 17-foot doors,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:24.900
if you will.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.730
And then there's doors on
the side that come open here.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.550
Unlike a Cessna,
we talked about--

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.300
where did Tina go?

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.240
Oh, she disappeared.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.280
The dropped object,
dropping pumpkins.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.800
My pumpkins are 1,000
pounds, come off

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.000
the airplane just like that.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.130
Different missiles and
different bombs or whatever.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.670
The center of gravity
of the airplane

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.730
is right about
where my finger is.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.490
And so these weapons that are
here, when I release them,

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.220
it's suddenly like dropping
a car off the front end

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.370
of your airplane.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.730
And so there's a huge
center of gravity shift

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.810
that happens just like that.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.360
And so the flight
controls need to be

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.280
able to compensate for
something like that.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.200
Last piece I'll give you
just for sake of time

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.010
is, what's the speed
envelope, if you will,

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.150
that this airplane operates?

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.110
RANDY GORDON: What's up?

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.540
RANDY GORDON: Oh, I wish 200.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.590
Man, I wish 200.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.960
I would buy one right now if
I could go 200 in this thing.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.170
AUDIENCE: About 160.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:20.170
RANDY GORDON: Yeah,
on a good day.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.390
You might get, if you get
a really, really high end

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.600
general aviation
airplane, 160 knots or so,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.440
something like that.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.100
You can get more than
that, but then you

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.310
start getting into some
real, like, Mercedes Benz

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.590
exotic class, general
aviation planes that

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.260
are like the Cirrus
that go beyond there.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.270
In general, you're talking
somewhere between 80

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:42.340
and about 140, 150 for most of
them, or something like that.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.410
Believe it or not, this
airplane can actually

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.950
fly as slow as a
Cessna, but it also

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.040
can fly two times
the speed of sound.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.950
And it does that pretty
easily, believe it or not.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.580
Also, this airplane,
60 degrees of bank

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.960
starts to get really extreme,
a little bit uncomfortable.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.690
This airplane, fully
aerobatic, doesn't care.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.540
Pulls 9 g's.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.670
You guys know what g's are?

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.560
The accelerations of gravity.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.610
So my human head-- well, MIT
heads weight about 20 pounds

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.890
or so, a little bit
more than the norm.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.620
So at 9 g's, everything on your
body weighs nine times as much.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.930
So that's 180 pounds.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.710
Your neck has to be
able to support that.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.170
Imagine everything
on this airplane

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.760
has to be stressed
such that it can

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.770
tolerate that load and more.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.290
Also, it can go
negative g as well.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.850
Altitude-wise, I
think the highest

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.930
I've ever had a Cessna
was about 14,000 feet.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.130
And it was wheezing.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.800
I mean, it was really, really
hard for it to get up there.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.860
This airplane goes 0 feet all
the way up to about 60,000

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.510
to 65,000 feet.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.120
So it flies twice as high
of what you would see

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.650
on your commercial airliners.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.150
What I'm trying
to impress on you

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.620
is it's a huge flight envelope
with a very different solution

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.740
set compared to what you
might have on a Cessna.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.040
The only other thing I
would say with Raptor is--

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.880
and this was something
that took me a while.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.760
My first combat mission,
I really understood this.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.730
In a Cessna, if I have
a problem, I can land

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.260
and most likely
people will come out

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.560
to help me and call home and
let everybody know I'm OK.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.740
In bad guy land, if people
are coming to get me,

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.870
they really are
coming to get me.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.090
So you're in very
hostile territory

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.640
where you do not want to
leave the airplane if you

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.640
can avoid it.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.660
So there is a tremendous
amount of redundancy that's

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.340
built into this airplane.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.120
We'll talk more through
that a little bit.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.770
So anyway, you've essentially
derived all of the challenges

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.100
that a flight control engineer
would have to deal with.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.030
Let's talk a little bit about--

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:40.600
I'll put this here just for
sake of making it easy to rest.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.090
This airplane has what's called
reversible flight control

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:43.590
system.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.740
What does that mean?

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.950
You guys talk about that yet?

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:47.450
Go ahead.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.240
AUDIENCE: I think it's
basically [INAUDIBLE] or when

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.000
you move [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.750
RANDY GORDON: Yep.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.000
So not only when
you move the stick.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.970
What happens if you go outside
the airplane, grab the aileron,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:56.600
move that up and down?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.350
What happens inside?

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.650
AUDIENCE: The stick--

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.310
RANDY GORDON: The
stick moves, right.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.690
So it's reversible.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.560
I move the stick, and the flight
control surfaces will deflect.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.140
Or I move the flight
control surfaces,

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.260
and the stick will deflect.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.600
So they are directly connected
with pulleys and cables

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.930
to one another.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.060
For the guys who have flown,
what does the airplane

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.470
feel like when you get to 100,
120, 130, 140 miles an hour?

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.700
I mean, what does it feel
like on the control surfaces?

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.470
AUDIENCE: Heavy.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.820
RANDY GORDON: Yeah,
so it gets heavy,

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.860
it gets real stick
kind of heavy.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.350
Same thing if you're slow,
everything gets kind of sloppy,

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.420
if you will, because
you are directly

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.570
feeling the air
loads on the airplane

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.800
as transmitted to the stick.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.200
In this airplane, these
flight control surfaces,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.650
this tail surface back
here is about the size

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.910
of a lot of fighter wings.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.080
It's huge.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.790
And you can imagine at
120, 130, the airplane

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.450
is really hard to really move.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.610
Well, what happens if you're
going 1,000 miles per hour?

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.070
You could be Arnold
Schwarzenegger.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.860
You do not have the strength to
maneuver these controls around.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.780
So this airplane has a very,
very exotic hydraulic system

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.060
and a computer system and
an electric system that

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.750
allows all that to operate.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.300
From the hydraulics,
I'm not kidding,

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.220
there's like 4,000 psi
of hydraulic fluid that

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.910
moves this whole thing around,
swings it back and forth.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.010
From the electric
standpoint, now, again, this

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.060
is a reversible flight
control system, all manual.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.560
The flight controls
in this airplane

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.440
don't work unless the electrics
are turned on to go do it.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.460
So your flight controls
are electrically

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.530
controlled--
hydraulically powered

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.790
but electrically controlled.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.700
Which is a little weird
when you think about it

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.160
because now all of a
sudden, electrical problems

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.560
in this airplane start
impacting your ability

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.280
to fly the airplane, which
gets a little bit strange.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.780
You guys ever hear
of a thing called

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.310
a permanent magnetic generator?

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.740
Do you know what that is?

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.090
A little bit of
a technical term.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:49.730
Who knows?

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.360
You know a lot.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.270
Go ahead.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.290
AUDIENCE: Is it a
type of generator that

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.590
uses permanent magnetic energy?

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.680
RANDY GORDON: Outstanding!

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.900
Yes, you have correctly
derived the definition

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.640
of a permanent
magnetic generator.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.390
No.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:03.630
The way it works
is this airplane

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.610
has six permanent
magnetic generators.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.760
They are the primary source
of flight control power.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.740
All that has to happen is
the engines have to rotate.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.340
That's it.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.890
So even if the
engines are shut down,

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.810
I can just keep wind
going through the engines

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.190
and they rotate,
they will rotate

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.040
sufficient to generate power
from the permanent magnetic

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.940
generators.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.220
If those fail, the airplane
also has electrical generators

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.720
on board.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.710
There's two of them--
there's actually

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.660
three of them on board.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.050
They can power the
flight controls as well.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.520
Worst case scenario for a Raptor
pilot, the engines seize up,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.880
I lose my electrical power.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.670
The only thing I have
left is a battery.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.470
And just like anything
else with a battery,

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.220
the more you use it,
the more it depletes.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.910
So at that point, any deflection
of the flight control surfaces

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.490
depletes the electrical energy
and you don't have that much

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.470
left to actually control it.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.040
OK.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.370
One last thing here and we'll
move on to the next slide.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.040
We'll talk a little bit--
just some definitions.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.590
The wing has this
thing on the front.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.110
Do you know what that's called?

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.070
AUDIENCE: Leading edge.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.150
RANDY GORDON: Leading
edge flaps, right.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.780
OK, perfect.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.710
All right.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:59.720
What's that called?

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.620
AUDIENCE: Ailerons.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.990
RANDY GORDON: Ailerons.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.660
What did I hear?

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.680
I heard something else.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.580
AUDIENCE: Flaperon.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.280
RANDY GORDON: Ah.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.570
Who said that?

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.070
OK.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.250
Explain.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.890
AUDIENCE: It's a combination
of both flap and aileron.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.940
Flaps are on the outside,
ailerons are on the inside.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.090
And-- no.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.140
Did I get that backwards?

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.230
RANDY GORDON: Yep,
other way around.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.350
AUDIENCE: Other way around.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.130
And depending on which
[INAUDIBLE] of flight you're

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.100
in, you either have full use
of those control surfaces

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.470
or part of it is dedicated
to the flap and part of it

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.450
is dedicated to
being the aileron.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.040
RANDY GORDON: Yeah.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.540
Outstanding.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.510
That's good.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.700
And this airplane--
this airplane has what?

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.020
Ailerons, right.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.750
So if I want to go right
and I move the yoke right,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.690
what happens to the ailerons
here in this airplane?

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.860
Sorry, I'll put it that way.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.020
That way, you're setting up.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.970
So I'm going this way.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.610
So this aileron is doing what?

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:48.360
AUDIENCE: It's going that way.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.140
RANDY GORDON: Going
that way, right.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.280
This aileron is doing what?

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:50.850
AUDIENCE: Up.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.490
RANDY GORDON: Up, right.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.170
So I'll cut to the chase.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.270
These are ailerons, these are--

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.530
so these are the flaperons
here on the inside.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.830
These are the ailerons.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.560
In a Raptor, those aileron
deflect differentially.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.140
So just like you
have in a Cessna,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.750
they can also both
deflect up, they

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.300
can also both deflect down.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.500
The flaps on the inboard are
flaps and ailerons-- flaperons.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.560
So they can deflect up
and they can deflect down.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.090
We'll show why that
brings up some neat stuff.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.860
OK.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.680
Rudder, obviously back here.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.170
In this airplane, when
I push the rudder left,

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.690
the rudder deflects
left, I deflect right.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.430
This has two rudders.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.050
Both rudders can
deflect one way,

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.370
they can deflect the other way.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.770
They can both deflect in,
and there's some reasons

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.060
why you'd want to do that.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.240
And they can both deflect out.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.800
The last piece I'll
give you is back here,

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.590
normally this would
be called an elevator,

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.540
but on a supersonic
airplane we call

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.170
these horizontal stabilizers.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.880
If you guys have read the
story of the Bell X-1,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.310
so Chuck Yeager when
he went supersonic--

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.730
we talked a little bit earlier
about supersonic shockwaves

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.500
forming on the airplane
as you start going fast.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.200
What Chuck Yeager discovered
is that the elevator,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.280
like in a traditional Cessna,
that horizontal stabilizer

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.480
does not move.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.970
So the elevator
at the back moves,

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.050
but this part stays fixed.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.550
That shockwave that
would form right here

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.940
would actually blank the
air back to the elevator,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.640
and they wouldn't have
any pitch control.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.810
So when they talk about
this thing called Mach tuck,

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.340
which was a scary,
scary thing that

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.980
happened to a lot of World
War II fighter pilots when

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.500
they got into a dive--

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.670
they would start forming
shockwaves on the airplane.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.920
They didn't have the elevator
authority to pull up,

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.810
and so they would actually
nose dive all the way in

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.220
because they go faster and
faster and faster heading down.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.180
The answer was rather
than the back end

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.170
of this thing maneuvering,
the entire surface moves.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.000
So as a fighter
pilot, especially

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.130
when you got people walking
underneath the airplane

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.500
because they're maintainers,
they're working on things,

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.880
you always, always, always,
you show them your hands.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.990
Because if you tap
that stick, again,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.160
the stick is not directly
connected just like it is,

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.790
the stick's connected
to a computer.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.880
The computer votes and it
allows things to happen.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.330
It then commands a 4,000
hydraulic psi system to deflect

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.500
basically this big old wing.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.490
You can actually
take a guy's head off

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.870
with the flight
control surfaces.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.270
So you always, always
show your hands

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.600
whenever you have people
walking underneath the airplane

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.360
for that.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.880
So it's got a very, very
advanced flight control

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.690
system on board.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.440
We'll talk through a
little bit about what

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.330
advantages that gives you.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.230
The last piece I'll
give you is the engines

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.590
at the back, which
are a thing of beauty.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.270
I was a propulsion
guy, aeronautics

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.590
engineer kind of thing.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.250
It's almost like modern
art masterpiece to me.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.160
Those engines have
the ability to call

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.690
what's called thrust vectoring.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.690
They'll swing up and
they'll swing down.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.620
Where would you
want to use that?

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.520
Why do the engines
have thrust vectoring?

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.020
You've answered a lot today.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.470
You're smart, though.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.510
You know what's going on.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.360
Go ahead.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.560
AUDIENCE: Very low speeds.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.200
RANDY GORDON: Very low speeds.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.250
Outstanding, yep.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.770
Where's another regime?

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.070
Think of the flight
envelope of the airplane.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
very high altitude.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.900
RANDY GORDON: Very
high altitude.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.280
So why high altitudes?

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.450
AUDIENCE: A little lift
from the wings, or the wings

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.630
could be small so--

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.680
RANDY GORDON: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.530
Density goes way down as
you go up in altitude.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.460
So if I deflect--

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.110
I mean, I have to
get more deflection

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.110
to move that air to be able
to move the airplane if I'm

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.690
relying just on the
aerosurfaces alone.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.590
The way I get around that is
I put two 35,000 thrust pound

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.900
engines, if you will,
on board the airplane.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.660
And just like a fire hose, if I
grab a fire hose and I move it,

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.330
you would feel that torque
on your body, the same thing

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.570
here with the thrust
vectoring on the back.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.490
So with just the
movement of my hand,

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.530
I can deflect 70,000
pounds of thrust way

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.870
at the back end of the airplane.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.500
So we talked about center of
gravity being right about here.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.590
So that moment arm
of that thrust force

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.760
is all the way back here,
and I can deflect that up.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.940
And at very, very low speeds,
where the flight control

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.860
surfaces might
not be doing well,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.970
I can still move the airplane
just by using the thrust alone.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.500
At high altitude,
where I don't have

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.200
a lot of density, same thing,
I can maneuver the airplane

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.770
just by using the thrust alone.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.010
So where that helps you--

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.260
because, again, this
is a dog fighter.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.720
Here's what happens, and you'll
see this from time to time.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.760
So I'll do this
with a side look.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.410
When I get to high
angle of attack,

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.750
so the wind is coming
like this and it's

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.780
hitting the bottom
surface of the airplane,

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.580
I don't have the ability
to really maneuver

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.880
a lot because sometimes some
aerosurfaces are blanked

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.460
by just the size of
that fuselage coming

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.630
right out into the wing.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.540
So I cheat, if you will,
by using the engines to get

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.220
that final little pitch rate.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.350
We'll see later on in
the Raptor demo video

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.700
where the airplane will go--

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.890
it's called a high alpha loop,
high angle of attack loop.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.090
It'll go vertical-- rather
than doing a loop where

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:46.000
you see it prescribed
this whole path over here,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.290
the airplane will go vertical.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.710
I'll engage the thrust
vectoring, and it'll pivot.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.880
So the velocity vector is
still heading straight up,

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.530
so the airplane is
still moving up.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.170
But it kind of does
this gymnastics thing

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.120
where I've now turned
the airplane using thrust

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.960
vectoring, even though
the airplane is still

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.870
heading straight up.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.400
It's wacky.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.280
It's totally cool.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.290
All right.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.260
Let's talk through a
couple other things.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:09.760
OK.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.970
So that's the flight controls.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:11.850
How we do in timeline?

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:12.030
OK.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.110
We're looking pretty good.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.460
Anyone recognize the
cockpit on your left?

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.090
AUDIENCE: F-15.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.200
RANDY GORDON: F-15, yeah.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:22.890
Outstanding.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:23.850
Good.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.680
This was my very first airplane.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.850
I didn't know any better.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.920
I sat down I said, wow,
what a cool cockpit.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.090
Look at all this cool stuff.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.640
Buttons everywhere and
switches all over the place.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.920
This is an airplane of the '70s,
designed when Richard Nixon,

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.460
Jimmy Carter, that kind
of era, if you will--

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.030
very, very first intro to
solid state electronics.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.700
Really wasn't fully
fleshed out at this stage.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.890
This airplane had a
hydro mechanical system,

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.690
which meant that just
like in this airplane

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.420
where there were cables
and pulleys, a similar kind

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.260
of flight control
system in it there.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.720
This picture is the Raptor's
cockpit on the inside.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.950
Some pretty dramatic
differences between the two.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.160
So again, just call them out.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.260
What do you see?

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.460
AUDIENCE: Glass cockpit.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.180
RANDY GORDON: Glass cockpit.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.220
Where does that help you?

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.240
AUDIENCE: I say the
glass is cooler.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.200
RANDY GORDON: Go ahead.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.330
AUDIENCE: It can be display.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.200
RANDY GORDON: What's up?

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.010
AUDIENCE: It can
be multi-display.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.000
You can change it to--

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:19.960
RANDY GORDON: Oh, yeah.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.710
It's great.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.380
You can see these new
digital cockpit Mercedes Benz

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.690
and BMWs or whatever,
where in the old days

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.790
you just had speed
and tack, if you will.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.610
Now you can configure
it however you want.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.530
Now, the moment you start
putting that in there--

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.470
no, got it.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.050
Yeah, the moment you
start doing stuff

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:40.410
like that, you start creating
a software airplane, which

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.600
gives you a lot of
flexibility and a danger.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.600
We'll talk about that one
a little bit later on.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.540
What else do you see
flight controls-wise

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.960
since we're talking mainly
about flight controls today?

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.840
AUDIENCE: Side stick.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.570
RANDY GORDON: Side stick, yeah.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:27:01.110
So right there is the
control stick in an F-15.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.330
Sits directly
between your knees.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.390
In a Raptor, that is
your control stick.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.000
It's on the side.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.700
Why would you ever
want to put something

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.620
like that on the side?

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.120
Go ahead.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.940
RANDY GORDON: That's part of it.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:15.440
That helps.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.100
And there's actually--
you can't see it.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.530
Here it's partly there, but
this little section here, it's

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.150
a foldout armrest.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.310
So your wrist is on the stick.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.040
Your elbow, if you will,
it's resting on an arm rest.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.110
So it gives you a lot
of leverage from there.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.890
That's one reason.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.390
What's a couple
other reasons why

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.580
you'd want to go side
stick versus center stick?

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.960
AUDIENCE: Your legs get in
the way on the center stick.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.370
RANDY GORDON: Legs
get in the way.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.700
That's a big deal
because in this airplane,

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.950
you actually got pretty good
after while of flying it,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.500
where if you really need
to maneuver the stick,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.340
you kind of do the leg
up and kind of move

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.470
over that way to get
everything out of the way.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.090
The other side about it, too, it
might not be quite so obvious,

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.310
but you see how that stick--

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.330
that's about where your
eye height would be.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.790
You see how that
stick kind of gets

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.730
in the way of seeing
some of the instruments?

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.040
It's just sitting right there.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.900
In a side stick, that's
completely off to the side

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.590
and all of this real
estate is completely open.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.680
The other thing I'll give you,
again, just for sake of time,

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.590
it's a little bit
of a thought change.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:15.160
When you have a
center stick, it's

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.000
like when you're driving a car.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.310
And when you're parking--

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.770
you're trying to
park your car, you

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.360
want to be able to maneuver
that wheel around a lot.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.780
But when you're
at highway speeds,

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.650
if you were to take the
wheel and maneuver it

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.280
that much again, you're
going to roll the car.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.950
So in a center stick,
you move the stick around

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.210
to be able to deflect the
flight control surfaces.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.210
There's a physical
displacement of the stick

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.500
to make that happen.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.830
On a side stick, that stick,
initially when they first

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.220
put it in, did not move at all.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.990
So imagine if you were in your
car and you wanted to steer,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.930
and rather than the
wheel actually moving,

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.270
you just put pressure
on the wheel itself

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.120
and that was enough to transmit
to the computer in the car

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.860
to turn the wheels.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.310
That was a problem initially,
which we can talk about

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.270
after the presentation.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.130
That's a little bit of
a sidebar discussion.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.020
This is a human factors thing.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.190
It's a side stick.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:10.510
Initially it didn't move.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.070
Eventually they decided,
I'll put in some deflection.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.730
So I can go a half inch
left, a half inch right,

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.340
about a quarter inch forward,
I go about a half inch back

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.930
because normally I really want
to get the nose going this way.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.510
If I had that much
deflection forward,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.410
I don't want to fly
the airplane this way.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.170
So you have the
ability to do that.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.550
But it gives you a little bit
of the best of both worlds.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.140
There's some
deflection to give you

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.810
feedback that you've input
something on the stick,

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.230
but not so much
deflection that it

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.530
gets in the way of everything
else you're trying to do.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.470
So there's a little bit of real
estate in the fighter cockpit.

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.590
The last piece I'll give
you, and it's a little bit

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:49.960
hard to see here, is all those
buttons there on the stick.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.670
What you have the
ability to do-- so

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.540
it's exactly like modern car
steering wheels right now.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.270
You can control volume, radio,
everything else like that,

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.010
you can do it from
the steering wheel.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.090
Same thing in a fighter.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.450
It's called hands-on
throttle and stick, HOTAS.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.080
And it allows you to
control everything

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.780
that you would want
to do on the airplane

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.430
with never having
to leave your hands

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.380
from the throttle on the stick.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.540
The other piece I'll give
you is that in a Raptor--

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.060
so in a fighter like
this, this is your stick,

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.280
this is your throttle.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.480
In a Raptor, because
the flight control modes

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.540
can change so much, this
is your right inceptor

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.180
and this is your left inceptor.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.130
It's all considered part of
the flight control system.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.630
All right.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.200
Let's keep going.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.690
So just like on your car where
if you want to go to XM radio,

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.630
you go to media
source or whatever

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.720
and go XM satellite
radio, you have buttons

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.990
because it's a software-driven
jet, just like we saw before,

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.390
and I can pull up a flight
control display that

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.130
shows me the position of all
my flight control surfaces.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:54.020
Again, the pilot is way
forward on the front end

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:54.740
of this airplane.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.160
As I deflect things, sometimes
I can't actually see them.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.310
And so initially, this
was a flight test display

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.480
so that I don't have to do
the old poltergeist thing

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.980
and try to rotate
all the way around

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.140
to be able to see to the
back end of the airplane

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.940
to see if the elevators moving.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.860
I basically instrument
everything and I

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.880
can see it here.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.590
Now, some of the
human factor stuff

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.510
that's kind of cool
with how they did this--

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.730
so again, this tells you, at
the top, rudder deflection

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.270
surfaces, ailerons, where the
horizontal stabilizers are at,

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.680
how the engines are doing.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.070
This is a little weird.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.380
I don't really like
how they did this one,

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.750
but this is the leading edge
flaps, LE flaps, the leading

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.180
edge flaps.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.470
So it just shows you how far
they're deflected, dug in,

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.100
dug down.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.680
On the lower left-hand corner,
it shows you center of gravity.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.380
So there's limits.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.910
Just like what
you would normally

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.670
do on flight planning
for your Cessna--

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.020
hey, I can only put this much
fuel with this much passengers,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.760
and I've got to be within
this limit for takeoff,

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.430
for landing and everything else,
the airplane tells you that.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.470
Now, what's cool about
some of the things they've

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:54.510
done in Raptor is that
if it's out of limits,

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.490
again, it doesn't expect you
to get out the piece of paper

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.050
with the whiz wheel and the E6B.

00:31:58.050 --> 00:31:59.550
It just changes color.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.840
It goes red and it gives you a
warning that says, hey, idiot,

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.950
you are beyond the
aft center of gravity.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.910
No gauge tells you it's
just having a hard time

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.380
seeing where all the fuel
is and everything else.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.530
That's a different story.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.270
But it tells you what percentage
of mean aerodynamic chord

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.370
that you're sitting at and it's
able to adjust stuff around.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.570
So I'll give that to you
because what this allows is--

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.820
oh, by the way, the last
part here is flight control--

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.340
so in other words, this tells
you where you moved your stick

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.470
and it tells you trim.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:28.890
So you know where
the trim is set,

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.760
and it also tells you
where the stick is set.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.910
So you know your inputs
that go through there.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.220
When you have a
software-driven machine,

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.220
you can customize things
and make it very simple.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.760
You guys have seen that
terrible, terrible awful movie

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.700
Top Gun, right?

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.190
It's just awful, right?

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.960
So that scene where
Maverick loses his engines

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.590
and they go through this, engine
one is out, engine two is out,

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.950
and they go on this flat spin
to sea, which is a bunch of BS.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.710
When you're in a spin, you
don't translate over the ground,

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:56.820
you fall straight down.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.200
So this whole flying out
to sea thing is ridiculous.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.330
It doesn't happen that way.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.860
If you don't have a
software-driven airplane,

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.750
when you lose engines like that,
then you've got to go through

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:07.560
this whole--

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.410
for instance, in the Cessna,
if you lose the motor,

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:12.330
what do you got to do?

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.710
Establish your glide, get
everything set up, check to see

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.710
am I my left, right, or
both on the fuel source,

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.410
what's my whatever, blah, blah,
blah, and everything else.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.660
In the Raptor it's the most
awesome thing possible,

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.760
you literally do nothing.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.530
You sit there and the computer
goes, oh, you've lost a motor.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:28.160
I've noticed that
you have a problem.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.210
Let me see if I can help
you, and it will restart

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.750
the motor for you if it can.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.600
If it can't restart
the motor, chances

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.150
are it ain't going to restart
and you can leave it shut down,

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.290
if you will.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.900
It allows some neat
human factor designs

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.700
because in this airplane-- in
the Raptor, believe it or not,

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.250
when you're flying
the Raptor, you're

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.950
not thinking about
flying the Raptor.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.820
You're thinking about
employing the Raptor.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.030
So you're trying to find
where all of your wing mates

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.180
are, where the bad guys
are, et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.730
Flying is secondary.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.520
Whereas in this plane,
flying is everything.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.920
So they tried to
as much as possible

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.740
alleviate the pilot from as
much burden of responsibility

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.750
of thinking about flying
the airplane by doing

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.650
neat little tricks like that.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.100
The other thing I'll give you
too about the flight controls

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.830
is, again, we talked about
how ailerons can go up,

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.590
ailerons can come down,
flaperons go up, they go down,

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.030
rudders come out and go down.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:21.880
On takeoff mode, I'll show
you something kind of cool.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.780
So here's the nose look on here.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.760
On takeoff mode,
without any input

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.790
from the pilot-- so there's
no flap switch in the cockpit,

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.870
there's no leading edge,
there's nothing like that.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.710
It just knows, based
on the fact that you've

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.190
got the gear handled down and
that you're on the ground,

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.150
that it senses the weight
on wheels, it thinks,

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.770
this guy wants to take off.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.210
So the rudders will
both deflect inward.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:46.070
Why would you do that?

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.570
Go ahead.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:50.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.280
RANDY GORDON: So not quite.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.400
There is a tie between the
flight controls, though.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.070
So in other words,
if I take the rudders

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.920
and I tow them both in, so
both rudders are deflected in,

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.870
what does that do from an
aerodynamic standpoint?

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.500
Which way's the nose going to go
if these rudders are deflected

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.140
in?

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.680
AUDIENCE: Up.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.230
RANDY GORDON: Up, right.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.050
So it makes it easier to
rotate the airplane on takeoff

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.210
because the rudders
are deflecting in.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.460
Both of them go in.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.290
The other part about it too is--

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.400
so we talked about this.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.710
You guys ever see a
competition aerobatic,

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.190
one of those extra
300 kind of airplanes?

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.450
See how the aileron
runs the entire length

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:32.540
of the whole wing?

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.750
So the pilot, all they got
to do is just tap the wing

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.270
and the airplane is going to
do corkscrews and spirals.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.190
On a Raptor, that's
part of the reason

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:41.650
why the aileron and the
flaperon can move together

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.250
as one surface.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.760
And so the leading
edge flaps will dig in.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.640
The trailing aileron and
the trailing edge flap,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.420
that will dig in as well.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:55.120
So on takeoff, with no
input from the pilot,

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.090
whereas the wing normally
would look like this

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.330
with a little bit of
camber on it, on takeoff

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:04.250
the wing looks like this.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.750
It's kind of cool like when
you look at from the side.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.890
So if you're looking at
it from directly side on,

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.650
that leading edge flap
comes down, these come down.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.040
That puts in a whole bunch
of camber on the wing,

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.720
and it generates a lot of lift.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.970
And again, that's completely
independent of the pilot.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.640
The pilot has done nothing
other than just tell it,

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.370
I'm on the ground because
the gear handle is down.

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:29.520
PROFESSOR: Laz, what would
be a typical rotation speed?

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.320
RANDY GORDON: Yeah.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.650
So that's a good question.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.570
What do you guys think?

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:34.630
So I start on the runway.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.290
By the way, I need
8,000 feet of runway.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:40.000
This whole 2,500 feet is not
for a Raptor, unfortunately.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.890
8,000 feet of runway.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.940
But by the time I actually
get ready to pull back

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.150
on that stick to rotate, how
fast do you think it's going?

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.700
RANDY GORDON: Little close.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.740
150 is the usual--

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.330
so about take off--
which, by the way,

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:02.220
this airplane is about
34, 35 tons on takeoff,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:06.600
compared to 2,500
pounds or whatever.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.850
So it's a very heavy airplane.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:09.350
It's got to get a
lot of speed to be

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.470
able to get that rotation.

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.990
But it's about 150,
160 knots on takeoff,

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:17.730
which is faster than the never
exceed speed of the Cessna,

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.960
as it goes.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.420
But yeah, so the flight
controls are there to help you.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.800
The other thing
I'll show you too

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.380
is there is-- so
sailplane guys--

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.550
where are my sailplane guys?

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:27.510
Anyone fly sailplanes?

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.630
So on the left in a
sailplane cockpit,

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:34.050
you typically have a lever for
the speed brakes, spoilers,

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.450
so these big surfaces
that pop up on the wing

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.580
to slow the airplane
down to just glide slopes

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.720
and those sorts of things.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.220
We talked a little
bit earlier about

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.870
how the electrical
engineer guys want

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.240
this thing to be completely
stealthy and whatever else.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.060
The last thing you want to do,
based on the discussion we just

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.520
had, is I don't want to
have a big board stick up

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.390
in the middle of this
airplane because that's

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.700
going to make my radar
reflection go very, very large.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.400
So they did something
kind of remarkable.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.970
They used the flight
control surfaces themselves

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.650
as the speed brakes.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.480
So if I need to slow
the airplane down,

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.250
I hit a little switch
on the throttle.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.640
And immediately what happens
is the leading edge flaps will

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.200
come down a bit, the
ailerons will both go up,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.190
the rudders will go out,
so they'll both tow out.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.980
And it's using that to help
slow the airplane down.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:24.090
It's actually quite effective,
which is pretty cool.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:24.590
All right.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:27.110
A couple other things
we'll go through.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.500
Landing mode.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.700
Pilot's done nothing.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.690
Touchdown, throttles are
back, gear handle's down,

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.460
and all of this stuff happens.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.030
Here, let me get
this zoomed in here.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.770
So that's the aileron.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:41.730
It's up.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:42.600
Holy crap.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.460
The other one's up, too.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.500
The flaperon goes
up on either side.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.000
The rudders, you
can see how they're

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.350
both kind of towing
in there a little bit.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.770
The reason it's
doing that is it's

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.860
trying to transfer all of
that weight from the wings

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.920
and put it into the gear.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.410
So it's trying to kill all
of the lift on the wings

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:00.960
and transfer that
to the landing gear

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.780
so that you have the maximum
traction on the wheels

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.640
as you hit the brakes
as you slow down.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:13.660
Also, on refueling-- so
when you go air refueling,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.900
there's a little switch
that you open in the jet.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.050
That opens up this door.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.510
That tells the jet
that I'm getting

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.480
ready to refuel
while I'm airborne.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.980
When it does that,
it says, this guy

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.240
isn't trying to dogfight
the airplane anymore.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.530
They're trying to get gas.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.020
So therefore I don't need
all the full roll capability

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.940
and everything else, and
really, what I really

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.470
want is an airplane
that's really

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.070
responsive with its lift.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.720
And so, again, no input from
the pilot, but the leading edge

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.630
flaps will deploy down,
the trailing edge flap

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.400
and the ailerons will
also deploy down.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.820
Again, they're trying to
create camber on that wing.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.320
This is all digital
flight controls.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.170
No input from the
pilot whatsoever.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.170
PROFESSOR: Laz, what would
a typical airspeed be

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.390
when doing this air refueling?

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:54.400
RANDY GORDON: This is
about-- oops, sorry.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.290
Let me go back one here.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:01.000
This is about 300 knots or
so, something like that.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.250
You've got to be able to
fly-- so for a Raptor, that's

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.630
kind of slow.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.290
For the tanker airplane,
that's somewhat fast.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.130
So you're trying to
find that marriage where

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.310
both airplanes have
good flying qualities

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.480
so that one's not about to
stall and the other one's

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.360
in full power trying
to catch up to him.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.160
By the way, the
most unnatural act

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.870
I've ever done as
a fighter pilot

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.450
is to connect up my airplane
to another airplane.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:23.620
I just never got used to it.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.600
I can do it just fine,
but the whole notion

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.720
of this big boom connecting
my airplane to a big airliner

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.820
was just really strange
and weird to me.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.570
Never got used to it.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:34.070
OK.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.010
Some of the limiters.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:40.530
So in an F-15, because we talked
to that a little bit earlier,

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.670
you can get up to 500,
600 miles an hour.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.220
You can take both
hands on the stick,

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.320
you can pull that
stick all the way back,

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.080
and you will rip the wings off
the airplane and you will turn

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.960
it into a big ball of metal
cascading down to the ground

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.230
because you have
over-g'ed the airplane.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:57.660
Again, that awful, terrible
movie Top Gun in which

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.120
Tom Cruise departs the
airplane and gets into a spin,

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.900
again, you've exceeded some
capability of the airplane

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.700
and the airplane departs
controlled flight

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.310
and gets into some type
of uncontrolled situation.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:11.670
On a Raptor, there used to be
in the pilot operating manual

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.610
a little blurb that said
quote you can maneuver

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:18.330
this airplane with
quote reckless abandon,

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.250
and you will not
over g the airplane,

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.710
you will not depart the
airplane from controlled flight.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:27.380
They did a spectacular
job allowing this airplane

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.010
to get right to the
edge of performance

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.530
but not going over the top.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:35.160
So one of the neat
things that they did--

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.840
airplane is in a left-hand turn.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.830
Look at that aileron.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.350
It's up.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:40.640
Look at that aileron.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.150
It's up.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.460
What the crap is going on there?

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.960
And if you know
this one, you really

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.370
do get the model
because I didn't

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.860
know this for a long time.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.570
So again, just for
sake of time because I

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.590
know we've got guys
coming in afterwards,

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:00.500
center of gravity of the
airplane sits right here.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.090
In your engineering
classes you always

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:04.820
talk about forces acting
on the center of gravity.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.070
And you take this whole
airplane and you model it down

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.430
to a point mass and
you say that's--

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.400
for sake of all the
sum of forces analysis.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.260
Well, in real life this
airplane's about 43 feet wide.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.340
Yeah, you can sum the
forces through there,

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.670
but there's forces acting
all over this airplane

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.020
at different spots.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.180
Think about here on the wingtip.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.100
I put g on the airplane.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.320
And this wing tip, it's
almost like the wings want

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.900
to bend up as I'm coming down.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.420
So you put a lot of stress
out on the wing tips.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.940
So their answer,
quite ingeniously,

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.040
was to deflect the
ailerons down when

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.360
you're at high maneuvering.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.590
The way you know you're
at high maneuvering

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.880
is you can kind of see these
little wispies forming off

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.560
the wingtips.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.510
So you are creating
low pressure.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:48.510
That's another one, too.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.050
You can see the clouds forming
on the front edge of the wing.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.510
Low pressure causes
that air to condense,

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.710
and so you make clouds.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.050
So you know the airplane's
really maneuvering up.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.020
And an answer to reduce
stress at the wingtips

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.950
was to deflect the ailerons up.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.560
What happens to the lift out at
the wingtips with the ailerons

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.960
up?

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.670
Goes down, right?

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.740
So it helps to push
those wings back

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.920
down again so you're not trying
to overstress the airplane.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.560
There are limiters like
this all over the airplane,

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.130
such that you won't
over g the airplane.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.510
Literally, you can do anything
you want to this airplane.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.420
That's what I'm telling you,
it's easier to fly a Raptor

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.790
than it is to fly a
Cessna because you really

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.380
have to pay attention to what
you're doing in a Cessna.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.060
In a Raptor, I could
put my kid in there

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.610
and he can do this all day at
whatever speed, and nothing bad

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.770
will happen to the airplane.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:36.480
It's really quite spectacular
how they did that.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.860
The other part
I'll give you here

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.470
is some of the command systems.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.970
So if I'm in a dogfight and I'm
trying to shoot the other guy,

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:46.160
I'm going against a
maneuvering target.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.310
And so the flight
controls transfer over

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:50.950
to what's called a
g command system.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.560
So if I'm maneuvering at 4
g's and I let go of the stick,

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.890
the airplane will stay at 4 g's.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.100
And if I see that the target's
maneuvering and I need

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.960
to go to 6 g's or 7
g's, I'll put that in

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.300
and the airplane will keep that.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.860
So in other words,
again, it's a vote.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.760
I'm not physically
connected to anything.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.240
I talk to the computer
and I say, I want 6 g's.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.850
And the airplane does all types
of black magic and sorcery

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:13.210
behind me, and Lo and behold,
the airplane gets to 6 to 7

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:13.820
g's.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.030
That really matters when
you're in a high maneuvering

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:18.910
kind of situation,
so it goes g command.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:21.920
When you're slower,
i.e. on landing,

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.210
and I want to put that flight
path marker right on that edge

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:27.550
of the runway because that's
where I want to touch down,

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:31.700
right at the 1,000-foot
markers, then in that scenario,

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.850
I'm not really caring
so much about g command,

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:35.360
I care about pitch rate.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.870
And so it transitions over
to a pitch rate command.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.880
And if I put no
input on the stick,

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.240
it says zero pitch rate,
again, black magic and sorcery

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.170
will happen behind me.

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.280
The flight controls
will do whatever

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.800
they need to do to make sure
that my pitch rate stays

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.760
at zero.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.100
So it transitions from one
type of light control system

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:51.640
to the other.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.150
No pilot input whatsoever.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:57.310
It's just based off of
flight command system.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:57.810
All right.

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.260
So let's talk through a couple
of the implications of that,

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.320
and then we'll go to
questions at the end.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.670
Can you do the flight control
video Raptor at the top?

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.210
It's about a minute.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:12.010
And then bring it up to
full screen and hit pause.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:12.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.090
Got to love that music.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:26.590
Stop.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:27.600
[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.640
Thank you.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:31.650
This one is full
speed and pause.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:32.360
RANDY GORDON: OK.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.610
And can you go back to the
beginning on it real quick?

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:37.850
OK.

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:41.150
So video in cockpit facing
out to the display screens

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:43.490
is a big no-no because
you could see stuff.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:45.120
So we won't even
bother with that.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.540
But what they did, this is the
Raptor Flight Demonstration

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:47.750
Team.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.790
This is out of Langley
Air Force Base Virginia.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.370
They mounted a camera in
the cockpit facing aft.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.460
What I love about
this is, again, you

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.980
can see real quick what's
going on with the airplane.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.150
So again, the
leading edge slats,

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.660
there's no input from the pilot
other than just maneuvering.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:04.670
They'll deploy
wherever they need to.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:06.260
You'll see the
horizontal stabilators

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.340
And if you're close,
you can actually

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.000
see what the ailerons
are doing and what

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.670
the flaperons are doing.

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:12.470
A neat trick, and
we'll see this as they

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:16.010
go into this high g demo.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:17.390
Do you guys know about--

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.220
this gets a little bit
advanced, but a thing

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.940
called static margin,
which is a stability

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.030
thing about this airplane.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:26.300
Again, this airplane, in its
bare airframe configuration,

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.630
no hydraulics, no computers,
nothing on board the airplane,

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.400
totally unstable.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.940
What keeps it stable
is the computer itself.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.990
What you'll see is you'll
see this maneuver where

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:37.280
he'll go into a
g turn and you'll

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.860
see all those clouds forming on
the back end of the airplane.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.440
Pay attention to what the
leading edge flaps are doing.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.880
They're digging in.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.010
The horizontal
stabilators, you'll

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.590
see them initially move
to get the turn going,

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:50.950
but then once
established in the turn,

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.370
the way it's
controlling things is

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.640
it's moving around
the aerodynamic center

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:57.230
and the center of gravity.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:58.760
It's doing that
by dorking around

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.470
a bit with the lift
on the wing, and it's

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:02.500
doing that by deflecting
the leading edge flaps.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.000
So that flight control surface
display I showed you earlier,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.520
the horizontal stabilators
would be completely streamlined.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.790
And all of the maneuvering is
coming from the wing itself,

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.570
which is pretty amazing.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:13.490
PROFESSOR: Next video?

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.910
RANDY GORDON: No, no.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:14.820
Go to flight controls.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:15.600
We'll watch that.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.100
PROFESSOR: Go back, then?

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.680
RANDY GORDON: Yep,
and then we'll just

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.270
watch as it goes through, this
time without the funky club

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.810
music, I guess, hopefully.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:23.810
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:27.300
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:34.090
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.210
The horizontal stabilators
are streamlined.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:47.200
[INAUDIBLE] Incidentally,
watch the flight controllers

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.840
in the back.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:49.820
AUDIENCE: Oh, man.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.200
We need somebody better here.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.460
RANDY GORDON: I know, totally.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.090
So at that speed, again,
it's the g command system.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:02.950
The pilot is commanding
a certain g rate.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:05.600
And miner deflections are
happening all the way here back

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.100
along the back edge
of the airplane.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.040
The pilot has no input on that.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.700
The system is doing everything
possible to command that g

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.910
that the pilot has asked for.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:16.830
You'll see one
other maneuver here.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.640
Pause for a second.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.700
So what this maneuver is is--

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.610
and again, slow speed.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.400
Airplane's going straight up,
and what they're trying to do

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.070
is basically pitch
forward completely and get

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:32.320
the airplane-- so it's almost
like you're flying an L,

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.040
like you're going
straight up and then you

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.910
want to pitch forward
and then accelerate out

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.310
horizontally that way.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.610
The way gets that is through
that thrust vectoring that

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:40.160
happens.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.250
But as that maneuver
happens, again, all the pilot

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.010
is doing is just doing a direct
push forward on the stick.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:46.660
Watch what happens
to all the flight

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.450
controls in the
back of the airplane

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:50.830
to keep that airplane going
exactly where the pilot wants

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:51.160
it to.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:51.660
Play.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:56.470
So you'll see huge
deflections out

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:58.120
of that horizontal stabilizer.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:58.870
It's kind of neat.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:59.740
You can keep playing.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.400
So what you're seeing
there is, from the outside

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.560
of the airplane-- we'll
see this more on the demo--

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.930
is the airplane is essentially
pirouetting in the sky.

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:24.350
So it's falling straight down,
but it's very controllable.

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:28.070
It's flying at speeds about
60 to 65 miles an hour,

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.240
but very, very controllable.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.490
And you'll see every bit
of flight control surface

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.290
on the back end of this
airplane deflecting

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:34.620
to do what it needs to do.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.910
So don't think of it in
terms of aileron, elevator.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:41.270
It's a little bit fluid when
it comes to a Raptor's stuff.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:42.320
Stuff happens back there.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.280
PROFESSOR: Touch and go video?

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.490
RANDY GORDON: OK, so this
shows a little bit of-- yeah,

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:46.780
you can go ahead and play that.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.740
And hit pause for a second.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.310
We'll just do the setup.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:56.090
OK.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.640
So very quick, the setup
for this video, this

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.850
is the downside of a digital
flight control system.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:04.700
Because on this
airplane, again, it's

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.640
pure cables, pulleys,
it's ratios and gears

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.520
and stuff like that.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.050
On this airplane,
it's software code.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:15.050
It's zeros and ones, and
you better get it right.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:16.880
And everything is
interconnected.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.970
We talked about how
moving the gear handle

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.140
tells the flight control
system something different.

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.940
If I open the air
refueling door,

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.430
it tells the flight control
something different.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:29.000
In this case, the power
setting of the airplane

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.750
tells the airplane
something different.

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.420
One of my good friends,
test pilot, outstanding guy.

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.230
So don't think of this
as he's a bad pilot.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:39.300
He's not, he's awesome.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.990
But the jet believes
something that

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:44.390
wasn't really true because
there was an error in how

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.130
the software was coded.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.950
And you'll see the
first approach--

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.210
he'll take off again on
what's called military power,

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.030
so they're not
using afterburner,

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.610
and the airplane
behaves just fine.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.630
The next time around, he goes
around using afterburner power,

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:01.130
so you'll see fire come out of
the back end of the airplane.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.860
And that changes something
in the flight system

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.410
for the engines, which
tells the flight control

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.570
computer a different condition.

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:11.580
And what ended up happening is
that the gains, if you will,

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.420
of the stick were
completely off.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.880
So again, this would be like
if you were on a highway speed

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.540
and that same wheel
deflection you would

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.480
use to park your car
in your garage, now

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.280
that little deflection
of your wheel

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.710
makes that same turn
of the tires up front.

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:29.060
So you get into what's called a
pilot-induced oscillation, PIO,

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:31.520
which basically says you're
out of phase with the airplane.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.930
If I'm driving my car and I
turn the steering wheel right,

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.090
the car is going left.

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:37.010
As it's going left, I'm
trying to correct, I go right,

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.240
and now the thing goes right.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.280
And so you get out of
phase with the airplane,

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.440
and you'll see what happens.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.440
Go ahead and play.

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.970
By the way, you see all
the flight control surfaces

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.200
deflecting in the back?

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.860
This is now in a
pitch rate system.

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.560
So he's just trying
to land the airplane.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.150
The back of the
airplane does whatever

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.550
it needs to do to keep that
flight path marker exactly

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.420
where it needs to go.

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:59.950
And again, all the flight
control surface is deflected.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.650
Military power because the
engines are black, if you will,

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:03.320
on this one.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.780
On the next time
around, you'll see

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.630
him maneuver with
afterburner, and you'll

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:10.020
see him get into this
pitch-induced oscillation.

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.800
That's the chase
airplane, by the way.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.470
It's an F-16 that
follows them around.

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.030
So same thing, getting
set up to land.

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:33.100
The camera goes out of
focus here for a second,

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.240
comes back in.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.740
Again, just notice
everything that's

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:37.620
happening on the back
end of this airplane

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.120
to keep that pitch rate where
the pilot has commanded it to.

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:46.120
Two things will happen here.

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.030
He selects afterburner
and he raises the gear.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:50.050
That changes the
flight control laws.

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:53.290
And the gains were
not set correctly.

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:54.290
There's the afterburner.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:57.900
And now you see where he's out
of phase with the airplane.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.360
And he's doing everything to
keep the airplane from hitting

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.130
the ground, and can't avoid it.

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:09.500
He's OK, but the airplane
was fairly well scraped,

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.920
as you can imagine.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.350
So it's just a danger.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.270
The digital flight
controls allow a lot

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.370
of flexibility and creativity.

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.950
There used to be a term,
eh, it's only software,

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:20.040
we can figure it out.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:24.860
Not true when you're dealing
with vehicles like this,

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.500
where small changes
in software code

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.090
can have dramatic implications
on the ability of the airplane.

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:32.140
So it takes an
amazing amount of--

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:32.810
PROFESSOR: Demo?

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:34.070
RANDY GORDON: Yeah, you can
go ahead and do Raptor demo.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:35.480
And with that, we
can go questions

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.340
because I'm a little bit over.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.390
PROFESSOR: No, it's fine.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:40.190
RANDY GORDON: OK.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:42.920
So we can play this full
screen, if you will.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.700
PROFESSOR: You want to take
questions while it's running?

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:48.940
RANDY GORDON: Yeah.

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.350
So this is from
another good buddy

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.190
of mine, a guy
name Zeke Skalicky,

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:53.550
who was the Raptor demo pilot.

00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:54.890
Outstanding guy.

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.060
But this is the Raptor demo
if you've never seen it.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:59.100
So we'll take some questions
while this is going.

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.060
Go ahead.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.580
AUDIENCE: Is there a thrust
to weight ratio on an F-22?

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.410
RANDY GORDON: Yeah,
greater than one to one.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:07.860
So the airplane, about
63,000, 64,000 pounds.

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:09.630
Normally a strong takeoff.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:13.060
The thrust coming out the
back is 70,000 pounds.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.700
So on a nice cold
day, like if you're

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.670
close enough to sea level,
you will actually go faster

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:21.000
than the speed of sound
while you're climbing up,

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.360
which is cool.

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:23.860
Yeah?

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:27.350
AUDIENCE: What is the thrust
vectoring while taking off?

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:29.090
PROFESSOR: Laz, try to--

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:29.590
oh, yeah.

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:31.090
Try to repeat the
question if you can.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:32.090
RANDY GORDON: Oh, sorry.

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:33.640
PROFESSOR: Because
he's not mic'ed.

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:34.990
RANDY GORDON: So
the question was--

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:37.150
well, one, the question was
the thrust to weight ratio.

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:39.270
It's greater than one to
one-- a little bit greater

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.900
than one to one on takeoff.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:43.070
By the way, watch this
maneuver here real quick.

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:45.750
So that's the thrust
vectoring kicking

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:48.340
in to really get the airplane--
so initially it has the flight

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.160
control surfaces.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.250
And then as things slow
down, the thrust vectoring

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:55.990
kicks in to basically turn the
airplane into a flat plate.

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:58.830
Second question was about the
thrust vectoring on takeoff.

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:01.460
So it'll put it a little bit up,
not much, just a little bit up

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.540
to help the nose
rotate just a tad.

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.220
This is that high angle of
attack maneuver, if you will.

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.080
Keep going.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.090
It's all good questions.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:15.590
Yeah?

00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:17.920
AUDIENCE: You said all the
software is written basically

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.750
so the plane can't
damage itself.

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.110
Does the pilot become a limiter?

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:23.550
Can it put you in situations
where it can hurt you?

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.930
RANDY GORDON:
Yeah, very much so.

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.050
In fact, we've kind of
achieved that spot now,

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:28.850
where the pilot very
much is limiting

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:31.310
the performance of the airplane
itself because the airplane

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:33.540
could do so much more.

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.110
So this is what's called a
fifth generation fighter.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:40.180
The first generation was like
an old Korean War, like F-86

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:40.890
kind of airplane.

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:43.130
And then successively
through the generations,

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:44.720
you arrive at this
fifth generation,

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.760
which to me is the
pinnacle of what

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.480
you could get with a human
and an airplane together.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.840
Sixth generation is going to
involve teaming this airplane

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.910
with unmanned airplanes,
and the unmanned airplanes

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:59.330
are going to have a lot more
capability from a maneuvering

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:00.740
standpoint because
they don't have

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.580
the limitation of the
pilot and all the life

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.830
support systems that come
with it and everything else.

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.130
So all that weight you would
normally devote to that,

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:09.300
you can get away with
putting other stuff in there.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.600
When I was telling you it
flies at about the same speed

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.200
as a Cessna--

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.870
I mean, this is those
types of maneuvers

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:15.890
there where you can
get away with that.

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:18.050
Again, watch the flight
control surfaces in the back

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.950
and what's going on.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:23.350
Later on they'll do a pass
where he'll open up the doors

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.940
and you can see the main
weapon bay, which is

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.230
underneath the airplane belly.

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:28.390
And then you'll see the
side weapon bay doors,

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:30.390
so you can kind of see
where all the weapons are

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.660
carried inside the airplane.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.070
Again, a huge center
of gravity challenge.

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:35.320
So here's that maneuver there.

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.440
You can see the doors open.

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.890
One thing I didn't
really tell you about

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:43.250
is, so in that such
situation, because missiles

00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:45.840
weigh a couple hundred pounds a
piece or so, some of the bombs

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.120
are about 1,000 pounds apiece,
when you lose all that weight

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.820
immediately, it's
literally like dropping

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.990
a car off the front
end of your airplane.

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:54.210
The way that it fixes that
center of gravity issue

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:56.380
is by changing fuel
inside the airplane.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.470
So it sloshes fuel
forward or back

00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:59.910
to keep the center of gravity.

00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:02.310
Again, there's no
fuel control panel

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:04.650
where I go, well, move this
and click this and whatever.

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:06.310
It does it all
completely automatically.

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:07.020
Go ahead.

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.600
AUDIENCE: What kind
of sensors can you

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.830
use to detect the
center of gravity?

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:12.630
RANDY GORDON: The
sensors that you can use?

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:15.810
So all of the fuel
tanks are instrumented,

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:17.820
so you know the status
of fuel in terms

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.070
of where things are set up.

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:22.220
You tell it-- well,
actually, it has the ability

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.520
to know what's on the airplane.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.020
So when you load a
missile, it goes,

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.480
oh, it's this type of missile
and it weighs this much,

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.070
and it knows the
mass properties of it

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.940
and so it sets it up from there.

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:33.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:37.220
RANDY GORDON: So it actually
identifies that all by itself.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:40.210
So like in a Cirrus, you
have to actually pull up

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.610
a screen in the Cirrus and
go, my passenger weighs this

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:44.340
and I've got this
baggage on board,

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.090
and then it gives you
the picture of where

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:47.300
the center of gravity is.

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.850
This thing, because
it's all digital,

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:51.140
the missile has a little
connector rod that connects it

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.040
and it says, behold,
I'm a missile.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.180
AUDIENCE: What about
the pilot weight?

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.630
RANDY GORDON: Oh,
the pilot weight?

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:58.900
Doesn't matter because
they spec'ed it--

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.900
well, it matters but
for a different reason.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.330
It matters for the ejection
seat, predominantly.

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.520
Because the ejection seat--

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.190
I think it's like 135
pounds is the lightest,

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:13.420
something like that, 115 to
135 to, like, 220 or something.

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.120
It's something around that spot.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.620
So to be able to be within the
safe envelope of the ejection

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:21.430
seat, that's where the
weight of the pilot matters.

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:23.800
But they spec the center
of gravity such that

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.320
so long as really
anyone can sit up front

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.700
and you're not going to throw
off the CG of the airplane,

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.300
even though you're way
far forward of the CG

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.010
and there's a moment arm there.

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:34.810
But between everything
else in the cockpit,

00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.240
that ejection seat is
ridiculously heavy.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.900
And all the avionics that sit
up front, the radars up front,

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.320
all these things
that sit up there

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.650
have far more of a contribution
to the center of gravity

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:47.380
than you do, unless you're,
like, Shaq or something

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:47.880
like that.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:48.910
But go ahead.

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:54.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
on the helmet screen?

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.910
RANDY GORDON: So in
this airplane, not yet.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:57.960
That's coming along soon.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.370
Some of the older airplanes,
believe it or not, have that.

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:03.330
Like the F-15 that I flew,
you had a special helmet

00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:07.410
that had all of the information
displayed on the visor itself.

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.960
So in addition to that hands-on
throttle and stick so I don't

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.500
have to take my
hands off of anything

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.170
to touch anything
in the cockpit,

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:15.090
I also don't have to
look in the cockpit

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:18.470
to see altitude,
air speed, heading.

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:21.600
It's all displayed
to me upfront.

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.700
This airplane eventually
will get that.

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:27.120
This is a programmatic
discussion now.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.370
They only had so many dollars
to spend, and they said,

00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:31.830
this airplane is so
awesome that it shouldn't

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:34.080
need a helmet-mounted display
system because it should

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.930
be able to see all the bad
guys from far enough away

00:59:36.930 --> 00:59:38.460
and not be a problem.

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.170
We fielded the
airplane that way.

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:42.630
The first batch of
pilots, they all

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:46.210
transitioned from airplanes that
had that helmet-mounted system.

00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:48.510
And they came to this airplane
where it didn't have it,

00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:49.540
and they were pissed.

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.600
They were like, we've
got to have that back.

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.430
So that's kind of where
a lot of the efforts

00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:55.910
now are going to modernize
the airplane a bit.

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:56.420
What else?

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:57.040
Good questions.

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:57.630
Go ahead.

00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:58.200
Yeah?

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.540
AUDIENCE: Why is there a need
for humans in the cockpit?

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.810
Why not just go for
unmanned systems?

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.760
RANDY GORDON: Yeah, it is the
great debate of the fighter

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.780
community right now.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:10.120
You're really touching on
something really, really deep.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.930
The best answer so far
is that the greatest--

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:18.350
I mean, we talked a lot about
the hardware and the systems

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.310
on board the airplane.

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.710
Really, the greatest piece
of capability on the airplane

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.990
is the mind of the
person flying up front.

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:29.120
If it's a very dynamic
and changing environment,

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.820
to be able to tell a machine
to be able to incorporate all

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.090
those inputs and make the
right decisions based on that,

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.350
kind of hard to do right now.

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.850
I'm not saying we're not going
to get there, just right now,

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:39.790
it's difficult.

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:41.510
Where we use unmanned
systems a lot

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.080
now is in surveillance
missions, where

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.330
you can just launch the thing.

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.090
And it's got a
pre-programmed navigation,

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:49.940
and it knows what it needs to
do and it can set things up.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.340
Those are somewhat
bounded problems,

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.200
is probably the best
way to describe it,

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.450
where you could use an
unmanned system for that.

01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:58.790
Where it gets difficulties
is in combat situation,

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:00.230
it's extremely dynamic.

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:04.100
It's battle royale,
WWF, mosh pit,

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.110
any possible chaotic
situation you can put,

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.130
that's kind of
what it looks like.

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:10.700
And so having a human mind
attached in that environment,

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.990
to be able to adapt and do
what the mind does better

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:14.660
than a machine does,
at least right now,

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:20.600
that's the main argument to keep
humans in the system for now.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.830
Yeah?

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:24.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] operate
these planes [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.630
to remotely operate
them, is the [INAUDIBLE]??

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:30.170
RANDY GORDON: It is.

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.930
PROFESSOR: Can you
repeat the question?

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:34.470
RANDY GORDON: Yeah, the question
is that if you operate these

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.180
things remotely--
so even if you had--

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.170
classic example, we'll
use Sully Sullenberger

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:42.760
because we talked about
Sully in the previous one.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.280
You take off out of LaGuardia,
you lose both engines.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.550
If you could have a remote pilot
sitting somewhere else that

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:50.590
could take over and
decide land on the Hudson,

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:53.850
because a machine most likely
wouldn't have made that choice,

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.390
is there a time lag issue?

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:57.430
The answer is 100% yes.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.450
There is a time lag
issue between getting

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.450
that information displayed
down, make the input,

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:04.450
that input goes back
up and comes back over.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.930
A thing we've done at
test pilot school is--

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:10.870
remember we showed earlier
that flight path marker,

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:12.860
where as a pilot you put
the flight path marker

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.070
and that's exactly where
your airplane's going to go?

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:17.560
If there's a time lag, that
will actually mess you up

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.930
because there's some second
or two delay between what

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:21.920
you're seeing and what the
airplane's actually going.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.370
At test pilot
school, they actually

01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:27.820
built a flight path marker that
accounts for that time delay.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.280
If it knows that time delay,
it will actually count for it.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.330
So you could fly the airplane
remotely even with the time lag

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:36.680
and still be able to do very
high gain tasks, like land

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.350
the airplane, for
instance, where things

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:39.460
are changing very rapidly.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:42.140
So it's a new science, not
fully fleshed out here.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.720
But the proof of
concept has been

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.920
demonstrated, to control
an airplane remotely even

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.390
with the time lag.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:51.040
Who really cares
about that right now

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.170
are the airlines because,
to be very frank,

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.470
the pilots tend to be a pain
in the butt for an airline

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:57.460
company.

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.170
And if you can remove
the pilots and just

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:02.860
have a remote operated system
or even an autonomous system,

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.990
from a business
standpoint, the company

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.960
really likes that from
an aviation standpoint.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.860
It triggers all
types of discussions

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:11.480
in a lot of other issues,
but that's one question.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:11.980
Go ahead.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.290
PROFESSOR: Let me jump in
for a minute with that.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:18.310
I think actually to me, one of
the holy grails of GA safety

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:24.430
would be to have a
human co-pilot, perhaps,

01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:25.570
on the ground.

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:27.070
So if you had that
kind of telemetry

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:31.850
that you have in a drone, a
human somewhere else could say,

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.400
you're running a
little short on fuel

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.270
or you forgot to change
tanks, all the things

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:38.530
that a human co-pilot could
do right in the cockpit.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:40.270
Most of that safety
running checklist

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:43.270
could be probably
enhanced remotely.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:46.240
So that would be a great add
to a Cessna, or a Piper, even.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.830
RANDY GORDON: And
you see a little bit

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:49.240
now in some of the more
advanced airplanes,

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.230
like we talked a
little bit about if I

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:52.720
have an engine problem in the
Raptor, I literally do nothing.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.980
I just sit there and
stare at the clouds

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.080
and go, wow, what a lovely
day, and the computer

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.120
fixes it for me.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.500
There are other scenarios
where the jet will tell me,

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.960
hey, you've got a
generator problem

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.260
and then immediately pull up
the checklist for the generator

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.070
failure to allow me to fix it.

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:10.540
So you see some basic automation
right now already in play.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:11.590
A couple other questions.

01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:12.710
I know we're running short.

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:14.390
Go ahead.

01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:16.810
AUDIENCE: How much of flying
a Raptor is seat of the pants

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:19.540
that you would miss by
not being in the cockpit?

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.920
RANDY GORDON: By
not being there?

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.310
AUDIENCE: Or is it so automated
at this point that it's

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:25.070
the same whether you're sitting
there or at a computer screen?

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.770
RANDY GORDON: Yeah, if it's a--

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:28.090
so we have two terms.

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:29.890
One is called beyond
visual range, which

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:32.529
means I can't see the
other guy with my eyes,

01:04:32.529 --> 01:04:34.930
but my sensors can see him.

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:37.540
And if I'm shooting missiles
long distance like that,

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.330
I don't lose any seat of
the pants by being remotely.

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:41.290
It's like a video game.

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:43.460
Literally, it's exactly
like a video game.

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.670
If it's a maneuvering
environment where I see the guy

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.120
and we're in a
dogfight, then yeah,

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.540
you lose a lot in terms
of seat of the pants,

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.120
eyeball, just things that
are hard to automate.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.250
So it's half and half.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.550
In a drone scenario,
would a drone dogfight?

01:04:57.550 --> 01:04:58.100
I don't know.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:58.970
It's a good question.

01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:00.279
I'm not really sure.

01:05:00.279 --> 01:05:03.190
Go ahead.

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:06.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.529
RANDY GORDON: You
could, but then I'd

01:05:08.529 --> 01:05:10.300
have to have some
way to represent

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.470
the physical environment
that the drone is seeing.

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:14.010
I've got to be able
to represent that

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.620
to the guy in the
simulator on the ground.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.310
I have to be able to
relay that real time.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:19.810
It matters.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:23.450
So who play sports?

01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:24.980
Guys, any of you?

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.779
Whenever you're playing
sports, you've got an opponent.

01:05:27.779 --> 01:05:30.200
If you play it a lot, like if
it's racquetball or football

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.220
or something like
that, you get very

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.970
good at looking at
your opponent and being

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:36.200
able to see micro movements
before the actual big movement

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.090
happens, so that you know, oh,
they're about to swing this way

01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:40.540
or they're going
to throw this way.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:43.010
So you can read your
opponent and make a decision

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:45.730
about what's about to happen
a second or two from now.

01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:47.720
In a fighter jet,
the exact same thing.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.830
If I'm fighting a guy and I see
a control surface deflection,

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.420
even before the
airplane is gone,

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.310
I know the person
is going this way,

01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:59.420
I can position myself to be
there before they arrive.

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.520
I would need some way
to represent that if I'm

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.260
in a simulator on
the ground, and it

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.250
would have to be transparent to
the guy in the simulator what

01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:08.710
that feels like.

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:10.170
Go ahead.

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:11.130
Lots of good questions.

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:12.330
This is a good class.

01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:14.040
PROFESSOR: Let me
ask, actually, who's

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.590
here from the Flying Club?

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:17.160
Sebastian.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:17.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah, actually,
I wonder if, Laz,

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.840
can you stay another
10, 15 minutes?

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.320
RANDY GORDON: Sure, absolutely.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.300
PROFESSOR: Why don't we
have Sebastian jump in,

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.420
give his Flying Club spiel,
and then both of them

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:31.420
will be up front for
questions right afterwards.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.070
Thank you, Laz.

01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:33.120
RANDY GORDON: No worries.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.770

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
As I'm going to argue repeatedly
today, biology has become a science

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
over the last 50 years. And,
as a consequence, we can talk

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
about some basic principles.
We can talk about some laws and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
then begin to apply them to very
interesting biological problems.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And so our general strategy this
semester, as it has been in the past,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is to spend roughly the first half
of the semester talking about the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
basic laws and rules that govern
all forms of biological life

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
on this planet. And you
can see some of the specific

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
kinds of problems, including
the problem of cancer,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
how cancer cells begin to grow
abnormally, how viruses proliferate,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
how the immune system functions,
how the nervous system functions,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
stem cells and how they work and
their impact on modern biology,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
molecular medicine, and finally
perhaps the future of biology and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
even certain aspects of evolution.
The fact of the matter is that we

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
now understand lots of these things
in ways that were inconceivable 50

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
years ago. And now we could begin
to talk about things that 50 years

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
ago people could not have dreamt of.
When I took this course, and I did

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
take it in 1961, we didn't
know about 80% of what we

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
now know. You cannot
say that about mechanics

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in physics, you cannot say that
about circuit theory in electronics,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and you cannot say that,
obviously, about chemistry.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I'm mentioning that to you
simply because this field has

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
changed enormously over the ensuing
four decades. I won't tell you what

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
grade I got in 7. 1
because if I would,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and you might pry it out
of me later in the semester,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you probably would never
show up again in lecture.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But in any case, please
know that this has been an

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
area of enormous ferment. And
the reason it's been in such

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
enormous ferment is of the discovery
in 1953 by Watson and Crick of the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
structure of the DNA double helix.
Last year I said that we were so

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
close to this discovery that both
Watson and Crick are alive and with

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
us and metabolically active,
and more than 50 years, well,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
exactly 50 years after the discovery.
Sadly, several months ago one of the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
two characters, Francis
Crick died well into his

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
eighties, and so he is no longer
with us. But I want to impress on

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
you the notion that 200 years from
now, we will talk about Watson and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Crick the same way that people
talk about Isaac Newton in terms of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
physics. And that will be so
because we are only beginning to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
perceive the ramifications of
this enormous revolution that was

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
triggered by their discovery.
That is the field of molecular

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
biology and genetics and
biochemistry which has totally

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
changed our perceptions of how
life on Earth is actually organized.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Much of the biology to which you
may have been exposed until now has

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
been a highly descriptive science.
That is you may have had courses in

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
high school where you had to
memorize the names of different

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
organisms, where you had to
understand how evolutionary

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
phylogenies were organized, where
you had to learn the names of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
different organelles, and
that biology was, for you,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
a field of memorization.
And one point we would like,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
hopefully successfully, to drive
home this semester is the notion

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that biology has now achieved a
logical and rational coherence that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
allows us to articulate a whole set
of rules that explain how all life

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
forms on this planet are organized.
It's no longer just a collection of

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
jumbled facts. Indeed,
if one masters these

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
molecular and genetic principles,
one can understand in principle a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
large number of processes that exist
in the biosphere and begin to apply

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
one's molecular biology to
solving new problems in this arena.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
One of the important ideas that
we'll refer to repeatedly this

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
semester is the fact that many of
the biological attributes that we

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
posses now were already developed
a very long time ago early in the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
inception of life on this planet.
So if we look at the history of

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Earth, here the history of Earth
is given as 5 billion years,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
this is in thousands obviously.
The Earth is probably not that old.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It's probably 4.5 or 4 or
3 billion years but, anyhow,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that's when the planet first
aggregated, as far as we know.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
One believes that no life existed
for perhaps the first half billion

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
years, but after half a billion
years, which is a lot of time to be

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
sure, there already begins to be
traces of life forms on the surface

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
of this planet.
And that, itself,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is an extraordinary testimonial,
a testimonial to how evolutionary

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
processes occur. We don't
know how many planets

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
there are in the universe
where similar things happened.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And we don't know whether the
solution that were arrived at by

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
other life systems in other
places in the universe,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
which we may or may not ever
discover, were the similar solutions

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to the ones that have
been arrived at here.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's clear, for example, that
to the extent that Darwinian

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Evolution governs the development
of life forms on this planet that is

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
not an artifact of the Earth.
Darwinian Evolution is a logic

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
which is applicable to all life
forms and all biosystems that may

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
exist in the universe, even
the ones we have not discovered.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
However, there are specific
solutions that were arrived at

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
during the development of life on
Earth which may be peculiar to Earth.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The structure of
the DNA double helix.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The use of ribose in deoxyribose.
The choice of amino acids to make

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
proteins. And those specific
solutions may not be universal.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Whether they're universal in the
sense of existing in all life forms

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
across the planet, the
fact is that many of the

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
biochemical and molecular solutions
that are represented in our own

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
cells today, these solutions,
these problems were solved already 2

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and 3 billion years ago. And
once they were solved they were

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
kept and conserved almost unchanged
for the intervening 2 or 3 billion

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
years. And that strong degree of
conservation means that we can begin

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to figure out what these principles
were early on in evolution of life

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
on this planet and begin to apply
them to all modern life forms.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
From the point of view of evolution,
almost all animals are identical in

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
terms of their biochemistry and
in terms of their physiology.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The molecular biology
of all eukaryotic cells,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that is all cells that have
nuclei in them, is almost the same.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And, therefore, we're not going
to focus much in this course this

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
semester on specific species but
rather focus on general principles

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that would allow us to understand
the cells and the tissues and the

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
physiological processes that are
applicable to all species on the

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
surface of the planet. Let's
just look here and get us

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
some perspective on this because,
the fact of the matter is, is that

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
multicellular life forms, like
ourselves, we have, the average

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
human being has roughly three
or four or five times ten to the

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
thirteenth cells in the body.
That's an interesting figure.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The average human being goes
through roughly ten to the sixteenth

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
cell divisions in a lifetime,
i.e. ten to the sixteenth times in

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
your body there will be cells
that divide, grow and divide.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Every day in your body there are
roughly ten to the eleventh cells

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that grow and divide. Think
of that, ten to the eleventh.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And you can divide that by the
number of minutes in a day and come

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
up with an astounding degree of
cellular replication going on.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
All of these processes can be
traceable back to solutions that

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
were arrived at very early in the
evolution of life on this planet,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
perhaps 550, 600 million years ago
when the first multicellular life

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
forms began to evolve. Before
that time, that is to say

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
before 500 to 600 million years ago,
there were single-cell organisms.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
For example, many of them survive
to this day. There were yeast-like

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
organisms. And there were bacteria.
And we make one large and major

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
distinction between the two major
life forms on the planet in terms of

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
cells. One are the prokaryotic
cells. And these are the cells of

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
bacteria, I'll show you an image
of them shortly, which lack nuclei.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And the eukaryotic cells which
poses nuclei and indeed have a highly

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
complex cytoplasm and
overall cellular architecture.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We think that the prokaryotic life
forms on this planet evolved first

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
probably on the order of 3
billion years ago, maybe 3.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
billion years ago, and that about
1. billion years ago cells evolved

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
that contained nuclei.
Again, I'll show them to you

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
shortly. And these
nucleated cells,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the eukaryotes then existed in
single-cell form for perhaps the

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
next 700 or 800 million years
until multi-cellular aggregates of

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
eukaryotic cells first assembled
to become the ancestors of the

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
multi-cellular plants and the
multi-cellular animals that exist on

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the surface of the Earth today.
To put that in perspective, our

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
species has only been on
the planet for about 150,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
00 years. So we've all been
here for that period of time.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And a 150,000 sounds like
a long time, in one sense,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but it's just a blink in the eye
of the Lord as one says in terms of

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the history of life on this planet,
and obviously the history of the

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
universe which is somewhere
between 13 and 15 billion years old.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
You can begin to see that the
appearance of humans represents a

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
very small segment of the entire
history of life on this planet.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And here you can roughly see the way
that life has developed during this

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
period of time from the fossil
record. You see that many plants

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
actually go back a reasonable length
of time, but not more than maybe 300

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
or 400 million years.
Here are the Metazoa.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And this
represents --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Well, can you hear me?
Wow, 614 came in handy.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000
OK. So if we talk about
another major division,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
we talk about protozoa and metazoa.
The suffix zoa refers to animals,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
as in a zoo. And the protozoa
represents single-cell organisms.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The metazoa represent multi-cellular
organisms. And we're going to be

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
focusing largely on the biology
of metazoan cells this semester,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and we're going to be spending
almost no time on plants.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
It's not that plants aren't
important. It's just that we don't

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
have time to cover everything.
And, indeed, the molecular biology

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that you learn this semester will
ultimately enable you to understand

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
much about the physiology of
multi-cellular plants which happen

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to be called metaphyta, a term
you may never hear again in

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
your entire life after
today. That reminds me,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
by the way, that both Dr. Lander
and I sometimes use big words.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And people come up to me afterwards
each semester each year and say

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Professor Weinberg, why
don't you talk simple,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
why don't you talk the way we
heard things in high school?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And please understand that if I use
big words sometimes it's to broaden

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
your vocabulary so you
can learn big words.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
One of the things you should be able,
one of the big take-home lessons of

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
this course should be that
your vocabulary is expanded.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Not just your scientific vocabulary
but your general working English

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
vocabulary. Perhaps the
biggest goal of this course,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
by the way, is not that you learn
the names of all the organelles and

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
cells but that you learn how to
think in a scientific and rational

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
way. Not just because of this
course but that this course

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
helps you to do so. And as
such, we don't place that

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
much emphasis on memorization but
to be able to think logically about

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
scientific problems. Here
we can begin to see the

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
different kinds of metazoa, the
animals. Here are the metaphyta

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and here are the protozoa,
different words for all of these.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And here we see our own
phylum, the chordates. And,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
again, keep in mind that this line
right down here is about 550 to 600

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
million years ago, just to
give you a time scale for

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
what's been going
on, on this planet.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
One point we'll return to repeatedly
throughout the semester is that all

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
life forms on this planet
are related to one another.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
It's not as if life was invented
multiple times on this planet and

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
that there are multiple independent
inventions to the extent that life

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
arose more than once on this
planet, and it may have. The other

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
alternative or competing life forms
were soon wiped out by our ancestors,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
our single-cellular
ancestors 3 billion years ago.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And, therefore, everything
that exists today on this

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
planet represents the descendents of
that successful group of cells that

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
existed a very long time ago.
Here we have all this family tree

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
of the different metazoan forms that
have been created by the florid hand

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
of evolution. And we're not going
to study those phylogenies simply

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
because we want to understand
principles that explain all of them.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Not just how this or that particular
organism is able to digest its food

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
or is able to reproduce.
Here's another thing we're not

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
going to talk about. We're
not going to talk about

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
complicated life forms. We're
not going to talk very much,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
in fact hardly at all, about
ecology. This is just one such thing,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
the way that a parasite is able to,
a tapeworm is able to infect people.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
This is, again, I'm showing you
this not to say this is what we're

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
going to talk about, we're
not going to talk about that.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We're not going to talk about that.
There's a wealth of detail that's

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
known about the way life exists
in the biosphere that we're simply

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
going to turn our backs on by
focusing on some basic principles.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
We're also not going to talk about
anatomy. Here in quick order are

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
some of the anatomies you may
have learned about in high school,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and I'm giving them to you
each with a three-second minute,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
a three-second showing to say
we're not going to do all this.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And rather just to reinforce
our focus, we're going to limit

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
ourselves to a very finite
part of the biosphere.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And here is one way of depicting
the biosphere. It's obviously an

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
arbitrary way of doing so
but it's quite illustrative.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Here we start from molecules.
And, in fact, we will occasionally

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
go down to submolecular atoms.
And here's the next dimension of

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
complexity, organelles. That
is these specialized little

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
organs within cells. We're
going to focus on them as

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
well. We're going to focus on
cells. And when we start getting to

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
tissues, we're going to start
not talking so much about them.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And we're not going to talk about
organisms and organs or entire

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
organisms or higher complex
ecological communities.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And the reason we're doing that is
that for 40 years in this department,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and increasingly in the rest of the
world there is the acceptance of the

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
notion that if we understand what
goes on down here in these first

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
three steps, we can understand
almost everything else in principle.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Of course, in practice we may not
be able to apply those principles to

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
how an organism works or to
how the human brain works yet.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Maybe we never will. But,
in general, if one begins to

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
understand these principles down
here, one can understand much about

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
how organismic embryologic develop
occurs, one can understand a lot

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
about a whole variety of disease
processes, one can understand how

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
one inherits disease susceptibilities,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and one can understand why many
organisms look the way they do,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
i.e. the process of
developmental biology.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And so, keep in mind that if you
came to hear about all of these

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
things, we're going to let you down.
That's not what this is going to be

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
about. This also dictates the
dimensions of the universe that

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
we're going to talk about because
we're going to limit ourselves to

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
the very, very small and not to
the microscopic. On some occasions

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
we'll limit ourselves to items that
are so small you cannot see them in

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
the light microscope. On other
occasions we may widen our

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
gaze to look at things that
are as large as a millimeter,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
but basically we're staying very,
very small. Again, because we view,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
correctly or not, the fact that the
big processes can be understood by

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
delving into the molecular details
of what happens invisibly and cannot

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
be seen by most ways of visualizing
things, including the light and

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
often even the electron microscope.
Keep in mind that 50 years ago we

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
didn't know any of this,
for all practical purposes,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
or very little of this. And keep
in mind that we're so close to this

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
revolution that we don't really
understand its ramifications.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I imagine it will be another 50
years before we really begin to

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
appreciate the fallout, the
long-term consequences of this

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
revolution in biology which began
51 years ago. And so you're part of

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
that and you're going to experience
it much more than my generation did.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And indeed one of the reasons why
MIT decided about 10 or 12 years ago

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
that every MIT undergraduate needed
to have at least one semester of

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
biology is that biology, in
the same way as physics and

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
chemistry and math, has become
an integral part of every

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
educated person's knowledge-base in
terms of their ability to deal with

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
the world in a rational way.
In terms of public policy,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
in terms of all kinds of ethical
issues, they need to understand

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
what's really going on. Many
of the issues that one talks

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
about today about bioethics are
articulated by people who haven't

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
the vaguest idea about what
we're talking about this semester.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
You will know much more than they
will, and hopefully some time down

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
the road, when you become more and
more influential voices in society,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
you'll be able to contribute
what you understood here,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
what you learned here
to that discussion.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Right now much of bioethical
discussion is fueled by people who

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
haven't the vaguest idea what a
ribosome or mitochondrion or even a

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
gene is, and therefore is often
a discussion of mutually shared

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
ignorance which you can
diffuse by learning some basics,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
by learning some of the essentials.
Here is the complexity of the cell

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
we're going to focus on largely
this semester, which is to say the

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
eukaryotic rather than
the prokaryotic cell.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And this is just to give you a
feeling for the overall dimensions

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
of the cell and refer to many of
the landmarks that will repeatedly be

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
brought up during the
course of this semester.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Here is the nucleus. The
term karion comes from the

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Greek meaning a seed or a kernel.
And the nucleus is what gives the

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
eukaryotic cell its name.
Within the nucleus, although not

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
shown here, are the
chromosomes which carry DNA.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
You may have learned that a long
time ago. Outside of the nucleus is

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
this entire vast array of organelles
that goes from the nuclear membrane,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
and I'm point to it right here,
all the way out to the outside

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
of the cell. The outside
limiting membrane,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
the outer membrane of the cell
is called the plasma membrane.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And between the nucleus and the
plasma membrane there is an enormous

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
amount of biological and
biochemical activity taking place.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Here are, for example,
the mitochondria. And the

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
mitochondria, as one has learned,
are the sources of energy production

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
in the cell. And, therefore,
we'll touch on them very

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
briefly. This is an
artist's conception of

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
what a mitochondrion looks like.
Almost always artists' conceptions

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
of these things have only vague
resemblance to the reality.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
But, in any case, you can begin to
get a feeling for what one thinks

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
about their appearance. Here
are mitochondria sliced open

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
by the hand of the artist.
And, interestingly, mitochondria

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
have their own DNA in them.
One now accepts the fact that

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
mitochondria are the descendents of
bacteria which insinuated themselves

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
into the cytoplasms of larger cells,
roughly 1.5 billion years ago, and

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
began to do a specialized job
which increasingly became the job of

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
energy production within cells.
To this day, mitochondria retain

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
some vestigial attributes of the
bacterial ancestors which initially

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
colonized or parasitized
the cytoplasm of the cell.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
When I say parasitized,
you might imagine that the

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
mitochondria are taking
advantage of the cell.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
But, in fact, the mitochondria
represent the essential sources of

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
energy production in the cell.
Without our mitochondria, as you

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
might learn by taking cyanide, for
example, you don't live for very

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
many minutes. And the vestiges of
bacterial origins of mitochondria

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
are still apparent in the fact that
mitochondria still have their own

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
DNA molecule, their own chromosome.
They still have their own ribosomes

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
and protein synthetic apparatus,
even though the vast majority of the

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
proteins inside mitochondria
are imported from the cytoplasm,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
i.e., these vestigial bacteria now
rely on proteins made by the cell at

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
large that are imported into the
mitochondrion to supplement the

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
small number of vestigial bacterial
proteins which are still made here

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
inside the mitochondrion and
used for essential function

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
in energy production. Here
is the Golgi apparatus.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And the Golgi apparatus up here is
used for the production of membranes.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
As one will learn throughout the
semester, the membranes of a cell

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
are in constant flux and are
being pulled in and remodeled and

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
regenerated. The Golgi apparatus
is very important for that.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Here's the rough endoplasmic
reticulum. That's important for the

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
synthesis of proteins which are
going to be displayed on the surface

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
of cells, you don't
see them depicted here,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
or are going to be secreted
into the extracellular space.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Here are the ribosomes, which
I might have mentioned briefly

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
before. And these ribosomes are the
factories where proteins are made.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Again, we're going to
talk a lot about them. And,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
finally, several other aspects,
the cytoskeleton. The physical

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
integrity, the architecture of
the cell is maintained by a complex

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
network of proteins which
together are considered to be the

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
cytoskeleton. And they enable
the cell to have some rigidity,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
to resist tensile forces,
and actually to move.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Cells can actually move
from one place to the other.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
They have motile properties.
They're able to move from one

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
location to another. The
process of cell motility,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000
if that's a word
you'd like to learn.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Here is what a prokaryotic
cell looks like by contrast.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
And I just want to give
you a feeling. First of all,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
it looks roughly like
a mitochondrion that I

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
discussed before. But
you see that there is the

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
absence of a nuclear membrane.
There's the absence of the highly

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
complex cytoarchitecture.
Cyto always refers to cells.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
There's the absence of the complex
cytoarchitecture that one associates

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
with eukaryotic cells. In
fact, all that a bacterium has

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
is this area in the middle.
It's called the nucleoid, a term

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
which you also will probably
never hear in your lifetime.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And it represents simply an
aggregate of the DNA of the

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
chromosomes of the bacterium.
And, in most bacteria, the DNA

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
consists of only a single molecule
of DNA which is responsible for

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
carrying the genetic information
of the bacteria. There's no membrane

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
around this nucleoid. And
outside of this area where the

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
DNA is kept are largely ribosomes
which are important for protein

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
synthesis. There's a membrane
on the outside of this called the

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
plasma membrane, very
similar to the plasma membrane

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
of eukaryotic cells. And
outside of that is a meshwork

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
that's called the outer membrane,
it's sometimes called the cell wall

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
of the bacterium, which
is simply there to impart

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
structural rigidity to the bacterium
making sure that it doesn't explode

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
and holding it together. And
then there are other versions

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
of eukaryotic cells. Here's
what a plant cell looks like.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
And it's almost identical to
the cells in our body, except

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
for two major
features. For one thing,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
it has chloroplasts in it which
are also, one believes now,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
the vestiges of parasitic bacteria
that invade into the cytoplasm of

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
eukaryotic cells. So, in
addition to mitochondria

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
which are responsible for energy
production in all eukaryotic cells,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
we have here the chloroplasts which
are responsible for harvesting light

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
and converting it into energy
in plant cells. The rest of the

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
cytoplasm of a plant cell
looks pretty much the same.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
One feature that I didn't really
mention when I talked about an

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
animal cell is in the middle of
the nucleus, here you can see,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
is a structure called a nucleolus.
And a nucleolus, or the nucleolus

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
in the eukaryotic cell is
responsible for making the large

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
number of ribosomes which are
exported from the nucleus into the

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
cytoplasm. And, as I
mentioned just before,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
the ribosomes are responsible
for protein synthesis.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
It turns out this is a major
synthetic effort on the part of most

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
cells. Cells, like our
own, have between 5 and 10

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
million ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
So it's an enormous amount of

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
biomass in the cytoplasm whose sole
function is to synthesize proteins.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
As we will learn also, proteins
that are synthesized by the

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
ribosomes don't sit around forever.
Some proteins have long lives.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Some proteins have lifetimes of
15 minutes before they're degraded,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
before they're turned over. One
other distinction between our

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
cells, that is the cells
of metazoa and metaphyta,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
are the cell walls,
analogous to the cell walls of

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
bacteria, this green thing on
the outside. As I said before,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
we do not have cell walls
around our cells. And we will,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
as the semester goes on, go
into more and more details about

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
different aspects of this
cytoarchitecture during the first

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
half of the semester.
Here, for example,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
is an artist's depiction of
the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Why it has such a complex name,
I cannot tell you, but it does.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
It's called the ER in the
patois of the street. The ER.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And the endoplasmic reticulum
is a series of membranes.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Keep in mind, not the only membrane
in the cell is the plasma membrane.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Within the cytoplasm there are
literally hundreds of membranes

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
which are folded up
in different ways.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Here you see them depicted.
And one set of these membranes,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
often they're organized much like
tubes, represents the membranes of

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
the endoplasmic reticulum which
either lacks ribosomes attached to

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
it or has these ribosomes attached
to it which cause this to be called

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
the rough endoplasmic reticulum to
refer to its rough structure which

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
is created by the studding
of ribosomes on the surface.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
As we will learn, just
trying to give you a feeling

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
for the geography of what we're
going to talk about this semester,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
these ribosomes on the surface
of the endoplasmic reticulum are

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
dedicated to the task of making
highly specialized proteins which

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
are either going to be dispatched
to the surface of the cell where they

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
will be displayed on the cell's
surface or actually secreted into

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
the extracellular space.
Many of the proteins that are

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
destined for our body are not kept
within cells but are released into

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
the extracellular space where
they serve important functions,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
and so we're going to
focus very much on them.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Here's actually what some of these
things look like in the electron

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
microscope to see whether we can
either believe or fully discredit

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
the imaginations of the artists.
Here's the rough endoplasmic

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
reticulum I showed you in schematic
form before. And you can see why

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
it's called rough. All these
black dots are ribosomes

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
attached on the outside.
Here's the Golgi apparatus.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
You see these vesicles
indicated here. And a vesicle,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
just to use a new word,
is simply a membranous bag.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And keep in mind, by the
way, that we're not going to

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
spend the semester with these
highly descriptive discussions.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Our intent today is to get a lot of
these descriptive discussions out of

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
the way so that we can begin to talk
in a common parlance about many of

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
the parts, the molecular
parts of cells and organisms.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Here is the mitochondrion
which we saw depicted before.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
It looks similar to, but
not identical to the artist's

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
description of that.
And keep in mind that the

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
mitochondrion in our cells,
as I said before, are the

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
descendents of parasitic bacteria.
Here's the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
and the way it would look, as
it does in certain parts of the

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
cell when it doesn't have all
of these ribosomes studded on the

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
surface. The endoplasmic reticulum
here is involved in making membranes.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
The endoplasmic reticulum here is
involved in the synthesis and export

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
of proteins to the cell's
surface and for secretion, as

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
I mentioned before. Much
of what we're going to talk

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
about over the next days is going
to be focused on the nucleus of the

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
cell, that is on the chromosomes on
the cell and on the material which

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
is called chromatin which
carries the genetic material.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
So the term chromatin is used
in biology to refer simply to the

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
mixture of DNA and proteins,
which together constitutes the

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
chromosomes. So chromatin
has within it DNA,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
it has protein, and it has
a little bit of RNA in it.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
And we're going to focus mostly
on the DNA in the chromatin,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
because if we can begin to
understand the way the DNA works and

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
functions many other
aspects will flow from that.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I mentioned the cell's surface,
and I just want to impress on you

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
the fact that the plasma membrane of
a cell is much more complicated than

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
was depicted in these drawings
that I showed you just before.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
If we had a way of visualizing
the plasma membrane of a cell,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
we would discover that it's formed
from lipids. We see such lipids

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
there, phospholipids, many
of them. We'll talk about them

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
shortly. That the outside of the
cell, there are many proteins,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
you see them here, which thread
their way through the plasma

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
membrane, have an extracellular
and intracellular part.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
And these transmembrane proteins,
which reach from outside to inside,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
represent a very important
way by which the cell senses

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
its environment.
This plasma membrane,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
as we'll return to, represents a
very effective barrier to segregate

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
what's inside the cell from what's
outside of the cell to increase

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
concentrations of certain
biochemical entities.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
But at the same time it creates
a barrier to communication.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
And one of the things that cells
have had to solve over the last 700

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
to 800 million years is ways by
which the exterior of the cell is

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
able to send certain signals and
transmit that information to the

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
interior of the cell.
At the same time,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
cells have had to use a number
of different, invent a number of

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
different proteins, some
of them indicated here,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
which are able to transport
materials from the outside of the

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
cell into the cell, or visa
versa. So the existence of

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
the plasma membrane represents a
boon to the cell in the sense that

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
it's able to segregate what's on the
inside from what's on the outside.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
But it represents an impediment to
communication which had to be solved,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
as well as an impediment to
transport. And many of these

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
transmembrane proteins are dedicated
to solving those particular problems.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Here you see, once again
an artist's depiction

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
form, aspects of the cytoskeleton
of the cell. And when we talk about

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
the cytoskeleton we talk about
this network of proteins which,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
as I said before,
gives the cell rigidity.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Keep in mind that the prefix cyto
or the suffix cyt refers always to

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
cells. Allows the cell to have
shape. And here you can see this

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
network as depicted in one way,
but here it's depicted actually much

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
more dramatically. And
here you begin to see the

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
complexity of what exists inside
the cell. Here are these proteins.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
These are polymers of proteins
called vimentin which are present in

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
very many mesenchymal cells.
Here are microtubules made from

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
another kind of protein.
Here are microfilaments,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
in this case made of the molecule
actin. And if we looked at

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
individual molecules of
actin they would be invisible.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
This is end-to-end polymerization
of many actin molecules.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
And we're looking here under the
microscope from one end of the cell

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
to the other end of the cell. And
you can see how these molecules,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
they create stiffness, and
they also enable the cell to

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
contract and to move. Some
people might think that the

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
interior of the cell is just water
with some molecules floating around

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
them. But if you actually look
at what's present in the cell,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
more than 50% of the volume
is taken up by proteins.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
It's not simply an aqueous solvent
where everything moves around freely.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
It's a very viscous slush, a
mush. And it's quite difficult

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
there for many cells to move
around from one part of the

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
cell to the other. Here you
begin to get a feeling now

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
for how the connection, which
we'll reinforce shortly in

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
great detail, between individual
molecules and the cytoskeleton.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And here you see these actin fibers.
I showed them to you just moments

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
ago stretching from one end
of the cell to the other.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And each of these little globules
is a single actin monomer which

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
polymerize end-to-end and then form
multi-strand aggregates to create

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
the actin cytoskeleton. Here's
an intermediate filament and

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
here's the microtubules that are
formed, once again giving us this

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
impression that the cell is actually
highly organized and that that high

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
degree of organization is able to
give it some physical structure and

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
shape and form. I think
we're going to end today

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
two minutes early. You
probably won't object.

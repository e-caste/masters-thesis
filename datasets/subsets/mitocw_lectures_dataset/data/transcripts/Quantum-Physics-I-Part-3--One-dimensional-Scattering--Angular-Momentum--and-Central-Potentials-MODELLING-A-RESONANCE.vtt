WEBVTT

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.120
PROFESSOR: That's how
it looks, a resonance.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.751
You can see it basically
in the phase shift.

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:16.590
And great increase of the
phase of almost minutely pi

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.632
over a very small
change of energy.

00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:26.200
And it should [INAUDIBLE]
with a very big [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.952
So this is how it looks.

00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:33.816
And I want to now
proceed, after if there

00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:36.370
are some questions,
of how do we search

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.750
for residences a little
more mathematically rather

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.360
than plotting them.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.010
How could I write an
equation for a resonance.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.887
Cannot say, oh, the
phase changes fast.

00:00:48.887 --> 00:00:54.090
Well, that's not a very
nice way of saying it.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.910
It's good.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.990
It's intuitive.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.110
But we should be
able to do better.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.230
So how do I find resonances?

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.633
So let's model
resonances a little bit.

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.565
How do we find resonances?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.165
So let's model this behavior.

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:23.290
By that is writing
a formula that

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.450
is simple enough that seems
to capture what's happening.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.670
And that formula's
going to inspire

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.840
us to think of resonances
perhaps a little more clearly.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.480
So suppose you have a
resonance near k equal alpha.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.140
I claim the following
formula would be a good way

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.490
to represent the resonance?

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:56.060
We would say that tan
delta is equal to beta

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.950
over alpha minus k.

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:05.438
Or-- yeah, we would say that.

00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:16.680
[INAUDIBLE] Or if you wish,
delta is tan minus 1 of beta

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.332
over alpha minus k.

00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:21.860
Why is that reasonable?

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.950
It's a little surprising,
but not that surprising.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.730
You see that-- delta is
equal to minus pi over 2.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.630
The tangent of delta
goes to infinity.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.562
So there's something
going on here in which you

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:44.960
have this property.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.860
So let's plot this.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.956
So let's plot beta
over alpha minus k.

00:02:55.956 --> 00:03:00.400
You need a clock
to understand this.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.700
So this is k, and we're
plotting this quantity.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.586
Well, it's going to go
crazy at k equal alpha.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.320
That we know.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.090
When k is less than
alpha, I'm going

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.090
to assume that alpha
and beta are positive.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.996
They both have units of k.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.886
And when k is less than
alpha-- we begin here--

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:33.220
then this denominator
is positive,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.000
the numerator is positive,
ratio is positive.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.570
It's small, maybe.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.407
And then suddenly,
when k reaches alpha

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:45.365
it goes to infinity.

00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:51.540
So it's going to be like that.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.460
Now, it actually
is true that when

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.586
k differs by alpha by
beta, it reaches value 1.

00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:08.056
So here is alpha minus beta.

00:04:08.056 --> 00:04:10.790
That point it reaches value 1.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.000
So if I want this
thing to be very sharp,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.540
I need beta to be small
so that it's little

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.040
until it reaches beta within--

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.040
distance beta within alpha,
and then it shoots up.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:40.570
So I want beta to be
small for sharp behavior.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.354
On the other hand here,
it goes the other way.

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:57.560
It goes from minus
infinity back to 0,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:05.110
and has value minus
1 at alpha plus beta.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.420
So within minus beta, and
beta off of the center

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.015
alpha, most of
the things happen.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.820
If we plot now the
tangent of this,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:32.610
or the arctangent of this, tan
minus 1 of beta, alpha minus k,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.530
well, if the tangent of
an angle is very little,

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.250
the angle can be taken
to be very little.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.080
At this point, it
will reach pi over 2,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.340
so the angle is little,
will go to pi over 2,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.471
and then quickly becomes
larger than pi over 2,

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.780
you're thinking tangents.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.610
So the tangent is going up,
is blowing up at pi over 2.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.420
Then continuously, it
goes to minus pi over 2,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.350
and then continuously goes
to 0 so it reaches pi.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.080
So this is the
behavior of delta.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.950
Delta is this tan minus
1 of beta over that.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.630
And delta is doing
the right thing.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:32.200
It's doing this
kind of behavior.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.230
There is a shift.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.090
I could add a constant
here to produce this shift,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.410
but it's not important
at this moment.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.320
The resonance is
doing this thing,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.980
up to a total shift
of pi that doesn't

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.892
change the tangent of an angle.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.480
So this is one way
of modeling what's

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.320
happening to the phase
shift near our resonance.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.400
So let's explore
it a little more.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.690
I can do a couple
of calculations.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:15.130
For example, I can compute
what is d delta dk at k

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.970
equals alpha.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.240
That's should be
a nice quantity.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.261
Is a derivative of the face.

00:07:28.135 --> 00:07:31.250
At the resonance,
at the position

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.090
alpha of the resonance.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.563
So here's delta, here
is k, and there's

00:07:37.563 --> 00:07:39.660
the derivative of this k.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.600
And how should it be?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.000
Well, basically, the
phase changes by amount pi

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.760
over a distance beta or 2 beta.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.450
So this must be a
number divided by beta.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.080
You can calculate this
derivative from this equation.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.550
It's a nice exercise.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.472
It's actually just 1 over beta.

00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:13.130
That's a result. 1 over beta.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.210
The other quantity that
is nice to understand

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.120
is how does this
scattering amplitude

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.430
behave near the resonance.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.640
So what is the
value of as squared?

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.409
Oh, that's the absolute
value of psi s squared,

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.179
which is sine squared delta.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.160
That's the same
thing as As squared.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.944
Well, you know what is
the tangent of delta?

00:08:44.944 --> 00:08:49.890
A little trigonometric play
should be able to do it,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.500
and can give you the
sin squared delta.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.545
And here is the answer.

00:08:56.545 --> 00:09:01.950
It's beta squared over
beta squared plus alpha

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.112
minus k squared.

00:09:04.112 --> 00:09:07.970
Kind of a nice,
almost bell shape.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.860
Of course, it's polynomial,
but it looks a little

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:18.200
like just a nice symmetric
shape around alpha equal k.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:23.480
Now, this division is so famous
it has been given a name.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.100
It's called the
Breit-Wigner distribution.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.980
Breit-Wigner.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:43.100
But it's described as the
Breit-Wigner distribution,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.865
and it's usually referring
to terms of energy.

00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:50.280
Of energy, not momentum.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.840
So-- and it's--

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.920
what should happen to
scattering amplitude in general

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.710
when you have a resonance.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:12.950
So the way to do
this calculation now

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.300
is to say, well, what
is alpha minus k?

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.595
Let's try to relate it to the
energy minus the energy at k

00:10:22.595 --> 00:10:24.810
equal alpha.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.300
Well, this is h
squared k squared

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:37.810
over 2 m minus h squared
alpha squared over 2 m,

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:44.420
which is h squared over 2 m,
k squared minus alpha squared.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:55.250
On the other hand, I have
here alpha minus k squared.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.190
I don't have k squared
minus alpha squared.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:05.200
So-- approximations.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.120
if the resonance is narrow
enough, if beta is small,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.480
let's do an approximation.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.350
We do h squared over--

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.970
everybody knows
this approximation,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.920
shouldn't be afraid of doing it.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.405
It's alpha-- how
could I write it--

00:11:25.405 --> 00:11:30.295
k minus alpha
times k plus alpha.

00:11:34.015 --> 00:11:39.400
And the approximation is that
all the interesting thing

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.575
comes from the difference
between k and alpha,

00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:45.300
how close k is to alpha.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.925
So when k is close to
alpha, all the dependence

00:11:49.925 --> 00:11:51.770
is going to be here.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.880
This is going to be about 2
alpha when k is near alpha.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.600
And if it's a little
more than that,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.220
it doesn't matter,
because it's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.710
So this could be
approximated to 2 alpha,

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:14.050
and therefore this becomes h
squared alpha over m times k

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.030
minus alpha.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.645
So that's a little help.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:30.570
Then size of s squared,
doing a little more

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.080
of algebra with the
constants there.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.540
Probably you want to
do it with two lines.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.560
It's tricky.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.720
It's really simple.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.820
It's always written
in this form--

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:51.540
1 over 4 gamma squared over
e minus e alpha squared

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:57.010
plus 1 over four gamma
squared, and that's

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.780
the so-called
Breit-Wigner distribution.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:07.670
And gamma is a
funny constant here.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.630
We'll try to
understand it better.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.050
2 alpha beta h squared over m.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.410
It has to be something that
depends on alpha and beta,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.960
because after all,
we weren't modeling

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.820
the resonance with alpha beta.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.000
So this curve is very famous.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.224
That's the distribution of
the scattering amplitude

00:13:40.224 --> 00:13:43.010
over energies whenever
you have a resonance.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.130
So we should plot it.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.200
You have an e alpha.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.730
You have an e alpha
plus gamma over 2

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:57.650
and e alpha minus gamma over 2.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:04.220
But the energy minus e alpha
is equal to the gamma over 2,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.830
you get the gamma squared over
4 so the total amplitude goes

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.960
down to 1/2 of the
usual amplitudes.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.970
When the energy is equal
to e alpha, you get 1.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.894
1 for psi s squared.

00:14:23.894 --> 00:14:30.150
But when the energy differs
from e alpha by gamma over 2,

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.600
you get half.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:42.160
So-- actually, I'm not
sure of the deflection

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.860
point, where it is.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.224
Probably not there.

00:14:45.224 --> 00:14:47.684
Or is it there?

00:14:47.684 --> 00:14:50.174
I don't know.

00:14:50.174 --> 00:14:53.440
I drew it as if it is there.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:09.730
So that's the distribution, and
the width over here is gamma.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.780
So gamma is called the
width at half power,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.546
or at half intensity.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.780
Yeah.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:32.790
Width-- the half width
of the distribution.

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:27.450
IAIN STEWART: All
right, so last time, we

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.240
were talking about degrees
of freedom in SCET.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.720
And I drew these two pictures
and emphasized to you

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.670
that the difference
between these two pictures

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.970
is really where the degrees of
freedom live in momentum space.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.040
So this is the P
minus P plus plane.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.640
And unlike most
effective field theories,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.560
in this effective
field theory we

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.000
have degrees of
freedom that have

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.700
to be identified by two
variables rather than just one.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.560
So we need two variables
to say where collinears are

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.560
or where softs are.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.600
And there was
generically, I said,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.550
a dependence on the process.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.510
So SCET, or what degrees
of freedom you need,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.120
depends what you're studying.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.220
And it's generically
not the case

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.660
that these two
effective theories

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.340
that I wrote down
for you will describe

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.940
every possible process.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.690
In fact, SCET, of
course, won't describe

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.750
every possible process.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.375
So what effective
field theory you need

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.310
depends on what
you're looking at.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.360
It just turns out that these
two sets of degrees of freedom

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.860
that I wrote down
to you do describe

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.120
a lot of different processes.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.720
And that's why the language
of SCETI and SCETII is useful,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.040
but there's no guarantees.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.880
You could run into a
process that requires

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.880
more degrees of freedom.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.160
And there are
examples of processes

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.070
that require more degrees
of freedom than this,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.850
but this is still a
useful starting point.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.060
And this is where we'll start.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.850
And then we were talking
a little bit about fields

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.750
last time.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.980
And one thing I derived for
you was that the collinear

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.415
field has a power counting that
makes it scale like lambda.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.860
This is the collinear quark.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.330
And then at the end of lecture,
we also derived a formula

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.370
for the collinear gluons.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.000
So if we write down components
of the collinear gluon plus,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.720
minus, and perp--

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.820
we remember what
these notation means.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.970
This means n dot A. And
this means n bar dot A.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.304
And we figured out that
the scaling for these guys

00:02:45.304 --> 00:02:47.180
is lambda squared 1 lambda.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.550
And we said that that was
nice because we could put them

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.260
together with a derivative and
have a covariant derivative,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.205
which I wrote in
terms of momenta just

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:00.080
to sort of emphasize.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.998
So, if you like, this
is momentum space,

00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:16.790
that these guys had
the same power counting

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.093
in the different components.

00:03:19.093 --> 00:03:21.260
And so when we come and
talk about gauge invariance,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.820
this fact that they have
the same power counting

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.237
in the different components
will, of course, be important.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:29.720
Because what gauge invariance
does is ties momenta to gluons.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.970
And if we didn't have
the same power counting

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.980
in the different
components, then we

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.860
would not have a gauge
field corresponding

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.710
to a certain momenta.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.702
OK, so another way of
arguing that they should

00:03:41.702 --> 00:03:43.910
have the same power counting
would have been directly

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.430
from gauge invariance.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.430
All right, I'd like
to continue there.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.190
The one thing that
you'll note, which

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.100
is unusual from an effective
theory point of view,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.210
is there's a set of fields that
have no suppression at all.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.180
These A n minus gluon
fields just scale like one.

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:13.200
So when you have
dimensional power counting,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.492
all the fields have dimensions.

00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:15.900
You add more fields.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.070
You get higher dimensions.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.720
You get suppression.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.760
Here, with this
lambda power counting,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.420
there's a component of the gauge
field that has no suppression.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.420
We can add as many
of them as we want.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.070
And that costs nothing.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.940
So let's do that and
see what happens.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.820
So a priori, you might think
that this is really bad

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.400
because you could have
an infinite number

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.050
of different operators
at lowest order

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.770
just with a different number
of these A n minus fields.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.895
And we'll see that actually
things are not so bad,

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:18.020
but I think it's best to
do that by way of example.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.080
So we'll consider an example
that just has one collinear

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.360
particle in it for simplicity.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.940
And we can do that by
having a heavy particle that

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.300
carries a lot of energy
decay to a light particle,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.360
like a B quark decaying
to an up quark.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.650
So in QCD, our current
would just be u bar gamma b.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.100
Gamma would be
left-handed current.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.855
And we can consider the
B quark to be in HQET.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.000
And we have an energetic u quark
as what we want to consider.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.275
It's not the only
possibility, but we

00:06:19.275 --> 00:06:21.400
could pump all the momentum
out through the current

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.700
into the leptons into the e nu.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.490
But let's pump energy
into the up quark,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.510
so that it's energetic.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.234
So here's the current in QCD.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.690
b goes to u.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.540
And the notation that
I'll use for this

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.110
is a double line
for the heavy quark

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.270
and then a dashed line
for the collinear quark.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.770
So this guy is going to be
described by an hv field.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.320
This guy is going to be
described by Cn field.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.420
This is production, so
this will be a Cn bar.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.680
So I'll reserve this
notation of dashed lines

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.647
for collinear quark propagators.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.680
OK, so the simple
minded thing is just

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.047
to write down an
effective theory current

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:29.630
where I replace the full theory
fields by the effective theory

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.130
fields.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:35.840
I replace the up quark, an up
quark that's a Cn collinear

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.150
field in some direction.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.230
And I replace the heavy quark
by an hv for the b quark.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.130
Then, effectively, that would
be the tree level matching

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.710
between this diagram
and that diagram

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.395
or the tree level matching
from that particular diagram.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.490
But let's consider adding
these A n minus gluons,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.290
since they were things that
we could add to the current.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.270
So we can add any number
of A n minuses here,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.687
and we'd have something that's
the same order in the power

00:08:10.687 --> 00:08:12.080
counting.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:23.420
So let's consider another
diagram in QCD, where I just

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.867
attach an A n minus gluon.

00:08:24.867 --> 00:08:26.450
And I'll attach it
to the heavy quark.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.490
So I have a different
number of external fields,

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.860
but this one costs
me nothing when

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.159
I go to the effective theory.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.789
Let's call this momentum here k.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.782
We'll call this guy here q.

00:08:46.782 --> 00:08:49.980
And this guy here
we'll just say is MbV.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.580
So then k is MbV plus q.

00:09:05.736 --> 00:09:07.560
And I can write q
out in components

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.500
since it's a collinear particle.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.500
And if I want to
identify the big piece,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.380
then that would be
the n bar dot qp's.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.930
So remember last time, from
looking at coordinates,

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.670
we can write out any vector
in terms of the coordinates.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.878
And it's useful to do that
since the coordinates have

00:09:23.878 --> 00:09:25.845
a different power counter.

00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:27.720
Now, what's going to
appear in the propagator

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:33.280
here is k squared minus m
squared minus Mb squared.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.640
So let's look at k squared.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.960
So if I square this term,
I just get Mb squared.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.600
If I square this term, I
get 0, but then there's

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.700
a cross term as well.

00:09:52.095 --> 00:09:53.220
And then there's some dots.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.680
And the dots are indicating
terms that are suppressed.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:09.700
And so if I look at k squared
minus M squared, then that's n

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.744
dot v Mb n bar dot q.

00:10:13.744 --> 00:10:19.125
And this order lambda to the
0 since the momentum n bar

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:22.300
dot q was order lambda to the 0.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:29.410
So there's no power
counting to the propagator.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.525
Another way of saying
it is this propagator

00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:34.540
is off-shell by a hard amount.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.880
These scales are hard.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.900
And if I go back
to my picture, that

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:44.050
means they're up here
in this purple region,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.450
purple box around this.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.920
OK, so the degree of freedom,
which is this purple propagator

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.100
is actually living up
in that purple region.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:02.280
It's something we have
to integrate out, OK?

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.090
So let's do that.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.262
So integrating it out just
means expanding the diagram.

00:11:11.262 --> 00:11:12.970
And I've already
expanded the propagator,

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.760
so there's the denominators.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.957
We just have to
expand the numerator.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.640
OK.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.000
Let me write out A n mu,
but we replace the spinner

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.840
by the field.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.480
And I'll start by just writing
in the full propagator,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.000
and then we'll
start expanding it.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:02.170
I'm using a convention here for
the gluon interaction in QCD,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.990
which is plus igTA gamma mu.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.927
So there's the full theory.

00:12:13.927 --> 00:12:15.510
All I've done is
take the full theory.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.472
And rather than write spinners
and a polarization vector,

00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:19.680
I've just written the fields.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.210
Because I'm, in
the end, interested

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.300
in looking at what
kind of operator I get.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.850
So I'm interested here in
taking the piece, which

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.140
is not suppressed.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.695
So let's just do this slowly.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.170
So there's an index A
on this guy as well.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.040
So let's write out the leading
order piece of the numerator.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.170
I've collected some i's,
put the M, the g out front.

00:13:01.172 --> 00:13:03.380
So if I take all the order
1 pieces of the numerator,

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.797
then these are the
order 1 pieces.

00:13:04.797 --> 00:13:07.280
Mb is order 1.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.931
k I can replace by MbV plus q.

00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:14.015
And then there's an MbV
slash that's order 1 and an n

00:13:14.015 --> 00:13:15.500
slash over 2 n bar dot q.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.100
That's the same decomposition
we had over there.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.500
Here, because I'm interested
in certain polarization,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.270
let me pull out
that polarization.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.960
Then I have my denominator.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.733
And my denominator
we already expanded,

00:13:34.733 --> 00:13:35.900
so let's just write that in.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.960
OK, so far, so good?

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.740
So this piece here is
0 because n squared

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.050
is 0. n slash
squared is n squared.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.730
So then we have this piece.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.520
For this piece, 1 plus
v slash, remember,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.380
is part of a projector that
could act on the heavy quark.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.880
But there's this n
slash in the way,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.720
so we want to push it through.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.800
So we can do that.

00:14:30.832 --> 00:14:33.290
So let me write out the two
pieces from pushing it through.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.236
There's an Mb that cancels
this Mb once that term's gone.

00:14:40.236 --> 00:14:41.450
So let me do that.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.940
When I push it through, I
switch to 1 minus v slash.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.740
There's still a 1
over n dot v here.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.730
And then there's an hv.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:04.450
And 1 minus v slash on the
heavy quark field is 0.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:11.860
And then the n dot
v cancels n dot v.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.630
So if I want to
write this putting,

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:21.100
now, this A n field inside
because the TA is inside,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.900
then I would write it like this.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.800
So the momentum here n
bar dot q is order 1.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.670
And this n bar dot
A n is order 1.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.680
So this operator is the same
size as this operator here.

00:15:52.097 --> 00:15:54.430
And that's what I was saying
that we should worry about,

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.250
the fact that we can add
these gluons without any cost.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.123
And we just added
one and found out we

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:00.790
have an operative
that's the same order.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.230
So the way you might draw this--

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.480
and there's a convention
also for collinear gluons

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.870
where you put a
line through them,

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.590
so this is a collinear gluon--

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:30.177
is that this guy is the
same order as this guy, OK?

00:16:30.177 --> 00:16:32.760
Well, we'll come back to this,
talk more about it in a minute.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.010
Let's consider another diagram.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.780
We attached the
gluon on the left.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.180
Let's also attach it on the
right, see what happens.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:54.210
So again-- QCD diagram,
doing the same thing,

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.330
attaching the
gluon here, some q.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.850
This is some momentum p.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.780
And this is p minus q.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.477
This case is different
than the previous case.

00:17:07.477 --> 00:17:09.060
The reason that this
case is different

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.119
is that both p and
q are collinear.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:16.369
And so p minus q is collinear,
too, same scaling as p and q.

00:17:27.187 --> 00:17:29.706
So this propagator
is not off-shell.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.940
In our hyperbolas, it would
live on the blue hyperbola

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:43.490
that I drew, which is well
within the effective theory,

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.658
not outside the
effective theory.

00:17:45.658 --> 00:17:47.950
So we don't want to integrate
out this propagator here.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.700
And what that means
is that there will be,

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.480
in the effective theory
itself, an interaction,

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.260
a Lagrangian interaction
that takes into

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.135
account this diagram.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.800
So in the effective
theory, if you like,

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.640
if I draw an effective
theory diagram,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.330
there will be an
effective theory diagram

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.250
that allows us to
attach that gluon

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.330
because this propagator
here is a propagator

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.500
in the effective theory.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.422
Unlike the one that I just
erased which was off-shell

00:19:09.422 --> 00:19:11.630
and had to be integrated
out of the effective theory,

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:17.390
this one is inside the
effective theory, OK?

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.890
So adding on the
left does something

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.840
different than
adding on the right.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.660
On the left, we've knocked
the quark off-shell.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.860
We add on the right,
it's close to mass shell.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.710
So we can consider
generalizing what we just

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.940
did by adding more gluons.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:41.150
Remember that we don't
have any restrictions

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.200
on how many we can add.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.030
So let's just
consider adding more.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.530
Let's add m of them.

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:10.830
And I'll call the
momenta q1, q2, to qm.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.710
And all these propagators
here are off-shell.

00:20:19.012 --> 00:20:20.390
This is a QCD graph.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.640
When I calculate
graphs like this,

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.280
if I have these gluons there,
I have to also consider

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.300
cross-diagrams.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.610
So rather than trying
to draw cross-diagrams,

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.040
let me just cross-gluon graphs.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.700
And what you would expect
from what we've said before

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.200
is that in the
effective theory this

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.490
is going to catch on to
some kind of Feynman rule

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.360
that looks like
this, but then has

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.740
a bunch of gluons that can
come out of the vertex,

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.720
in this case m of them.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.140
That's what we expect.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.690
And so we expect
a generalization

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.750
of this operator with m
fields rather than just 1.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.490
So if we do this
calculation, it actually

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.200
turns out to not
be too complicated.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.780
I can include all cross-diagrams
by sum over permutations.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:47.760
I have one of these n bar dot A
gluons for each external gluon

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.150
line with a corresponding
color factor.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:55.180
And I keep the largest
piece of the denominator.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.230
And I'm always just getting
the order 1 momenta.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.220
And there's a
slight complication

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.540
that, when I have
a graph like this,

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.450
if I look at the momentum
of this, it's q1.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.367
But if I look at the
momentum of the next one,

00:22:11.367 --> 00:22:13.155
this would be q1 plus q2.

00:22:13.155 --> 00:22:16.170
And so the denominators here are
not just simply q's, but sums

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.740
of q's.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:26.620
OK.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.380
And these n's would
be dotted into fields.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.970
And T's would be
dotted into fields.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:44.110
So if we want to write this as
an effective theory operator,

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.970
then we should think about
what this vertex means

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.437
in the effective theory.

00:22:48.437 --> 00:22:50.020
And we should be a
little bit careful.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.690
Because what this means,
if you think about it

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.090
in terms of the locality
of this diagram,

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.910
is that all these gluons are
coming out of the same point.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.250
So it's like phi 4 theory where
you divide by 4 factorial.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.830
You have to be a
little bit careful

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.440
because any one of these
gluons, from the point of view

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.750
of the external states,
could be as equally

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.190
good as an attachment.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.270
So when we put in
the gluon fields,

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.453
we ought to be careful
about those factors.

00:23:18.453 --> 00:23:19.870
So this is the
right Feynman rule.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.600
And one way of just
thinking about it is we'll

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.540
have m of these fields, but then
we'll divide by an m factorial.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.970
So we can write down the
complete result for the two

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:13.068
level matching as an
operator since we just

00:24:13.068 --> 00:24:14.235
calculated all the diagrams.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.410
So we started with this current.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.250
We're in QCD.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.330
And we matched it at
tree level onto a current

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.600
that I can write like this,
hiding all the complexity

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:56.930
in this thing I call
W. I have to sum

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.310
over however many attachments,
which I was previously calling

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.690
m, but now I'm calling k.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:34.730
And if you study this guy for
a while, actually what is true

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.720
is that this guy has a name.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.420
This is a momentum
space Wilson line.

00:25:52.056 --> 00:25:54.380
So what is a position
space Wilson line?

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.960
That's where it really
looks more like a line.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.810
So a Wilson line is a
string of gauge fields

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.550
that goes between
two points, here

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.420
between minus infinity and 0.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.900
There are some
ordering to the fields

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.160
because they don't commute.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.327
Because they're not abelian.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.720
And the fact that
it's a line means

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.170
that we go in a straight
line between the two points.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.370
So here's a path which
is a straight line

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.230
s between minus infinity and 0.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.960
And actually, this formula here,
the Fourier transform of this,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.010
is giving you the Wilson
line that I drew up--

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:50.625
the Feynman rule that I
drew up there or the fields

00:26:50.625 --> 00:26:51.500
that I drew up there.

00:27:22.702 --> 00:27:24.850
So there's some
ordering to the fields.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.860
And what this P does
is it orders the fields

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.850
in an appropriate way.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:30.040
Namely, it puts the guys
with the larger argument

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:30.640
to the left.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.160
So on your homework,
you're going

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.260
to do the exercise of
thinking about doing

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:55.570
this matching for two gluons
and taking the Fourier transform

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.670
this and connecting these.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:00.160
At least I believe
that's what I asked.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.950
That's a very good exercise
to see everything work out

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:06.830
that I'm just describing
to you here in words.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.280
So one way of thinking about
what's happened in this

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.447
effective theory-- and this
actually turns out to be

00:28:11.447 --> 00:28:12.490
generically true--

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:16.540
is that rather than having
this embarked on a field, which

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.900
was order 1, it actually can
be traded for this Wilson line

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.305
object.

00:28:21.305 --> 00:28:22.930
So I just showed you
that that happened

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.420
for this particular example,
but it turns out actually

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.160
to be genetic, that, instead
of talking about the n

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.990
bar of A field, we can
talk about this function

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.670
of the field, which
is this Wilson line.

00:28:44.894 --> 00:28:46.740
Lift that for a sec.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.060
So this is true
in this operator.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.620
We just got this Wilson line.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.110
In terms of the Wilson line,
things are pretty simple.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.980
And it actually turns out
to be generically true,

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.170
and we'll see that later on.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.400
And we'll also talk
about gauge invariance

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.490
later on, which has
to do with this story.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.760
It turns out that this
Wilson line can also

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.160
be understood from the point
of view of gauge invariance.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.840
The need for this
Wilson line can

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.960
be understood from the point
of view of gauge invariance.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.120
And I can at least describe
that to you in words.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.100
So if you look at
this diagram here,

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.460
we can't attach collinear
gluons to this quark.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.680
But this carries color.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.560
We can attach collinear gluons
to this quark, no problem.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.750
It doesn't knock it
off-shell or anything.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.620
So we're going to have a
problem with gauge symmetry

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.080
because we have two
things that are colored.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.570
A priori, we're going to have
a problem with gauge symmetry

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:56.190
because we have two things
of color, one of which

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.380
we can't attach effective
theory fields to and one

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.150
of which we can.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:03.000
But there's also operators
with gluons in them,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.530
which are these ones.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:09.380
And what effectively happens is
that the gauge transformation

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.940
that used to be for
this heavy quark field,

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.650
it gets moved into
this Wilson line.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.690
So this Wilson
line will transform

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.690
in a way that compensates
for the transformation

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.060
of this collinear quark field.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.480
And that's exactly because
the gluons here, which

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.660
were kind of the corresponding
gluons in QCD for the gauge

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.660
transformation, are
explicitly integrated out

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.860
to give that Wilson line.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.650
So it's all tied together.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.860
We'll come back and talk about
that in more detail later.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.590
All right, so let's consider
now the effective theory now

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.440
that we have some idea of how
these calculations are working.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.270
And let's consider this
SCETI effective theory.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:12.210
So we have a collinear mode and
an ultra soft mode with momenta

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.730
that we're scaling in this way.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:20.820
And we also know, if we
consider the Feynman rules,

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.250
we can look at what the
propagators would look like.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:29.040
So let's consider, first of
all, having a collinear gluon.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.360
And let's just try to think
about what kind of propagators

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.180
the effective theory
is going to have.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.300
So maybe this comes
from a heavy quark.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.990
So we have this possibility
of having a collinear gluon,

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.890
momentum q.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.130
We expanded the propagator
for that last time.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.970
And the important point about
this being a collinear gluon

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.630
is that p and q
are the same size.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.380
So we never drop p relative
to q or q relative to p.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:09.070
So if we write out
the components,

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.890
we did this last time.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.390
And we found that
there was really

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.340
no expansion in the denominator.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.330
And in the numerator, we
could make an expansion

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.940
and just keep the
leading order piece.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.935
So the propagator would
be proportional to this.

00:32:24.935 --> 00:32:27.310
There's some spin structure
as well that I'm not writing.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:35.800
But q of the gluon is
of order p of the quark.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.240
So nothing gets dropped.

00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:46.330
So this is going to
be a propagator that

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.870
exists in the effective theory.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.230
That's what I was saying before.

00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:01.170
The other thing we
could do is we could

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.080
attach an ultra soft particle.

00:33:10.498 --> 00:33:12.290
We could actually attach
it to either side,

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.750
but let me focus
on the right side.

00:33:22.015 --> 00:33:23.890
So there's going to be
some ultra soft gluon.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.200
It's not collinear
to any direction.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:31.420
Let's call its momenta
k, call this still p.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.340
Now, k is much smaller than
p by our power counting.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.970
So the k is of order
lambda squared.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.737
So in n bar dot k is
much less than n bar dot

00:33:45.737 --> 00:33:48.394
p, which is of order lambda 0.

00:33:48.394 --> 00:33:53.590
k perp is much less than p
perp, which is of order lambda.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:57.100
And then the n dot
k is or order n

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.920
dot p because those are
both lambda squared.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.990
So here it's not going
to be like over there.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.332
There is actually going
to be an expansion that

00:34:05.332 --> 00:34:07.165
occurs because things
are of different size.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:15.770
So if I only keep the leading
order terms and the propagator

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.500
here, well, the numerator
I just have n bar

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.068
dot p because n
bar dot k is small.

00:34:23.068 --> 00:34:24.860
And the only place that
I need to keep both

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.350
is in this n dot term.

00:34:36.826 --> 00:34:38.409
So there is an
expansion that goes on.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.310
And again, if I look at how
off-shell this propagator is,

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.469
it's perfectly within
the effective theory.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:35:01.360
So this is a propagator with
off-shellness that leaves it

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.680
inside the effective theory.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:07.660
OK.

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.730
So it's not far
off-shell by any means.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.330
In fact, it's just as off-shell
as the propagator over there

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.530
for the collinear particles.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.260
So it doesn't really
make sense to think

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.798
about treating this propagator
any different than treating

00:35:19.798 --> 00:35:22.090
this propagator from an
effective theory point of view.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.390
But you see that
the Feynman rule

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.780
has to somehow know whether
you're in this situation where

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.330
you need to keep the
momentum of the gluon

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.580
or whether you're in this
situation where the momentum

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.372
should be expanded.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.190
And we'll see how that works.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.820
So this is by way of
sort of giving you

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.180
a hint as to what's to come
and what kind of complications

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.010
we'll face in the
effective theory

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.680
because the effective theory can
interact with collinear gluons

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.210
or these ultra soft gluons.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:59.888
And it somehow needs to be only
keeping leading order terms.

00:35:59.888 --> 00:36:02.180
If it's really the leading
order effective theory, then

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.240
we should just keep this term.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.210
We shouldn't keep these
higher order terms.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:07.085
But over here, we have
to keep all the terms.

00:36:11.142 --> 00:36:13.350
So what should the leading
order effective theory do?

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.410
What should we demand of it?

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:24.330
We've basically, now,
set up all the things

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.830
that we need to
think about in order

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.410
to figure out what the leading
order effective theory is.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.530
So let's do that.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.770
OK, so what do we demand
of this Lagrangian?

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:45.940
It should yield the
propagator of course

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.560
and, also, interactions.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.050
Within this effective
theory, it has interactions

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:02.490
both with collinear gluons
in that diagram over there

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.350
and with ultra soft gluons.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.130
And you can see
even from here why

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.460
we need two different
fields because there

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.430
has to be some way
of telling that we

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.550
have a different propagator in
this case than in that case.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.820
Or put another way,
the external field

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.290
here has a different
power counting

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.590
than the external field here.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.740
So already we're kind
of seeing that we

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.800
need two different gluon fields
in this effective theory,

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.260
as we said earlier.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.190
So the Lagrangian has to have
interactions with both of them.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.790
It has to have both
quarks and antiquarks

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:45.090
because remember that
collinear quarks and collinear

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.870
antiquarks both existed
as leading order things.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.470
That's not like HQET where one
of them gets integrated out.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.510
And basically, that
is just the statement

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.310
that, say you have a collinear
gluon going along very quickly.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:01.890
It can para-- create a
quark and an antiquark.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:03.420
And if they're,
again, collinear,

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.360
that's something that has to
be allowed to happen at order

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.040
1 in this effective theory.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.010
OK.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.950
So, so far, so good.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:17.540
This is just saying,
what kind of fields

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.598
are we going to have
in this Lagrangian.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:26.150
This third bullet is related
to what I was just stressing,

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.690
that we have to get a
leading order propagator

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.672
in different situations.

00:38:32.672 --> 00:38:34.130
So somehow the
effective theory has

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:38.930
to know something about
the size of momenta that

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.610
are running through it.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.210
And if we want to be
strict about defining

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:50.780
the effective theory and just
defining the leading order

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.120
term, it's not OK
that we expand later.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.050
We really have to
expand ahead of time.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:05.120
And so whatever the Lagrangian
is, it should just give this.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.100
And it should just give this.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.318
And it should not
give these dots, OK?

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.610
So that's what I mean by
having no additional expansion.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.660
And the final thing is
a little more subtle.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:34.430
And that is that we
should think ahead.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.383
So when we design
this effective theory,

00:39:36.383 --> 00:39:38.800
we're not only going to want
to describe the leading order

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.330
term, but we're
also going to want

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:41.865
to describe power corrections.

00:39:41.865 --> 00:39:43.990
Because if we can't describe
the power corrections,

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.948
we don't really have an
effective field theory.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.250
So whatever we do,
we should make sure

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.210
that we have a notion of what's
going on with higher order

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.717
terms, that they're
well-defined things, that we

00:39:56.717 --> 00:39:58.800
can think ahead about what
the operators are going

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.010
to look like.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.590
And we need that
in order to know

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.750
that we can formulate those
operators and make sure

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.810
they're suppressed.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:14.040
So another way of putting it is
that we should set things up,

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.780
so we don't have
to re-set things up

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.248
when we start talking
about power corrections.

00:40:33.068 --> 00:40:35.610
So we really should think about
the effective theory globally

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:38.490
even though we're sort of
starting by formulating

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.170
a leading order term.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.420
We should think about the
power corrections as well

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.320
and how those interactions
are going to behave.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.152
OK, so that's saying that
we want to think about,

00:40:50.152 --> 00:40:51.610
at least, what
these dots are going

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:53.655
to look like, what
this plus dot,

00:40:53.655 --> 00:40:56.540
dot, dot is going to look like.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.940
OK, so this is our goal.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.170
And we'll go through it slowly.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.320
So this is a top-down
effective theory.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.030
So we can start with
QCD, and then we

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.420
can integrate out the
off-shell degrees of freedom.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.590
We can just formulate
from what SCET

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:22.080
is by starting with
the QCD Lagrangian

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.530
and splitting it into
the fields that we want

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.660
and manipulating it.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:34.420
So let's start with
psi bar iD slash psi.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.135
And let's write psi in
terms of two fields.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.245
And this goes back
to our discussion

00:41:50.245 --> 00:41:51.745
when we were talking
about spinners.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:01.180
So these two fields have a
projector on the full theory

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:10.546
field, and they obey n bar
slash, n slash, n slash,

00:42:10.546 --> 00:42:11.440
n bar slash.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.266
Cn is Cn.

00:42:13.266 --> 00:42:21.430
And the n bar slash n
slash by n bar is by n bar.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.800
So I want to write out the
QCD Lagrangian in terms

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.223
of component because the
different derivatives,

00:42:26.223 --> 00:42:28.390
the different components
of the covariant derivative

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.760
and the different
regular derivatives

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:35.620
inside that derivative, have
different power counting, OK?

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.210
So let's do that.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.550
And I'll introduce these two
fields in order to do that.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.020
So if you like, I'm just taking
QCD and writing it in these

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.842
coordinates that we're
setting our usual coordinates

00:42:49.842 --> 00:42:50.800
for talking about SCET.

00:42:56.332 --> 00:43:10.540
So decompose the D
slash and just write out

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.355
the field as these two pieces.

00:43:16.908 --> 00:43:18.325
And then I can
multiply these out.

00:43:18.325 --> 00:43:19.950
And because of the
projection relation,

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.060
some of these
products will vanish.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.220
So if I only write the
pieces that don't vanish,

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:29.140
then I only have four
pieces, which are these four.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.790
So all other combinations
that I didn't write

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.205
vanish, and those four survive.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.880
We'll do one example,
so you see what

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.880
the strategy is for getting
rid of the other terms.

00:44:36.342 --> 00:44:38.050
So let's consider one
of the other terms.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.440
Let's consider the guy
with the D perp slash,

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.955
but between two Cn fields.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.250
So I can insert the projector.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.580
And then I can move it
through the D perp slash.

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:09.270
I'm moving two things
through, and they both

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.480
have 0 dot product with D perp.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.620
So there's no additional terms.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.600
I just can push it through.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.600
And n slash on Cn bar is 0.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.090
So n slash on Cn
was 0, remember.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:25.020
And if you take the dagger and
make it into a bar relation,

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.520
you also have this formula.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.270
So this is 0.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.830
And a similar thing--

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.840
by inserting projectors,
we can figure out

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.190
which terms are non-0.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:38.570
And these ones I'm writing
are the non-0 ones.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:39.482
This guy's 0.

00:45:39.482 --> 00:45:40.690
That's why I didn't write it.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.240
OK, so any questions so far?

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.850
Hot today, drink lots of water.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:55.960
OK.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.210
This is just QCD.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.210
I haven't done anything.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:05.034
I just write QCD out and assign
some strange coordinates.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.760
So now, I'm going to
do one thing, which

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.850
is going to end up simplifying
our lives a little bit later

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:35.647
on.

00:46:35.647 --> 00:46:37.730
And I'm going to use the
fact that, when we talked

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.550
about production
of quarks, we said

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:42.500
we're going to produce
this Cn type of quark

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.510
and not the phi n bar
bar type of quark.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:54.780
So phi n bar,
remember, corresponded

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.630
to sub-leading
spinner components.

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:04.500
So let's just decree
that I don't really

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.330
care about this field.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.090
And, therefore, I don't need
to have any current in my path

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:10.920
integral that I
couple to this guy.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.970
So it's like an auxiliary
field if you like.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.530
And because the path integral
in this fermionic field

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:44.200
is quadratic, we can just
remove it from the path,

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.730
just do the path
integral over it.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:50.770
Once we know that there's
no source term for it,

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.280
we can just do the path
integral since all the terms are

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.560
explicitly written over there.

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:07.880
So let's see what
happens when we do that.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.750
So doing the path integral
for this quadratic field just

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.640
means solving the
equations of motion.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.970
So we take the variational
derivative with respect

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:27.717
to phi n bar of the Lagrangian.

00:48:27.717 --> 00:48:29.425
And that gives us the
following equation.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:01.740
We could multiply both
terms in this equation

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.160
by an n bar slash over 2.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.340
And then we can use the
projection relation.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.487
Just to simplify the
Dirac structure a little,

00:49:10.487 --> 00:49:12.570
we can move the Dirac
structure from here to here.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.440
And then we could formally solve
this equation for the phi n

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:37.940
bar.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.374
It's an inverse
covariant derivative.

00:49:50.675 --> 00:49:52.947
I can push this through
this at the cost of a sign.

00:49:52.947 --> 00:49:54.530
So if I move it to
the right-hand side

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:58.850
of the equation, that
takes care of that sign.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.768
So I did two sign changes.

00:50:00.768 --> 00:50:02.060
I moved something to the right.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.790
And then I pushed these
through each other

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.570
to get that equation.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:08.070
OK.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:21.696
So what this is saying, in
terms of the original field,

00:50:21.696 --> 00:50:23.570
is that I have this
equation for psi.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:30.630
So if we take that
result and we plug it

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:43.720
back into our Lagrangian,
which I meant to give a star,

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:50.650
then we'll just have an
equation in terms of the C.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:53.080
We already used two terms.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.300
And so those two terms,
when you plug it back in,

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.140
they just cancel.

00:51:02.333 --> 00:51:04.000
So there was two terms
in the Lagrangian

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.036
that had psi n bar bar.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:37.930
And the remaining
two you have that.

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:45.470
OK, so this is Lagrangian that's
just in terms of the Cn field.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:47.020
We'll call it double star.

00:51:51.096 --> 00:51:52.810
Previous guy was
supposed to be star.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.480
OK, so several questions arise.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.190
What have we done?

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:02.290
Do we like this inverse
covariant derivative?

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:03.400
Are we happy with that?

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.480
Are we unhappy with it?

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.720
So what does an inverse
covariant derivative mean?

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.140
Well, actually just what is
an inverse derivative mean?

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:12.490
This is an inverse operator.

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.030
So what does that mean?

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.830
So the way you define
an inverse operator

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.840
is exactly how you define
an inverse operator

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.830
in quantum mechanics.

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:34.775
So let me remind you of that.

00:52:34.775 --> 00:52:37.150
This is the analog of, in
quantum mechanics, having, say,

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.950
a 1 over r potential.

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:41.730
But if r is an operator, then
you have a 1 over an operator.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.330
And the way that you define
that is by the eigenvalues.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:14.410
So 1 over i in r dot
partial of some field

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:19.570
i of x you can write it out
in terms of momentum space.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.310
So if we go over to momentum
space, that's the eigenbasis.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.570
And then the
eigenvalue is just 1

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:38.795
over the momentum, this
component of the momentum.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.234
OK, so it's just the
Fourier transform of that.

00:53:46.234 --> 00:53:47.490
So this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:47.990
Yup.

00:53:54.105 --> 00:53:54.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:56.710
I have a question
about whether or not

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.163
you've actually done nothing.

00:53:58.163 --> 00:53:59.830
IAIN STEWART: I have
done nothing, yeah.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:01.518
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
seems [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:01.518 --> 00:54:03.310
IAIN STEWART: Yeah,
that's my next comment.

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:04.225
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:04.225 --> 00:54:07.200
And so phi n bar--

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.200
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, so--

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.617
AUDIENCE: Actually corresponding
to this other new spinner

00:54:10.617 --> 00:54:12.822
would mean that you're only
considering interactions

00:54:12.822 --> 00:54:13.780
that are all collinear.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.363
In the original
piece, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:15.363 --> 00:54:17.110
does contain that interaction.

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:18.485
IAIN STEWART: The
only difference

00:54:18.485 --> 00:54:21.640
between what I've done so
far in QCD is that, in QCD,

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.410
if we were to think
about QCD, we'd

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:26.950
couple external currents both
to this phi n bar as well

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:29.310
as the Cn.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.580
And that's the only difference.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.452
But there's a small
community of people

00:54:34.452 --> 00:54:36.160
that actually think
about this Lagrangian

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.410
as the QCD Lagrangian.

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:41.710
And that's because, if I
was willing to a couple

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.620
a current to this particular
combination of fields,

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.810
I could still call it QCD, OK?

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:50.380
So in that sense,
if I really demand

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.600
that I'm only producing
Cn's and I just

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:59.313
have a term that's, like, JCn
and I don't have this phi n

00:54:59.313 --> 00:55:00.730
bar, then it's
something different

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:04.120
because I'm not directly
able to produce these guys.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:08.140
But if I allow myself,
also, to couple

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:10.690
to this combination here,
then I can do everything

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:11.950
in terms of these Cn fields.

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:13.780
And it's really just QCD.

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.150
AUDIENCE: So star star
is exactly collinear QCD

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:18.520
if you're only producing in--

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:18.850
IAIN STEWART: Exactly.

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:20.642
AUDIENCE: --forward
direction or something?

00:55:20.642 --> 00:55:21.351
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:23.530
IAIN STEWART: Just even
simpler, it's exactly

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:26.050
QCD if I only produce these Cn.

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.450
If I just say I'm
only interested

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:31.007
in operators that produce this
particular spin component--

00:55:31.007 --> 00:55:32.590
AUDIENCE: But if you
try to say that--

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:33.030
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:33.970
IAIN STEWART: No, no.

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:35.553
I haven't I haven't
made any expansion

00:55:35.553 --> 00:55:37.585
to make it collinear yet.

00:55:37.585 --> 00:55:41.553
AUDIENCE: But if there was a
hard scatter with two totally

00:55:41.553 --> 00:55:42.970
different directions
[INAUDIBLE],,

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.550
you could produce
phi n bars, right?

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:48.430
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, but that
would be another Lagrangian.

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:52.900
So this Lagrangian,
in the end, will only

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.850
be useful for
producing particles

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:56.620
in the n collinear direction.

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.780
That's what I'm
going to be after.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.400
And I'd have another
copy of this.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.683
For each linear direction,
I have one additional copy

00:56:03.683 --> 00:56:04.600
of what I'm doing now.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.392
AUDIENCE: Right, so
you've lost the ability

00:56:06.392 --> 00:56:08.355
to produce hard
scattering by doing this.

00:56:08.355 --> 00:56:09.730
IAIN STEWART: By
just doing this.

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:10.555
AUDIENCE: But as long
as you don't talk about

00:56:10.555 --> 00:56:10.970
that, it's still [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:12.040
IAIN STEWART: Right.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.740
That's right.

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:15.820
OK.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.490
So we're far from done.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:21.070
And really this is
just sort of a warm up.

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.890
Really what we've done here is
we've just written things out

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:25.152
in terms of components.

00:56:25.152 --> 00:56:26.860
And it's true that
these derivatives here

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.600
have different power counting.

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.848
And we're going to make
use of that in a second.

00:56:30.848 --> 00:56:32.890
And we've also just sort
of focused our attention

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:35.620
on this guy that
we could produce

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.870
at leading order from
a hard scattering

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:42.505
in some particular direction,
such as in our b to u example.

00:56:47.828 --> 00:56:50.120
So if we're interested in
just one collinear direction,

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.290
then there's two components
of the spinner that

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:53.540
are always the big components.

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.690
And we focused on a field
that gives those components

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:58.190
directly.

00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:59.630
So what do we have to do still?

00:57:10.083 --> 00:57:11.250
So there's three more steps.

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:18.270
So we have to
separate collinear.

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:20.610
So far, we just have one
type of covariant derivative.

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:22.950
We have to separate
out the fields that are

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:24.700
in that covariant derivative.

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:30.420
In particular, the ultra soft
and collinear gauge fields

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.455
have to be separated out.

00:57:33.455 --> 00:57:34.830
Another thing we
have to do is we

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:43.045
have to separate the collinear
and ultra soft momenta.

00:57:43.045 --> 00:57:44.670
There's two different
types of momenta,

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:47.520
as we saw in this simple
example of a gluon momenta

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.720
flowing into a propagator.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.030
And we actually have
to distinguish them.

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:54.870
And then we have to expand.

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:56.940
So until we do these
first two steps,

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.080
there's not really
anything to expand.

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.127
And so once we've
distinguished those,

00:58:02.127 --> 00:58:03.960
we'll be able to say
that certain things are

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.860
larger than others.

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.080
And then we'll be
able to figure out

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.880
what the leading or
Lagrangian actually is.

00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:17.610
OK, so let's start
with this second step.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.111
So this is step two.

00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:28.090
So remember what the
power counting was.

00:58:33.455 --> 00:58:36.280
The collinear gluons
had this scaling.

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:43.798
The ultra soft gluons
had this scaling,

00:58:43.798 --> 00:58:45.590
which is the same as
an ultra soft momenta.

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:54.790
And the right way of
doing this kind of thing

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:56.710
would be to take
Feynman diagrams

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:59.440
and do some matching
calculations,

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.270
but sometimes we're
able to get away

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:05.170
with just thinking about
doing things by writing down

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:07.110
field relations.

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.490
And that's almost true here.

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:12.062
When we were drawing our
Feynman diagrams before,

00:59:12.062 --> 00:59:14.270
if you think about one gluon,
this is certainly true.

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:17.380
So we drew Feynman
diagrams before.

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:25.960
We had this one, and we had
this one, ultra soft collinear.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.760
And we just consider
one at a time.

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.030
So we could just
think of adding them.

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:34.010
And that's kind of almost true.

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.060
It turns out that it's
true up to some terms

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:41.055
that we don't care about
for the moment, OK?

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.639
But these terms are
power suppressed.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:07.870
And we'll see where
they come from later on.

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.370
So the way you can
think about this,

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:12.100
if you ignore that
complication, is

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:16.060
that you really just divide the
gauge field into two pieces.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.370
There's one place that you've
perhaps seen that before,

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:20.657
when you talk about a
background gauge field, right?

01:00:20.657 --> 01:00:22.990
You say you have a quantum
field and a background field.

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:25.750
And that's very nice if you
go to background field gauge.

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.370
And that's kind of
physically what's

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.800
going on here because we
have two different modes that

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.660
have different wavelengths.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.250
These guys are really
long wavelength.

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:34.570
These guys are
shorter wavelength.

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:36.330
Remember that the p
squared of these guys

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:39.310
is much larger than the
p squared of these guys.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:45.760
And think about this
formula in that way,

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:55.530
that this is like a
classical background

01:00:55.530 --> 01:01:10.620
field to the Cn and the A n mu
since the p ultra soft squared

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:15.810
had a scaling which was lambda
to the fourth lambda squared

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:16.920
squared.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.430
And that's much smaller than
p collinear squared, which

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:23.920
was q squared lambda squared.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.180
So that's saying that this guy
has much larger wavelength,

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.800
a long wavelength mode to
these short distance modes.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.300
So we can think of this
as a slowly varying

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.410
classical background.

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:36.493
And that's one way of
thinking about this formula.

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:39.120
We'll exploit that a little
bit later on as well.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:47.840
So now that we have
the sum of them,

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.600
we can just think about how big
one is relative to the other.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.220
And actually, the coefficient
that's between them

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.887
doesn't really matter
too much for that.

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:05.870
So let's think about
the power counting

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:07.440
I already wrote on the board.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.895
So the power counting
is that n bar

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:14.610
dot A n is order lambda
to the 0 and so is

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:19.560
much greater than the
n bar dot A ultra soft,

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.780
which is order lambda squared.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.400
Same for A perp n,
that's of order lambda.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.395
That's much greater
than A perp ultra soft.

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:34.590
And so those two formulas
mean that it would never

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:36.510
have a comparison
between this and this.

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:38.070
I can always drop
the smaller one.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.640
And just like our
momentum, there's

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.470
one case where
that's not true where

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.820
we have to keep both of them.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.499
And that's for the
n dot A component.

01:02:57.490 --> 01:02:59.170
So here's something
we can drop, n bar

01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:04.951
dot A ultra soft and
A perp ultra soft.

01:03:04.951 --> 01:03:10.720
That leading order
can be dropped, OK?

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.730
So that's what we're
going to do and step two.

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.360
Step three corresponds
to dropping momentum

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.830
relative to another momentum.

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:35.150
So there was an expansion
of the propagator

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.480
in the case where we had
an ultra soft and collinear

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.290
at the same time.

01:03:55.918 --> 01:03:57.460
And let's just write
that down again,

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:58.918
but let's keep the
next order term.

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:10.390
And I'll ignore the
numerator since just looking

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:13.600
at the denominator will
give us enough information

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.835
for this discussion.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.440
We could do the numerator, too.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.335
It would just lead
to more terms.

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:31.410
So there are some terms
that I can expand.

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:34.230
And then I get the
propagator squared,

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:38.700
or I get a P squared squared,
because I expanded something

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.827
in the denominator back
into the numerator.

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:48.150
So the next order term
comes from a dot product

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:52.540
in the perp momenta because
the Pn perp is large.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.178
And so we get a term with
two k ultra soft dot Pn perp

01:04:56.178 --> 01:04:57.720
that corrects the
leading order term.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.470
And that's the first
sub-leading term.

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:04.680
So if you think about the
power counting of these,

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.440
this guy is lambda
to the minus 2.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.270
And this guy is
lambda to the minus 1.

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:18.440
OK, so there has to be something
in the effective theory that,

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.780
at higher order, will
reproduce this second guy.

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:43.370
There will be some power
suppressed Feynman rule in SCET

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:45.230
to reproduce this second term.

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.740
So what that means is
that you can't just

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:06.420
think that you ignore
this guy completely,

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.850
this k ultra soft perp.

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:12.390
You might just say, well, I just
set all the k ultra soft perps

01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:16.710
and the k ultra
soft minuses to 0.

01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:18.210
And that would be
something that you

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:22.380
can get away with, if your
careful, at lowest order.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.445
But at sub-leading
order, you can't.

01:06:24.445 --> 01:06:27.540
You need to think
that they exist, too.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:31.900
So whatever formalism we develop
should not set them to 0.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.380
And that was one of my
bullets that you should

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.158
think a little bit ahead.

01:06:37.158 --> 01:06:38.950
And this is me thinking
ahead, that I'm not

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:41.410
going to be able to just set
those momentum exactly to 0.

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:43.202
I'm going to need them
when I start talking

01:06:43.202 --> 01:06:44.695
about sub-leading terms.

01:06:49.890 --> 01:07:00.600
OK, so we expand just
like we don't throw away

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.850
the sub-leading gauge
fields because we need those

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.428
at sub-leading order as well.

01:07:04.428 --> 01:07:05.970
We neglect them in
the leading order,

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:09.182
but we have to sort of
think that they exist still.

01:07:09.182 --> 01:07:10.890
And with momenta, it's
a little different

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:13.230
since fields carry momenta.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:16.290
And so what you should think
is that the fields are allowed

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:18.540
to sort of carry these
momenta, but the Feynman rules

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.228
of the leading order theory
are just not sensitive to them.

01:07:21.228 --> 01:07:22.770
And that's the right
way of thinking.

01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:00.700
OK, so what we need
is an expansion

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.940
of the theory that will do this.

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.690
And that's called the
multipole expansion.

01:08:26.142 --> 01:08:27.600
So let me remind
you of some things

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.750
about multipole expansion.

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:33.180
Well, a multipole expansion
you see in electromagnetism,

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.590
remember?

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:37.410
You look at a charge
distribution far away.

01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:39.951
You see the total interval
over that charge distribution

01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:40.784
and then the dipole.

01:08:43.817 --> 01:08:45.359
That's the usual
thing that you think

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.484
of when you think of the
words multipole expansion.

01:08:47.484 --> 01:08:58.510
You think of E&M. And
it's similar here,

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:01.600
except we're doing
it for fields.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:08.010
So in position space, it's
similar to this where we expand

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.380
and we neglect some coordinates.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.109
So let me show you how a
multipole expansion works

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:14.744
in one dimension
in position space.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.630
So let's consider the following.

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:26.164
Consider an integral
dx psi bar of x A

01:09:26.164 --> 01:09:30.890
of 0 psi bar of psi of x.

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:33.500
So one of the fields I
stuck at 0 I expanded out

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.609
the coordinate around 0, whereas
the other ones I kept the x.

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:42.649
Let's see what this does
for the momentum space

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:43.910
by Fourier transforming it--

01:09:46.720 --> 01:10:04.187
so some momenta,
some phases, and then

01:10:04.187 --> 01:10:05.395
some momentum space vehicles.

01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:14.360
And I just put 0
because I put one

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.730
of the fields in the
coordinate space at 0.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:20.750
Do the x integral.

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:29.810
So I got a delta function
that says P1 is equal to P2

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:31.580
because I didn't have
anything in the k.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.440
And this is kind of along
the lines of what we want.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.490
It says that the momentum P1
is equal to the momentum P2.

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:50.270
And that's like expanding in k.

01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:55.020
So if we think about having
some Feynman diagram where

01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:04.050
we have P1 and P2
and some k coming in,

01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:07.100
if we want in some component
that P1 is equal to P2,

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.300
then this is achieving that.

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:22.620
OK, so this is the
analog of the kind

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.770
of expanding coordinates
that you do in E&M. Expanding

01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:28.060
into coordinates of a field
is doing the same thing.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.300
It's giving a
momentum conservation

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.370
that ignores the momentum
conjugate to that

01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:33.660
coordinate that I expand in.

01:11:42.367 --> 01:11:44.200
So what would the next
order term look like?

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:03.100
So we're still here
in one dimension.

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.900
If you think about
the expansion,

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:09.070
the next order term would
be a term like this,

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:12.570
then at x equals 0.

01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:13.070
Sorry.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:20.697
I don't really need dot
since this is one dimension.

01:12:23.318 --> 01:12:25.360
So that would be the next
term in a Taylor series

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.720
of the field about x equals 0.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:35.680
And if you do the same thing,
Fourier transform this guy,

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.570
you can work out that
you get the following.

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.910
OK, so the derivative
here on the coordinate,

01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:59.135
that comes with k, momentum.

01:12:59.135 --> 01:13:01.010
Because I should Fourier
transform the field,

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:04.430
then take the derivative,
then set the coordinate to 0,

01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:06.890
so I can still get a k.

01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:10.600
And this x actually just ends
up leading to a delta prime.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.080
You can write it
as a derivative.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.850
And x can be written as a
derivative in momentum space.

01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:17.630
And then it's a derivative
on the delta function.

01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:22.980
OK, so that's what the second
order term would look like.

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.400
So if you were to
think like this,

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.500
you have some kind
of Feynman rule

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.230
that's proportional
to a delta prime.

01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:33.710
And then however you
deal with a delta prime,

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.197
if you're Feynman rule had a
delta prime, what you would do

01:13:36.197 --> 01:13:37.530
is you would integrate by parts.

01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:38.990
And then the delta
prime would start taking

01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:40.190
derivatives of other things.

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:47.098
So that is a possible
route, but we're not

01:13:47.098 --> 01:13:48.140
going to take that route.

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.640
We're going to do
something simpler.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.180
So we could formulate the
multipole expansion in position

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.180
space like that,
but we're actually

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.400
going to formulate
it in momentum space.

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.090
So we're going to
do the same thing,

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:23.882
but we're going to do
it in momentum space.

01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.950
What are some
reasons to do that?

01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:30.660
Well, when you do
Feynman diagrams,

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.970
you do them in momentum space.

01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:35.650
So if we've already formulated
things in momentum space,

01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:37.930
then we'll immediately
get the Feynman rules

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:40.230
we want to do loop integrals
and stuff like that.

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:46.630
So that's an advantage of the
momentum space is that you more

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:48.310
directly get the
Feynman rules you want

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:49.930
and the diagrams in
the form you want.

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:58.340
It simplifies, actually,
slightly the formulation

01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:08.000
or somewhat the formulation
of gauge transformations,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.440
which we'll talk about later on.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:17.130
And what I think is a
nice kind of advantage

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:21.360
is where the momentum expansion
sits is in the propagator,

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.200
not in the vertices.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.210
We don't get Feynman
rules with delta primes,

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:36.080
but we then have to integrate
by parts to understand.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.330
We just immediately
get insertions

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:40.700
on propagators which would
correspond to the derivatives

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:42.560
that I would take
from integrating

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.320
that delta prime by parts.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:57.080
So this term that we saw before
that looked like a propagator

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.410
squared--

01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:01.775
which was when we were
sitting in momentum space

01:16:01.775 --> 01:16:03.770
and we expanded the
propagator to second order.

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:13.040
So we had this term that was
ultra soft perp dot Pn perp.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:16.120
And then it had this
denominator that was squared.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.850
If you ask where in
the effective theory

01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:21.540
is that, what is going to be the
thing that corresponds to that,

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:27.330
it's going to correspond to
some collinear propagator

01:16:27.330 --> 01:16:29.550
with an insertion on it.

01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:31.200
And the insertion
gives this numerator.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.710
And then I have two propagators.

01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:35.220
And that gives the
two denominators.

01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:42.690
OK, so that's how that term
is going to come about.

01:16:52.497 --> 01:16:54.330
So there will be some
sub-leading Lagrangian

01:16:54.330 --> 01:16:57.480
that I could call L1 that I
can insert on the propagator.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.750
And that would give rise to
these terms that we were saying

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.240
were higher order.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.550
OK, so we have to figure
out how to do this.

01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:11.050
And I will just give a little
bit of a picture for it today,

01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:12.800
and then we'll continue
with it next time.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.905
So I'm going to have
to back up a bit.

01:17:17.905 --> 01:17:20.155
So let's back up to the
Lagrangian that we had before.

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:27.520
And I want to just
introduce, since we were not

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.890
close to being done--

01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:33.520
we had sort of started down the
path, but we weren't done yet.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.180
Let me give a slightly
different name to this field.

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:40.810
Let me put a hat on it.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:50.710
So I want to do the
expansion in momentum space.

01:17:50.710 --> 01:17:53.540
So let me Fourier transform.

01:17:53.540 --> 01:18:02.110
So I'll call psi n twiddle of
P, do the full Fourier transform

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:10.090
of this guy, which was
previously just a field x.

01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:11.890
And we'll think about
doing expansions

01:18:11.890 --> 01:18:14.350
in this momentum space field.

01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:18.790
And for now, I'm also going to
make one other simplification.

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:21.910
And that is to only
consider the quark part.

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:23.920
And we'll put the
antiquarks back in later.

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:30.550
So if you like, we're
considering sort of the a's and

01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:33.550
not the b's in the
decomposition of the field.

01:18:36.025 --> 01:18:37.650
OK, so let's think
about this and think

01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:39.990
about how we can do an
expansion that would correspond

01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:42.810
to this multipole expansion.

01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:46.920
And the analogy that I'm
going to exploit here,

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.160
although it's not
perfect, is the expansion

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.690
that we did in HQET.

01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:59.678
So in HQET, we said we had a
full momentum for the b quark.

01:18:59.678 --> 01:19:02.220
And we split it into a piece,
which is kind of the big piece.

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:05.280
And then we had a piece
that was the small piece.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.400
And I'm going to do
something similar in SCET.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.000
I'm going to say I
have a full momentum--

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.140
I'm going to move
the indices up--

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.560
that I'm going to split into
two pieces because of the power

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:25.820
counting, a big piece
and a small piece.

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:31.900
The big piece here
will be the terms which

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.630
were of order 1 or lambda.

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:36.698
And then the rest
here will be something

01:19:36.698 --> 01:19:37.990
that's of order lambda squared.

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.825
And I allow that
residual piece not

01:19:46.825 --> 01:19:48.200
just to be in the
plus direction,

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.370
but to be in any direction.

01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:51.738
Because remember, at
sub-leading orders,

01:19:51.738 --> 01:19:54.280
I'm going to have to care about
the other components as well.

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:57.380
So let me just say
that the residual could

01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.290
have order lambda squared
pieces in any component.

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:01.790
In the minus and
the perp, I'm going

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:06.440
to expand with these residuals
being smaller than these terms

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.790
here.

01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:11.480
And this momentum I'm going
to call a label momentum.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:14.840
And this momentum I'm going
to call residual momentum.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:17.540
We'll see why that's a
good language next time,

01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:21.140
but it's kind of connected to
the idea that, in the HQET,

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.750
we labeled the fields
by this V. And we're

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:26.240
going to see that, for at
least some of the interactions,

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.190
it's a reasonable
way of thinking.

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:32.570
These large momentum is
just labels on the fields.

01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:35.040
OK, so we'll talk more
about that next time.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.850
I think I don't want
to go further with it.

01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:41.180
But basically, we're going to
make an expansion in residuals

01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.220
being smaller than these guys.

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:44.720
And in order to
make that expansion,

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.290
I have to have some notation
for the different pieces.

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:51.898
And we'll see where
that leads us next time.

01:20:51.898 --> 01:20:53.690
It'll effectively lead
us to the same thing

01:20:53.690 --> 01:20:56.330
as this multipole expansion
in position space,

01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:58.700
but it's a little
nicer, I claim.

01:20:58.700 --> 01:20:59.720
I like it a little more.

01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:04.560
Questions?

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:10.534
Good.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.490
Let's consider the motion
of a single particle

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.510
moving with a velocity v in a
ground reference frame, say.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.545
Recall that we defined the
momentum of this object as mv.

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:18.130
And we know that
Newton's second law

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.910
can be written in terms of
the change of momentum dp/dt.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.520
And when we integrated
Newton's second law,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.760
for impulse causes
the integral of ADP

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.380
from some time t prime
equals 0 to some time t.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.150
So we're integrating t prime.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.640
And here, we're
taking your momentum

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.530
from some initial momentum
to some momentum at time t.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.270
We have that the impulse
causes the momentum

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.670
of this single
particle to change.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.470
And in particular, this
is what we call impulse.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.170
And if the impulse is 0--

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.700
so as an example, if the
impulse fdt prime equals 0,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.660
that tells us that the
momentum of our particle

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.580
has not changed.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.530
Now, let's consider our same
thing for angular momentum.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.710
The only difference is that
we choose some point s.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.830
And we'll write the vector
rs to where the object is.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.860
And our angular momentum
we defined about the point

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.110
s was the vector from s.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.170
And we can indicate
maybe to the mass m.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.100
So it's a vector from s to where
the object is located cross

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.450
the momentum of the object.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.350
And this is how we define
the angular momentum.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.410
And recall that
our basic concept

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.220
is that the torque about
s causes the angular

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.509
momentum about s to change
for this single particle.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.530
Now, torque is if there's a
force acting on the particle.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.170
So for instance, if the force
were acting at some angle.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.620
Not only does the force change
cause the momentum to change,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.887
but we know that if
there's a torque about s,

00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:12.970
it will cause the angular
momentum of the particle

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.260
to change too.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.230
Now, let's talk about
the angular impulse,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.650
which is integrating
the torque from

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.390
say some time t prime
equals 0 to some time t.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.460
And that's the integral of
the angular momentum about s.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.950
And now we're integrating
this from some initial angular

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.530
momentum to some final
angular momentum.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:47.390
And just as before, we have
that the angular impulse

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.470
will result in a change
of angular momentum.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:02.950
And in particular, if
our angular impulse is 0,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.810
that implies that the angular
momentum of this particle

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.960
is constant.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.070
And so you can
see the analogies.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.820
The important fact to realize
is that in the reference frame,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.100
momentum does not
depend on any point,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.010
but our angular
momentum does depend

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.970
on the choice of the point s.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.480
And in particular, in terms of
the impulse, the torque about s

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.786
is also a quantity
that depends on s.

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:34.120
And so that's the
analogy between momentum

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.640
of a single particle and angular
momentum of a single particle.

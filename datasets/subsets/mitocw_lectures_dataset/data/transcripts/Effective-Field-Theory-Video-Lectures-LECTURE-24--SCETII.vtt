00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.360
IAIN STEWART: All right,
well, it's time to start.

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:29.325
So last time we were
talking about e plus

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:31.350
e minus to jets, and--

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:35.520
I should have written that--

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.920
in particular, e plus
e minus to dijets.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.740
And we were talking about--
we talked about factorization

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.352
and how to derive it.

00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:47.310
And I've schematically
written the result here.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.320
Last time we had a
more definite formula

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.600
with all the arguments
made explicit.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.630
So there were hard
functions, jet functions,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.110
and the soft function, and
we could either think about

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.450
measuring invariant
masses in two hemispheres

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.450
and constraining them to be
small to know we have dijets,

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.000
or measuring kind of the sum
of the two, which we called--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.750
which is effectively the thrust,
and then we get a slightly

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.200
simpler formula because we can
project these guys down onto

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.850
guys that'd only have--

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.610
or functions of one variable.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.255
But either way,
in either case, we

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:21.630
have a factorization
theorem that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.170
separates the degrees of
freedom and kind of the picture

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.010
is that we have these kind
of scales in the problem.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.900
So this is new jet,
new hard, and new soft,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.760
and we can use this
factorization theorem

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.975
to separate those scales
into these functions.

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:44.850
And then we can use--

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.975
I started talking about
using renormalization group

00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:49.845
equations in order to sum the
logs between these scales.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.800
And I wanted to finish
up that discussion.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.850
So for the Wilson
coefficient of the operator

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.803
or, for that matter,
for the hard function,

00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:04.720
which is the square of
the Wilson coefficient,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.510
you have a very simple
renormalization group equation.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.280
And that's because
momentum conservation

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.960
is enough to fix all
the variables that

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.250
label collinear fields.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.620
So you really just
have this overall Q,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.150
which is the center
of mass energy,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.300
and that's the only variable
that it's fixed by kinematics.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.178
There's no convolutions.

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:26.470
In the case of these things
called jet functions, which

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.420
we talked a little
bit about last time,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.300
you end up with something
like the Altarelli-Parisi

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.903
where there's an integral.

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:34.570
It's a little bit
different in the sense

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.030
that we actually know
its structure-- tolerance

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.200
and perturbation theory--
it has this structure.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.070
So it only has a very
particular dependence on S,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.080
has to scale like 1
over S, so one thing

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.010
that scales like 1 over
S is a delta function

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.740
or a plus function,
and basically, there's

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.190
only this single type of plus
function that can show up,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.343
and that's the analog
actually of something that

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.760
happened to this
guy where we said

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.870
there was only a possibility of
a single logarithm showing up.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.240
OK.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.240
So this is how far we got.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.715
Whenever you have something--
whenever you have equations

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:13.090
where you have convolutions
like this, what you should do

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.152
is Fourier transform
because if you Fourier

00:03:16.152 --> 00:03:17.860
transform something
that's a convolution,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.735
it becomes a product.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.440
So we'll Fourier
transform, and in order

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.450
to be careful about convergence
of our Fourier transform,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.600
we give it a small
imaginary part.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:46.470
And we define a position
space anomalous dimension,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.890
as the anomalous dimension
up there that depend on S,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.900
but now Fourier transformed
and likewise, we

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:02.120
define a position space
jet function the same way,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.920
and then this
formula here, which

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.400
is a convolution, if you
use these in the inverse

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.000
transforms, you arrive at a very
simple formula for the position

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.500
space.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:30.640
Gamma J.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.530
So the Fourier transform
of a delta function

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.910
is just the identity so
there's this term here,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.525
becomes that term there.

00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:39.790
The Fourier transform
of a plus function

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.750
is actually a logarithm, and
in order to get that result,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.410
you do need to have
this convergence.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.180
This little i0 in there.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.810
So in general, if
you have there's

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:02.950
a general kind of relation
between logs and plus

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.540
functions like that,
and in Fourier space,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.170
the kind of highest logarithm
you get is L to the K plus 1.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.705
OK, so these logs here,
you're basically--

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:23.080
if you think about
counting them,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.540
you should count this one
over S as an extra log,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.460
and in Fourier space,
that becomes explicit.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.440
You really just get a
log to the K plus 1.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.770
All right, but
this formula here,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.320
is something that,
again, is of this kind

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.630
of multiplicative form.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.510
So what happens to the anomalous
dimension in the Fourier space

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.050
is that it has a
multiplicative form.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:54.630
All right so we have
mu debugging mu of J Y

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:03.790
comma mu is simply gamma
J Y comma mu J Y comma mu.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.790
So it's no more difficult
than this formula up here.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.160
Just have to find the right
space, which is Fourier space.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.970
So then we can make an all
order solution of that formula.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.970
Given that we know
this, we can just

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.420
plug-in this and
integrate, and we've

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.710
done this a few times now.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.597
Let me just do it formally
by not doing the integrals,

00:06:31.597 --> 00:06:33.180
but writing them out
in a way that you

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.300
could do them to show you what
the all order solution would

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.800
look like.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.580
So you can write the
solution using this fact

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.970
and using this fact.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.670
So we have to use that fact
to convert this logarithm here

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.580
into something that is
just in terms of alphas.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.640
But using those two facts, we
can do the same kind of things

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.760
that we've done before and
write the all order solution

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.690
in the following way.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:22.440
The integrals are contained
in this W and this K.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.160
Here's the noncusp
piece, and then

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.840
the cusp piece comes
with two integrals

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.320
because it had a logarithm, and
we turned one of the logarithms

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.400
into an integral as well.

00:08:41.068 --> 00:08:42.860
So hopefully I've gotten
all my twos right.

00:08:53.322 --> 00:08:54.780
So we saw something
similar when we

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.325
were talking about the
running of the Wilson

00:08:57.325 --> 00:09:00.820
coefficient of the C, because
it also had this kind of form

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.850
with just a logarithm
and a constant term.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.072
And it's a similar thing here.

00:09:06.072 --> 00:09:08.530
So this is an all order solution
for the running of the jet

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.370
function.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.190
Of course, we don't know
these functions to all orders.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.760
We only know them up
to some given order,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.695
and so you plug those--
whatever order you

00:09:17.695 --> 00:09:19.570
want to work-- you plug
it into this formula,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.987
and then you can
do this integral,

00:09:20.987 --> 00:09:22.930
and then you figure
out these factors here.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.420
And those factors
are summing the logs.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.665
In the case of the jet
function, what you would--

00:09:29.665 --> 00:09:31.540
the way that you can
think about this picture

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.500
is that you want to--

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.800
you have to put the guys in
the factorization theorem

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.780
at a common scale, and so
one way of thinking about it

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.760
is as follows.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.105
Let's take our hard function
and do perturbation theory at mu

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:49.540
equals mu age, and then
we'll sum logs down

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.890
to say the soft scale.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.680
That's one way of doing it, and
we'll do perturbation theory

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.130
for the jet function, at
a scale mu equals mu J,

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.850
and then we'll use this
renormalization group here,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:09.170
which will just say gamma
J to run this guy down

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.370
to the soft scale.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.260
In that kind of
scenario, you wouldn't

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.380
have to run the soft function.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.210
This is like a top
down kind of picture

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.880
where you're just running the
objects at the higher scales

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.200
down to the lowest scale.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.860
That's one way of doing it.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.770
You could also do it
in an equivalent way

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.990
where you run the soft
function, for example,

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.660
up to the jet scale, and you
don't run the jet function.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:35.280
And that'll give you
actually the same result.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.410
But in the way--

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.120
with the information
I've presented you,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.470
this is the way
that you would think

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.120
about doing the
renormalization group,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.913
and that would sum up
logarithms in the cross section.

00:10:45.913 --> 00:10:48.080
And it's very easy if you
write it in position space

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.163
to see what type of
logarithms you're summing out.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.140
So in position
space, if we go back

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.320
to a formula like
the one at the top,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.930
basically, what happens
is that in position space,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.640
you, again, have a product.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.610
So these convolutions here,
which were also this form,

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.400
if you Fourier transform, then
you end up with a product.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.050
D sigma D, so
schematically, D sigma

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:22.230
Dy for, say, where y is the
Fourier transform for thrust,

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:27.540
would just be h times
j in position space

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.960
times the soft function
in position space as well.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:38.370
And there's Q somewhere, but it
would be a very simple formula

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.210
which just has a product.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.680
And so you can figure out
what logs you're summing.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.582
The logs that you're
summing, again,

00:11:45.582 --> 00:11:47.040
just as we talked
about before, are

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.570
simplest to describe in when
you take the log because you're

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.480
really summing logs
in an exponent.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.000
So if we talk about
the log of D sigma Dy,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.900
then we can enumerate
the types of logs

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.145
that one sums as follows.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.550
So these are the leading logs.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.206
This is next leading
log, and this

00:12:22.206 --> 00:12:26.270
is next to next leading
log, just like before.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.400
When we were talking about
enumerating the logs,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.910
we talked about
before an example,

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.780
we were enumerating logs in
the Wilson coefficient C.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.090
Now we're doing it for
a full cross section,

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:39.040
but because in position space,
the cross section is simply

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.873
a product of objects, you
can think about just--

00:12:43.873 --> 00:12:46.040
if you take the logarithm,
they kind of split apart.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.680
And it's very
simple to enumerate

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.600
what corresponds to
the things that you

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.760
would get by putting
in anomalous dimensions

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.180
at a given order.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.960
So if you use the leading
log anomalous dimension, just

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.270
the one loop cusp, then
you get these terms.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.050
Get the higher terms from
the running of the coupling.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.090
If you put in the next
leading log terms, then

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.720
you get those terms.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.080
OK.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.940
And so you supplement
that resummation which

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.640
comes from this
K and this omega,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.680
in general, you
supplement that with sort

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.010
of fixed order calculations
of the H and the J and the S.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.910
And that gives you a complete
cross-section at some order

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.990
and resum perturbation theory.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.708
So you could do that
also in momentum space.

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:34.750
You could write out the
formula in momentum space

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:40.090
just because after all that's
what you want in the end.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.970
Position space is
just really a nice way

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.220
of deriving the results
that then you eventually put

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:55.290
back into momentum space
in some way or another

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.970
because that's
where the data is.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.520
And let me just show you what
the formula would look like,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:17.170
just so you get a kind of
picture with all the arguments.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.590
So if I were to Fourier
transform the resum formula,

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.430
over here I didn't write
the resummation in.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.340
I didn't write in
the evolution factors

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.340
that correspond to this.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.470
So let me do that, but let
me do it in momentum space.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:39.630
So I guess I made a slightly
different choice here.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.890
So I'm doing it for
the thrust case.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.770
These convolutions just being
integrals over the variables

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:09.000
that are like this S
prime, for example.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.330
So this is S prime integral.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.330
And this is an L prime integral.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.650
OK so there's three
integrals in this formula.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.730
I guess this is-- it's
kind of a funny notation,

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.690
but I could have
written integral instead

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.152
of writing these tensor signs.

00:15:48.152 --> 00:15:49.860
That would have been
probably more clear.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.770
Do that.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:05.730
OK so there's the formula
in momentum space.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.060
And it's doing what I said.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:14.310
This factor here is
running the hard function

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:21.840
down to the soft scale,
and this other factor here

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.710
is running from the jet
scale to the soft scale,

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.830
and I didn't have to
run the soft function.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.590
I should have written
in here that I evaluate

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.620
this guy at the soft scale.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.610
And this guy here remember is
the non-perturbative guy which

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.410
we also talked about
a little last time.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:45.373
OK so that's kind of the basic
structure these use as usual

00:16:45.373 --> 00:16:47.040
are summing the
logarithms, and then you

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:55.110
put fixed order results in
for this guy, for that guy,

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.090
and for this guy here.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:07.579
And in doing so you get
the [INAUDIBLE] result.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.843
All right, so this
fact that I could

00:17:10.843 --> 00:17:12.260
have done the
running differently,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.359
that I could have
run the soft function

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.640
is a kind of consistency.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:23.470
So there are other
ways of doing the r g,

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.753
and they all lead
to the same answer.

00:17:26.753 --> 00:17:28.420
And when I say the
same answer, I really

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:33.150
mean the same precisely
exactly the same number.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.280
So I really mean
the same, not just

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.330
sort of approximately the
same but exactly the same.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.250
And the other ways
of doing the RGE

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:46.570
are the basic idea of why there
are more than one way is again

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.100
this fact that if I do
coefficient renormalization,

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.790
that that's the inverse of
doing operator renormalization.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.520
So there's two ways of
thinking about doing the run.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.209
You run the operators,
you run the coefficients.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.480
OK in this picture it's a
little bit more complicated

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.820
because we have three
scales, but when

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.770
I'm running the hard
function, I quivalently

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.990
could have run both the
jet and the soft function

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.550
and not run the hard function.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.370
So let me maybe
give one other way

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.170
of doing this just to show you.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.730
So I could have run the
hard function say, just

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.605
down to the jet scale.

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.480
And then instead of
running the jet function,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.690
I could have run the soft
function up to the jet scale.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.330
That would be another
way of doing the RGE,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.010
and that would lead to
an equivalent picture.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.600
And there's more than
two, because there's

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.708
three scales in this.

00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:43.250
There's more than
two natural things.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.172
There's three possible
natural things,

00:18:45.172 --> 00:18:47.380
where you would run to either
this scale, this scale,

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.410
or this scale, but
at the base of it,

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.480
it all has to do
with this equivalence

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.340
that we talked about in
simpler scenarios earlier.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.412
And you can write this
also as a relation

00:19:01.412 --> 00:19:02.620
between anomalous dimensions.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.022
So it implies a
non-trivial things

00:19:05.022 --> 00:19:07.480
about the formula that have to
be trivial in order for this

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.740
to work.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:16.120
So for example, it implies
that the coefficients

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.300
of the cusp anomalous dimension
in the various renormalization

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.660
groups would be in a certain
way that they would be related,

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.090
and even in the non-cusp
anomalous dimensions, which

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.460
is this formula,
there's a relation

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.810
between the jet, hard, and
soft anomalous dimensions.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:32.310
OK?

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.162
And that's needed-- this is
an expression of this fact

00:19:36.162 --> 00:19:37.870
that you can do the
renormalization group

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.690
by running different objects.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.610
So you can derive
this formula by just

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.670
saying mu D divided by
the cross section is 0.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.060
And going through it,
if you were to allow,

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.180
then you would find
formulas like this one.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.470
OK?

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:55.430
So questions?

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.975
I went quick, because
most of the concepts

00:20:01.975 --> 00:20:04.350
here are things that we've
seen before in simpler guises.

00:20:08.347 --> 00:20:09.930
The new complication
is really that we

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.080
have this dependence on
a variable which ended up

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.750
being y, but by going
to Fourier space,

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.550
it looked just like
a simple product

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.980
again, and y behaved like a
simple kinematic variable.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.230
The end of the day, we want
to Fourier transform back,

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.025
but we have a space where
things look familiar.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.470
OK.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.170
So that's e plus
minus the dijets,

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.510
and that's the
last SCETI example

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.920
I'm going to do for a while.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.140
I'm now going to
turn to doing SCETII,

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.120
and we'll spend some time
talking about SCETII.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.750
So in SCETII, instead of
having ultrasoft interactions

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.390
with collinear particles,
we have soft interactions

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.340
with collinear particles.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.380
So we have to call how
that's going to work.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:16.680
So if we take a soft particle,
consider a soft particle

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.740
interacting with some collinear
particle, and ask what

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.420
do we get out?

00:21:25.933 --> 00:21:27.850
So if we just ask about
momentum conservation,

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.450
and we call this q,
then q is equal to q

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:35.118
soft plus q collinear.

00:21:35.118 --> 00:21:36.910
And since we know the
scaling of these two,

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.250
we know the scaling of q.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.790
It's just given by whatever
the larger of the scalings is.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.760
So soft and collinear
both have the same-- so

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.135
let me remind you
of the scaling.

00:21:52.135 --> 00:21:57.340
So this guy was q, lambda,
lambda, lambda, and this guy

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.550
was q lambda squared 1 lambda.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.610
So the difference between
ultrasoft and collinear

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.860
and soft and collinear is
that soft and collinear have

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.990
the same size of perp momenta.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.170
So the perp momenta are
just of order lambda.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.480
Obviously, in the
minus momenta, the 1

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.210
wins, so the minus
momentum of order 1.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.547
And then the plus
momentum, it's the soft

00:22:18.547 --> 00:22:20.630
that wins, because it's
bigger than the collinear.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.470
So this is order lambda.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.450
OK.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.360
And that's actually
much different than what

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.525
we found when we added
ultrasoft and collinear.

00:22:31.525 --> 00:22:33.400
Because when we added
ultrasoft and collinear

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.380
we got back collinear.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.320
Here, we're not
getting back collinear.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.420
This is actually off-shell,
from the perspective

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.530
of our low-energy modes.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.320
Because q squared, the
biggest part of q squared

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.820
would be 1 times lambda.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.030
q squared's of order
lambda which is much bigger

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:52.960
than lambda squared.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.180
So adding a soft and a collinear
particle in SCETII immediately

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.850
gives you something off-shell.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.350
That's going to make some things
easier and some things more

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.695
complicated.

00:23:08.695 --> 00:23:10.070
Mostly, it's going
to make things

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.153
a little more complicated.

00:23:21.497 --> 00:23:23.330
At least at the start,
it'll looking easier.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:40.020
So you could think about
this from our mode picture,

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.870
where we had softs
that live here

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.120
and collinears that live there.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.982
In order for them to interact,
they have to go up to a place

00:23:48.982 --> 00:23:50.940
where we can have a common
momentum, and that's

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.210
a higher hyperbola, like this.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:58.390
It's not all the way up to the
hard scale which is up here.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.070
That was hard, but there's
an intermediate scale

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:07.050
that comes in which is the
scale of this q squared.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.882
So this is q squared.

00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:12.300
This is the order of
the q squared there,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.410
and sometimes this is called
a hard collinear scale.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.930
This would be called a
hard collinear mode, hc.

00:24:30.398 --> 00:24:31.940
And you could even
write down, if you

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.482
wanted, an on-shell degree of
freedom for this hard collinear

00:24:34.482 --> 00:24:37.280
mode.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.870
So an on-shell
version of it, you

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.590
could think of it as
a mode, in theory.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.570
An on-shell version of
it would have a scaling

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.135
that's q 1 lambda root lambda.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.620
So you can think of one way
of approaching it which we'll

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.042
take this attitude in a minute.

00:24:57.042 --> 00:24:58.500
One way of approaching
this problem

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.780
would be to first
think about doing

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.240
some matching onto a theory
with this hard collinear mode

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.180
and then trying to match down
onto a theory that just has

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.400
the collinear and the
soft mode, and we'll

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.760
exploit that a little later.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.200
But first, let me
do a different thing

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.050
and just ignore this
dashed line and just think

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.130
about matching
directly from the QCD

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.060
onto the SCETII which just has
these two degrees of freedom.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.860
So what's going to
happen is that we're

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.440
going to have to
integrate out more things,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.407
because any type of
interactions that we write down

00:25:54.407 --> 00:25:56.240
are basically giving
us something off-shell.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.310
So let's do an example of this.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:04.880
So we'll do an example of
a heavy-to-light current,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:10.620
but now, it won't be an SCETII
current but rather an SCETI.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.570
So I just want to have one
soft particle and one collinear

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.130
particle.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.730
Simplest possible example,
but now this is soft,

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.081
and this is collinear, not
ultrasoft and collinear.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.450
All right.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.520
So we have some current.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.630
I'm just going to label
the lines with c's and s's.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:45.180
So imagine that you
attached a soft gluon here.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.880
That would give you
something that's off-shelf.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.420
So this line here is
off-shelf, and likewise,

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.950
on this side, if
this is soft coming

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:57.150
in but you attach
something collinear here,

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.030
then this is off-shelf.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.890
Before, when we
had this picture,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.440
and we were doing
it for SCETI, one

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.510
set of attachments which
still need to on-shell,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.535
in particular on this side.

00:27:08.535 --> 00:27:10.410
And on this side, we
got something off-shell.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.170
We integrated it out,
and we got a Wilson line.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.190
Right?

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:15.750
Here, it's a little
more complicated,

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.645
because you touch alternate
modes on either side.

00:27:18.645 --> 00:27:20.520
And you get something
off-shell, and you just

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.135
have to put out this
pink line all at once,

00:27:25.135 --> 00:27:27.510
and that's going to give you
another type of Wilson line.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.360
In this calculation,
we're going to get

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:38.430
W. It's both of the
collinear modes,

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:43.650
and another type of Wilson
line from the soft modes.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.640
Let's call it Sn.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.860
So how do you build
up a Wilson line?

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.890
Well, first of all, think
about attaching more gluons

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.910
onto this line.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:05.560
Right?

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.050
That's kind of the analog
of what we did before.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:14.980
So just attach more
soft gluons here,

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.137
more collinear gluons here.

00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:19.970
This might be the first
thing you would try,

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.270
just adding those
guys up, and that

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.217
means you have a whole line
of things that is off-shell,

00:28:25.217 --> 00:28:26.800
and you just calculate
these diagrams.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:35.518
And if you do that calculation,
it will give you Wilson, lines.

00:28:35.518 --> 00:28:37.060
And what it'll give
is something that

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:51.050
looks like this, where Sn dagger
is a function of the n dot

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:55.150
As component, and
W as a function of

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.920
said n bar dot Ac component.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.800
So there are Wilson lines
along some direction,

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.320
and it looks like this.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.240
This is c.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.180
This is S.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.510
Now, there's something
wrong with this.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.532
It's not quite the right answer.

00:29:16.532 --> 00:29:18.740
The reason that the Wilson
lines are the way they are

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.250
is because I got the collinear
ones from integrating them out

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.100
from the next to the heavy quark
which is the soft particle.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.560
So that's why W sits next to h.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.050
S dagger sits next to c
because of the same thing

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.820
on the collinear side.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.460
But if I wanted to make them
into a gauge invariant thing,

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.280
I want the W to sit next
to the c and the S dagger

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.320
to sit next to the h.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.260
That would be the analog
of what we had in SCETI,

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.940
and that's not what we got.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.910
If this was QED, then that would
be fine, because this and this,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:49.385
I could just commute them.

00:29:49.385 --> 00:29:50.510
Well, I can always do that.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.260
I can just push this
guy through that guy.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.130
But in QCD I can't, because
these guys have color matrices,

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.340
and they don't commute
with each other.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.920
So that means that this isn't
quite the whole story here.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.480
There's some diagrams
that we missed.

00:30:07.612 --> 00:30:09.070
So there must be
some diagrams that

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:24.185
are non-abelian that we missed,
and what are those diagrams?

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.095
These are diagrams that involve
triple gluon and four gluon

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:31.595
vertices.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.530
And what these guys
do, it turns out,

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.730
is they do one thing
in this calculation.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:58.380
They really just flip the
order of the W and the S.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.220
So why do we have to
consider those diagrams?

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:11.270
So think about, instead of
attaching gluons to quarks,

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.190
attach gluons to gluons.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:22.090
So say we have soft
collinear, and we attach them

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.410
to each other but through
a three-gluon vortex.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.848
Then, this guy's off-shell.

00:31:25.848 --> 00:31:27.640
If that off-shell guy
attaches to this guy,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.230
then it's off-shell.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.210
And if you integrate
out diagrams like this,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:36.010
that's going to change what our
result over there look like.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:39.190
If you go to the same
order on the other side,

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:40.450
exactly analogous thing.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:47.310
OK.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.643
So these are also things that
you have to integrate out.

00:31:49.643 --> 00:31:53.020
You have to integrate all
these pink things out.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.645
And if you do that, then
it does what I said.

00:31:57.645 --> 00:32:01.650
If you do that to
all orders, what

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:09.360
you can do with a axillary
Lagrangian-type approach,

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.735
obviously, you're not going
to start calculating diagrams

00:32:11.735 --> 00:32:15.050
to all this, but there are
some tricks to doing it.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.560
Then, you get them
in the right order.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.190
And it's easy to
check, for example,

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.920
that at the order of two
gluons that this guy does

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.630
exactly what you want.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:35.530
So this is then a collinear
gauge invariant object,

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.000
and this is then something
that's soft gauge invariant,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.620
and that's nice.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.790
That's what you're hoping.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.360
That's what you're expecting.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.255
AUDIENCE: What about
diagrams like collinear soft

00:32:49.255 --> 00:32:52.600
all from the collinear
line or something?

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.930
IAIN STEWART: You want to
add one more gluon where?

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.680
AUDIENCE: I want to
stick like a collinear

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.588
right in between some softs.

00:32:58.588 --> 00:32:59.380
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:04.865
You mean like on
here, like that?

00:33:04.865 --> 00:33:05.740
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.950
Essentially, it'd be over
on that diagram over there,

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.618
like not even [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:10.618 --> 00:33:11.410
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:12.618
It's the same thing, I think.

00:33:12.618 --> 00:33:15.700
So if you add this
guy here, then I

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.740
think it's power suppressed.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:22.330
Because it ends up being
a power suppressed term

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.220
that you don't need, if
I remember correctly.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:25.720
Yeah.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.860
This guy's power suppressed.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.410
AUDIENCE: You have to define
like a different lambda

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.350
for each one?

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:30.522
It seems like it would be--

00:33:30.522 --> 00:33:31.230
IAIN STEWART: No.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.840
You can think of this as
a full theory diagram.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.340
Right?

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.400
Where this guy is
off-shell, and you haven't

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.800
changed how he's off-shell.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.550
You just change the
value of the momentum,

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.400
but one thing you've
done is you've doubled

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.870
the number of hard propagators.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:49.580
So if I remember
correctly, this guy just

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:50.830
gives you something off-shell.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.650
I'm pretty confident,
something that's power

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:54.700
suppressed in lambda.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.900
All right.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.160
So this is how soft collinear
factorization works.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.410
So soft collinear factorization,
if you think about it

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:11.130
from the point of view of
going from QCD to SCETII,

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.159
it's just integrate out
these pink lines, as usual,

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.020
and you end up with
something that's where

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.393
things are splitting apart.

00:34:17.393 --> 00:34:18.810
And the reason
that it's happening

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.239
is because these
lines are off-shell

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.800
that are where you would try
to interact, have interactions,

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.420
and so your theory is
forced apart by the fact

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.179
that these things can't
interact in an on-shell way.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:35.350
So it's different than
SCETI that in that sense.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.500
So this is kind of
cumbersome, as you can see,

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.590
if you wanted to think
about doing it arbitrarily.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:43.050
Because it seems like you just
have to calculate diagrams,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.139
and who wants to calculate
infinite classes of diagrams

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:47.969
for arbitrarily
complicated scenarios?

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.199
Right?

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.670
Maybe in this
case, we can do it,

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.440
but actually even
in this case, we

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.270
have to resort to some tricks
to do it to all orders.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.090
And in more
complicated scenarios,

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:59.290
it would just get even
more and more cumbersome.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.670
So we'd like to have a
trick that's generic,

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.630
where we could get
the same answer.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:08.760
And the way that we can do that
is by using this dashed line up

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.390
in the picture.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.920
Think about formulating rather
than directly this SCETII,

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.500
formulate first an
SCETI, and then we'll

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.885
match that SCETI onto QCD.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:36.120
So another, in some ways, better
method is to do QCD to SCETI

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:45.380
and then SCETI to
SCETII, so three steps.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:54.110
So we're going to
first use a SCETI that

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.790
doesn't have the
collinear, just has

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.280
the soft mode and the
hard collinear mode.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:03.510
So it has what I call the
hc in the picture and s.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.010
OK?

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.140
So that would be
a mode that has P

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:11.400
squared in this picture of
order, say let's call it lambda

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:11.900
squared.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:20.653
So if I say that this is
for some lambda squared,

00:36:20.653 --> 00:36:22.070
then you'd have
the soft mode that

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.360
has P squared of
order lambda squared,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.985
and this hard collinear
mode that has P

00:36:24.985 --> 00:36:26.150
squared of order q lambda.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.530
And that's exactly an
SCETI-type situation, where

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:35.040
we were calling these c and us.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.220
So that's step one.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.310
Step two is to factorize
that theory, which

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.495
we know how to do.

00:36:43.495 --> 00:36:48.830
In particular, the
ultrasoft which is soft

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.597
can be factorized with
a field redefinition.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.770
So this has the advantage
that at this first stage

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.620
we still have a locality
that protects us

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.140
and helps us to
understand the theory.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.650
We then factorize, and
then in the third step,

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.490
we match SCETI onto SCETII.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:26.560
And then, we're getting rid
of these hard collinear modes,

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.650
matching them onto
some collinear modes,

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.340
and then we still
have our soft modes.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.870
So we think that
the hard collinear

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.610
modes contain the collinear
modes in the first stage.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.270
But they also contain
some other stuff

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.540
which is unwanted baggage
that we have to get rid of,

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.835
and that's why we have this
second stage of matching.

00:37:54.835 --> 00:37:56.710
But you can really think
of it in the picture

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.260
as doing first the matching,
where you integrate out

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.610
the hard scale, but you contain
in your effective theory

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.340
this scale associated
to the dashed line.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.462
And then in a second stage, you
integrate out the dashed line,

00:38:10.462 --> 00:38:13.180
and that gets you
to the final thing

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.670
you want which is just low
energy modes on this line here.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.890
OK.

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:33.030
So one thing this does is
give a simple procedure

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:36.420
of constructing
SCETII operators,

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.630
even though there's more
non-locality in SCETII

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.710
than there was in SCETI.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.870
Because there's non-locality,
because you don't just

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.060
have this one scale
that could cause you,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.150
even have this smaller scale
that's causing non-locality.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:59.360
And that's explicit in
the soft Wilson line.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.630
The thing that's giving
the soft Wilson line--

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.940
well, the things that are
producing the Wilson lines

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.370
are really modes of this scale.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:12.188
OK so it's more non-local.

00:39:12.188 --> 00:39:13.730
One way of saying
it's more non-local

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.880
is simply that there'll
be 1 over l pluses,

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.360
as well as 1 over l minuses.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:22.200
That's another way of saying
why it's more non-local.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.580
OK so that's just an
example of something

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.710
that makes it look trivial.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:32.970
So let's say we wanted to do
this calculation, this way.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:36.450
So then in step one, we
would simply write down

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:37.860
the current in SCETI.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:44.070
We would integrate out
the off-shell pink lines,

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.750
but there'd only be
lines on one side,

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.460
and we get this which
is our SCETI result

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.200
for heavy-to-light current.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:58.920
Then, in step two, we would do
the field redefinition in order

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:07.890
to factorize this theory,
and we get that result.

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.540
And in step three, in
order to match this result

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:17.570
onto a current in SCETII, it's
really simply a renaming here.

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:32.876
So why is this step so easy?

00:40:32.876 --> 00:40:35.700
It looks completely trivial.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.370
The reason that
this step is so easy

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.198
is that any T-product, any
time-order product that you

00:40:40.198 --> 00:40:41.990
write down here, will
have a correspondence

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.860
in this other case.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:53.900
OK?

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.692
So you can really--

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:03.470
it really is that simple.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.080
So when so if it's
really that simple, then

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.260
you can see the advantages
of this procedure.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:16.460
It's not always
that simple, and let

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.900
me present as a kind of
theorem or just a bit

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.290
of a statement when
it will be this simple

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:27.812
and when it will
not be this simple.

00:41:27.812 --> 00:41:29.270
So basically, you
have to know when

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.930
will the T-products between
these two theories match up?

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.930
And the T-products will
match up under the following

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:42.650
circumstances, or they won't
match up under the following

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:43.953
circumstances.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.040
So if in the SCETI
one theory you

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.580
had time-order products with
greater than or equal to two

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:17.180
operators that had soft
and collinear fields,

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.910
then you can generate
some non-trivial matching.

00:42:51.373 --> 00:42:52.790
So I think that's
best illustrated

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.140
by an example again.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.260
So in this particular
example, up here, we only

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.720
had one operator that had both
soft and collinear fields,

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.500
this external current.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.400
And then we had Lagrangians,
but they were totally decoupled

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.590
after we made this field
redefinition, the L0

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:07.160
Lagrangian.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.467
So they don't count as
something that's mixing

00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:10.550
soft and collinear fields.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.350
We just had this operator.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.940
But if you had two
of these operators,

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.210
and you wanted to go
through the same procedure,

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.010
then you could get
something non-trivial.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.302
So let's imagine that scenario.

00:43:24.356 --> 00:43:30.950
We have two operators,
so let's think

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:36.890
of having in the
SCETI, two interactions

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:41.785
that are like this, then we
could string them together

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:42.285
as follows.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.690
So this is a T-product between
two different interactions that

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:00.950
both had soft and collinear.

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.960
I'm just taking two of these
guys and putting them together.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.680
And if you look at the
off-shell-ness of this line

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.880
here, then P squared is
of order, in our counting,

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:17.830
it's like a k plus times a
q minus which is of q times

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.916
a lambda times a q.

00:44:19.916 --> 00:44:22.430
So it's really something that
lives at that hard collinear

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.230
scale.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.770
OK?

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:30.298
But you need two terms in
the time-order product that,

00:44:30.298 --> 00:44:32.590
in order for there really to
be a propagator like this,

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.280
that you're integrating out.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.390
So this guy here will
match onto something

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.960
when you do this
matching, where you

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.390
have two soft fields and two
collinear fields, like that.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:48.220
Because this guy here
really is something

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:53.560
that you would want to integrate
out at that dashed line.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.230
Really, it's an off-shell,
hard, collinear mode.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.850
But if you didn't
have two T-products,

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:03.170
then effectively
what happens is,

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.170
when you change the
external kinematics in order

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:08.770
to do the matching, all what
were called hard collinear

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:11.200
lines become collinear
lines, and then

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.755
the matching is trivial,
as it was up here.

00:45:13.755 --> 00:45:15.380
But if you're in a
situation like this,

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.440
then there is a line
that, by changing

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.390
the scaling of
these external guys,

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.390
it doesn't change the scaling
of that internal line,

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:25.244
and then you get some
non-trivial Wilson coefficient.

00:45:29.116 --> 00:45:32.504
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:39.810
IAIN STEWART: So
let's call these hc.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:47.010
Yeah, and so I start
by calling them hc.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.300
Right?

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.440
And then, what I want to do,
when I calculate this diagram

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.520
to do the matching, is I want to
assign them a different scale.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.650
I want to define them
to be c instead of hc.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.830
So I start out
thinking of them as hc.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:05.070
That's what I do in step one.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.390
I can do a field redefinition.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.110
It doesn't matter.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.890
But now, I want to match
from SCETI onto II.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:14.070
So therefore, what I do is
I take my full theory, which

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.430
is SCETI, and I
evaluate it with fields

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.010
that don't have the right
power counting for that theory.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:23.460
And then I do a Taylor-series
expansion of all the diagrams,

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.960
so that's this.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.720
I change my external fields,
and I call them c instead of hc.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.762
AUDIENCE: Oh, because
you're doing the same thing

00:46:29.762 --> 00:46:30.445
with ultrasoft.

00:46:30.445 --> 00:46:30.900
So ultrasoft, it really means--

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.567
IAIN STEWART: And now
I make these soft,

00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:36.540
but soft and ultrasoft,
that's just really a renaming.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.480
AUDIENCE: Ultrasoft in
the SCETI [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.730
IAIN STEWART: Ultrasoft
is equal soft.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:42.810
Sorry.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.340
Maybe this makes it clearer.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.650
Ultrasoft and soft just
two different names

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:48.150
for the same thing.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:51.210
But hc and c aren't,
because hc really

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:53.820
lived on the upper hyperbola.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.940
I put the external particles
onto the lower hyperbola,

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.210
but I'm frozen in here
with one particle that

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.960
stays in the upper
hyperbola and therefore

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.002
has to be integrated out.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.950
OK.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:21.150
So the kind of thing that
you would get by doing that

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:27.330
is that you would
get convolutions

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:29.342
with some Wilson coefficient.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.050
In this case, they were--

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:43.770
well, let me just say, it
depends on some P minuses.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:52.760
This is P1, this is P2, and
then in my example over there,

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.180
I guess I had some heavy quarks.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.301
OK, and there's some
Dirac structures.

00:48:09.782 --> 00:48:11.240
So it would be
something like this,

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.410
where you'd get some
function, whatever it is,

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.120
that's coming exactly
from integrating

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.090
all the purple stuff.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.630
So this is the
Wilson coefficient,

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.640
and usually, you would
call these things

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.380
jet functions, because they
look like jet functions.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:48.980
So this comes from the SCETI
modes that got integrated out.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.168
So the difference between this
and the SCETI matching, where

00:48:53.168 --> 00:48:54.710
you're integrating
out the hard scale

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:56.460
is you're already
getting sensitivity here

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.700
to the plus momentum
of the soft.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.261
That's one difference.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.088
OK.

00:49:05.088 --> 00:49:07.380
So this is a general procedure
for constructing SCETII.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:14.450
Let's see how much
I want to say.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:18.260
So let's say a few words
about power counting.

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:23.690
So if you take some
T-product of terms in SCETI,

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:28.160
that will scale like some
power of lambda to the 2K OK?

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:32.690
So in SCETI, you have to be a
little bit careful about power

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:34.620
counting when you
do this procedure.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.640
So in SCETI, you could
just assign some power.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.340
Let's call it lambda to the 2K.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.200
And when you do a matching onto
an operator in SCETII, what

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.940
you're generically
going to find is

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:51.920
that there'll be a relation
between the power counting here

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.830
and the power counting
there which is good,

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:58.790
but there's also one
thing to be aware of.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.340
So if I define eta to
be the power counting

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:05.570
parameter for SCETII--

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:06.980
just to give it
a different name,

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.170
so I can talk about
a correspondence--

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:12.350
then basically, eta is
like lambda squared.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:20.350
And that, well, that just
follows from this formula,

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.170
that if you want to
identify lambda squared

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:25.360
is lambda over q for
the collinear modes,

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.330
then this would be the
right way of doing it.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:30.880
Little lambda would be
square root of lambda over q.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.490
But in SCETI for
the collinear modes,

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:34.240
you'd say there's some
parameter eta which

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.590
is just lambda over q.

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:37.090
OK?

00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:39.600
So basically, it looks like
you just take 2K and go over

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.100
to k, because you just changed
the definition of what you're

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:45.940
calling the parameter, but
there's also this plus E.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.000
That means that you can
get additional suppression,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.065
and that plus E comes
about from the fact

00:50:51.065 --> 00:50:52.690
that you also change
the power counting

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:56.302
for your external fields,
when you do this procedure.

00:50:56.302 --> 00:50:58.510
So something that was scaling
like lambda in the hard

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:02.560
collinear theory might become
lambda squared-- i.e. eta--

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.045
in the SCETII theory.

00:51:08.656 --> 00:51:12.560
So this E which
is greater than 0

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:22.510
comes from changing the power
counting of external fields

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.290
in the matching.

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:42.050
One example is just having
an external collinear

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.570
quark or external
collinear perp gluon,

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:47.720
for example, where you
would have c of order lambda

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.150
in SCETII, and it becomes
of order eta in SCETII

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.120
which is lambda squared.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:57.350
Those are extra factors of
the power counting parameter.

00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.070
OK.

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:03.210
So what do we learn, if we
put all these things together?

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:07.850
Well, one thing since soft
and the collinear fields

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:10.422
don't talk to each other,
when you write down

00:52:10.422 --> 00:52:12.380
Lagrangians for them,
they're totally decoupled

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.130
right from the start.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:20.630
And so there's actually no
mixed soft collinear Lagrangian

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:21.380
at leading order.

00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.150
And so all the
meat of this theory

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.800
is coming about when
you integrate out

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.467
these off-shell modes,
and you construct

00:52:36.467 --> 00:52:39.250
the external operators.

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:39.750
OK.

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.760
I'll say little bit more
about power counting.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.635
So there's no mixed soft
collinear Lagrangian

00:52:48.635 --> 00:52:53.115
at leading order, and
you can get mixed things

00:52:53.115 --> 00:52:53.990
at sub-leading order.

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.827
So in that way, it's like SCETI
after the field redefinition.

00:53:10.342 --> 00:53:11.550
But here, there is no analog.

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:13.740
If you just want to
go directly to SCETII,

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.217
there wouldn't be an analog
of the field redefinition.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.360
All the Wilson lines are
coming from integrating

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.778
off-shell particles.

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:33.680
OK.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.860
So we're going to
speed up a little.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.310
I'm going to skip
over one thing, which

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:41.490
I don't think I need.

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:43.970
So you can write down
power counting formulas,

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.720
like we did in chiral
perturbation theory.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.020
Maybe I'll just write
those formulas down.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:54.020
So in general, in chiral
perturbation theory,

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.395
we had a formula
that said, if we

00:53:55.395 --> 00:53:57.853
want to figure out the power
counting of any given diagram,

00:53:57.853 --> 00:53:59.540
we can have a counting
for that diagram,

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.830
and we know what size it is.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.460
And there's analogous
formulas like that

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.730
in both SCETI and SCETII.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:12.350
So in SCETI it's pretty simple.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:13.850
You say you have
something that's

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:16.010
order lambda to the delta.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:19.115
Then delta, the
formula for it follows.

00:54:23.183 --> 00:54:25.100
This is very analogous
to what we talked about

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.392
for chiral perturbation theory.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:40.470
So these guys here are vertices
that are purely ultrasoft,

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:42.350
and if you have purely
ultrasoft vertices,

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.360
you're subtracting 8
because the measure

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.100
of the ultrasoft particles is 8.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:48.350
I'm not deriving this for you.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:52.050
I could, but I think
it's fairly intuitive.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:56.180
So if you think about the
lowest order Lagrangian,

00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:00.320
say psi bar ID slash
psi for ultrasofts.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:03.900
This would already be something
that's lambda to the 8,

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.270
and this is then leading
order, so you subtract 8.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:12.410
And this guy here is
the rest, anything mixed

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.740
or purely collinear.

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.540
And then for that
guy, you subtract 4,

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:19.623
because as soon as you
have at least one collinear

00:55:19.623 --> 00:55:22.430
particle, then you have to
use the collinear measure.

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:26.240
And so here, some
operator like c bar,

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:28.970
and dot dc was order
lambda to the 4.

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:31.672
So you subtract 4 and
that's leading order.

00:55:31.672 --> 00:55:33.380
And so what this
formula allows you to do

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.260
is really just you do
power counting entirely

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.380
in terms of vertices.

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:40.400
You never have to power count
measures for loops or power

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.870
count propagators.

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:43.920
You just count vertices.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.790
So if you want to know how big a
time-order product is, and it's

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:54.830
a time-order product of an
L3 with an L2 with this kind

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:59.180
of setup, this will be basically
you count this as lambda phi.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.910
And you could even get
the absolute size right,

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:10.990
taking into account the
scaling of external particles,

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:13.040
and that's what this
constant 3 factor does.

00:56:16.204 --> 00:56:21.350
And U is equal to 1
only for pure ultrasoft.

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:30.095
Otherwise, it's 0.

00:56:30.095 --> 00:56:31.070
OK?

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:33.230
So there's formulas
like this, and there's

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:36.840
an analogous one in SCETII which
is a little more complicated.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.440
But it allows you just to have
a power counting where you can

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:46.490
just power count Lagrangians
or operators 01 with L1,

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:50.420
and that's lambda squared
without having to worry about

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.270
what propagators do I have
in this time-order product?

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:54.807
What loops do I have?

00:56:54.807 --> 00:56:56.390
You never have to
ask those questions.

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:58.098
You just have power
counting at vertices,

00:56:58.098 --> 00:57:00.508
and that makes
things quite easy.

00:57:00.508 --> 00:57:02.300
AUDIENCE: When you
write these expressions,

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.363
one insertion of Lagrangian
corresponds to a single vertex.

00:57:05.363 --> 00:57:06.530
[INAUDIBLE] that Lagrangian.

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:07.728
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:57:07.728 --> 00:57:08.270
That's right.

00:57:10.575 --> 00:57:11.075
OK.

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:18.290
All right.

00:57:22.722 --> 00:57:24.680
So I want to do a couple
of examples in SCETII.

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:36.900
So let's do an example.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.760
Let's do an example which
is in some ways simple,

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:48.710
and it's an exclusive
analog of our DIS example,

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:51.980
and it's called the
photon pion form factor.

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.290
So it's exclusive.

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:55.500
It's clearly exclusive.

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.970
There's a pion, and really,
all it's going to come in here

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:01.730
is hard collinear factorization.

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:05.360
So it's simple in the way
that it actually is not really

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.720
exploiting the full
complications of SCETII.

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.220
It's really just
another example,

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.470
where we have hard modes
factoring from cleaner modes.

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:14.060
But they're clearly
SCETII modes,

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:17.840
because they're going to
be modes for this pion.

00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.360
So we're going to use
again for this calculation

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:24.560
a bright frame, which
you'll see, I guess,

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.040
when I write down some momenta.

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:30.980
So what would we write down
for this process in QCD, first

00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.130
of all?

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:33.890
So you'd say, I have a pi 0.

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:37.850
It has some momentum P pi.

00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:40.460
I have some current
which I can take at 0,

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.533
and I want to make a
transition from the pi 0

00:58:42.533 --> 00:58:43.325
to a single photon.

00:59:01.662 --> 00:59:03.120
So you could write
that as follows.

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:26.510
I can always replace
the photon by current,

00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:28.508
and then I can parameterized
that matrix on it

00:59:28.508 --> 00:59:29.300
like a form factor.

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:46.190
And if we go through things
like parity, charge conjugation,

00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:50.060
stuff like that,
time reversal, we

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.420
find out that there's
one real form factor,

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.490
and there's an epsilon
symbol in this guy.

00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:57.650
It has to be linear in
the polarization vector.

00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:00.260
That was already true
here, and there's

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.090
one way of getting the
indices to work out

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:03.950
which is with this epsilon.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.410
So what you're really
after in this process

01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:09.370
would be some understanding
of this form factor.

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:12.002
That's the one piece of
non-perturbative information.

01:00:12.002 --> 01:00:13.460
Everything else,
Lorentz invariance

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.713
is enough to tell you about.

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:17.630
So we'd like to see if
there's a factorization

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:23.630
theorem for that form factor,
if we take the limit where

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.470
q squared is large.

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:37.100
So we have an
electromagnetic current.

01:00:43.457 --> 01:00:47.535
You can think about it is up
and down quarks for the pion.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:56.280
So there's some matrix
in the 2 by 2 space

01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:02.940
which is the charge, which you
can write as 2/3 minus 1/3,

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:03.840
like that.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.330
Or if you wanted to write
it in terms of polymatrices,

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:12.660
you could write it as
identity over 6 plus a tau 3

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:17.208
for isospin polymatrix over 2.

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:21.600
So there's some charge matrix
that's going to show up.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.660
What happens if we expand
q squared much greater

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.060
than lambda QCD squared?

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.712
In this formula over
here, this form factor

01:01:29.712 --> 01:01:31.920
knows about lambda QCD, and
it knows about q squared,

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.600
and we haven't expanded.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.420
So what happens if we do expand?

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.490
Can we simplify
that form factor?

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:41.690
And it does.

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:45.500
So I'm going to do this
in the bright frame again,

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:50.020
and that effectively means
I'm taking the momentum that

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:55.990
corresponds to the off-shell
photon as the same form

01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:58.010
as we did before
for our calculation

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:05.662
in DIS, purely in
the z coordinate.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:11.470
The momentum of the photon,
it's an on-shell thing,

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:14.102
so I can just write it
as E the photons say

01:02:14.102 --> 01:02:15.185
times a light-like vector.

01:02:15.185 --> 01:02:19.370
Then, P gamma squared will
be 0, as we want it to be.

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:24.220
And if I pick this kinematics,
then P pi is just P plus P

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:37.960
gamma, so that would be a P pi.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:45.150
OK?

01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:49.750
So in Feynman diagrams,
what am I talking about?

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:53.850
I'm talking about
making a transition

01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:56.970
with an off-shell
photon, through a diagram

01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:01.470
like this one, to a pi 0
or plus the cross graph.

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:09.980
And with this setup
with this kinematics,

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:13.160
this intermediate line here,
if we go through the scaling,

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.730
it's going to be hard.

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:18.560
So these guys with
this kinematics,

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.890
we make the pion collinear.

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:27.170
In order to see that,
you can impose P pi

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.780
squared equals M pi squared.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.950
Right?

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:33.530
This is never going
to be made small,

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:37.460
but E is going to have to be
tuned to be basically q over 2.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.350
So this thing is
going to become,

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:42.050
if you impose this
condition, something

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:47.990
like M pi squared over 2 q.

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:52.130
Then, you find out that
the pion is collinear.

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.290
So the pion is collinear.

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:55.850
The photon is a photon.

01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:59.432
This line here is
hard, and so we

01:03:59.432 --> 01:04:00.890
want to integrate
out the hard line

01:04:00.890 --> 01:04:05.540
and match this guy in
the effective theory

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.405
onto some effective
theory operators that

01:04:09.405 --> 01:04:10.280
would look like this.

01:04:21.016 --> 01:04:22.170
This guy is pink.

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:28.290
OK.

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:31.230
So we just have to write down
what type of effective theory

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:34.410
operators that could be, and
again, it's an effective theory

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:36.230
operator of two quark fields.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:37.980
So it's very much like
what we did before.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.720
I'm not going to be going
through all the indices

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.220
that I have to go
through in order

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.188
to keep track of charge
conjugation and all

01:04:54.188 --> 01:04:54.730
those things.

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.950
I'll just write down the
right answers for that part.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.090
So I could write like this.

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:21.780
So after doing hard
collinear factorization,

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.960
there's again operators
which is two quark's.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.180
Some hard Wilson
coefficient which

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.200
is this pink thing, integrating
out the pink line that

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.330
sits in the middle.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:37.110
This obey current conservation.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:40.440
Dimensional analysis
fixes this 1 over q.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.250
Charge conjugation,
actually, also provides

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:47.070
constraints on the
Wilson coefficients,

01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:49.770
just like it did in DIS.

01:05:49.770 --> 01:06:05.060
So charge conjugation
tells us that there's

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.605
a relation between
flipping signs.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.230
But we just impose
on this operator

01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:14.480
all the symmetries and
things that we can think of

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.160
and see what it says
about the operator.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.243
You can think about just
writing the operator down

01:06:18.243 --> 01:06:21.320
based on this picture without
ever calculating any diagrams,

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.790
just knowing what you're after.

01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:25.640
And then imposing on
it all the symmetries

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.330
that should be conserved.

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:31.393
So one is dimensional analysis.

01:06:31.393 --> 01:06:32.060
That gave the q.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.970
Current conservation,
that's partly responsible

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:37.805
for the epsilon which
is also like a parody.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:50.340
Go through flavor
and spin, and you

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:55.260
find that this has
this structure,

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.360
and there's some constant
that I threw in here.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.310
And you actually
know from the flavor

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:08.320
that it's got two photons.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.670
Right?

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:11.770
And I'm not ever adding
any more photons,

01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:15.160
so that means there's
two factors of q hat.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.950
And so there's a q
hat squared, which

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:20.440
I can stick inside this gamma.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:25.738
And it has to be
a color singlet,

01:07:25.738 --> 01:07:28.030
because it's going to have
to have a non-trivial matrix

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:30.400
element with pi 0 which
is a color singlet.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.890
And since it has to be--

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:41.650
so there's no TA inside the
gamma that's what I mean.

01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:44.860
There'd be nothing for the
index A to contract with.

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.390
And since it's a
color singlet, that

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:49.180
means if you were to think
about soft interactions here,

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.560
they would just cancel.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.590
Right?

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:54.085
If I were to think about
putting in soft interactions

01:07:54.085 --> 01:07:55.960
and integrating them
out, I'd get an S dagger

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.510
S that would cancel out.

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:00.760
So that's the sense in which
this is a simple example.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:16.569
OK.

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:18.760
So then, we would
have a formula where

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.859
we could equate the
effective theory

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:24.810
result with the
full theory result.

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:30.790
So we can equate
matrix elements,

01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:33.370
and this is one way in
which this example is

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:35.569
different than dependent
elastic scattering.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:40.600
We're really doing a matching
at the amplitude level.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.790
Remember, the form factor
was a parameterization

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:48.189
of the amplitude,
and if we do that--

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:02.609
If you like, if you think about
the two currents that we had,

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:04.960
and we've integrated them out.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.210
Now, think about just
this operator here.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:09.160
The matrix element
pi 0 to vacuum

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.819
that we had to finding this
thing which had two currents

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:16.158
just becomes a matrix
element of that operator.

01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:24.240
Again, like our DIS example,
we form the sum and difference

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.410
at the momenta.

01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:28.170
We can think of forming
P bar plus which

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:35.640
is P dagger plus or minus P.
And one of these guys just

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.944
gives the total
momentum, just the minus

01:09:39.944 --> 01:09:43.319
with our sign conventions.

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:49.270
So that gets fixed
which, in this case,

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:58.160
it just gets fixed to the
pion momentum which is q.

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:08.350
So if you like, you've
inserted the operator here.

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:11.230
You have some collinear
lines, and then you

01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:14.860
have a matrix element of the
pi 0, and then you have gluons.

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:22.592
But you know that
whatever momentum comes in

01:10:22.592 --> 01:10:24.050
has to be the
momentum of the pion,

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:28.180
and that's the one
momentum constraint.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.390
So that means that
the answer just

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:36.030
involves one convolution
again which is

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:37.730
the one that's unconstrained.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.170
So there's a Wilson
coefficient that

01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:45.660
depends on the other
unconstrained guy which

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:51.480
was P plus, and then
there's a matrix element,

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.870
where I can write in a
delta function with that P

01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:56.970
plus, the usual kind
of way that we've done.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.480
But here, it's a little
different matrix element

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.820
than the one we saw on DIS,
because it's not forward.

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:07.745
It's vacuum to pi 0.

01:11:19.722 --> 01:11:21.180
But it's actually
the same operator

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:24.960
that we were talking
about in DIS.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.470
It's just a bilinear operator
with two collinear quark

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:32.070
fields, two collinear quarks
in dress with Wilson lines.

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:41.270
So one can go through a
similar type of matrix element

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:43.400
analysis for this
operator, and it

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.610
gives something that's called
the light cone function.

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:48.250
So let me define that for you.

01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:10.720
This matrix element
can be written

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.560
in terms of an object that
has a dimensionless variable.

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:28.030
It's an analog of the
part-time distribution function

01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:29.890
but for this matrix
element that we're

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:32.316
dealing with here which
is vacuum to pion.

01:12:35.172 --> 01:12:38.078
So this has some similarity
to the formula we had in DIS.

01:12:38.078 --> 01:12:39.370
There's a delta function there.

01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:41.360
There's a delta function here.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.810
There's a dimensionless
variable z, dimensionless

01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:47.110
variable z there, and this is
a non-perturbative function.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.510
So this is what's called
a light cone distribution

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:00.640
function for the pion.

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:08.540
So generically, when you
have an exclusive process,

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:12.350
and you're producing some
hadron that's very energetic,

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:15.330
like a pion, this is the type of
thing that's going to show up,

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:17.481
one of these light cone
distribution functions.

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.980
This example of photon
to pion is in some sense

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:28.600
a very, very simple,
exclusive process,

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.640
the simplest one in some sense.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.140
OK.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.430
So we could take this formula,
plug it back in there,

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:36.520
and then we'd have a
factorization theorem.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.290
And I think that you can imagine
what that would look like.

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:41.290
I could write it, instead
of an integral over W,

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:45.250
as an integral over z, and
that would be the factorization

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:49.090
theorem involving this 5 pi.

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:52.282
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:53.278 --> 01:13:54.070
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.765
IAIN STEWART: That's right.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:58.960
So you should think
of the z as like--

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.430
so the way to think about
the z is as follows.

01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:03.430
So think about like
when you initially

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:07.780
produced these guys here,
think about all the momentum

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.970
going this way.

01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:13.120
When you initially
produced them,

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.510
after you integrated out the
hard interactions, you had z

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:19.540
and 1 minus z is the possible
split of the quarks fields

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.070
in the operator.

01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:23.110
So one of these guys carries z.

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.330
Effectively, what this
2z minus 1 is doing

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:27.455
is one of these guys is
carrying z, and one of them

01:14:27.455 --> 01:14:28.930
is carrying 1 minus z.

01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.220
OK?

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.750
The sum of these
is 1, and that's

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.420
the analog of the statement that
the whole total momentum should

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.175
be the pi 0 momentum.

01:14:36.175 --> 01:14:38.050
But you don't know how
to split how much goes

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.240
into each one of those.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.190
And what the wave
function is, it's

01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:45.460
all the linear interactions
that subsequently

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:49.070
rearrange this thing before you
annihilate it with the state.

01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:52.627
So all these things are
dressing up the pion state.

01:14:52.627 --> 01:14:53.960
They're producing the pion pole.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.950
So this is like 5 pi.

01:14:56.950 --> 01:15:00.910
And so what you have
is an operator that

01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.495
depends on z, a wave
function that depends on z.

01:15:03.495 --> 01:15:06.100
So this is a Wilson
coefficient that depends on z,

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.020
and your final
factorization theorem

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:13.570
is exactly of that
type, that you sort of--

01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:21.910
of an integral of z
of c of z Which also

01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:31.285
can depend on q and mu
and then 5 pi of z and mu.

01:15:31.285 --> 01:15:33.760
AUDIENCE: Is there a sense
of the 5 pi z as universal?

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:33.940
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.565
It's universal.

01:15:34.565 --> 01:15:36.640
AUDIENCE: You can use it
for other [INAUDIBLE]??

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.750
IAIN STEWART: Absolutely.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:40.400
Yeah.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.590
So as long as you
can factor it so

01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:45.770
that it's these
fields ans that pion,

01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:48.200
then you have this matrix
element, you get this guy.

01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:53.630
Some people try to measure
things about this guy,

01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:56.630
it's moments and stuff.

01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:57.130
All right.

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:03.180
One thing that happens here has
to do with this integral over z

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:10.290
which is still in some sense
an unsolved problem in SCET.

01:16:10.290 --> 01:16:12.300
So I have to mention it.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.820
So when you do
this integral, you

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.380
could ask, what does
the c of z look like?

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:21.780
And it turns out that c of
z will have in it terms that

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:24.803
go like 1 over z.

01:16:24.803 --> 01:16:26.220
And so you get
integrals that look

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.960
like dz over z of 5 pi of z.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.500
So at lowest order, this
integral would show up.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.595
And it turns out that,
for this matrix element

01:16:36.595 --> 01:16:38.470
here, you don't get
anything worse than that.

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:40.470
You never get 1 over z squared.

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:44.760
And this integral here, because
of properties of this 5 pi,

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:45.840
is finite.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.970
There's no problems.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:51.390
But there are examples known
in the literature, where that's

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:54.743
not the case, where you
actually get 1 over z squared,

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.160
and people have
some understanding

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:59.640
of the physics that's
happening in those cases.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.380
But there's not a
complete understanding

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.560
of how factorization
works in those cases.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.130
OK?

01:17:05.130 --> 01:17:07.270
So that doesn't happen
in this example,

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:10.210
but there are other examples
of exclusive processes

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:11.710
that would lead to
1 over z squares,

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.730
and then this integral
is not well-defined.

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:24.100
And people understand
that there's

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:25.918
a cut-off that's
coming in, and they

01:17:25.918 --> 01:17:27.460
understand that that
cut-off actually

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.080
has to do with some rapidity.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:33.100
But how to explicitly write
down an analog factorization

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.320
theorem that involves
those cut-offs

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.950
and has renormalization
group is an unsolved problem,

01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:42.110
unsolved SCETII problem.

01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.610
OK?

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:44.440
But for the example
we did, everything's

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.140
kosher and beautiful.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.130
All right.

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:52.550
So I think what
I'll do next time,

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:54.290
since we're out of
time I'm not going

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:56.570
to start my second example now.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:58.010
So next time,
we'll do an example

01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:01.020
that does involve soft fields,
both soft and collinear fields

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:01.520
in SCETII.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:09.400
That's where we're going, but
we'll leave that to next time.

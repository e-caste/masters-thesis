00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:23.960
COLIN SHEPPARD: OK, so for
the ones that just arrived,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.680
I'm going to be giving
the lecture today.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.090
But George is here.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.660
So if you've got
questions, you can ask me.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.720
I don't mind being
interrupted at any time.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.917
But also, if you want
George to answer something,

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:38.000
he's sitting here as well.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.450
So he can also contribute.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.090
So last time, George was looking
at the Fourier transforming

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.330
property of a lens.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.070
And he looks at the--
derived the 1D case, where

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.270
you've just got a function of, x
rather than a function of x, y.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.470
You've got this
transparency a distance z

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.100
in front of the lens.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.990
And then you've got a
screen placed a distance

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.650
f behind the lens.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.150
And so the question is, what
do you get on that screen?

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.590
And I'm not going to go
through all the algebra of that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.780
again because George
did it last time.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.950
This was the calculus.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.390
This was the answer.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.660
What you find is that what
you get in this plane here

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.050
is actually the
Fourier transform

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.330
of the thin transparency.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.060
So g of x is this
transparency here.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.320
You get the Fourier
transformer that.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.970
And multiplied by
a parabolic phase

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.710
factor, which depends on the
position of this screen--

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.980
of the transparency.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.200
What is the value of this z?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.620
You'll notice that you get this
factor here, 1 minus z over f.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.430
So if z equals f,
this is going to be 0.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.110
And this phase factor
is going to disappear.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.170
So for the special
case where z equals

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.390
f, all you see here is just
the Fourier transform of this.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.580
Very simple-- very
simple answer.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.550
And people actually have known
this for quite a long time.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.900
And at one time, it did
look really attractive

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.600
that you could
actually imagine using

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.620
this as a real way of
doing Fourier transforms.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.910
Especially as we're
now going to do,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.230
you can immediately generalize
that to the 2D case.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.040
So you can do a 2D
Fourier transform.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.810
And when you think that the
light propagates through this

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.750
at the speed of light, you
can do a 2D Fourier transform

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.610
at the speed of light.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.530
And when people
first realized this,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.765
which was back in the 1950s--

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:11.540
'50s or early '60s, computers
were very slow then.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.020
So doing a 2D Fourier
transform was not trivial.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.760
So a lot of effort was put into
trying to design instruments

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.270
to do that.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.820
Yes.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.190
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Do you
know who was the first one

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.857
to realize this?

00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:25.263
Was it Vander Lugt?

00:03:25.263 --> 00:03:26.930
COLIN SHEPPARD: The
question is, who was

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.960
the first to recognize that?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.845
Yeah Vander Lugt was
at Michigan, wasn't he?

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:40.580
And interestingly,
the holography guys

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.733
were also in the same lab.

00:03:42.733 --> 00:03:43.650
What's the guy's name.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.790
The one-- Emmett Leith.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.240
And interestingly, Emmett
Leith and Vander Lugt

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.920
both published virtually the
same paper in the same year.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.295
It's a very, very interesting
historical thing there.

00:03:58.295 --> 00:04:00.170
They're both from the
same lab, and they both

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.100
invented almost the same
idea as far as I can see.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.670
And neither of them
referred to the other guy.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.500
Very peculiar.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.030
Anyway, I don't know who really
came up with this idea first.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:21.440
But actually, I suspect that
actually, even Ernst Abbe

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.970
realized this.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.320
Ernst Abbe was the scientist who
designed the Zeiss microscopes

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.530
120, 130 years ago.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.180
And he came up with a
theory for image formation

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.940
in a microscope,
which is actually

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.690
what we're going to
be getting onto pretty

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.250
well, the next thing--

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.940
the imaging with a 4F F system.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.130
He understood that
130 years ago.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.940
And I don't think he's often
given as much credit is

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.180
he should get.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.600
Anyway, you can
use this as a way

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.130
of doing a Fourier transform,
and even a 2D Fourier

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.860
transform.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.780
So you see, going
from this stage

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.000
to this stage is
trivial, really.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.500
All we've done here
is assuming that it's

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.400
a separable function
of x and y so you

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.700
get exactly the same
sort of integral for y

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.860
as you get for x.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.920
So it now becomes
a double integral.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.430
This is the two-dimensional
Fourier transform object

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.200
of g of x, y.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.460
And you can see, you get
again the phase factor.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.100
Here, because it's
separable, you've

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.310
got this e to the
i pi x squared,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.170
and you got an e to
the i pi y squared.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.700
And of course, x squared
plus y squared very nicely

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.390
equals r squared.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.920
So this becomes a
spherical type wave.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.760
So we've still got this 1 minus
z over f So if z equals f,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.750
then again, this
phase factor vanishes,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.410
and we end up with just
the pure Fourier transform.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.100
Yeah, as I say,
so a lot of people

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.100
thought that this
was quite a neat way

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.200
of doing Fourier transforms.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.590
There was a lot of work
on optical computers

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.280
all the way through
the '60s and '70s.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.700
But the trouble is that, as
fast as they could develop

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.810
these systems, the
computer people developed

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.800
their computers even faster.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.040
So they were always one
step behind, I think.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.740
So I think in the
end, people realized

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.880
it was a waste of time,
and that it was never

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:49.850
really going to become
a practical way of doing

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.300
real calculations.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.970
But in the early days, it was.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.850
And Emmett Leith we
were just mentioning,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.420
he first developed these
systems for actually

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:07.730
analyzing the images they
took from a synthetic aperture

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:14.360
They'd fly an aeroplane over
North Korea, taking pictures.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.370
And then the idea was that
the plane takes many pictures

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.960
as it's traveling along, and
they're coherent with respect

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.600
to each other.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.880
So you can actually combine
them digitally afterwards

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.380
and get an image, which
has got amazing resolution.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.770
And you can see the guy in North
Korea reading his newspaper

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.260
or whatever.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.860
So they really did that
sort of thing way back then.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.700
Right, so that's the
equation here then.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.120
And yeah, so this is
just going through how

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.340
that thing was derived.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:08:00.300
So we've got the screen
here, the g of x.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.990
By the time we get
here, it's convolved

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.930
with some parabolic
phase function.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.630
And then after it
goes through here,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.110
it's multiplied by another
parabolic phase function.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.830
And then as it
propagates here, it's

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.330
convolved with another
parabolic phase function.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.050
And if we have that magic
condition, that this is f

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.080
and this is f, most of these
parabolic phases cancel out

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.300
and we're left with this
very simple final answer.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.090
So that's basically
what's happening.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.260
And George went through the
various stages of doing this.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.429
Of course, you end up with a
couple of integrals of products

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:43.100
of three phase functions here.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:49.350
So the algebra process
was quite complicated.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.270
Well, not really complicated,
but just lengthy.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.720
But everything in
the end cancels.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.240
If you haven't got z
equals 2f, though, then you

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.400
can see that you have
got this phase factor.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.960
So you don't actually get
exactly the Fourier transform

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.780
in this plane in that case.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.290
You get the Fourier
transform multiplied

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.630
by this phase factor.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.890
And that can be
important in some cases.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.750
That's something that you
need to take into account.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.490
There's another
special case, actually.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.620
That's the case when z equals 0.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.500
The case when z equals
0 is if this screen

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.030
coincides with the lens--

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.656
immediately close
up to the lens.

00:09:37.656 --> 00:09:41.060
And I think Goodman does
that one as well, doesn't he.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.130
And so if z equals 0, this goes.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.330
And so we're still left
with this phase factor,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:52.797
e to the i pi x double
dash squared over lambda f.

00:09:52.797 --> 00:09:54.380
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
And also, Goodman

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.570
does the case of
the transparency

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.247
after the lens, which I
did not do in the notes.

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:00.330
COLIN SHEPPARD: Right, OK.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.320
Yeah, so Goodman does this
case of the transparency placed

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.820
in here.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.695
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That this is z negative.

00:10:06.695 --> 00:10:11.015
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, but
it's very similar answers.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:22.510
OK, so this is just
writing down finally, then.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:29.650
We're defining then the Fourier
transform of little g is big G.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.220
So the final answer is that
you've got this parabolic phase

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.210
function times the
Fourier transform of g.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.380
OK.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:55.030
So this is pointing
out that we've now

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.960
looked at two different ways
you can do a Fourier transform.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.030
One way is to just propagate
the light a very large distance.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.060
You remember, if you have
[? frame ?] of a diffraction,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:13.600
if your screen is a very long
way away from the diffracting

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.960
screen, object,
whatever it was called--

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.410
transparency then again,
you get this Fourier

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.120
transform relationship.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.660
But of course, here he's
put a proportional side.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.150
There's some things
out the front there.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.930
And in particular, there's going
to be, again, a parabolic phase

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.070
term, isn't there?

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.180
Because in this case here,
what you'd expect actually

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.950
is that this
Fourier transform is

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:43.840
going to be actually on the
surface of some curved surface,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.870
not of a plane surface.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.800
So if the screen
is plane, then it's

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.960
going to be multiplied by
some parabolic phase term.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.200
And now we've just looked
at this other case where

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.280
we don't have to have a
very large lab in order

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.560
to do this experiment.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.020
We can actually make the
experiment quite small

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.100
so that it fits on top of the
table just by using a lens.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.420
And really what you can see,
that that is actually doing,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.630
according to your
geometrical optics ideas now,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.390
you can see what this is doing.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:27.680
This is producing an
image of this at infinity.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.800
So you can see that these two
things are actually equivalent.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.550
Well, what it's
doing is bringing

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.680
what would have been at
infinity to some finite plane.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.190
So that's all it's doing there.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.070
But again, we've got
this [? string ?]

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.580
here, this proportional
sign, which

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.340
means there's some other
constant factors out there,

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.940
including in general this
parabolic phase factor, which

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:06.150
for this particular case, when
you got f and f, it disappears.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.390
The parabolic phase
function disappears

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.830
when you've got this very, very
special case with the two f's

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.330
there.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.720
OK, now this one.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.640
What this is really
trying to show

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.335
is that, really,
there's two ways

00:13:25.335 --> 00:13:26.460
of looking at this problem.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.460
These two diagrams
here are really

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.950
trying to show the
same case, but trying

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.360
to get you thinking about
a different way of viewing

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.450
the problem.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.500
So in this case
here, you can think

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:55.180
of any point on the
screen on the transparency

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.440
is going to act
like a point source.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.430
So it's going to produce a
spherical expanding wave.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.270
And then this is a distance
f, so that spherical wave

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.950
is going to be
converted into a plane

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.240
wave The angle of propagation
of this plane wave

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.960
depends on the distance at
this point from the origin,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.880
of course.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.440
And so you can think, then,
of what you see on the screen

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.360
as being made up of
what's called an angular

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.500
spectrum of plane waves, where
the strength of each of those

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.940
and get a spectrum components
comes about from the value

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.410
of at that point.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.680
So that's one way of
thinking about it.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.640
And this way [INAUDIBLE]
thinking about it

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.600
the other way.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.550
This way, you're
thinking of the object.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.070
It's going to diffract.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:55.230
If you imagine your transparency
as being like a grating,

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.985
it produces a diffraction.

00:14:57.985 --> 00:15:01.230
It's producing
light grating orders

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.830
For example, if this
was a very simple case

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.460
of a sinusoidal
grating, you'd expect it

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.100
to produce some grating orders.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.840
And these grating orders
correspond to plane waves

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.000
traveling in particular angles.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.240
So this shows the
angular spectrum

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:29.040
of the diffraction of the light
given by the transparency.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:35.040
And then the lens collects
these different plane

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.750
white components.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.300
All of them are
going to be converted

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.750
into a spherical
converging wave that

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.420
converges a distance f away.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.440
It doesn't say that, but
this must be [? there. ?]

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:55.360
And the plane wave's
moving at different angles

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.240
are going to converge to a
point which, of course, is

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.970
proportional to the sine of
the angle of the propagation.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.390
So here, at any
point on the screen,

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.410
you're going to sum up
again these angular spectra

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.740
components, each of which is
going to give a spherical wave.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.670
So you can see, looking
at that diagram again,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.280
they're like inverses
of each other.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.760
I think this is another
example where, very often, you

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.865
can think of a
reciprocal type behavior.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:38.620
You could just flip
this over, and it would

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.180
look the same the other way.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.160
OK, so this way
here, then, we're

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:53.070
thinking of this as just
like the Huygens sense

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.750
that we spoke about
when we were first

00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:05.150
doing diffraction [? there. ?]

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.520
OK, so this is giving
some nice pictures.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.150
I'm going to steal this
presentation afterwards,

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.150
because there's so many
good displays in this thing,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.329
that I'm going to use it in
my own lectures in the future.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:22.069
So this has given
me some good ideas.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:27.140
So we start off, then,
this is a rectangle.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.530
Oh, I'm going to say
something in a minute, though.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.910
So this is a distance f.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.080
This is a distance f.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.170
So this length, then,
as we just described,

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.750
is going to produce a
Fourier transform of that.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:45.420
So the Fourier transform
of rect is a is a sinc.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:51.148
So you'd expect to get this a
sinc in x times a sinc in y.

00:17:51.148 --> 00:17:53.190
Now, the thing I was going
to say though, George,

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.710
this looks to me that
this is longer than that.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.170
This is longer this
way than that way.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.576
So this should be longer that
way than this way, I think.

00:18:01.576 --> 00:18:03.993
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: That's
the aspect ratio of the screen

00:18:03.993 --> 00:18:04.493
actually.

00:18:04.493 --> 00:18:06.682
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, the
aspect ratio of the screen

00:18:06.682 --> 00:18:07.890
ought to be 90 degrees round.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.030
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: There's
not a [? way of the ?]

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.155
Fourier transform, I guess.

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:10.800
[LAUGHS]

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.630
COLIN SHEPPARD: Anyway, so
this conversation does bring it

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.120
home, I think, and
a very important

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.990
point that we've mentioned
before in the course.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.340
That if you make a
function smaller,

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.490
it's Fourier transform is wider.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.080
If you make the function
wider, this Fourier transfer

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.830
is smaller.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.070
And you'll notice, then, these
products of these two sincs

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.090
gives a bright
spot in the center,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.170
a series of bright
spots along the axes.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.740
There are also some bright
spots in this region here.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.710
But they're so weak that
you can't actually see them.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.300
Really, you can only see
the ones along the axes.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.310
All right, so that's
the first example.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:04.770
Then this one's showing how,
if we make the transparency

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:10.840
smaller, the rectangle smaller,
so this pattern gets bigger,

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.210
now actually we can
just about manage

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.230
to maybe see some ones
other than along the axis.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.400
And then this one is
an interesting one.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.620
So now we've got not just one
aperture, but three apertures.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:33.580
And so how can we work out
what the Fourier transform

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.140
of three apertures would be?

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.800
Anyone got some ideas?

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.890
I'm sure [INAUDIBLE]
will have an idea.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:42.940
Anyone?

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.800
How would anyone think of
doing this sort of thing?

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.663
Have you come across a thing
called the convolution theorem?

00:19:56.663 --> 00:19:58.330
Probably you should
have done somewhere,

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.280
I would have thought.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.030
So there's the thing
in Fourier transforms

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.250
called convolution theorem.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:09.580
So this is actually, like,
three spikes convolved

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.010
with a square, which
really all it means

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.270
is we place a square on
each of the three spikes.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:22.210
And the convolution theorem
says that the Fourier transform

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.570
of a convolution is the product
of the Fourier transforms.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.890
So what you'd expect is that the
Fourier transform that you're

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.560
going to see here is
the Fourier transform

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:40.170
of the rectangle, which is this,
multiplied by something else,

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.890
which is the Fourier
transform of the three spikes.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:49.070
And the three spikes is
like a delta function

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.810
and a plus or minus
delta function.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.170
The plus or minus delta
function together,

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.140
e to the i sampling plus
e to the minus i sampling

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.730
gives cause.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.300
And the one in the center
just gives a constant.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.500
So the Fourier transform of
these three delta functions

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.830
is 1 plus a cosine, or
something like that.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.660
And so that's what we
expect to see, then.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.800
This thing, this pattern
that we saw before,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.690
is going to be multiplied
by a cosine function which

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.000
comes about because of
the separation of this.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.650
And of course, because
this distance is actually

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.290
much bigger than the
width of the rectangle,

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:41.220
the spacing of the cosine is
much finer than the Fourier

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.120
transform of the rectangle.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.610
And so that's why
these fringes--

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:49.440
you see these fringes,
very fine fringes,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.260
they become a result of the
fact that these components here

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.690
are quite well-separated.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.810
So that's another
very nice example.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:08.790
And so all these theorems that
you learn in Fourier transforms

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.030
can all be directly
taken over into optics.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.240
And sometimes, they
can save a lot of work,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.450
because you can just use the
standard forms for things

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.680
that you can look up
in a book of tables.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.710
And it saves you a lot of
algebra, or even worse,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.870
arithmetic.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.920
Right, so this is
another example.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.000
So now we're back to the
bigger rectangle, or something

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.815
close to the bigger rectangle.

00:22:35.815 --> 00:22:41.180
The Fourier transform of the
rectangle, we saw before.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.490
But now this one, you see this
is multiplied by some fringes.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.670
So this is like the opposite
of this one, really.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.150
So this is a convolution.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.980
This is a product.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.470
So we use the same
convolution theorem again.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.910
The fringes, of
course, correspond

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.870
just like we said before.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.110
The Fourier transform of
the three delta functions

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.670
was the fringes.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.100
So the Fourier transform
with the fringes

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.050
is like three delta functions.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.350
So what we'd expect,
this is a product

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.790
of the fringes
and the rectangle.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:21.070
So we expect here to see the
convolution of the Fourier

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.320
transform of the
fringes and the Fourier

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.390
transform of the rectangle.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.630
And that's what we see.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:33.440
So we see three of these
diffraction patterns situated

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.650
on these three spots
corresponding to the Fourier

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.870
transform of that grating.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.170
So a very nice
display, that one.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:42.850
I like that one.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.450
OK, so this is now
introducing the idea

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.910
of what's called the 4F system.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:01.950
So we're going to do this not
just once, but do it twice.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.310
So this just shows
what we've had so far.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:08.270
If we've got some
particular transparency,

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:12.560
we get some particular
diffraction pattern

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.300
in the back focal plane.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.660
And then in the 4F system,
we do the same again.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.110
We now have another
lens which is

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.630
going to do exactly the same.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.330
It's going to look
at this pattern

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.060
and produce it's
Fourier transform.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:36.550
So remember, if this is f
and this is f and this is f

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.070
and this is f, we won't
have to worry anything

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.890
about these parabolic phases.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.430
It's just straight Fourier
transforms with nothing else.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:47.860
And so you can see what you get.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.060
It's very simple.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.440
You start off with this object.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.410
So here is Fourier transform
And if you take the Fourier

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.100
transform of the
Fourier transform,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.560
what do you get if you do a
Fourier transform of a Fourier

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.060
transform?

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.818
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah,
it's not quite, is it?

00:25:04.818 --> 00:25:05.360
You remember?

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.530
You invert it.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:10.160
That's right, Yeah,
so someone got that.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.160
If you remember, if you do a
Fourier transform of a Fourier

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.960
transform, you get the
original function inverted.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.270
You have to take the Fourier
transform four times,

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.880
and then you get back
to where you start.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.980
And so that's what
we can see anyway.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.380
So this is the inverted.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.650
Well, of course, inverted,
that's just what we expect,

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:30.150
isn't it?

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.620
Because we know that when
we have an imaging system,

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.730
we get an inverted image.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.060
So everything fits together.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.840
It gives exactly
the same results

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.320
that we expect from
our geometrical optics.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.050
And so in this case,
of course, this

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.920
is a rather symmetrical object.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.120
So the fact that this
has been inverted,

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.950
I guess you can't
really even see.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.870
OK, so this is
saying, then, that you

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:11.400
can make a 4F system
which produces,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.930
then, an inverted version
of the original object.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.180
You might wonder what
the point of that is.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.660
I mean, I guess
in a way, there's

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.600
no point in making an
image which is much

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.150
the same as the object, really.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.960
But one reason why
you might want--

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.310
well, there's two reasons.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:35.220
One is that it's actually
produced this image

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.780
in a different plane.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:41.790
So it's actually transported
this distribution of light

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.580
here from this
plane to this plane.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.070
So that's one type
of application

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.490
where you might want to
do something like this.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.330
And the second thing, of course,
is that although this is always

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.710
called a 4F system,
one we obviously

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.790
have to have this and this
[INAUDIBLE] both equal for this

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.090
to work.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.190
We have to add this and this
f to be equal for it to work.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:12.110
But this f doesn't have
to be the same as that f.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.530
So you can actually
have a system

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.980
like this, where you actually
produce a magnified image

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.965
or a demagnified image.

00:27:19.965 --> 00:27:22.355
And now, that, of course, is
getting a lot more useful.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.340
So that's how you
can produce an image

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.310
of an object in another plane.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:38.620
Now, the next thing
to note is, of course,

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.200
so far we've assumed
that all this light gets

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.710
through this optical
system and gets here.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:51.530
So if that was the case,
you get a perfect image.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.260
If all the information
from the objects

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.140
was getting to the image, then
you wouldn't lose anything.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:02.360
But in practice, of course,
that's never going to be true.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.480
And, well, one way it's not
going to be true, of course,

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.520
is because in practice,
these lenses are never

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.360
going to be infinitely large.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.050
But also, we could,
if we wanted to,

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:19.070
actually put some sort
of mask in this plane

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.940
here to actually stop
some of that light getting

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.940
through to the image plane.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.800
And so now we're going to look
at what happens if we do that.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.330
This is much the
same overall effect

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.600
as George spoke about in
previous lectures, actually.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.960
Not imaging case, but he
spoke about-- you remember

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.080
the results with the
building with the windows

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:52.360
that you could actually, just
by doing digital processing

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.400
on the Fourier
transforms, you can

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.010
manipulate the
strength of the grating

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.990
components in the final image.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.260
So the same is true
here, except now we're

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.910
doing it optically
rather than digitally.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:10.940
So what you'd expect, then, is
if we put something in here--

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.080
so here, this is
showing a passband.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.455
So let's say you
put in here some--

00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:20.110
a [? paint ?] screen
with a small hole in.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:25.240
The hole is this passband, and
the screen is the block band.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.690
So it only let's through
the region in the center.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.620
According to how big
that passband is,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.940
you'll get different
answers in the image plane.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.280
Yeah, of course, it
says the transparency

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.440
may be a grayscale.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.610
It doesn't have to be a binary
type thing, black and white.

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:51.620
Or it could even
be a phase mask.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.580
It could be that this
is changing the phase

00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:00.350
by, let's say, pi by 2 relative
to this or pi relative to this,

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.160
or whatever.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.890
And you get different
answers according

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:09.050
to what you choose, obviously,
for the geometry of this

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.235
what we call spatial filter.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:22.250
OK, so yeah, this is
going back to this idea

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:26.190
of these two ways of thinking
about the same problem.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.980
So this is the first way,
where we think of our objects

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.640
as being made up of lots
of point scatterers Each

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.730
of these scatterers gives
rise to, like, Huygens'

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.730
spherical wavelets.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.610
Each of these is
collected by lens.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:50.030
The lens convert
that to a plane wave.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:53.960
The plane wave reaches
the second lens.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.030
And because it's
a plane wave, it's

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.120
converted back to a
spherical wave that converges

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.220
at distance f away from that.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.000
And now we've actually
introduced the fact

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.220
that these f's
can be different--

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.445
so f1, f2.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.910
This has to be equal
to this, and this

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:15.980
has to be equal to this.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.120
Otherwise, the phases
won't cancel out properly.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.230
And so you can see
that what you'd expect,

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.740
then, is that because
in this diagram here,

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:33.020
F1 is bigger than F2, this
image is actually smaller

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.540
than the original object.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.180
And note now, you
can also see directly

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.180
the geometry showing
the inversion,

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:47.180
the point above the axis has
come to an image below the axis

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.220
here.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.560
So that's the one way
of thinking about it.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.290
And then the other way
is to think in terms

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.300
of spatial frequencies.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.230
We think of this object as
being like a grating, which

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.270
is going to produce
grating orders which

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.550
travel in different directions.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:09.660
Each of these grating
orders is like a plane wave.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.570
And when it reaches
the lens, it's

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:16.820
going to produce a converging
spherical wave, which

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:22.530
comes to a focus at
distance f behind the lens.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.550
And then after that, of
course, it doesn't stop.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.830
But it carries on.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.970
It diverges again,
reaches the second lens.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.100
And then the second
lens, because this

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.730
is a spherical wave coming
from a distance f away,

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.450
is converted into
a plane wave again.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:44.790
So again, you've got this nice
symmetry between what goes in

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.950
and what comes out.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.930
So there are these
really different ways

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:53.510
of thinking about how
this is all going on.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.420
End of show.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.143
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:01.143 --> 00:33:02.268
COLIN SHEPPARD: Right then.

00:33:02.268 --> 00:33:03.492
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:03.492 --> 00:33:05.030
COLIN SHEPPARD: Right, OK.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.700
So all that was just a warm-up.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.190
That was last week's lecture--
last Monday's lecture

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.000
we've done so far.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.030
Right.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.290
Oh, yes.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.540
Lots of interesting
things coming up later.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.780
OK, so we're going to
carry on straight away

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.350
with more of this 4F system
and spatial filtering.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.750
So we're just getting
started on this.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.960
And so there's lots of
very interesting things

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.760
you can do with these.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.490
So this is back to the same
thing again [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:09.730
showing again, but a
bit more detail now,

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.030
because we're actually
going to really look

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.600
at more detail of where
these orders are formed

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.739
and what you can do with them.

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:24.090
So we have a grating object.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.540
Let's imagine this is just
a 1 plus a cosine, which

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.270
means then it
produces a zero order,

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.120
and then a plus
and minus 1 order.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.080
So three plane waves.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.320
And as we said, each
of those plane waves

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:43.050
is going to be converted to
a converging spherical wave.

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.199
And so in this back
focal plane, you'll

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:51.310
see three spots corresponding
to the three orders.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:55.760
And then carrying
on, these plane waves

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.610
then converted back
into a spherical wave.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:02.120
And you get an image which
is back to the grating again.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.410
So at the moment,
the optical system

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.990
has transmitted all
the information.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.740
And so what we really
expect is that the image

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.190
is exactly the same as the
object, apart from the fact

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:21.020
it's inverted and it might be
magnified, or the opposite.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.870
But the resolution you'd
expect would be the same.

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:29.520
All the detail in here,
you'd expect to see in there.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.870
So the next thing
to look at is what

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.600
happens if we now
place something

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:39.260
in this plane that changes
the relative strength

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.060
of these different orders.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.640
And there are lots of
things that we could try.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.030
The first one, the
simplest one to look at,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:51.140
is what happens if we just
put in something, a mask

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:58.160
here that lets through the
zero order and not the others.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.560
The plus 1 and the minus 1 order
are obstructed by this screen.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.490
So all we let through
is this single order,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:11.520
which is going to be
converted to a plane wave.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.990
And so on your screen here, all
you'll see is the plane wave.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:18.510
So the image that you see--

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.680
well, I call it an image.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.810
But it's not really
much of an image.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.420
It's completely featureless.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:29.340
It's just like a gray spot--

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.900
a gray region.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.500
There's no detail there.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:37.230
So we've lost that structure.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:41.280
Actually, because we
put this mask in here,

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:46.740
the structure is beyond
the resolution limit

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.640
of the optical system.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.770
And so we can't see it.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.840
OK, so this is what we might
call a low-pass filter.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.610
So if you think of these
as being like these grating

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.420
orders basically represent
different spatial frequencies.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:11.370
So just in analogy with what
you have in electricity,

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.220
where you've got
frequencies and time,

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:20.290
in space, we've got distance and
we've got spatial frequencies.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:25.120
So this is why we could talk
about low-pass filtering.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.530
We're filtering the
spatial frequencies.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:31.440
And just like in
time, you remember

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.800
when you've got
your hi-fi system,

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.070
if you turn down
the treble, that's

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:41.160
acting like a low-pass filter.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.880
It's cutting out the
high-frequency sound

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.850
and letting through the
low-frequency sound only,

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:48.690
isn't it?

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.340
So that's what we call
a low-pass filter.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.680
And this is exactly the same.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.140
We've put in the mask.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.280
It's a bit different in a
way from the electronic case,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.560
because in optics, we've
got a lot more freedom

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.240
as to what we can do.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.550
We can actually put in
something here which

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.220
has got real sharp edges to it.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.170
In electronics, if you're
trying to make a filter,

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.240
there's always a
limit to how much

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.730
you can make the roll
off of the filter.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.940
So you can't get something
that suddenly cuts off

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.980
like that very easily.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:31.030
OK, so this is going
through the maths of this.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:36.610
Our original transparency,
then, is a 1 plus cosine.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.600
And the 1 plus cosine,
we Fourier transform

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.750
that to find what we
call the object spectrum.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:50.080
And so in this case, finding
the Fourier transform of cosine

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.690
is very straightforward,
because we just

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:56.860
expand cosine as e to
the i something plus e

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.730
on the minus i something over 2.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:04.360
And each of those e
to the i type terms

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.670
will correspond to
a single frequency.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:13.660
So we end up now with three
terms at different frequencies.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.670
The one Fourier transforms to
a delta function of u, which

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.180
is a spike where u equals 0.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.030
And the two components
of the cosine

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:32.350
correspond to another 2 delta
functions, each situated--

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.210
this one's a u
equals some value u0.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:40.150
And this one is some
value u equals minus u0.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.320
So you've got these three spikes
that we've been talking about

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.750
for the last few slides now.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:51.790
So this is the object spectrum.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.340
It's the angular spectrum
that we've got here.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.590
So actually, you can see that
u here basically represents

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:04.263
the angle that these plane
waves are traveling in.

00:40:04.263 --> 00:40:05.680
And there's three
different angles

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.630
that the light can travel in.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:16.660
And so yeah, that
will propagate, then.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.360
And as we've said
before, you can

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:24.320
see that these rays
are moving at an angle.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.980
And so as you go
along a distance f,

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.770
you get a shift
in the x position

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:37.230
which is given by, of
course, the slope of this.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:41.170
The more the slope, the
more it deflects by the time

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.150
you travel a distance f.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:47.150
So this then gives the
shifts of these two things.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:51.700
So that's before
the screen, then--

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.350
sorry, before the mask.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.324
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.110
Yeah, so this is showing, then--

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:46.250
so these raise, then,
as they come down here.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.190
We put in this
pupil mask which is

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.990
going to get rid of these two.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.520
And it just leaves
the other one.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.660
So we just left them
with our single beam,

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.350
which as we said before gives
an image which is not really

00:41:59.350 --> 00:41:59.850
an image.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.500
Right, yeah, so
after the pupil mask,

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.990
we multiplied by the mask.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.080
Gets rid of those two.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.090
Just leaves the other one.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:14.920
And finally, then, the
final image you'll see

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.860
is going to be the Fourier
transformer of that.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:22.400
And the Fourier transform of the
delta function is a constant.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.530
And so you see something
which has got no detail in it.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.250
OK, so this gives
another example, then.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.970
Here, we're looking at some
binary amplitude grating.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.820
So this is a
particular example--

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.060
another example.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.810
So last time, we looked
at the cosine type thing.

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.010
So this one is now
a binary grating,

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:53.250
which means that the
object is something

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.080
which is either black or white.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.790
And we shine a light onto this.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:01.420
So it's like a
square wave grating.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:06.010
And so unlike the previous
case where cosine, of course,

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:10.690
just produced those
three grating components,

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:14.380
in this case, there's going
to be a whole load of grating

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.040
components.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.380
They're going to go on forever.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.600
But they get weaker and weaker.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.050
And so you can see here,
it shows a few of them.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.180
The first, the
second, so there'll

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.230
be the third, the
fourth, and so on.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.490
And then minus 1,
and so on and so on.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:33.340
And each of these is moving
at a different angle.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:37.960
So when the plane wave
gets to the pupil mask--

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:44.040
sorry, when the plane wave
is focused to the pupil mask,

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.880
it's going to reach there.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.360
At a point, the distance
from the axis, of course,

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:55.000
is going to depend on the angle
of this plane wave component,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.890
the grating component.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:59.440
So if you look
here, you're going

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.710
to see all these different
grating orders all

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.420
arrayed in this position here.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:12.310
And so by putting some
sort of mask here,

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:17.650
we can monitor and change the
relative strength or phrase

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:21.100
or whatever we like of
those different components.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.410
And then they'll
be added together,

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:28.040
produce some nice effect that
we might want to look at.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.880
So let's see what we're
going to get in this case.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.660
So in this particular
case in the picture,

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.570
the size of this
aperture is enough to let

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.950
through the central three
components, the zero order

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:44.860
and the plus and minus 1 order.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.430
But it stopped all
the other ones.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:53.650
So what you will see here is
the Fourier transform of this.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.260
[INAUDIBLE] before.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.510
It's these three spikes again.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:03.580
The Fourier transform of
the three spikes is just a 1

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.960
plus a cosine.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.270
The relative strength of
these might change according

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:11.160
to the properties of these--

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.860
of the transmission of the mask.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:20.740
But anyway, what you see finally
is an object which is like--

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:28.210
you see the 1 plus cosine
type variation in amplitude.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:32.530
And so you notice that
this thing here started

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:36.740
with these very square edges.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.860
We no longer see the
very square edges.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:46.490
So this is an example of
how we've lost resolution.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:50.660
The optical system has got
a certain finite resolution.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:53.810
There's detail in
this original object

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:56.720
that we can't actually
see in the final image.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.655
And this is because
not all the light

00:45:58.655 --> 00:45:59.780
has got through the system.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:12.010
OK, so we're going to look
at a particular case now.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.830
This is the bit I was saying
I wasn't very keen on.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.090
No, no, it's all right.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:18.520
But anyway, there's
a load of maths

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.360
here, which I might
actually gloss over a bit,

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.950
and let you look at
it yourself later.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.690
But basically,
then, we're looking

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:29.890
at a particular example.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:34.855
It's a binary grating with
perfect contrast, m equals 1--

00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:36.700
i.e., this goes
from black to white.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.990
That's what that means.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:42.040
It's got a period of 10 microns.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.650
The spacing, the
period, is the distance

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:48.550
between the repeat
on this grating.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:52.810
And it's got a duty
cycle of a third, which

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:59.220
means that the white bit is
a third of the black bit.

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.370
Is that what that means?

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:00.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:01.920
COLIN SHEPPARD: A
third of the whole.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.795
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:02.795 --> 00:47:05.570
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah,
a third of the period.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:11.550
OK, and then we're also told
that the 4F system consists

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:16.720
of two identical lenses of focal
length f equals 20 centimeters.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.040
So both f1 and f2
are 20 centimeters.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.760
And we put a pupil
mask of diameter

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:29.150
3 centimeters here
at the Fourier plane.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:33.467
What is the intensity observed
at the output image plane?

00:47:33.467 --> 00:47:34.425
So that's the question.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.890
OK, the secrets to solve this
kind of problem, what you've

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.500
got to do is to
work out what you're

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.230
going to get in this
plane, which is basically

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:54.780
the Fourier transform of this.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:48:00.330
And then you're going to
have to multiply by the mask

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.490
and see which of those
orders get through.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:07.920
So the relative scaling of this
diffraction pattern in the mask

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.380
is obviously all
important for that.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.870
If you don't get that
right, then you'll

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:17.870
get the wrong answer,
obviously, because you

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:19.870
might get orders getting
through that shouldn't,

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.110
or the other way around.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:28.440
And so once we've done
that, we know now what

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:34.720
the grating orders, the Fourier
components in the final image,

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.840
are going to be.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.400
And we then do another
Fourier transfer.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.960
And we've got the
image amplitude.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.640
There we are.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.878
Again, we go [? do ?] scaling
to get it the right size.

00:48:53.878 --> 00:48:55.420
Normally, of course,
at the very end,

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.920
we would be interested in
intensity, not amplitude,

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.420
as well.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:09.720
OK, so this is our
example low-pass

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:13.230
filtering, a binary
amplitude grating.

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:17.040
So this is this grating
as we've chosen.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:22.980
And so you can see this, that
the dimension's in microns.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:27.820
So this is quite a fine grating.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.930
So you can see that it's
not symmetrical, by the way.

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:35.890
The duty cycle is
not a half, right?

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:39.730
So the width of
the bright regions

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.940
is smaller than the width
of the dark regions.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.380
And that's important
when it comes

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.990
to looking at the
Fourier transform,

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.120
and therefore the
spectrum of that.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.430
And then the pupil
mask that we're

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.020
going to look at looks
something like that.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.860
We let through the
frequencies near the center.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.770
And we keep out--

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:06.090
reject the frequencies which
are further from the center.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:17.820
OK, so for the Fourier
transformer of that,

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:19.590
this is a repetitive function.

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:23.670
So the Fourier transform just
becomes a Fourier series.

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:28.930
And this is an expression for
the Fourier series of this.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:34.490
It basically consists
of two parts.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:39.070
It's got a sort of
envelope, which is a sinc.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:44.720
Basically, this is going to
consist of an infinite number

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.910
of discrete frequencies.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:52.420
It's going to consist of
a constant term, which

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.110
is the zero.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:58.860
It is going to consist of
a first harmonic and then

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.590
a second harmonic and a
third harmonic, and so on.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:04.840
If the duty cycle
has been chosen

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:09.820
to be a half, i.e. it was a
square wave, then by symmetry,

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.740
it turns out that
the second harmonic

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.160
and the fourth harmonic
and all those all vanish.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:18.520
So you'd only end up with the
zero, the first, the third,

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.140
the fifth, and so on.

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:25.540
But in general, there will
be all the orders there.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:29.230
And the relative
strength of those orders

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:35.470
here, you can see the
size depends on the value

00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:37.360
of this sinc function.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.630
Actually, that's a very easy way
of seeing about the even orders

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:42.940
canceling.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:48.640
Because what happens is, if
the duty factor is a half,

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.960
it turns out that
the even orders when

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:57.550
q equals even number
coincide with the zeros

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:58.750
of the sinc function.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.720
And that's why they vanish.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:09.240
So where this comes
from is that--

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:13.260
so we're saying that
this function is a--

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:20.060
maybe it's easier if I go on
to the next slide, I think,

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.610
which is the Fourier transform.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:26.570
Yeah, so the Fourier
transform, the strength

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.510
of these components is
what we've got to find out.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:34.700
And so this function
Fourier transforms

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.720
to something which is a
series of delta functions

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.860
corresponding to the different
orders, different values, of q.

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:46.670
And the strength of the
different components

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:48.380
is given by the
value of the sync.

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:56.850
So you can see again, if there
are some values of alpha q

00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:02.862
which can be 0,
and therefore would

00:53:02.862 --> 00:53:04.820
mean that those components
[? will ?] be there.

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:20.890
OK, so when it gets to the pupil
mask, all that's happening--

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:24.490
maybe we ought to
go back to the--

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:29.300
we'll go back to this diagram.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:34.250
So you can see that
what we need to know

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:38.270
is, this is coming to a
focus at this point here.

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:41.900
But we need to know what
that distance here is.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:47.690
But we need to know that
relative scaling of where

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:49.100
that diffraction order appears.

00:54:06.725 --> 00:54:09.224
Oh, that was well
up here [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:19.503
OK, so this is this lambda
f that comes in here,

00:54:19.503 --> 00:54:21.170
because it's going
through a distance f.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:24.655
So that gives the scaling
of this distribution

00:54:24.655 --> 00:54:26.810
that you get there.

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:34.190
And so that's where u now is
replaced by this x double dash

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:35.600
over lambda f--

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:40.570
the scaling of that size of
that diffraction pattern.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:46.800
And then this is put in
the answer, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.955
is that you get this--

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:56.660
oh, yeah, we're told the
alpha is the juicy fat cycle.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.730
So that's the third.

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:01.270
So alpha is a third in here.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:09.795
And where do we get the 1
centimeter from, George?

00:55:09.795 --> 00:55:12.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.630
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah,
I think I saw something

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:26.080
like this on the crib sheet.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.520
Which he will hide, by the way.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:37.680
So we've got-- all
right here, we've

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:48.770
got lambda equals 0.5 microns,
f equals 20 centimeters,

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:54.640
lambda period is
equal to 10 microns.

00:55:54.640 --> 00:56:00.550
So that gives that lambda
f over [INAUDIBLE] lambda

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:07.645
is 0.5 times 20 over 10.

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.422
No, that's not--
this is microns.

00:56:15.422 --> 00:56:16.380
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.640
Lambda-- both lambdas
are in microns.

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.290
COLIN SHEPPARD: Oh yeah.

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:22.670
These are in microns.

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:23.600
These are in microns.

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.230
These are in centimeters.

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:27.140
So this is in centimeters.

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:30.700
And this is equal
to 1 centimeter.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:35.620
Right, OK, so that's
what's going on there.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.367
So that's the 1 centimeter.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:46.970
OK, so that's just plotting,
then, these different orders.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:53.560
And so you can see here the
zero order plus 1 plus 2 plus 3,

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.980
so on.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:00.950
But the screen blocks
out all the ones,

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.420
except for these central ones.

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:10.370
And so this thing, these
relative strengths,

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:12.290
must come from--
well, there's a factor

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:15.200
of third at the
front is this one.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.280
And then this is
multiplied by the value

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:24.210
of sinc of a third, which must
give the rest of this thing

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:26.094
here.

00:57:26.094 --> 00:57:27.770
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
And so I have

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:32.030
posted in the website a
supplement to this lecture.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.890
So in the supplement,
I have worked

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.110
out all these
calculations-- how you

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:40.470
compute the sinc of 1 over 1/3,
sinc of 2 over 1/3, and so on.

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:43.420
So you can see some more
details in the website.

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.660
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, OK.

00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.430
You remember a
sinc, you've defined

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:49.057
the sine of pi x over pi x.

00:57:49.057 --> 00:57:49.640
Remember that?

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:57.310
So that's the way that
people will usually

00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:05.310
define a sinc of x equals
sine of pi x over pi x.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:11.580
All right, so it's
defined in that way,

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.697
because then lots of nasty
pi's and things cancel out

00:58:15.697 --> 00:58:16.530
and everything else.

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:31.000
All right, so we've
got to multiply that

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.010
by the size of the mask.

00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:37.780
So as it shows
here, the mask going

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:43.240
from minus 1.5 centimeters to
plus 1.5 centimeters, which

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.100
means that this grating
component, which

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:48.340
is at 2 centimeters,
doesn't get through.

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:54.760
So that's what gets
through the aperture.

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:59.170
And then we Fourier
transform that again.

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:03.480
And so the delta
function transforms

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.200
to an exponential-- a
shifted delta function,

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.780
and corresponds to exponential.

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.905
And therefore, our output--

00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:21.830
this f was the
same in this case.

00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:24.600
The two f's of the two
[INAUDIBLE] lens were the same.

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:29.020
So we get 1 over
lambda f again there.

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:33.650
AUDIENCE: What will happen if
we make the width of this mask

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:35.540
minus 2 to plus 2?

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:39.806
Will there be any diffraction
due to this second order?

00:59:39.806 --> 00:59:43.660
COLIN SHEPPARD: Well, if it was
exactly minus 2 to the plus 2,

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:48.290
then I guess if it
really was exactly there,

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:52.160
you'd expect half of it
to get through this order.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.740
I mean normally, we would
assume it either lets it through

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:58.200
or doesn't let it through.

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:04.160
So if you made the size of the
aperture 2.5, then of course

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.440
this next order would
get through, wouldn't it?

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.190
AUDIENCE: But if it
is exact [INAUDIBLE],,

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:10.800
that means do we
have to consider

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.638
the diffraction of [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:13.638 --> 01:00:18.470
COLIN SHEPPARD: No, I
think that effectively, I

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:21.983
think you have to say that
half of it got through.

01:00:21.983 --> 01:00:23.900
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Actually, that's correct.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.575
Because in actuality,
the grating is finite.

01:00:26.575 --> 01:00:27.950
So these are not
delta functions.

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:29.520
They're sinc patterns.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.810
So if you place the
grating at exactly 2,

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:35.720
then you allow 1/2 of the
sinc to go through, right?

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.370
So therefore, 1/2
is [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.745
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, that's
a very good way of thinking.

01:00:39.745 --> 01:00:41.900
Here, we started off
by saying that this

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.700
is a continuous
repetitive grating.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.640
And so we can think of it in
terms of a Fourier series.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.340
But of course, it's not
actually infinitely big.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.560
I guess it's not going to be
more than a few light years

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.800
across.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.990
So this is multiplied by
another rect function, really.

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:11.300
So the Fourier transform of this
whole thing multiplied by rect

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.550
is something
convolved with a sinc.

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:17.450
So each of these things is
not really a delta function.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:20.038
But it's really a
very narrow sinc,

01:01:20.038 --> 01:01:21.746
which depends on the
size of our grating.

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:22.246
.

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:24.590
So the point George
is making is,

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.920
if you think of it as
a sinc, then it really

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.810
would be letting
through half of it.

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:35.420
I think mathematically, it'd
have to be like that as well.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.010
You get used to
these when you do--

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:42.080
you must remember from solving
partial differential equations,

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.580
when you do the
boundary conditions,

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.750
you always have to do
that sort of thing.

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:48.480
It seems a bit of a cheat, but--

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.160
OK, so this is putting
the numbers in, then.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.180
So this is the three components.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:03.860
These are these root 3
over 2 pi's we had there.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:08.070
And then finally, these
two combined together

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.190
to make a cosine.

01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:13.860
And our final
amplitude of our image

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.370
is going to be a
constant plus of cosine.

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.290
You notice that it's not--

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:21.420
the amplitude of
this is not the same

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.870
as the amplitude of that, of
course, because of the fact

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:28.920
that it was a this
rectangular grating.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:36.550
Yeah, and finally, though,
as I just mentioned briefly

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.230
a little while ago,
what you actually

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:39.910
see is not the amplitude.

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:43.030
What you see is the
intensity, which

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:46.160
is the modulus square
of the amplitude.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.410
So you remember, we
said that we normally

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.170
are going to call the intensity
just the modulus square

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:54.380
of the amplitude.

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:57.400
There perhaps should be
some halves and funny things

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.920
out there if we were
really doing it according

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.520
to the Poynting vector.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.770
But normally, we don't
bother with that.

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:08.150
We just say it's
the modulus square.

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:11.170
So the modulus
square of this, we're

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:17.050
going to get this squared and
twice the product of these two,

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:18.580
and then this one squared.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:22.190
So we get this term
in Cos squared.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:26.570
And then you have to remember
your formulae that you learn

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:33.060
in maths, Cos 2 theta equals 1
minus 2 cosine squared theta,

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.390
which allows us the right
Cos squared theta is

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:38.120
1 plus Cos theta over 2.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:45.370
So this Cos squared, we can
now replace by a constant plus

01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:48.320
a cosine of twice the angle.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.090
And so this is the
constant bit, and this is

01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:56.390
the cosine of twice the angle.

01:03:56.390 --> 01:04:01.210
All right, so that gives a
another harmonic in the image.

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:03.770
So that's something that
people are a bit confused

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.690
by sometimes, first of all.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:08.000
Because we've gone
through a lot of talk

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.420
about how it's only the first
time on it that's gone through.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.990
But actually now, when
we look at the intensity,

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:17.600
we've now got a second
harmonic that's appearing

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.280
in the final intensity.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.130
So note, the second
harmonic term intensity

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:26.800
due to the magnitude
square operation.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.640
This term explains the ringing
in coherent low-pass filtering

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.230
systems.

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:45.660
So the ringing is the wiggles
you get on the sharp edge.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.800
Right, and that's a sketch
of what it looks like.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.990
So it doesn't look quite
like a cosine grating

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:57.100
anymore, because
when you square it,

01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:02.170
the low values get depressed
more than the high values.

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:06.030
So it makes it look
more peaky, like that.

01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.560
OK, so perhaps
we'll start again.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.080
I was just waiting for one
of our people to come back.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.340
Ah, well, there we are.

01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:27.560
Just in time.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:32.960
OK, so yeah, before we carry on,
then, there was a question just

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.140
before the break.

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.570
So we're going to
have a question.

01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:38.540
AUDIENCE: OK, actually,
I have two questions.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.060
The first question regarding
the physical meaning

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:45.610
of the low-pass filter, just
now in the previous slide.

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:47.660
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah,
OK, so the question

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.690
is about the low-pass filter.

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:53.640
So you remember in--

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.380
perhaps I'll draw
something from electronics.

01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:03.140
So you remember from
your hi-fi amplifier.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.890
So this is frequency.

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:11.540
So these are high frequencies
and these are low frequencies.

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:15.260
So this corresponds to
[? ah! ?] And this corresponds

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.260
to [? uh. ?]

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:22.850
And if we multiply this by some
function that looks like that,

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:24.970
this is what we call
a low-pass filter,

01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:27.670
because which we let
through the low frequencies

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:31.870
and we stop the
high frequencies.

01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:33.530
So the same is true here.

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:40.030
So when we say low-pass,
we mean that we

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:44.540
let through the spots which
are close to the axis,

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.642
and stop the ones that
are far from the axis.

01:06:47.642 --> 01:06:48.850
So that's the first question.

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:50.248
Then there's another one.

01:06:50.248 --> 01:06:51.790
AUDIENCE: The second
one is regarding

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:56.080
the Abbe's rule because
Abbe's rule tell us if we can

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.240
[INAUDIBLE] two orders of the
wave, we can form an image.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:05.020
But just [INAUDIBLE] even
with three orders of the wave,

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.530
we still get very [INAUDIBLE]
compared to that original one.

01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.705
So I wanted to check
out what is the reason.

01:07:10.705 --> 01:07:13.210
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Right, OK, so this

01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:18.020
is going back to Abbe's
rule, which I don't know--

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:20.530
I've never really heard
what he said, actually.

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:23.650
But have you got that
in a book or something?

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:26.850
It's probably in Chinese, is it?

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:31.470
But anyway, the Chinese
Abbe came up with this rule

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:33.170
that you must have at least--

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:35.130
well, we gave an
example just now,

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:37.836
didn't we, where you
only had one beam.

01:07:37.836 --> 01:07:42.653
One order got through, and
we didn't get an image,

01:07:42.653 --> 01:07:44.070
because you're
obviously not going

01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:47.310
to get any interference if
you've only got one beam.

01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:53.730
So according to Abbe, you've got
to have two beams interfering

01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:59.000
in order to get some variation
in amplitude in the image.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.730
And so he says at
least two, I guess.

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:10.800
So if you think of these,
you could let throw the--

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.850
last time we had the 0 and
the plus 1 and the minus 1,

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.979
which is three beams.

01:08:16.979 --> 01:08:19.500
And the point that was
made in the question

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.020
was that, although we
got an image, it was

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.069
wasn't a very good image.

01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:28.979
So I think that's
probably right.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:35.850
I guess Abbe's rule is
all to do with resolution

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.229
of an optical system--

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:39.158
the smallest detail you can see.

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:40.950
But it doesn't necessarily
mean that you're

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.080
going to get a good image.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.060
And changing the
relative strengths,

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.420
we're going to see this in
lots of examples now, actually.

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.580
I guess the whole of
the rest of this lecture

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.770
will be about these--

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:57.990
more examples of stopping
beams and so on, and changing

01:08:57.990 --> 01:09:00.390
beams and seeing what
it does to the pattern.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.729
And so very often,
what you'll find,

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:06.779
then, is you get something
which is maybe not a good image

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:09.279
of the original object.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:15.120
But it's an image, which is
much better than nothing.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.300
OK, so does that
answer the question?

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:25.350
OK, so we now looking
at a bandpass filter.

01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:27.720
So going back to what
I was saying here,

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.370
the bandpass filter,
of course, is

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:34.069
something that looks like this.

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:38.300
A bandpass filter stops the
low frequencies and also

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.010
the high frequencies.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:45.920
And so you can see here, the
optical equivalent of this,

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.620
it's now stopping
the zero order,

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:52.260
but allowing the first
orders to get through.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:56.680
And then the later ones
would also not get through.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.240
Oh yeah, that was
another point that George

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.130
mentioned to me during
the break that I

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:03.980
hadn't appreciated fully.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.770
And that is that this
particular example, which

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:12.260
had this duty cycle of
a third, actually, it

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:15.680
turns out that the third
order of this one vanishes.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.010
So I guess the third, the
sixth, the ninth, all these.

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:20.900
And this is just like we said.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:25.620
That for a square wave grating,
all the even orders cancel.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:29.540
So it's all to do with the
zeros of that sinc function.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:36.210
We add sinc of alpha q, where
alpha is the duty cycle.

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:41.600
So for any duty cycle, there
will be particular values

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:48.830
of the particular integers for
the order, which would vanish

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:51.860
in the Fourier transform.

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:56.720
Right, so here, we're
letting through the plus 1

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.710
and the minus 1.

01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:04.510
Did something [INAUDIBLE] there?

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:07.814
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:07.814 --> 01:11:09.230
COLIN SHEPPARD: Ah.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:09.900
Right, yeah.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:15.360
OK, so the amplitude is
going to be a 1 plus cosine.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.940
And intensity, we're going to
get a second harmonic image,

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.235
just like we had with
the previous case.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.590
0 and then now we're going to
go through this in more detail.

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.770
So it's the same
grating as before.

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:33.600
So we haven't got to work
out all that stuff again.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.240
You remember, 1 centimeter
was where the first order was.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:43.870
So we've got this series
of these different grating

01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:45.460
components.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:50.230
And these ones are 0,
as I just described.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.690
The next one wouldn't be 0.

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:55.450
And we're putting this
masking, which is just

01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:56.890
going to let throw these two.

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:08.200
And so mathematically,
we can write mask

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.520
as being the sum
of two rectangles--

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.500
rectangle, another rectangle.

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:22.660
So then it lets through
those two components

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.800
and stops the others.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.350
So we've got these
two delta functions.

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:33.180
And then we just got to do
a Fourier transform again.

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:40.800
Each of the delta functions
produces a plane wave--

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.420
[INAUDIBLE] complex exponential.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.560
We're then going to
add those together.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.660
And we've got to change
the [? interdistance, ?] of

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:59.880
course, and then combine
these two complex exponentials

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.620
to make a cosine.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.320
And then finally, we've
got to square it again

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.610
in order to get the
intensity [? out. ?]

01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:12.410
So notice what we get now.

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:15.506
You see we get
the constant term.

01:13:15.506 --> 01:13:18.040
You see, here, it's just cosine.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.530
There's no constant term anymore
because the constant term

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:21.460
is gone.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:26.270
So because when we square
it, we get Cos squared.

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:29.440
The Cos squared, we go
into double angles again.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.560
We get a constant plus a cosine.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.970
And so you see that actually,
we get an image where

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:40.390
the first harmonic
doesn't appear at all,

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:42.170
but the second harmonic does.

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:47.080
So this comes back to
your question in a way.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:50.050
You end up with getting
an image which is actually

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:51.700
really not like the object.

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:54.730
Because you see that this
has got twice the frequency

01:13:54.730 --> 01:14:01.830
of this, although Abbe says
that you can get an image,

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:04.730
he doesn't say that you
can get a correct image.

01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:08.130
And in this case, you could
be very confused by this.

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:11.490
You could look in your
microscope at something

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:13.800
and you could see this.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.630
And you'd be completely
mistaken about the object that

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:22.140
was actually producing this,
because it's actually twice as

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.610
big as what you expect.

01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:25.110
So--

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:26.360
AUDIENCE: I've got a question.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.740
COLIN SHEPPARD: Oh, yeah.

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.580
You frightened me.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.710
AUDIENCE: If you grab
just the zero order

01:14:31.710 --> 01:14:33.990
and say the first order,
but not the minus 1,

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:36.000
you get the same period
as the original grating?

01:14:39.655 --> 01:14:41.490
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Yeah, I guess so.

01:14:41.490 --> 01:14:42.980
Would that be right, George?

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:47.850
If you take this one and
this one, so you've got--

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:51.230
and then you square it.

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:53.070
You're going to get
1 plus an e to the i.

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:58.920
You're going to-- yeah,
he's working it out.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.945
He's working it out.

01:14:59.945 --> 01:15:01.687
We'll have a race, shall we?

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:08.318
You're going to have a 1
plus e to the [INAUDIBLE] i

01:15:08.318 --> 01:15:09.110
something or other.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:16.290
And then this module is squared.

01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:21.200
And then you can take out an
e to the i something over 2.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.400
You've got the answer?

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:22.900
Yeah.

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:30.790
Something like that.

01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:31.740
So this is cosine.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:34.050
So you're going to end
up with cosine squared.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.200
It's the same as this, isn't it?

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:38.700
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.830
It would just be the phase term.

01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:43.936
No, it can't be, because
it's half as far apart.

01:15:43.936 --> 01:15:45.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.300
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, you
got the first harmonic,

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.260
because it's the
square of half of it.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.010
Yeah.

01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:54.660
OK, so it's double half of it.

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.300
So you do get the
first harmonic, yeah.

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.040
You're quite correct.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.620
But it might work
for this object.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:06.090
But I guess there'd be other
objects, which would also

01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:08.660
produce funny results.

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.960
And of course, as we know--

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.080
well, some of us know.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.040
Most of you won't know.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.930
But for example,
[INAUDIBLE] will

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:22.260
know that if you have a
mask, which is actually

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.660
metric like that, it's
going to have some quite

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.170
interesting properties.

01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:26.922
So I don't know
whether you're going

01:16:26.922 --> 01:16:28.589
to go through these
at some later point.

01:16:28.589 --> 01:16:30.492
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:30.492 --> 01:16:32.160
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Maybe in the exam.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.930
OK, so everyone [INAUDIBLE]
up on asymmetric gratings.

01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:38.705
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:38.705 --> 01:16:42.150
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yes,
single-sideband modulation.

01:16:42.150 --> 01:16:43.115
Yeah.

01:16:43.115 --> 01:16:44.490
And what's the
other word for it?

01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:52.010
What's this, when they
measure the flow of the--

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:53.110
in aerodynamics?

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:55.030
Schlieren.

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:57.990
It's basically Schlieren.

01:16:57.990 --> 01:17:04.660
OK, and now we're looking
at a tilted illumination.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.110
So same sort of system
as the last one,

01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:12.190
but we're now not illuminating
it where the plane wave along

01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:13.780
the axis.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.220
We're going to tilt this.

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:23.230
And so what we find if
we've got a grating,

01:17:23.230 --> 01:17:24.700
and we illuminate
it with a plane

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:30.220
wave, what do we find happens
if we tilt the plane wave?

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.810
Have you come across this--

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:33.930
you did this
earlier on, did you?

01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:35.920
I don't think I was
there for this one.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.320
But actually, all that
happens is it just

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.840
tilts the diffraction pattern.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.400
Very simple.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.270
So you can see
now, the zero order

01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:49.220
is still in this direction.

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:53.860
And all of the other orders
just move [INAUDIBLE]..

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:56.530
They all rotate
through the same angle.

01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:59.560
This is actually only true
if you can think of this

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.930
as being a thin grating.

01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:07.870
And if you go into theory of
volume holograms and things

01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:09.760
like that, then you'll
find that things

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.350
become much more complicated.

01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:14.620
The relative strengths of the
gratings can change and so on.

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:21.220
But this is a thin grating, so
that you can use this property

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:24.250
that you just multiply it
by the transmit transmission

01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:28.280
of the grating, then
that will be the case.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.610
So you can see what
that's going to do.

01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:34.870
All the gratings move up,
which means that they all

01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:38.020
get moved up there as well.

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:42.340
So you see the zero
order grating, which

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:48.250
was appearing down at the
origin, is now tilted upwards

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.360
and appears at this point here.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:55.090
So with this bandpass
filter that we've chosen,

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.370
we now get the
zero order through.

01:18:57.370 --> 01:19:03.010
So we're getting the
0 to through this one.

01:19:03.010 --> 01:19:06.040
And we're getting the minus
2 order through this one.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:19.480
Right, so we illuminate the
grating with an off-axis plane

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:26.410
wave at an angle of 2.865
degrees, which is obviously

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:32.210
very carefully designed, so that
this grating this grating order

01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:36.460
moves through from here to here.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.135
So what happens?

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:48.120
OK, so it's just describing
what I just said.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.810
Yeah, this is just describing
why that happens, then,

01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:53.548
in terms of multiplying the--

01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:00.200
this tilted wave is
just going to have

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:08.070
a complex exponential
phase variation like this.

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.830
So you multiply
that by the grating.

01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:13.680
And then it's just
[INAUDIBLE] this result

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.110
of rotating the thing.

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:26.910
OK, so there are
the grating orders.

01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:31.720
The zero order one is this one.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:37.090
And this is the plus and minus
1 and the plus and minus 2.

01:20:37.090 --> 01:20:40.900
And so we let through those two.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:47.350
So we're now letting
through the zero

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:50.870
order and the minus 2 order.

01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:53.130
So it's a bit like the
one in the question.

01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:59.800
But now it's the minus 2
order, not the minus 1 order.

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.740
So this is going to be another
example where it doesn't give

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:13.670
a very good image of it from
that result. OK, so yeah, let's

01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:15.156
just [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:17.934 --> 01:21:18.950
Here we are.

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:20.610
So it's 1 centimeters.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.000
That magic angle was
designed so that they're all

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.410
shifted by 1 centimeter.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.000
So after passing
through the mask,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.970
we just get those
two components.

01:21:36.970 --> 01:21:39.490
And so these are
the two components.

01:21:44.041 --> 01:21:45.770
Ah, but [INAUDIBLE]
no, it isn't.

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:47.562
Yeah, that's right,
because there's still--

01:21:47.562 --> 01:21:50.590
it's a bit more complicated
than where I was--

01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:52.710
it's tricky, this.

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:57.560
So not only of course that
we let through the zero

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.650
order and the minus 2 order.

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:05.060
But those orders have got
this complex phase shift.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:05.690
Is that right?

01:22:05.690 --> 01:22:09.106
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.270
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah,
exactly, exactly.

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:22.610
Because of the phase,
because of the--

01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:23.480
yeah.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.460
OK, so that's what I'm saying.

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:30.010
Although this is a zero
order and a minus 2 order,

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:32.010
they're actually shifted.

01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:34.910
And so when you do
the Fourier transform,

01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:38.180
they're just as
though they were there

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.920
plus 1 and the minus 1 order.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.380
And that's neat.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:43.130
Very interesting.

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:44.010
AUDIENCE: But with
different amplitudes.

01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:46.135
COLIN SHEPPARD: But with
different amplitudes given

01:22:46.135 --> 01:22:47.690
by these two strengths here.

01:22:51.950 --> 01:23:00.690
And then-- yeah, so then we
have to put the values of u

01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:02.580
in terms of the x.

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:04.860
And then we combine
the two exponentials.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.060
Well, can't do that anymore.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:06.640
Can we?

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.290
Oh yes, we can.

01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:12.250
AUDIENCE: Well, you can,
but [INAUDIBLE] sine and the

01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:14.230
cosine.

01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:16.230
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, exactly.

01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:18.470
So have you actually
done that, then?

01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:20.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:23.330
COLIN SHEPPARD: Right,
so you've got to do

01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:25.553
the modulus square of this.

01:23:25.553 --> 01:23:27.845
So you're going to have this
squared plus this squared.

01:23:27.845 --> 01:23:28.655
AUDIENCE: Plus [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:28.655 --> 01:23:30.530
COLIN SHEPPARD: Oh yeah,
OK, so [INAUDIBLE]..

01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:31.640
Yeah, of course you are.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:36.370
So then twice the
products of these two.

01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:38.402
And-- OK.

01:23:38.402 --> 01:23:41.090
Is that right?

01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:41.590
No, sorry.

01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:42.585
That's not right, is it?

01:23:42.585 --> 01:23:44.585
AUDIENCE: The magnitude
of the first [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:44.585 --> 01:23:47.558
the magnitude of the
second plus [INAUDIBLE]..

01:23:47.558 --> 01:23:49.060
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Yeah, that's right.

01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.790
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah.

01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:54.188
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.120
COLIN SHEPPARD: OK, and
this is what it looks like.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:00.620
Ta-da.

01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:07.090
OK, so the field is
the first harmonic.

01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:09.130
The intensity is
the second harmonic

01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:10.210
because of the squaring.

01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:12.790
And the contrast is 0.7.

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:16.930
Right, so again we end up with
a bad image as it's shifted,

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:19.270
because it's double frequency.

01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:22.060
And also, the contrast
is reduced in this case,

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:26.410
because the strength of the
two beams was not the same.

01:24:26.410 --> 01:24:28.780
This is calculating
here the contrast.

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:33.250
This is the normal definition
of contrast fringes--

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:36.160
the difference over the sum.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.050
And it comes to 0.7062.

01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:43.630
In the previous case, of
course, the contrast was 1.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:51.670
Right, another example--
a new pupil mask

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:56.200
consisting of two holes,
each of diameter 1 centimeter

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.980
and centered further away
from the axis plus or minus

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:04.070
2 centimeters from the
optical axis respectively.

01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:08.350
What is the intensity observed
at the output image plane?

01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:11.320
Right, so at least it's
told us the 2 centimeters.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.880
We know where that is.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.100
We don't have to worry
about working out

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:20.380
what 0.3479 degrees is.

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:24.880
We know that the first
order was at 1 centimeter.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.310
So the second order is
where the aperture is.

01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:32.520
So the second order is
going to get through,

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.940
the plus 2 and the minus 2.

01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:44.940
And did not appear,
then, up there?

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:48.540
Right, so the second harmonic
is going to get through.

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.443
And when you do
the square of that,

01:25:50.443 --> 01:25:52.110
you're going to get
the fourth harmonic.

01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:58.610
So this is going through
the mass of that, then.

01:25:58.610 --> 01:26:02.090
So we've got just
these two components.

01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:06.730
So these have now
got 2 centimeters

01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:09.460
in, rather than 1 centimeter.

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:14.050
So that means that you
get a 2 multiplied in here

01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:16.160
that wasn't there before.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:21.300
So that's where the
second harmonic comes in.

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.820
And then when you do the
square, again, you're

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:26.700
only going to get the
cosine and no constants.

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:31.500
And then you do Cos squared and
change that into double angles,

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.530
or fourth angles, actually.

01:26:34.530 --> 01:26:37.350
And now we're going to
see what it looks like.

01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:42.490
And now, it's even worse
an image of what we wanted.

01:26:42.490 --> 01:26:45.920
So I guess this is maybe
telling us what we shouldn't do,

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.220
rather than what we should do.

01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.610
AUDIENCE: Got another question.

01:26:48.610 --> 01:26:51.010
Is this is still
assuming f1 equals f2?

01:26:51.010 --> 01:26:54.722
And what happens if
f2 is smaller than f1?

01:26:54.722 --> 01:26:56.680
COLIN SHEPPARD: All it
would do, if you changed

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:02.140
the relative values of an
f1 an f2, all it would do

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:06.790
is change the size
of the final image.

01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:09.760
If you think about this system--

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.280
let's go back to one where
it shows that-- there we are.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:25.060
You can see that the relative
distances from the axis only

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.240
depend on this part
of the optical system.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.410
And then after the
pupil mask, we've

01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:34.570
already decided,
then, what orders

01:27:34.570 --> 01:27:36.820
get into the final image.

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:39.370
And then the final part,
all that's going to do

01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:43.150
is just change the relative
size of the final image you see.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.510
Right, now we're going to do
another bit more complicated

01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:00.100
one--

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:02.750
a phase pupil mask.

01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:07.070
And so what this
is shown as is, you

01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:11.300
can see it's got an opaque
part of the screen here.

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:14.690
And then in the
central part, it's

01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:21.560
transparent, but it's got
some sort of structure there--

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:25.160
some diffractive
dielectric element,

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:31.160
which changes the relative
phase of this order compared

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.180
with the other orders.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:39.060
So the question is, what's
that going to do to your image?

01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:41.430
So the rest of the system
is completely the same.

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:48.517
So this is what we are
considering putting in there.

01:28:48.517 --> 01:28:50.350
It doesn't matter what
the thickness of this

01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:53.590
is, because all
that's going to do

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:57.040
is change the relative
phase of all of these.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.638
So it won't affect how
they interfere with each.

01:28:59.638 --> 01:29:01.930
It will just change the phase
of the final image, which

01:29:01.930 --> 01:29:03.580
you don't see anyway.

01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:08.080
But what is important
is this bit here.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:14.530
The thickness of this
s equals 0.25 microns,

01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:20.680
and the wavelength was
half of 0.5 microns.

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.470
So that's lambda by 2.

01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:29.210
So that means it changes
the phase by 180 degrees.

01:29:29.210 --> 01:29:32.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:32.110 --> 01:29:33.661
COLIN SHEPPARD: Ah, n minus 1.

01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:35.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the next slide.

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.465
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, n minus 1.

01:29:37.465 --> 01:29:39.478
So it's not going to do that.

01:29:39.478 --> 01:29:40.020
Take it back.

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:42.054
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:42.054 --> 01:29:44.600
COLIN SHEPPARD:
It's [INAUDIBLE]..

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:51.770
OK, this is known as a phase
pupil mask or a pupil phase

01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:54.285
mask, or a mask pupil phase.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:01.060
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Yeah, that's right.

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.740
So that must be in
the next lecture,

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:04.640
because it's not in this one.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.640
So let's get down to
the real application.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:11.560
OK, so George said that I
would have just failed the exam

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:15.250
because I forgot the minus 1.

01:30:15.250 --> 01:30:19.000
Of course, this light
goes through the glass.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.660
But this light goes through
the glass and then the air.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:26.110
So to work out the
relative phases of these,

01:30:26.110 --> 01:30:31.000
you have to look at the relative
change in the refractive index

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.010
times the optical thickness.

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:41.620
So this is 0.25 microns,
and this is at 0.25 microns

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.420
divided by the wavelength.

01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:48.295
And it's going to be
multiplied by 1.5 minus 1.

01:30:48.295 --> 01:30:50.860
So this is assuming it's glass.

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:57.390
So this means that the
phase change is pi over 2.

01:30:57.390 --> 01:31:00.400
So not pi, but pi over 2.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:08.438
OK, so exactly the same grating.

01:31:08.438 --> 01:31:09.480
These are all the orders.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:18.210
And so you see, first of all,
we get rid of these outer ones.

01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:20.790
We let through just these three.

01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:25.410
But of those, we're
also going to change

01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:30.360
the relative phase of this one
relative to the other, too.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.900
That doesn't matter, of
course, in your sum whether you

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:35.970
change the phase of
this or you change

01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:37.230
the phase of the other two.

01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:40.770
Certainly, the relative phase,
which is the important thing.

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:53.070
OK, so these are the
three conditions, then.

01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:56.410
For the ones that are not
don't get through at all,

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:58.420
the strength of those is zero.

01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:05.150
Then here, we're taking these
ones to be of strength one,

01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:11.630
and this one in the center to
be strength of e to the i phi.

01:32:11.630 --> 01:32:16.790
And we know that
phi is pi over 2.

01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:21.520
So this is e to the i pi
over 2, which is just i.

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.840
Is that right?

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:27.310
Why have we got this i
minus 1 then, George?

01:32:27.310 --> 01:32:32.380
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
[INAUDIBLE] So one way

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:36.970
to write this pupil function
is as a rect that is as big

01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:37.765
as the opening.

01:32:37.765 --> 01:32:39.790
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah, OK.

01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:41.800
Sorry, yeah.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:51.280
So you can think of this as
being the whole thing minus--

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:54.900
well, this on top of
the whole rectangle.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:58.660
Otherwise, you'd have to do this
little rectangle and this bit

01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:02.120
a rectangle and this bit of
rectangle as three things.

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.050
So you could do it either
of those ways, I guess.

01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:07.810
But the way that George
has done it here,

01:33:07.810 --> 01:33:10.060
it's the rectangle, of
the whole [? lot, ?]

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:14.410
it's all of this
minus the central one,

01:33:14.410 --> 01:33:17.140
plus the central one
with the phase change.

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.450
So that's the minus
the one that's

01:33:19.450 --> 01:33:24.740
not there plus the one that is
there where the phase changed.

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.820
And yeah, so now--

01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:32.060
well of course, we still get
all these delta functions.

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:35.600
But now we've got
some i's coming in.

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.100
Sorry?

01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:36.975
AUDIENCE: Just one i.

01:33:36.975 --> 01:33:39.850
COLIN SHEPPARD:
Just one i, yeah.

01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:47.120
And then these two combine
to produce cosine still.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:50.160
I guess if you change the phase
of one relative to the other,

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.900
it'd be more complicated.

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:55.080
But these two produce a cosine.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.110
So we've got an i plus a cosine.

01:33:58.110 --> 01:34:00.980
And then we do the
modulus square of that.

01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:03.210
And the modulus square
of that, of course,

01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:06.590
is you're not going to get a
cross product term are you,

01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:10.860
because these two are
in phase quadrature.

01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:14.527
So when you do the modulus
square, you're only going--

01:34:14.527 --> 01:34:15.110
is that right?

01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.610
Yeah.

01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:17.800
You're going to get this
squared plus this squared.

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:22.590
And this squared, you can
write as these two terms

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:26.090
when you do the double angle.

01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:27.670
And I guess the next
one, we're going

01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:29.390
to see what it looks like.

01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:32.660
Ta-da, this is
what it looks like.

01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:36.650
First harmonic in field,
second harmonic in intensity

01:34:36.650 --> 01:34:38.780
because of the squaring.

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:42.950
And again, the contrast is
now much reduced, actually,

01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:44.930
in this case--

01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:48.160
down to 0.25.

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.455
So I guess this hasn't turned
out to be a very [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:51.455 --> 01:34:52.540
strategy.

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.030
This lecture seems to
be mainly showing you

01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:57.500
what you shouldn't do when
you make your microscope.

01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:59.263
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:59.263 --> 01:35:00.706
COLIN SHEPPARD: [LAUGHS]

01:35:00.706 --> 01:35:03.592
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:35:03.592 --> 01:35:09.590
COLIN SHEPPARD: OK,
so now we're going

01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:11.840
to go on to think
of this in terms

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.660
of what we call a
point spread function

01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:16.490
of the low-pass filter.

01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:19.400
So do you remember, going
back to our analogies

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:24.740
with electronics, we can
think of-- any electronics you

01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:30.140
can either think of
your hi-fi amplifier

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:32.610
as being like a
black box, don't you?

01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:37.090
And you put in something
and you get out something.

01:35:37.090 --> 01:35:39.690
And you can either
think of what happens

01:35:39.690 --> 01:35:45.040
was inside there as being like
an h of t, an impulse response.

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.770
Or you can think of it as
being a frequency response.

01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:54.670
So there are two
different ways of thinking

01:35:54.670 --> 01:35:56.020
about this black box.

01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.240
The same is true in this case.

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.040
So up until now,
we've been thinking

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:04.420
of this in terms of the
frequency response, what

01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:06.990
frequencies get into the image.

01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:09.370
And now we're going to think
of what that means in terms

01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:11.055
of the point spread function.

01:36:11.055 --> 01:36:13.180
We've come across the point
spread function before,

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.890
of course.

01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:20.820
So the point spread
function is basically

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:24.660
the image of a point object.

01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:27.780
And our point objects, we
make by having a screen

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:30.300
with a very small hole in.

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.445
So this, then, is
going to expand.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.200
It reached the lens.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.310
It's going to be
collimated because we

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:43.180
were seeing this on the axis.

01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:50.210
This collimated beam is going
to arrive at our pupil mask.

01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:51.890
Part of this collimated
beam is going

01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:53.500
to go through the aperture.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.700
It's going to get to a lens.

01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.420
It's then going
to be focused down

01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:06.540
and produce a converging wave
to form a spot on the screen.

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:09.110
So this is what we think of as--

01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:12.230
the final spot is going to be
what we call the point spread

01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:14.947
function h of x, y.

01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:24.610
OK, so how do we work out
this point spread function?

01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:28.440
So what we do is, we can
again work through this system

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.450
in terms of Fourier transforms.

01:37:30.450 --> 01:37:32.590
This is a delta function.

01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:35.160
So the Fourier transform
of a delta function

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.020
is just a constant.

01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:42.600
We multiply the constant
by the pupil mask.

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:47.080
And then we've got
another system here,

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:50.070
which does another
Fourier transform.

01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:54.930
So what we're going to get
in the final plane, the image

01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:57.390
of a point object, is
going to be the Fourier

01:37:57.390 --> 01:37:59.235
transform of the pupil mask.

01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:04.710
And yeah, so it
makes the point here

01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:08.520
that we have to be careful, of
course, how we scale things.

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.980
And of course, the
scaling is going

01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:14.898
to depend on the relative
sizes of these f1 and f2

01:38:14.898 --> 01:38:15.690
as well, of course.

01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:25.620
So, example-- if we got
the low pass filter,

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.630
so 0 is in the center.

01:38:27.630 --> 01:38:29.940
It lets through the
low frequencies,

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:33.450
stops the outer frequencies.

01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:37.740
So this is the pupil mask.

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:43.490
What does the point spread
function of that give?

01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:51.530
And so we're assuming that
the input transparency

01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:54.540
is delta x on the axis.

01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:57.460
So this is illuminated on-axis.

01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:02.920
The field after the pupil
mask is just the same

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.670
as the pupil mask.

01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:08.480
And then we Fourier
transform that,

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:11.240
and it's going to give a sinc.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.800
That the Fourier
transform of rect is sinc.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:18.650
And here, we've got the
relative sizes of this

01:39:18.650 --> 01:39:21.590
as well, so that we
know how big it is.

01:39:24.710 --> 01:39:29.000
And so that the amplitude
point spread function, then,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.000
is this Fourier transform
rescaled with this x dashed

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.960
over lambda f.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.280
We replace the u by the
x [INAUDIBLE] lambda f.

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:44.010
And this finally,
then, is our answer.

01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:05.720
Which three times
is it saying there?

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.437
This three, or is that three?

01:40:07.437 --> 01:40:08.520
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:12.300
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah,
OK, because the energy

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.310
has to be conserved
by this thing.

01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:16.780
So you remember,
there's this theorem

01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:18.840
in Fourier transforms
again that says

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:22.560
the area under the
function squared

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.870
is equal to the area under
the Fourier transform squared.

01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:30.470
So it's conservation of energy.

01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:36.670
And so this is the amplitude
point spread function.

01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:40.450
It's sinc, so it goes negative.

01:40:40.450 --> 01:40:43.300
Sinc is sine pi x over pi x.

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.900
So it goes negative.

01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:46.400
So that's why it's plotted here.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.140
This is 0.

01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:58.760
It wiggles up and down
above the 0 [? light. ?]

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:04.100
And so of course, if you looked
at the image of a point object,

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:07.400
you'd see the modulus
square of this.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:12.550
Just like when we looked at
our examples of the grating,

01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:15.860
we finally look at the
actual intensity, rather than

01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:16.910
the amplitude.

01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:19.590
The intensity, of course,
is always positive.

01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:22.010
So you'd actually be looking
at the square of that.

01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:26.380
But if you're trying to think
of this thing as being--

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.670
what we're going to carry
on to say, of course,

01:41:28.670 --> 01:41:33.080
is in Fourier space,
or in Fourier domain,

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.830
the spatial frequencies
of the object

01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:39.340
are multiplied by the mask.

01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:47.570
In terms of real space, you're
going to get a convolution.

01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:49.680
The product becomes
a convolution.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.230
So we're going to convolve our
objects with an amplitude point

01:41:54.230 --> 01:41:56.083
spread function.

01:41:56.083 --> 01:41:58.250
But we have to do it with
the amplitude point spread

01:41:58.250 --> 01:42:01.100
function, find the final
the total amplitude

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:04.460
in the image, and then
the modulus square

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:08.210
to find the final the intensity.

01:42:08.210 --> 01:42:11.090
OK, and this is an example
of the point spread

01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:14.960
function of this phase
filter we looked at.

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:19.610
The pupil mask, this is
the same as we had before.

01:42:19.610 --> 01:42:21.020
So this is its modulus.

01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.280
This is the phase.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.980
And if you calculate the
point spread function of this,

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:28.745
it comes to this.

01:42:28.745 --> 01:42:30.080
This is the modulus.

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.090
This is the phase.

01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:35.810
So you can see that that is why
we got a pretty horrible image.

01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:39.530
It's because it's got a very
nasty point spread function.

01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:41.870
[INAUDIBLE] point spread
function, for a start,

01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:44.460
it's got these very
large side lobes,

01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:46.145
which normally we don't like.

01:42:46.145 --> 01:42:49.070
We normally like to have
our point spread function

01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:54.110
to be nicely narrow and smooth,
and without the big side lobes.

01:42:54.110 --> 01:42:55.610
And then more than
that, it's also

01:42:55.610 --> 01:42:59.015
got these horrible phase
jumps, which I think

01:42:59.015 --> 01:43:02.780
are very likely to produce
a pretty awful image, which

01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:04.890
is probably what we saw.

01:43:04.890 --> 01:43:08.010
So this goes through the
sum of actually doing that.

01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:11.100
So this is the same as
we had before, then--

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.370
the big rectangle minus
the little rectangle

01:43:13.370 --> 01:43:15.140
with the phase.

01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:20.070
And then we've got to do the
Fourier transform of that.

01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:22.850
And so the way we've
done it here, then,

01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:25.940
we just got the sum
of two rectangles.

01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:28.490
Each of them becomes a sinc.

01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:32.960
But you've got this i here
you have to be careful of.

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.510
And then finally, we work
out the modulus square

01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:41.570
of the part of the
point spread function

01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:44.780
and the phase of the point
spread function right so

01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:48.590
this is the modulus square
of the point spread function.

01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:51.170
So these side lobes are
actually quite huge--

01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:55.120
quite big.

01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:06.470
OK, yeah, that's just looking at
the difference between the two,

01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:07.640
then.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:12.690
So if we have our
low-pass filter--

01:44:12.690 --> 01:44:15.650
so this is what I was saying
about these being huge.

01:44:15.650 --> 01:44:20.380
You see the low-pass
filter, these side lobes

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:22.490
are pretty small by comparison.

01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:28.160
I guess you could use some sort
of shaded aperture, or maybe

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:31.670
an aperture with some structure
that would allow you to make

01:44:31.670 --> 01:44:35.870
those side lobes even smaller.

01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:40.300
This is this process that's
sometimes called apodization.

01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:44.410
Apodization means
to cut off the feet.

01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:47.150
I think if George
was giving the talk,

01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:49.100
he'd say something
about the Greek

01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:52.840
for feet being something
to do with pod.

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:53.710
Right, there we are.

01:44:58.690 --> 01:45:02.350
OK, we are over time, really.

01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:03.510
[INAUDIBLE] stop now?

01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:05.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.120
COLIN SHEPPARD: Yeah,
maybe that's a good point.

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.340
I think that's good.

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:11.562
You've got the concept of
the point spread function.

01:45:11.562 --> 01:45:13.770
Now you've got a week to
think about the point spread

01:45:13.770 --> 01:45:14.400
function.

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.460
And then next time,
it will be very clear.

01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:22.500
OK, so any questions
from either side?

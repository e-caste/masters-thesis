NICOLA MARZARI: --for
all our applications

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.820
and for the lab sessions.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.590
I guess I keep using
Albert Einstein.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.580
This is the 100th anniversary of
his sort of famous year, 1905,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.180
so just a little celebration.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.300
One slide of a
reminder of what we

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.790
have seen in the
previous lecture,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.060
we have really developed
the formalism leading

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.730
to the Hartree-Fock equations.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.460
And the Hartree-Fock
equation follow

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.030
from a set of very simple
and very beautiful path.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.010
We have the
Schrodinger equation,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.250
and we have reformulated the
Schrodinger equation in terms

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.060
of the variational principle.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.520
So we have a functional.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.400
And we know that we can
throw into that functional

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.970
any arbitrary wave function,
and it'll give us an expectation

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.560
value of the energy.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.580
And sort of the closer we get
to the true ground state wave

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.760
function, the lower that
energy is going to be.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.560
We are never going to go
below the ground state energy.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.530
And so it's sort of a
very powerful approach

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.380
to try out sorts of
possibilities and solution.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.440
And in particular, sort
of Hartree and Fock

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.470
took this approach.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.170
They wrote sort of the
most general many-body wave

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.180
function that can be written
as a product of single particle

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.260
orbitals.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.140
That was actually the
original Hartree solution.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.570
Wave functions
written as data do not

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.140
satisfy a fundamental symmetry
of interacting fermions.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.000
That is they are
not anti-symmetric.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.230
And so what you do?

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.160
You take this product of
single particle orbitals,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.100
and you sum it with all
the possible permutation,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.590
with all the possible
signs in front,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.740
so that the overall wave
function is anti-symmetric.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.140
And that can be sort
of written compactly

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.680
as what is called as
later determinant here.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.510
And basically, now our unknowns
are the n orbitals phi.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.100
And so we need to determine the
shape of this n single particle

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.180
orbitals.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.980
And we want to
determine them such

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.070
that they minimize
the expectation value

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.380
of the variational principle.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.700
And so that leads basically to
a set of differential equation

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.750
is just functional analysis.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.560
And when you ask yourself
what are the conditions

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.780
that those single
particle orbitals need

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.750
to satisfy in order to minimize
the variational principle,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.390
well, this is it, the
Hartree-Fock equation.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.700
So each single particle
orbital phi of lambda

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.330
need to satisfy basically a
Schrodinger-like equation.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.870
Again, as always, there is
a kinetic energy term here.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.440
There is the interaction
with the external potential

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.810
that is just the
potential of the nuclei.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.400
And then come the
so-called mean field terms.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.230
So the electron lambda
here will interact

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.300
with each and every
other electron

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.390
mu via an electrostatic
interaction.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.100
You see phi star times phi
is the charge density coming

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.510
from the orbital mu.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.350
And the field that the
electron lambda fills

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.080
is the electrostatic
average density.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.280
And in these, we sum
over all the electrons

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.440
including the electron lambda.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.360
So up to now, we have a system
that is self-interacting.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.020
An electron lambda fills the
electrostatic interaction

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.920
with itself.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.930
That, in principle,
is not correct.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.890
But luckily, this next term
that is called the exchange term

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.840
cancels that exactly.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.160
And the exchange term is
the direct consequence

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
of having written the trial
wave function not just

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.860
as a product of a
single particle orbital,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.780
because up to now
we would have sort

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.210
of something closer to
the Hartree equation,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.600
but written as a proper
anti-symmetric wave

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.000
function, summing on all
the permutation with them

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.560
appropriate signs.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.990
And so, basically, we have
Schrodinger-like equation.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.230
A great advantage with respect
to the Hartree equation

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.900
is now the operator doesn't
change depending on the index

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.560
lambda because this sums
if you want to go over all

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.480
the electrons including lambda.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.880
So our only constraint
here is that we

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.440
need to find the n
lowest Eigen state

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.820
of this single
differential equation.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.760
So if we have n
electrons, if you want,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.600
it's not that we have n
different differential

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.840
equation, like it was the
case of the Hartree equation.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.780
But we have an identical
differential equation

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.860
that is written here.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.070
And we need to find the
n lowest energy states.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.090
And those will be our
single-particle orbitals.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.330
In all of this, we have started
from a variational principle.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.320
So it's very easy to go
beyond the Hartree-Fock.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.440
We can say, in large
r variational cluster,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.560
we can add more
Slater determinants

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.350
with sort of different
coefficients.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.760
We can try to construct a
more complex wave function.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.370
And that solution will
become better and better.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.460
Or we can sort of use
the perturbation theory.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.550
And so quantum
chemistry has developed

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.750
a number of techniques that are
post-Hartree-Fock techniques

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.440
that become systematically
more and more accurate.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.230
They are also more
and more expensive.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.650
And that's if you want, the main
limitation of that direction.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.010
What we'll see
today is something,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.050
as they say in Monty Python,
completely different.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.710
And that will be sort of
density functional theory.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.180
That's, if you
want a theory that

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:45.080
starts from a very different set
of hypotheses, the net result

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.280
will be, again, a set of
single-particle equations.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.280
The concept are very
similar actually, formally,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.500
to the Hartree-Fock
equation, but they

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.730
have been derived in a
completely different spirit.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.470
Density functional
theory tends to be

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.890
less expensive than
Hartree-Fock and, overall,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.910
tends to be more accurate.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.510
Especially for solid,
it's much more accurate.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.840
You'll see when we discuss
case studies the Hartree-Fock

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.500
solution for, say,
interacting electron gas

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.320
or in general for
metals tends to make

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.170
them semiconducting
or insulating-like.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.320
So Hartree-Fock then works
very poorly for solids.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.840
And that's why, if you want
density functional theory,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.790
comes from the solid
state community,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.330
while Hartree-Fock that tends
to work very well for atoms

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.390
comes from the quantum
chemistry community.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.600
And all the theory was developed
by Walter Kohn, and coworkers.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.515
So you'll see the
Hohenberg and Kohn

00:06:42.515 --> 00:06:46.460
theorem, the Kohn [INAUDIBLE]
mapping during the '60s.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.700
But I would say it's
only during the '70s

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.700
that people started to
be able to actually solve

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.760
interesting cases using
density functional theory.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.620
And it's really the
beginning of the '80s--

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.660
you'll see some
cases here today--

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.600
in which people started
calculating something that had

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.090
sort of a direct application.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.900
So we'll see the phrase
diagram of silicon

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.060
as a function of
pressure or volume

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.720
and sort of the first principle
prediction of properties

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.160
of solids.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.700
Walter Kohn, for the development
of this eventual theory,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.360
got the Nobel Prize
for chemistry in 1998

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.040
together with John Pople.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.920
That has been the person
that's been fundamental

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.900
in the development
of Hartree-Fock

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.840
and post-Hartree-Fock
approaches in quantum chemistry.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.340
OK.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.150
So let's see sort of what is
the general idea behind density

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.200
functional theory.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.900
And in many ways,
we'll sort of start

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.240
from ideas that
had been developed

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.660
at the end of the '20s and the
beginning of the '30s, what

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.030
is nowadays called the
Thomas-Fermi approach.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.210
And again, the
basic idea here is

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.710
that the wave function of a
many-body interacting problem

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.500
is an object that is
too complex to treat.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.160
And it would be very, very
nice if we could instead try

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.380
to deal with a simple object.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.610
And sort of one of the choices
could be the charge density.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.260
So if you want, Thomas
and Fermi independently

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.600
were asking themselves,
well, could we

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.570
try to solve not
really a Schrodinger

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.180
equation in the
many-body wave function,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.500
but solve something else in
which our only unknown is

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.670
the charge density?

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.650
If you think for a
moment, the charge density

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.350
is one of the sort of
fundamental variables

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.200
in the description of our
interacting electron problem.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.480
And so this was the question.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.830
Can we do something just
with the charge density?

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.620
And so what they
did is writing out

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.780
what we would call a
heuristic function.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:54.050
That is trying to devise a set
of terms that would give us

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.770
the energy of a set of
electrons in a potential

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.880
just as a functional of
their charge density.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.700
And so, by now,
you could sort of

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.640
think that some of
the relevant terms

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.370
will be electron-electron
interactions, electron

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.150
interaction.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.600
And we could write a sort
of electrostatic term,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.570
like the Hartree term in
the Hartree or Hartree-Fock

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.020
equation, that is just a
functional of the charge

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.640
density.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.850
So this is sort of fairly easy.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.840
It's also very easy
to sort of imagine

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.010
what could be the
interaction of the electrons

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.710
with an external potential
through the charge density.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.010
It will be just the integral
of that external potential

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.570
times the charge density.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.950
What becomes really
critical is finding

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.720
a functional that will give
us the quantum kinetic energy.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.610
If you think, in the
Schrodinger equation,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.660
the quantum kinetic energy is
really the second derivative

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.310
of the wave function.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.800
And obtaining from
a charge density

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.400
only some insight
into what could

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.330
be the second derivative of the
wave function is very complex.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.630
If you think for a moment at the
extreme case of a plane wave,

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.860
OK, so a sine and cosine sort
of in space, if you remember,

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.000
the charge density given by
a plane wave is a constant.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.590
We just multiply the
imaginary exponential

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.330
times its complex conjugate.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.230
That gives us a constant.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.250
So all plane waves
lead to a constant,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.550
but obviously the quantum
kinetic energy of a plane wave

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.790
depends on the wavelength
of that plane wave

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.130
because the second
derivative is what counts.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.010
So what I'm trying
to say is that, when

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:51.090
we look at this as a possible
wave function, a function,

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:56.340
say, of r and the charge
density that comes from this

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.710
is going to be a constant,
this wave function

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.630
times this complex conjugate.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.510
But the kinetic
energy of this object

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.590
is going to be
minus 1/2 k square--

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.870
sorry, plus 1/2 k square.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.170
And so there is
really not a good way

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.770
for this extreme case
to correlate its charge

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.330
density to its kinetic energy.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.870
It's an ill-defined problem.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.660
And this is really
the difficulty.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.790
So there isn't really
a good way if you

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:26.010
wanted to extract
the information

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.150
on the second derivative
from just the charge density.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.070
Now, [INAUDIBLE] sort
of this objection,

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:37.620
they tried to find a
reasonable functional, so

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.080
without sort of trying to
get the exact solution,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.210
but try to find a reasonable
function that would give us

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.410
a good estimate to the quantum
kinetic energy starting

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.750
from the charge density.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.000
And the solution to
this problem that

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.280
is something very
important is what

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.550
we could call a local
density approximation.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.850
So the problem here is that we
have a non-homogeneous charge

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.430
density everywhere in space.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.010
And we try to figure
out what could

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:16.260
be the quantum kinetic energy
of this non-homogeneous problem.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.130
And the approximation
that Thomas and Fermi did

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.270
was, well, dividing this
non-homogeneous problem

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.880
in a set of infinitesimal
volume in space.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.210
So it's a bit difficult
to draw, but suppose

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.450
you have the charge
density coming

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.390
from some atom or some molecule.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.070
This is a non-homogeneous
charge density distribution.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.210
Now, what you do is you
divide this in space

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.970
and set a very small
infinitesimal, if you want,

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:48.930
volume.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.400
And inside each volume,
the charge density

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.040
can be approximated
as a constant.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.930
And what Thomas
and Fermi said is,

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:04.170
well, the contribution coming
from this infinitesimal volume,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.790
say, the first one to the
overall quantum kinetic energy

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:14.160
will be given by that volume
times the kinetic energy

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.430
density of the homogeneous
electron gas at that density.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.790
So if, again, we
partition all space,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.720
we could have that the density
in this little cube is 0.5.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.780
Here is 0.6.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.450
Here is 0.7.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.170
Outside, it goes to 0.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.580
But we can actually calculate
in some other way what

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.150
would be the quantum
kinetic energy

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.770
of a homogeneous electron gas.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.430
That's a problem
that we can solve

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.590
if the homogeneous electron
gas is not interacting.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.640
And we can solve it numerically
even if it is interacting.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.300
So we can know what is
the quantum kinetic energy

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.450
of a homogeneous gas
with density 0.5,

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.060
density 0.6, density 0.7.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.250
And so we can also
know what would

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:10.380
be the quantum kinetic energy
per unit of volume of data.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.010
And so we'll say that this
non-homogeneous system in blue

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:18.180
will have an overall quantum
kinetic energy that is given

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.810
really by the integral
across space--

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.280
and it's written here--

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.250
of the quantum kinetic energy
of the homogeneous electron gas

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.170
integrated over space.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.040
And, say, for the
non-interacting electron gas,

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.960
it's actually very easy to do.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.120
So if you have a non-interacting
electron gas at a density rho,

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.860
its quantum kinetic energy
is just the rho to the 2/3

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.470
that then integrated
times the unit volume

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.350
gives us rho to the 5/3.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.180
So by integrating this quantity,
we would get an approximation.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.670
This approximation
is basically exact

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.780
in the limit of our
homogeneous system, obviously.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.140
And it will be
sort of quite good

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.400
in the limit of our
non-homogeneous system that

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.420
has a very slowly
changing charge density.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.300
The more, if you
want, inhomogeneous

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:23.700
your system becomes, the less
accurate this approximation is.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.060
And of course, something
like an atom or a molecule

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.950
is a very inhomogeneous system.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.050
You go with a
charge density that

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:35.610
goes from 0 to very high
volumes close to the core

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.270
of the nuclei.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.740
So this is basically
the overall answer

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.430
for the overall expression
that Thomas and Fermi

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:52.080
postulated for the energy
of an inhomogeneous system.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.330
They were saying,
well, suppose that we

00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:00.090
have a system that has a certain
distribution of charge rho.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:04.290
Without trying to solve the
Schrodinger equation finding

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.860
out the wave function and sort
of go through that the very

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.510
complex many-body route, we
can actually sort of postulate

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.300
that the energy could
be written, again,

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.340
as an electrostatic energy.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.790
You see sort of each
infinitesimal volume

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.880
interacting with each
other infinitesimal volume

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.850
times via 1 over R
electrostatic interaction.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.730
Then we have got an
external potential.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.950
Again, it's usually the
Coulombic field of the nuclei.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.890
And so the interaction
between the electron

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.040
and that external potential
is just trivial given by rho

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.970
times v.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.270
And the difficult term,
the quantum kinetic energy,

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.650
has been calculated with a
local density approximation.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.920
And this is the term that's
not going to be very good,

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.130
again, because it's very
difficult to figure out

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.040
what could be the curvature
of our wave function

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.670
just from the density that
that wave function produces.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.570
But anyhow, this is a very
simple expression to deal with.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.020
So for any external
potential v, we

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.000
can try to find out the rho
that minimizes this expression.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.915
And this will be our
Thomas-Fermi solution.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.810
There are obviously
a number of problems.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.910
I'll show you in a
moment an example of what

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.780
the Thomas-Fermi solution
would give to an atom.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.610
First of all, I
mean, there is really

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.140
no theoretical basis to this.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.790
It's what we call a
heuristic derivation.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.690
Thomas and Fermi
just wrote out what

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.900
could be a reasonable
energy functional,

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.220
and then tried to sort of see
what results it would give.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.940
But there hasn't been any
kind of formal derivation

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.050
of that functional.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.740
It's not like the Hartree-Fock
equation that sort of derive

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.820
just with some analysis from
the variational principle.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.850
Another problem is that,
again, it doesn't really

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:08.010
sort of introduce the concept
of anti-symmetry that fermions

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.160
need to have, the fact that the
many-body wave function needs

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.430
to be anti-symmetric
upon exchange.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.910
But you know, there is
no conceptual problem

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:23.580
in adding an exchange energy
to the previous functional.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.520
Using the same
concept, the same idea

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.610
of local density
approximation, suppose that we

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.280
want to add an exchange term.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.380
Well, we could look at what
is the exchange energy coming

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.840
from the Hartree-Fock
equation, say,

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.690
for a homogeneous electron gas.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.040
And that gives us
rho to the 1/3 term.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.240
And that's basically the
exchange energy density.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.090
And so for an
inhomogeneous system,

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.240
we are going to sort of
approximate its overall

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:03.090
exchange energy just by taking
the integral of that energy

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:08.250
density that is 1/3 times
the sort of local value

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.570
of the charge density.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.640
And so we have a rho to the 4/3.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.610
And so, again, it's a local
density approximation.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:22.860
The great consequence of
having this energy functional

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.080
that depends only
on r is that it

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.260
is absolutely inexpensive
from the computational point

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:28.890
of view.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.830
The only variable that we
need to be concerned with

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.400
is just the a scalar as a
function of three coordinates.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.120
That is the density
as a function of rho.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.390
And it's what we call a
linear scaling system.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.360
If you double the
size of your system,

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.380
the computational complexity
just becomes double.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.510
So it has a lot of
very good things,

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.820
but it's got a
fundamental defect.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.090
Because of that approximation
in the kinetic energy,

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:02.280
it actually does a very
poor job in describing

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.800
a non-homogeneous system.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.510
So it would work reasonably
well for something like a metal.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.570
Suppose that you want
to describe sodium,

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.360
or suppose you want
to describe aluminum.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:21.030
Those are system in which
the valence electron produce

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.730
a charge density that
is very homogeneous.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.880
So a Thomas-Fermi approach
could actually work well.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.820
And it's actually been used
even very recently sort

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.060
of quite successfully
to describe problems

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.930
like the surfaces of lithium,
the surfaces of aluminum.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:41.280
What happens, say, when
these simple metals melt?

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.110
What happens to the
sort of formation

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.850
of defects in aluminum?

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.890
So there are a
number of successes.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.070
But sort of clear example
of what goes wrong

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.130
is, say, if we study an
inhomogeneous systems

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.090
like the argon atom.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.340
And again, if we think at the
charge density of the argon

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.640
atom as a function, say,
of the radial distance

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.650
from the center
from the nucleus,

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.490
well, it will look
something like this.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.280
We have first 1s, and then we
have the 2s, and the 2p shells.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.310
This is somewhat
a poor depiction

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.750
of that charge density.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.870
If we try to solve
the argon atom

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.110
with a Thomas-Fermi
approach, all these sort

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:28.740
of fine structure of the
core shells in the atoms

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.690
is completely washed out.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.410
OK.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.980
So it gives you a reasonable
approximation and sort

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.740
of an appropriate decay
of the charge density

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.130
as we move far away, but
a lot of those details

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.330
have completely disappeared.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.340
And for this reason really
the Thomas-Fermi approach

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.310
wasn't developed
beyond the '30s apart

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.980
from some of these
recent applications

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.890
for the very specific
case of solids

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.340
that have a very
homogeneous charge density.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.290
The reason why we
describe it here

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.240
is that because,
in many ways, it's

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.720
the grandfather
of the ideas that

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.170
were developed in the '60s
in density functional theory

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.290
and, in particular, the
idea that for a moment

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.680
that we should focus not
on the wave function,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:22.830
but on the charge density of the
system as the key ingredient.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.860
The great difference between
the Thomas-Fermi approach

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.310
and density functional theory is
that density functional theory

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.810
actually is a theory.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.810
It starts with some
theorems that are proven.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.700
And then it shows what are
the form of the equations

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.300
that, say, a charge density
need to satisfy in order

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.560
to solve exactly the problem.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.890
So in many way, density
functional theory

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.490
is, in principle at
least, an exact theory.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.900
It's sort of writes out what
are the equation that the charge

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.850
density needs to satisfy.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.670
And those are absolutely
equivalent to a Schrodinger

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.860
equation for the wave function.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.160
There are some difficulties.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.900
And this is what we are going
to sort of go into right now.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.250
But let me first give you
the conceptual framework

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:15.300
of density functional theory
and how it was derived.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.730
And as usual, we start from
the Schrodinger equation.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.440
OK.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.580
So we start from the idea
that, in quantum mechanics,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.940
for any given
external potential,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.320
you have a well-defined
differential equation.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:30.900
OK.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.120
It's sort of very complex.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.780
It describes a
many-body wave function.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:40.110
So in most practical cases, we
might not be able to solve it,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.480
but everything is well-defined.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.370
You have an external potential.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.230
You have the
differential equation

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.810
that the many-body wave
function needs to satisfy.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.910
And so, in principle,
you have the solution.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.270
And so in that sense, sort
of the first statement

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.530
here is summarized.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.970
For a given external potential
and knowing how many electrons

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.540
are going to fill
this potential,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.770
our quantum problem is
formally completely defined.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.110
In principle, the
solution exists unique.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:14.610
We might not be able to
calculate it, but it exists.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.270
And once we know the many-body
wave function, that solution,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:22.980
we know everything about
our quantum system.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.700
OK.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.960
So this is, if you want, the
trivial part of the conclusion.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.110
That is, given an
external potential,

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:35.400
we find, by the Schrodinger
equation, the wave function.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.000
The wave function determine all
the properties of our system

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.600
and, in particular, determine
the ground state charge

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.780
density.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.710
So there is a
unique pathway that

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.560
starts from the
external potential

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.530
and leads us to the charge
density, the ground state

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.550
charge density.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.640
Once you have defined
the potential,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.090
you, in principle,
have uniquely defined

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:04.180
what is the ground state's
charge density of your system.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.860
And so in that sense, we say
that the ground state charge

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.250
density, the ground state
energy, and all the properties

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.670
of our system are,
in some complex way,

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.330
a functional of our
external potential

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.070
and the number of electrons.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.500
Functional, again,
can be anything.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.200
And in this case, it goes
through the Schrodinger

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.180
equation, nothing sort
of complex at this point.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:34.860
The sort of remarkable result
that no one had sort of figured

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:41.490
out between 1964 and 1965
is that the opposite is also

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.020
true and is not trivial at all.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.740
So what Hohenberg and Kohn
stated first, actually,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:53.310
in 1964, was this, that
the ground state charge

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:58.710
density is a
fundamental quantity,

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.860
as fundamental as the
external potential.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.020
And in particular, not only
the external potential,

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:11.460
the terms uniquely the
ground state's charge density

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.510
of your system, but also
the vice versa is true.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:20.250
That is, given a ground
state charge density,

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.760
in principle, one
can prove that there

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:29.730
is a unique external potential
for which that ground state's

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.270
charge density is the
ground state solution

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.470
for that external potential.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.160
So if you have the
external potential,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.940
conceptually it's trivial to
go through the Schrodinger

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.120
equation and its solution
to the charge density.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.760
What Hohenberg and
Kohn are telling us--

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.060
and I'll just show you a sketch
of the proof in a moment--

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.250
is that in principle, if someone
is giving you a chance density

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.770
and is telling you
this charge density

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.350
is the ground state's
charge density

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.290
of a number of
electrons and electrons

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.000
in an external
potential, in principle,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.220
what is that external potential
is an information that

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.510
is completely contained
into the charged density.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.300
And it's not contained
in a trivial way.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.220
It's not that you can look at
the ground state charge density

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.220
and guess what the
external potentially is.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.910
And that's where all the
complexity of practical densely

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.680
functional theory comes.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.050
But from the conceptual and
mathematical point of view,

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.950
these two quantities are
absolutely equivalent.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.190
From one, you get the
other and vice versa.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:45.370
And this sort of vice
versa was not trivial.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.920
And that is sort of
what is contained

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.120
in the so-called first
Hohenberg and Kohn problem.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.220
I won't go through
the derivation.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.540
It's actually very simple.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.420
I've printed it here in case
you sort of want to read it.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.870
But it's basically is a
derivation ad absurdum.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.730
What they are saying
there is that,

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:08.200
if that external
potential were not unique,

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.440
if there were two
external potential that

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.640
were different and would give
the same ground state energy,

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.070
we would get to absurdum.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.750
So typical mathematical
demonstration,

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.860
we suppose that there are two
different external potential

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.650
that give the same
ground states as density

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.410
and we show that we arrive
to a conclusion that

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.710
doesn't make sense.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.630
So there can be only a
single external potential.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.800
And that's the proof.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.330
And again, it wasn't trivial.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.030
I mean, if you want, this
is a very basic statement.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.450
But it took 40 years
to be formulated.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.500
And it's actually not
true in other cases

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.370
that to first glance
look very similar.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:56.210
Suppose that for a moment we
want to discuss excited states.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:58.480
You could say, well, if
I have a charge density

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.840
and I say this is the
charge density of an excited

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.600
electronic state,
maybe I could also

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.720
recover the potential
that has generated there.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.160
And that's not true, actually.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.080
So there are sort
of a number of cases

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.640
in which this is not true.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.360
But for this fundamental sort
of relation between the charge

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.090
density of the ground state
and the external potential,

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.420
this is true.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:24.250
So we have sort of moved
away now our attention.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.440
It's not any more
the many-body wave

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.910
function that we want to focus,
but is the charge density.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:34.060
The charge density is as
much a fundamental variable

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:34.960
of our problem.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.470
It's not a derived variable.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.740
It's not something that
comes from the wave function,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.282
but is something
that we can actually

00:29:40.282 --> 00:29:44.050
focus all our attention into.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:49.750
And now, we need to find the
equivalent of the Schrodinger

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.900
equation for the
charged density.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.600
This is what Schrodinger had
done in the '20s, in 1925.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.500
He said, this is the equation
that quantum objects satisfy.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.110
And I'll call it the
Schrodinger equation.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.110
Now, Hohenberg
and Kohn has shown

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.920
that we don't need to think
in terms of the wave function.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.170
We can think in terms
of the charge density

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.930
as being the fundamental
descriptor of our quantum

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:14.710
system.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:15.640
What is left?

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.220
They need to show me that
there is an equivalent

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.570
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:24.700
That is we can write a
density equation that

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.540
is sort of what will give me
the ground state and sort of all

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.230
the properties of the system.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:35.590
And that's really the second
Hohenberg and Kohn theorem.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:40.960
That is really writing
out the equivalent concept

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.110
of the Schrodinger equation
for the charge density.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:47.320
And now, sort of, it
becomes fairly conceptual.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.100
OK.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.010
So this is the procedure.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.300
And all of this in
the next few slides

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.130
is still a conceptual procedure.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:03.280
It will describe objects that
are well-defined in principle,

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.560
that are conceptually
well-defined,

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.220
but we still don't
have a clue on what

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.200
they look like in practice.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:15.370
And all the sort of density
functional application

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.200
goes through a
procedure that we'll

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.870
see later on that is the
sort of [INAUDIBLE] mapping

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:23.950
that gives a hint of what
these objects look like.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.770
But up to now, we are
going to introduce objects

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.380
that are well-defined
in principle,

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.710
but we don't know
how they look like.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.240
And so that's why somehow
density functional theory

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.180
is a much less intuitive
theory than something

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.750
like Hartree-Fock.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.250
OK.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.830
So this is going towards the
second Hohenberg and Kohn

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.840
theorem, defining the
fundamental equation

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.740
for the charge density.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.000
And this is the step.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.190
For any charge density
rho, so someone gives you,

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.000
someone draws you, an
arbitrary charge density.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.160
Well, we know that there
is an external potential

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.640
of which that charge
density is the ground state.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.290
We don't know what
it is, honestly,

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:16.450
but we have proven that there
is a unique external potential.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.320
OK.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.400
So because there is a
unique external potential,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.540
there is a many-body
Schrodinger equation

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.790
with that potential in there.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.480
And there is a
wave function that

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.700
is going to be the
ground state wave

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.220
function of that many-body
Schrodinger equation.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:43.930
So given a certain rho, we
know that an external potential

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.040
exists.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.230
And it's unique.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.630
It determines a
Schrodinger equation.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.575
And that Schrodinger equation
determines our ground state

00:32:53.575 --> 00:32:57.130
wave function that we call psi.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:03.520
So what we are saying is that,
given a rho, in principle

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.590
that psi, the ground state wave
function of the Schrodinger

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.660
equation in the
external potential

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.610
that is uniquely
defined by the rho,

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.010
is also a well-defined object.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.520
Again, we don't know what it
is, but it is well-defined.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.640
And because it's a
well-defined object,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.510
we can calculate the
expectation value

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:31.750
of that well-defined object
of the quantum kinetic energy

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:36.670
minus 1/2 sum over all i
of the second derivatives

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:40.870
and the electron-electron
interaction, just the 1

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:44.080
over ri minus rj term.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:50.080
So again, this term is, in
principle, well-defined.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.050
And we call this term the
universal density functional.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:34:02.380
That is for any given
arbitrary rho, i, in principle,

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.970
can define a number that
is this number here.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.560
I have the rho.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.429
In principle, from the rho, I
have the external potential.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.730
From the external potential, I
have the Schrodinger equation.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:20.139
In principle, I'm able to solve
that Schrodinger equation found

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.500
in principle the many-body
ground state wave function.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.880
That will be psi.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.540
And I can calculate
the expectation value

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.139
of psi of the quantum
kinetic energy

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:35.739
and of the electron-electron
interaction term,

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.400
all well-defined.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.810
We have really no clue on how
to calculate because we can't

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.429
really do in practice
any of the steps,

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:49.880
but this universal function of
the density is well-defined.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.989
So with this
universal functional

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:59.350
that is now well-defined,
we can write out something.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:08.580
We can write to an energy for
any given external potential

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.820
and for any given
charge density.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.700
And we write it as this.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.560
So for any given
charge density, there

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:25.530
will be a well-defined number
that is this universal density

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.960
functional of beta rho prime.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.520
And then we add
another term that

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:37.020
is just trivially the
integral of this v,

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:42.600
this external potential, times
the charge density rho prime.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.920
So again, this new
expression that we written

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.960
is well-defined.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.120
For any rho prime and for
any external potential,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.120
we can calculate
trivially this term.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.770
And in principle, we
know what this number is.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:08.400
And this is, if you want,
1964, 1965, the reformulation

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.110
of quantum mechanics.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.870
Because, now,
Hohenberg and Kohn are

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:17.520
able to prove that there
is a variational principle.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.700
That is, for this
expression written here,

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.090
for this functional
of rho prime,

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:29.430
we can prove that
for any rho prime

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:34.980
that we can throw in the
overall numerical value

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.650
of this expression
is always going

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:46.110
to be either greater or equal
to the ground state energy

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:49.300
that we would obtain from
the Schrodinger equation

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.910
in the presence of this
external potential.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:56.380
So now, we have a well-defined
density functional.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.350
So if you have an
external potential,

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:04.110
the z over r of your atom,
you can try out now not

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.480
wave functions that
are very difficult,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.140
but you can try
out charge density.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.900
And the charged
density that gives you

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.410
the lowest expectation
value, the lowest

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.405
value for this functional, will
be the ground state, the charge

00:37:19.405 --> 00:37:19.905
density.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.530
Small problem, we
have no clue what

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:29.700
this looks like as a
function of rho prime.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:35.170
But if we knew, we would have
a wonderfully simple approach

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.040
to quantum mechanics.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.960
Now, we don't need to deal
with the many-body complexity.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:47.630
We just minimize this expression
as a function of rho prime.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.720
And again, it's
sort of fairly easy

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.808
to prove this
variational principle.

00:37:52.808 --> 00:37:54.100
But one needs probably to sit--

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.390
I've given you some reading.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.790
So you're welcome, if you are
really interested in this,

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.610
to go back and read the first
Hohenberg and Kohn theorem

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.460
and read the second
Hohenberg and Kohn theorem.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.065
But in many ways, the proof
of this second Hohenberg

00:38:08.065 --> 00:38:11.140
and Kohn theorem
can be done again

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.210
through the
variational principle.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.960
That is, if we have
a certain rho prime,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.670
well, that, again, uniquely
determines the ground state

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:22.690
wave function.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.920
Rho prime will determine
an external potential

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.650
that, in principle, is
different from this.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:33.160
But rho prime will determine
an external potential

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.170
and will determine
our wave function

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.750
that is the solution of the
many-body Schrodinger equation.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:45.010
And if we take the expectation
value of our Hamiltonian

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.410
with this external
potential in this,

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:51.100
but evaluated on the
wave function of c prime

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.890
that comes from this
charge density rho prime,

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.150
well, we can show that
this expectation value here

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.470
is just identical to functional
that I have just written.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.630
And for the
variational principle,

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:08.380
then it needs to be
greater or equal than E0.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.620
I won't sort of dwell into that.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.600
And again, you can look at the
sort of detailed description

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.480
and in sort of some of the
many references that I've given

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.850
or that I've also
posted on the website.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:21.970
But what is
conceptually important

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.530
is that we have a new equation.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:25.030
OK.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.860
So 1964, '65, quantum
mechanics turned around.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.250
We don't have to think at
many-body wave functions.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:36.490
We can think just
at charge density.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:42.820
And all would be well
apart from this detail,

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:48.010
that we don't know what
that functional f of rho is.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.560
And so we have a
conceptual approach,

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.360
but we don't have a
practical approach

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.640
to solve the density functional
reformulation of quantum

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.700
mechanics.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.540
And this is, if you
wanted, true to this day.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:07.090
We don't know what is the
exact form of f of rho.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:11.620
If we knew it, sort
of most of our sort

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.170
of quantum mechanical
computational problems

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.460
would be trivially solved.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.840
Because solving that variational
principle in the charge density

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.070
would be most likely
a trivial thing to do.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.850
The issue is that not
only we don't know,

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:31.240
but we have understood a
lot of what that exchange

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.960
correlation-- of what that
universal density functional

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.890
is.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.500
And it's very complex.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:46.150
So it's unlikely that there is
a simple analytical expression

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:49.750
of it as a function of
the charge density only.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.950
But, you know, the other
great piece of, if you want,

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.170
quantum engineering
by Walter Kohn

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.950
was finding out a very
good approximation

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.930
to that density functional.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.210
We don't know what
the exact one is.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.790
But now, what they
are doing is, well,

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:12.190
finding out one that is going
to be very, very closely

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.780
similar to the exact one.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.040
And so they are going to throw
in some physical intuition

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.530
to this problem that
up to now, if you want,

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:23.860
has been a mathematical problem.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.480
It's another layer of
complexity in this discussion,

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.120
so I hope I'm not losing you.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.240
But sort of what
Walter Kohn did--

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.750
I think he had a young postdoc
arriving from Cambridge.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:39.562
Lu Sham had just done his PhD
in England and came there.

00:41:39.562 --> 00:41:41.020
And sort of, you
know, he told him,

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.570
I have this new
variational principle.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:48.580
Let's see what we can do to make
it into a practical solution.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:52.270
I think they were in Santa
Barbara, in San Diego probably,

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.590
at that time.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.400
OK.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.480
So this is what they
are going to do.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.520
Remember, sort of,
what is the problem.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:07.510
We need to figure out what
is a reasonable approximation

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:10.310
to this functional here.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:13.270
So what they say
is, well, suppose

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:17.060
that someone has given
us this charge density.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:20.320
So we need, in
principle, to find out

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.260
what would be the many-body
wave function that

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.100
is solution of this external
potential that corresponds

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.810
to this charge density.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:31.670
This is going to
be very complex.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:38.770
Let's invent a problem
in which electrons do not

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:41.020
interact between each other.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:41.860
OK.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.840
So electrons-- so
that's the sort

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.840
of main problem in the
Schrodinger equation,

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.720
that electrons interacting
with each other

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.710
introduce the two-body
electrostatic repulsion

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.610
in the Schrodinger equation.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.310
And that's what
makes it difficult.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.710
Well, what Kohn and
Sham say is let's

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.030
for a moment suppose that
there is a system of electrons

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.020
that don't interact.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.410
So the only thing that those
so-called Kohn and Sham

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:13.000
electrons fill is the
external potential.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.990
OK.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:17.920
So those Kohn and Sham
electrons will solve,

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.110
will satisfy, a Schrodinger
equation that is much simpler.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:26.260
Because there is no
electron-electron interaction.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.770
Those Kohn and Sham electron,
the only thing that they fill

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:33.130
is a new potential.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:36.620
And they will have their
own quantum kinetic energy.

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:45.040
So what they are saying is, for
any given charge density rho,

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.930
there is going to be
a non-interacting set

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:56.440
of electrons who's ground
state charge density is

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.750
identical to rho.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.260
So we have said, if we
have a charge density rho,

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.190
you can all go through, find
out the external potential that

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.260
comes from rho, the
Schrodinger equation,

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.340
the many-body interacting
electrons solution.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.960
But now, what we
are going to say

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:20.080
is we can also think at a system
of non-interacting electrons.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.490
And we want those
non-interacting electrons

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:31.450
to fill a potential that is
such that their ground state is

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:34.090
going to give us a
charge density that

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:38.050
is identical to the charge
density I'm dealing with.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:38.740
OK.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.710
And we call that
external potential

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.810
the Kohn-Sham potential.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:44.590
OK.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:48.490
So now, for a
charge density, you

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:51.010
don't only have to think
at all the complexity

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.230
that I've discussed up to now.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.650
But you have also to think
that, for a charge density,

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.750
there is going to be
this set of Kohn and Sham

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.310
known interacting electrons.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.790
And there is going to
be a potential that

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:07.030
is called the Kohn and
Sham potential that is such

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.480
that the ground state
of the Schrodinger

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.820
equation for non-interacting
electron, that

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.497
is without electron-electron
interaction, in that Kohn

00:45:15.497 --> 00:45:19.240
and Sham potential will give
us a wave function and a ground

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:24.010
state that leads to a charge
density identical to the charge

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:27.250
density I'm sort
of dealing with.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:27.910
OK.

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.750
What do we do with this?

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:35.980
Well, at this stage, there is
a sort of great simplification

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.040
that, for the
Schrodinger equation

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:43.330
of non-interacting
electron, we actually know

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.500
what is the exact solution.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.950
So it's actually
very simple to solve

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:52.630
a Schrodinger equation in which
the electrons do not interact.

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:56.320
Because, now, this
later determinant

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.720
is actually the exact solution.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.530
So if you have a set of
non-interacting electrons,

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:05.020
you don't have the
electron-electron term

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.380
in that Schrodinger equation,
this later determinant is not

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.410
only a good approximation,
but it's actually

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:14.650
the exact solution.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:18.670
So for this non-interactive
set of electrons,

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.970
we can solve everything exactly.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:25.030
And in particular, we
can calculate, say,

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:28.090
what is the kinetic
energy of this set

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.880
of non-interacting electrons.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.810
OK.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:39.070
So now, we can sort of have
a somehow pseudo-physical way

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:43.510
of decompose this
mysterious density

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:48.010
functional into different terms.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:50.800
So what we are actually
doing via the Kohn and Sham

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:56.440
mapping is extracting from
here terms that are very large

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.430
and that we know how to write,
we know how to calculate.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:07.060
And then, hopefully, once we
have extracted all these terms

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:10.960
that we know how to define,
we remain with something

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.200
that is very small
and that we'll

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.430
find another numerical
approximation for it.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:22.410
So Kohn and Sham say, well, we
have this well-defined density

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:23.400
functional.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.240
We extract two terms
that are well-defined.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.320
And these two terms that's
sort of the great achievement

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:35.160
actually contain most of
the physics of our problem.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.710
And the sort of small
term that is left over,

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.260
we are going to approximate
in some simple way.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.500
And actually, the
approximation that they found

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.775
worked very well.

00:47:44.775 --> 00:47:46.650
And that's why some of
this functional theory

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:48.540
became a practical theory.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.410
And so in this sort
of density functional,

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:57.300
the first physical large
term that they extract

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.510
is the quantum
kinetic energy that we

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.720
call Ts not of the real system.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.790
Because, again, even
if it's well-defined,

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:09.220
we don't know how to do that.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:14.130
But what they were able to write
is the quantum kinetic energy

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:18.250
of this non-interacting problem.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.490
So for a given
charge density, there

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:24.540
is this set of Kohn and Sham
non-interacting electrons

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:30.060
that lives in a potential, such
that they have the same ground

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.650
state charge density.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:33.900
And their kinetic
energy is trivial

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.480
because it's going to be
just the kinetic energy

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.870
of this later determinant, just
the sum of a single particle

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:40.650
term.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.870
So for a charged
density now, there

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:46.680
is a well-defined
quantum kinetic energy

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.140
that is not the true quantum
kinetic energy of the system,

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.080
but is the quantum
kinetic energy

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.890
of this sort of
associated system

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:57.900
of non-interacting electrons.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.720
But this term is
now well-defined.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.590
They say, well, let's
extract another term that

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:08.880
is well-defined that is just
a Hartree electrostatic energy

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.920
of a charge density
distribution.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:11.670
OK.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:14.880
So if we look at the charge
density distribution in which

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.950
each infinitesimal
volume interacts

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.320
with each other
infinitesimal volume

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.180
with an electrostatic
interaction,

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.430
that's going to be the term.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:27.960
And you know, what we
are left is now something

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.560
that they call the
exchange correlation term.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.430
That is everything else.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.230
OK.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:38.010
So F, in principle,
is an exact quantity.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:43.290
We are now able to define our
quantum kinetic energy term.

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:47.280
That is an exact quantity,
but is not really

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.710
the quantum kinetic
energy of the true system.

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.020
But we sort of
say, you know, this

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.050
is going to be equal
to a well-defined term

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:58.650
plus another well-defined
term plus a third term

00:49:58.650 --> 00:49:59.730
that we don't know.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.980
So we have sort of
decomposed a quantity

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:06.780
that we have no clue what it is
into three terms of which two

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.430
terms are well-defined.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:12.840
And all our cluelessness is
contained in the third term.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.650
And we call this third term
the exchange correlation,

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:19.320
but the sort of
physical advantage

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.200
of having done this
is that it turns out

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:26.850
that these two terms capture
a lot of the complexity

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:28.230
of your problem.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:31.810
And this term tends
to be fairly small.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:32.580
OK.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.680
So that's all, actually.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:37.770
That's why it works very
well because somehow they

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:42.430
manage to capture the
complexity of our system.

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:53.470
And so once that exchange
correlation term is defined

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:59.370
and it's approximated in some
way that we'll see in a moment,

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:04.950
our problem is now
well-defined because we really

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.900
have a variational principle.

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.780
Remember, the universal
density functional

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.870
plus the external
potential plus the charge

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.330
density in the field of
the external potential

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.750
minimizes the sort of
new variational principle

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:21.450
that comes from the
Hohenberg and Kohn theorem.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:24.120
And so we can write it,
our variational principle.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.320
That is this quantity
with the constraint

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.020
that the number of
electrons should be

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.420
equal to n should be minimum.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.350
And as usual, when you sort of
write a variational principle,

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:40.680
you are saying that sort of the
differential of that quantity

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.330
needs to be equal to 0.

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:45.120
Or if you want, I mean,
this is a generic term.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.360
You have a set of what are
called Euler-Lagrange equation,

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.050
basically.

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:51.120
That is nothing else than
differential analysis.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.030
That is you are
asking yourself, what

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:56.370
are going to be
the conditions that

00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:59.730
need to be satisfied
by the charge density

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:03.270
in order to satisfy the
variational principle?

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:06.030
There is always this sort
of 1 to 1 correspondence.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.710
You have a
variational principle.

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:09.840
It gives you
differential equation.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.550
Or you have
differential equation.

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:14.010
You can rewrite them in
a variational principle.

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.230
We have seen that for
the Schrodinger equation.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:21.660
And we see this, in particular,
now explicitly for the Kohn

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.100
and Sham orbital.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:28.230
So I'll actually go directly
to the explicit expression

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:31.290
of the Kohn and Sham orbitals.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:33.750
Again, remember that
what we have done

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:38.820
is we have defined a
variational principle that

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.970
acts on a universal
density functional

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:46.320
F plus the charge density
and the external potential.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.780
And we have decomposed,
we have extracted,

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.660
from this universal
functional sort of terms

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.770
that are large and physical.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:57.720
And we have sort of pushed
all the many-body complexity

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.050
of the problem in something
that we call the exchange

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:02.760
correlation functional.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.680
That is, again, a functional
of the charge density.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.580
We don't know yet what that
function of the charge density

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.120
is.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.940
But luckily, it's
going to be small.

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.360
So in a moment,
we'll approximate it.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:19.050
And then we ask ourselves,
what are the differential

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:22.620
equations that derive from
this variational principle?

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.540
Well, in principle, I
had written them here.

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.470
OK.

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.500
We just need to take the
variation with respect

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.380
to the charge density
and imposing the Lagrange

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.180
multiplication constraint.

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:38.670
And so this would be basically
that the charge density needs

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:42.780
to satisfy this set of
equation, the sort of functional

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.510
derivative of this
non-interacting quantum

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:50.100
kinetic energy plus a
number of terms that

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.590
really contain the
external potential,

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.940
the Hartree interaction.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.100
And the exchange
correlation need

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.770
to be equal to the
Lagrange multiplier that

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:03.870
fixes the number of electrons.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.940
We are not able to calculate
this functional derivative

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.940
because, remember, the
quantum kinetic energy

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.340
of the non-interacting
system is again

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.823
written as a later determinant.

00:54:16.823 --> 00:54:18.240
And so there is
sort of, you know,

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.730
this type of back in which, even
if we had written everything

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.970
in terms of a charge
density, we are not

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:32.040
able to explicitly
calculate not only

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:36.450
the derivative of the true
interacting electron's

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:38.190
kinetic energy with
respect to rho,

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.680
but we are not even able
to calculate the functional

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.590
derivative of the
non-interacting kinetic energy

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:44.890
with respect to rho.

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:49.530
But what we are able is actually
to calculate the derivative

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:53.640
of that non-interacting
kinetic energy with respect

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:57.940
to the orbitals that describe
the Kohn and Sham electrons.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:00.660
Remember that these
non-independent Kohn and Sham

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.530
electrons have an exact solution
that is a later determinant.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:07.560
And so we know there are trivial
many-body wave function is

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.210
a later determinant composed
by a single particle orbitals.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:17.490
And the functional derivative
of that independent

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:20.070
non-interacting
electron's kinetic energy

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:23.160
with respect to the
single-particle orbital

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.710
is now trivial and is
just minus 1/2 del square.

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:34.050
So at the end of all these sort
of complex formulation, what

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:36.810
we are left with is
something very simple

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:39.720
and probably something you
should focus your attention

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.860
from now on.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:45.210
We have now a set of
Kohn and Sham equation

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.480
that are the
differential equation

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:51.260
that the electrons need
to satisfy in order

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:55.690
to satisfy the variational
principle with the caveat

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.430
that, in this Kohn
and Sham equation,

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:02.210
there is at term, an
exchange correlation term,

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.460
that we still don't
know what it is.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.430
It's sort the formally defined
as the functional derivative

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.170
of the exchange
correlation energy

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:11.000
with respect to
the charge density.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.330
But we'll need to
approximate somewhere.

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:19.610
And what this equation
describes is not anymore

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:21.890
the true electrons
in your system,

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:25.970
but they describe this
cousins of the true electrons.

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:31.190
They describe this Kohn and
Sham non-interacting electrons

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:34.670
that have their
own orbital psi i.

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:38.870
And that will give us
a ground state charge

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:42.470
density that, if the exchange
correlation functional was

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:46.940
exact, would be not only this,
as obviously the same ground

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:50.930
state energy of our
interacting electron system,

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:55.920
but it would be the exact
solution of the problem.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.550
OK.

00:56:56.550 --> 00:57:02.040
So this equation look a lot
like a Schrodinger equation.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:06.057
They look a lot, if you want,
like the Hartree-Fock equation

00:57:06.057 --> 00:57:07.140
that we've written before.

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:12.370
Because what we are seeing
is that the a Kohn and Sham

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:18.210
electron i fills a quantum
kinetic energy operator,

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:23.370
fills a Hartree operator,
fills the external potential,

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:28.590
and then fills this
sort of remaining term

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:31.830
that is the exchange
correlation potential.

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:36.900
Again, if we knew what were
this exact exchange correlation

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.750
potential, we would have an
exact solution to the problem.

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:43.120
But we know a very
good approximation.

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.290
And then if you want
finding the ground state,

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:48.690
it's not very different
from finding the ground

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:52.320
state of the Hartree-Fock
equation with the caveat

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.080
that actually this
term here is going

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:59.580
to be much simpler
than the exchange term

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.350
of the Hartree-Fock equation.

00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:03.330
If you go back to
the first slide

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:06.420
to the Hartree-Fock
equation, the last term

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:10.290
is that numerically
very complex expression

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:13.260
in which we sort of
take the orbital,

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:18.720
and we put it inside an
integral differential operator.

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.015
Now, it's become simpler.

00:58:21.015 --> 00:58:22.140
And that's all if you want.

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:25.560
So the Kohn and Sham
equation look very similar.

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.380
In practice, they
are simpler to solve.

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:32.010
They tend to be more
accurate in most cases.

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:34.690
And that's, at the end,
what leads to the success.

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:37.140
But what is critical
for all of this

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.470
is having a reasonable
approximation to the exchange

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:41.910
correlation potential.

00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:44.610
If we had the exact exchange
correlation potential,

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:48.420
everything would be exact
in this formulation.

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:53.130
We would find the Kohn and
Sham independent electrons

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:58.920
that were sort of the ground
state electrons for that charge

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.740
density that is ultimately
equal to the charge

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.500
density of the
interacting electrons

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.470
in this external potential.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.670
OK.

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:19.080
And we have the Euler-Lagrange
or Kohn and Sham differential

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.940
equation in the previous page.

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.480
I written here sort of, you
know, just for reference

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:29.440
also what would be the
total energy of the system.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:34.410
And usually, if you had
an independent electron,

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:37.710
the total energy of
the system is trivially

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:42.890
the sum of each of the
single particle energies.

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:43.440
OK.

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.690
If you have 10
electrons and they

00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:47.430
don't interact with
each other, you

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:50.970
can calculate what is the energy
of each of these 10 electrons.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:54.630
Sum all of them, and that's
the total energy of the system.

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:57.960
In this case, it's more complex.

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.270
And the total
energy of the system

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:02.490
can't be really written
as that, but it's

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:05.790
got other terms that depend
on the charge density.

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:08.670
That's sort of this
is, in summary, what

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.300
your total energy is.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.800
And again, there's nothing
else than kinetic energy term

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.490
sort of a Hartree term
functional charge density,

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.470
this exchange
correlation functional,

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:23.010
and the interaction between
the external potential

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:24.280
and the charge density.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:30.560
But this is actually
different from the sum

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.600
of the eigenvalues.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:40.610
That would be the sum of the
expectation values of psi i

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:48.330
calculated on the
single-particle orbital where

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:53.020
T is, again, just the simple
quantum kinetic energy.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.590
And the VKS is this
Kohn and Sham potential.

01:00:56.590 --> 01:01:00.450
So if you want to calculate the
total energy of your system,

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:03.210
even if it's made of
independent electron,

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:07.470
you can't sum just a
single particle orbitals.

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.260
But you have to sort of
deal with this expression.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.920
Nothing complex in this, it's
just sort of a caveat that

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.795
is relevant when you
want to sort of-- you

01:01:15.795 --> 01:01:18.180
know, this is the reason
why we can't really

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.280
find out the equivalent
of the [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.060
theorems for Hartree-Fock.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:27.690
This is why at the end these
single-particle energies

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:32.010
are ultimately not
physically meaningful.

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:35.850
They sort of don't give us
the total energy of the system

01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:40.250
just by taking the
sum over all of them.

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.030
OK.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:45.470
So in order to make this
into a practical algorithm,

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:51.440
the only part that remains
is finding an approximation

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.250
to that exchange correlation
term, to that last term.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.250
Remember, we had sort of
defined this density functional.

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:01.520
We have been able to extract
two meaningful terms,

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.290
the Hartree electrostatic energy
and the non-interacting Kohn

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:07.850
and Sham kinetic energy.

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:11.390
And we have said what is left
is a function of the charge

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:12.860
density that we
call the exchange

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.110
correlation functional.

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:17.540
How we are going to
approximate that?

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:21.270
Well, we go back to
the Thomas-Fermi idea.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:24.260
We are going to
do a local density

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:29.370
approximation to that exchange
correlation functional.

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.150
So again, what we
want to calculate

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:38.360
is the exchange correlation
energy for any arbitrary charge

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.560
density.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.420
Sometimes I call the
charge density n.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.430
Sometimes I call the
charge density rho,

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.240
but they are always the same.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.100
So how do we do this?

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:51.090
Well, we don't have
the full solution.

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:53.120
But what we can
say, again, is that,

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.760
for an inhomogeneous charge
density that changes values

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.660
and then drops to 0, I
can calculate the exchange

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.860
correlation energy for this
charge density distribution

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:12.260
by sort of decomposing it
in infinitesimal volumes.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:15.140
Inside each
infinitesimal volume,

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.800
I can say the charge
density is constant.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.790
And you see, I make a local
density approximation.

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:28.640
That is I say the contribution
to the overall exchange

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.600
correlation energy of
this inhomogeneous system

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.130
can be broken down.

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:39.110
And each infinitesimal volume
will give its own contribution

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:42.352
to the total exchange
correlation density.

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.060
You know, in principle,
it's not correct.

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:48.500
I mean, our problem doesn't
have to be local in any way.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.440
Actually, as people say,
this exchange correlation

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.300
functional, the true
one, although we

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.680
don't know what it is, we
know that is ultra non-local.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.310
So it can't be
decomposed into terms

01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:04.040
that independently sum up.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.380
So in principle,
we can't do this.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.260
But in practice, it tends
to be a good approximation

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.110
for a lot of cases.

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:15.740
And so what is going to be the
contribution to the exchange

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.730
correlation energy from
this infinitesimal volume?

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:24.500
Let's say the charge
density there is 0.5.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.590
Well, what we need
to do is we need

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:32.270
to find out what is the
exchange correlation

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:35.750
energy for the
homogeneous electron

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.780
gas that is at this density.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:41.630
That's something that, with
some advanced computational

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:45.860
techniques, we can actually
find out almost exactly.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:51.260
So we would know, if we had
a homogeneous charge density

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:54.320
0.5 everywhere, what
would be the charge

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.480
density per unit volume.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.400
And we can find out what is
the exchange correlation charge

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.270
density per unit volume not only
for 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, anything.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:08.990
And what we are saying is
that, in this non-homogeneous

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:12.110
problem, we construct the
overall exchange correlation

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:15.990
energy by summing up
these different pieces.

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:20.360
And so this is what Ceperley
and Alder did in 1980.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:27.200
They basically found out what
was the almost exact sort

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.950
of closely to numerical
exact solution

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:33.560
for the homogeneous
electron gas.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:38.690
That is for a system in
which you have only electrons

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:42.320
homogeneously, so the
charge density is identical

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.230
everywhere.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:45.270
And those electrons interact.

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:49.040
So you can calculate the energy
of this interacting electron

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.530
problem exactly as a
function of the density.

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:53.030
OK.

01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:56.810
So you change the density
in your sort of volume,

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.850
and you find out
what is this energy.

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:02.060
And then you can
calculate, for any

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:06.140
of this density, what is
the Kohn and Sham quantum

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:06.890
kinetic energy.

01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:11.880
You can find out what is the
Hartree electrostatic energy.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.980
And so you can also find
out, for this specific case

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.850
of the homogeneous
gas, numerically

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:23.210
what would be the exchange
correlation density.

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:26.050
And so that's
basically a function.

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.240
So for the homogeneous gas,
that is for the case in which n

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.710
doesn't depend on
r, people found out

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:39.650
what was basically this
exchange correlation energy.

01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:43.200
It was calculated as a function.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:49.370
This is a function of
what people call rs.

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:55.080
rs is the radius of a sphere
that contains one electron.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.560
So it's a sort of
inverse quantity

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.240
with respect to the density.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.630
So numerical calculation, what
are called quantum Monte Carlo

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:07.490
calculation, really solved
the interacting Schrodinger

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.790
equation problem.

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:12.830
But for the specific case
of an electron gas that

01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:15.200
has a homogeneous
density, they were

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.880
able to do that for
various density.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.760
And so, now, we have a function
for the homogeneous problem.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.080
For the non-homogeneous
problem, we take a local density

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.530
approximation, and we say
that the overall exchange

01:07:30.530 --> 01:07:33.830
correlation energy is given
by the integral over all

01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:35.270
the infinitesimal volume.

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:38.660
And each infinitesimal volume
will have a certain density

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:43.085
and will contribute
with its own density.

01:07:43.085 --> 01:07:45.980
If the density is going
to be equal to here,

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.990
this will be the value
of the contribution

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.730
of that infinitesimal volume.

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:52.460
If the density somewhere
else corresponds to this,

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.030
this will be the corresponding.

01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:59.390
So we really match up this
overall exchange correlation

01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:03.050
term from all the little
infinitesimal volume

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:05.600
exactly as
Thomas-Fermi had done,

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:13.490
but now we do it for a term
that is a much smaller term

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.900
in our problem.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.100
Thomas and Fermi had done it
for the quantum kinetic energy.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.560
Instead, what Kohn
and Sham do, they

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.550
do it for what is left from
the universal functional

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:28.340
once you have taken
out the electrostatic

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:31.189
and once you have taken out
the quantum kinetic energy

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:34.100
of the non-interacting
electrons.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:39.590
At this point, if you
want 1980 and even

01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:42.380
before without the
computation, with some sort

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.140
of analytical approximations
to this curve,

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:48.260
density functional theory
becomes not only a theory,

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.870
but also a practical algorithm.

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:54.380
We have a set of expression for
the exchange correlation term.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.569
And so, now, it's just
a matter of trying

01:08:56.569 --> 01:09:00.560
to find out what the solution
to these problems are.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.529
And because somehow
conceptually we

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:07.189
start from the
homogeneous electron gas,

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:12.080
it turns out that this
approach worked especially well

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.250
for solids.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.029
I mean, the valence
electrons in a solid

01:09:17.029 --> 01:09:22.790
are much less structured than
the electrons in a molecule

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.740
that they need to drop to 0.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.500
So the charge density
in a solid overall

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.130
varies less dramatically
as a function of space

01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:34.130
than the electron density
in atoms and molecules.

01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:36.200
And these are
actually sort of what

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.189
were summarized the numerical
result of Ceperley and Alder.

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:44.720
So they had calculated this
exchange correlation energy

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.560
as a function of the density.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.979
And that was actually
a computational curve,

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:50.359
a set of dots.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:54.620
And this is often cited,
again, per Perdew and Zunger

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:58.340
in a sort of paper of
theirs, among other things

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:03.830
sort of suggested the
analytical interpolation of all

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:05.180
the numerical data.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:07.970
And so you see it's
something somehow exotic.

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:13.010
But while it's defined, this
is just not even a functional.

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.950
It's just a function
of the charge density.

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:17.900
So it's something
that is very simple

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.160
to calculate in practice.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.180
And so at this point,
density functional theory,

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.770
is a well-defined theory.

01:10:25.770 --> 01:10:29.420
So you see 1980, Ceperley and
Alder do this quantum Monte

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:33.230
Carlo calculation, find out
sort of what is this exchange

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:34.430
correlation energy.

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:37.130
Perdew and Zunger write
out a simple interpolation.

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:40.370
1982, sort of the
first time that I

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:44.000
think we see sort of where
all of this is going,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.080
Marvin Cohen in Berkeley
sort of has been

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.970
working for two or three years.

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:51.980
Alex Zunger was there.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.750
[INAUDIBLE] him, a
number of his students,

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.810
they have been able
to actually write out

01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:58.940
all the electronic
structure codes

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:03.140
that are able to solve the
density functional equation

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.330
for the case of
a periodic solid.

01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:07.460
And so they address
the case of silicon,

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.510
sort of the most important
material in electronics.

01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:13.790
And so what they do
is they are able now

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:17.480
to calculate the
energy of that system

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:21.080
as a function of the atomic
position and, in particular,

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.810
as a function of the
lattice parameter.

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:25.760
So you know, first
thing that they do

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.190
is they take silicon in
its diamond structure,

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:35.180
so the FCC lattice with
two atoms as a basis.

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:38.150
And they calculate that
energy as a function

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:39.720
of the lattice parameter.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.610
And it looks
something like this.

01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:44.460
And then obviously, as
you have learned by now,

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.650
you look at what is the
minimum of that energy.

01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:48.510
And that is the
theoretical prediction

01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:49.710
of the lattice parameter.

01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:52.440
And there is [INAUDIBLE],,
you know, 1% error.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.890
They look at the
second derivative.

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:58.350
This curvature here is
really the bulk models

01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:02.770
of your problem,
again, 5% 10% error.

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:05.340
And then they say, well, let's
suppose that we have silicon

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.650
not in the diamond
phase, but let's suppose

01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:11.280
that we have silicon
in the beta tin phase.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.590
And so this is also
experimentally known.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:15.930
And we know in the beta
tin what is the lattice

01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:17.100
parameter of silicon.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.620
And we know from the
Maxwell construction

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:24.390
what is the pressure
at which we would

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:29.310
have a transition from,
say, diamond to beta tin.

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.160
And again, you know, I can't
remember what was the error,

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.140
but it's substantially correct.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:38.310
And they were able to
actually sort of calculate

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:42.450
the sort of complex zoology
of all the high pressure

01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:43.650
phases of silicon.

01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:46.530
And it was in remarkable
agreement with the experiment.

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:50.040
So 1982, this is
[INAUDIBLE] and Cohen.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:57.375
But in particular, Marvin Cohen
in Berkeley showed that for a--

01:12:57.375 --> 01:13:01.620
Marvin Cohen.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.520
For a realistic case,
density functional theory

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.330
is able really to give us
quantity of prediction.

01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:11.010
Marvin Cohen has
actually become,

01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:15.060
this year, the president of
the American Physical Society.

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:15.750
OK.

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:19.380
So this is really the beginning
of density functional theory

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.750
as a practical approach.

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:27.420
And in many ways, what has
happened between 1982 and today

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.870
is that we have become
better and better

01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:35.370
at solving the algorithm
for this, overall, still

01:13:35.370 --> 01:13:37.440
complex computational problem.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.940
And you see a lot of this in
the next lecture that follows.

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.740
And we have become somewhat
better, not really dramatically

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:50.970
better, in calculating that
exchange correlation energy.

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:55.110
In a way, sort of the
ideas of Kohn and Sham

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:59.790
from 1965 of having a
local density approximation

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:01.440
is still very good.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.660
I mean, it's not used
nowadays any more that much,

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:09.690
but it's as close as--

01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:13.710
what we can do now is not
really that much better.

01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:15.630
And as you can
imagine, sort of what

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:18.510
people have done
that was a bit better

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:21.770
was introducing gradients
in your problem.

01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:24.840
So you're trying to
guess what the energy

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.710
of an inhomogeneous
system comes starting

01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:31.620
from what you know about the
homogeneous electron gas.

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:35.640
Well, maybe you should somehow
throw in into your problem also

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.530
the first derivative of the
gradient of the density.

01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:42.300
And so people did that fairly
soon in the early '80s.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:47.130
And sort of using the gradients
was actually much worse.

01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:51.480
There was a miracle in the
local density approximation

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:55.080
in which the actual expression
of the local density

01:14:55.080 --> 01:15:00.390
approximation satisfies a
lot of symmetry properties

01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:03.750
and scaling properties of what
would be the exact exchange

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.220
correlation functional.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.860
At the time, people
put in gradients.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:11.730
All these sort of symmetries
and scaling properties

01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:13.830
were sort of thrown to the dogs.

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:15.990
And actually the GGAs--

01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:18.840
sorry, the gradient
approximation,

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.370
were working much, much worse.

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:23.610
And so people need
to realize, sort of

01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:28.650
in the late '80s, the work
of Axel Becke, of John Perdew

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:31.770
especially, a lot
of it, you sort of

01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:35.640
need to introduce
gradients in ways

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:41.100
that still satisfy a lot
of these analytical forms.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:46.320
And in many ways, by now,
there is a sort of generalized

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.100
exchange correlation functional
that's been sort of developed

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:55.200
in the mid-'90s by Perdew,
Kieron Burke now at Rutgers,

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.540
and Matthias Ernzerhof.

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.250
That is called the
PBE functional.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:01.620
That has become sort
of the workhorse.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.750
So a lot of the
time, you'll see sort

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:05.460
of density functional
calculation done

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:09.420
in the PBE, GGA approximation.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.680
But again, these are
important improvements,

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.470
but if you want
just sort of very

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:18.900
little on top of
the local density

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.170
approximation of
the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:25.620
The chemistry community
has also sort of done

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:29.940
a number of very
intriguing developments.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.020
In particular, there are
things that the Hartree-Fock

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.340
does very well.

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.350
In particular, because
you have the sort

01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:41.370
of exchange term in
Hartree-Fock, you cancel,

01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:44.610
remember, the
self-interaction say,

01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:47.860
in the single-electron problem
coming from the Hartree,

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:50.130
the electrostatic problem.

01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:53.080
Density functional
theory, in theory,

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.640
in its exact formulation, would
be self-interaction corrected.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.470
But in practice, it is not.

01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:02.820
If you solve the hydrogen atom
with density functional theory,

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.740
you have that the
electron interacts

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.950
with the charge density
created by the same,

01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:09.970
by the electron itself.

01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:14.880
And so what sort of the quantum
chemistry community has done

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:20.400
is, well, they said let's take
LDAs, let's actually take GGAs

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.140
that seem to work very well.

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:26.520
But let's actually construct an
exchange correlation functional

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.535
that has a little
bit of this, but it's

01:17:29.535 --> 01:17:32.280
got also a little bit of
what we know worthwhile

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.150
in the Hartree-Fock equation.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.780
So they construct
hybrid functional

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:40.410
which there are sort of
pure density financial terms

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:45.080
and the sort of Hartree-Fock
exchange term mixed in.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.770
It makes the equation
much more complex.

01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:52.260
And if you want, it's a sort
of less pure formulation

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.780
of density functional
theory, but it

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:58.590
can work reasonably well or
very well especially, again,

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:00.990
for atoms and molecules.

01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:04.950
And this is where we are,
basically, with exchange

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:06.660
correlation functional.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.150
I think I'll stop here for
today because that's actually

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:10.300
a lot of work.

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.690
What we'll start seeing
in the next class

01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:17.010
is how we actually solve
this equation in practice.

01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:20.310
On March 8th, you're going to
your second lab in which you

01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:23.250
will actually study the
energy of a solid using

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.900
density functional theory.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.180
What I said today
is probably the last

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:28.710
of the conceptual lectures.

01:18:28.710 --> 01:18:30.945
And I understand that some
of it is very complex.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.880
There is reading material
posted on the Stella website.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.030
There is the
Kohanoff-Gidopoulos paper

01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:40.590
on density functional theory.

01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:44.280
And some of the readings that
I've given are very useful.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.800
The two best books
that are also cited

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.410
at the end of this lecture
are probably the one

01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:51.990
by [INAUDIBLE] or the
one by [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:54.990
And they are both called Density
Functional Theory or Density

01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:56.610
Functional Theory In Practice.

01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:59.520
And they are cited
on the last page.

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.880
Otherwise, this is it for
today and see you next week.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:15.250 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ:
So let's continue

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.780 align:middle line:90%
our discussion of series.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we proved
the comparison test

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:90%
at the end of last time.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.945 align:middle line:90%
So this was the comparison test.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So which is a statement about
series with non-negative terms,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.420 align:middle line:84%
with one being smaller
than the other.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of two things,
or two things are true.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
If I have xn and yn
non-negative with yn

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal to
xn, then the conclusion

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:84%
is, if the bigger
series converges,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
this implies that the
smaller series converges.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And the second statement is,
if the smaller series diverges,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:90%
then the larger series diverges.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And we also proved not
using the comparison test,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
but for p-series, that
the series 1 sum from n

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.505 align:middle line:84%
equals 1 to infinity of 1 over
n to the p, This converges.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, we did
use a comparison test

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:90%
for one direction, I guess.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So 1 over n to the p
converges if and only

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:90%
if p is bigger than 1.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:84%
So this converging
implied p has to be

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.950 align:middle line:84%
bigger than 1 by
the comparison test

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and what we know about
the harmonic series

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.748 align:middle line:90%
1 over n, sum of 1 over n.

00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So typically, in applications
you use these two theorems

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:84%
To say something about series
that don't look so simple.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I
look at the series, 1

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
over n squared plus 2020n,
n equals 1 to infinity.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So one could ask, does
this converge, diverge?

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a series
with non-negative terms.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And remember, I mean,
the bigger thing

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:84%
has to converge to imply that
the smaller thing converges.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And if the smaller
thing diverges,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:90%
then the bigger thing diverges.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So don't get the
inequalities mixed up.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So I have 1 over n
squared plus 2020n.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
This 2020 times n is just making
things bigger on the bottom

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and therefore smaller overall.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than or
equal to 1 over n squared.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And since this converges, this
implies by the comparison test

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that sum from n equals 1
to infinity of 1 over n

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:84%
squared plus 2020n
also converges.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, a mistake I'm sure
we've all made at some point

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
is mixing up the
inequality and not

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:90%
getting quite the right answer.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So for example, it is
also true that 1 over n

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
squared plus 2020n is certainly
less than or equal to 1

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
over 2020 times n, which is also
less than or equal to 1 over n.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:29.984 align:middle line:84%
And so, you're tempted to
say, since this diverges,

00:04:29.984 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
it implies the other
series diverges.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:90%
But this is not right.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Because the inequality is wrong.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Remember, if you want to
apply the comparison test,

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:84%
you either have to have a
bigger series which converges

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:84%
or a smaller series
which diverges.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Here we came up with a
bigger series which diverges,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:84%
which gives us no
information at all.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:84%
If we have a bigger
series, like 1 over n

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
squared that we
know converges, then

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.865 align:middle line:84%
do we get information
about the original series.

00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So let's do another
well-known test,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%
or at least test you should
remember from calculus,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:90%
so-called ratio test.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:90%
So what is a statement of this?

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:50.295 align:middle line:84%
So suppose xn does
not equal 0 for all n.

00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And this limit l
equals limit as n

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of x to the
n plus 1 over x to the n,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:90%
an absolute value exists.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Then, if l is less than 1 this
implies that the series xn

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:90%
converges absolutely.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.115 align:middle line:84%
And if l is bigger than 1,
then the series diverges.

00:06:40.115 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, what about l equals 1?

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
There's no information
for l equals 1.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:58.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Meaning you could have a
series so that this l equals 1.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.043 align:middle line:84%
And you could have a
series where it diverges.

00:07:08.043 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And you could also have a series
where l equals 1 and the series

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:90%
converges.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if xn equals
1 over n, for example.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Or I mean, even worse,
let's say 1 for all n.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But we know that the
series 1 diverges.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the individual
terms do not converge to 0.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:90%
They're just 1 the whole time.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
But for xn equals,
let's say, 1 over n

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
squared, so the one we
just saw a minute ago,

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
implies l, which
is the limit as n

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of n plus
1 squared over n squared

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
equals the limit as
n goes to infinity.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Dividing through, one
plus 1 over n squared,

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
this equals 1 plus
0 squared equals 1.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:35.374 align:middle line:84%
So for this series, the root
or the ratio gives this l is 1.

00:08:35.374 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:90%
And this series converges.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So again, for the
case that l equals 1,

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%
we have no information.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:90%
We can't say anything based on--

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.884 align:middle line:84%
this theorem gives
us no information.

00:08:54.884 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to prove
this theorem basically by--

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
so we're not exactly going
to use a comparison test.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But we are still going to
compare this series satisfying

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
one of these two assumptions
to a series we know,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
which is namely the ratio
test for number one.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.405 align:middle line:84%
So first off, let's get
number two out of the way.

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's suppose l
is bigger than 1.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Let alpha be a number
between 1 and l.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we don't
even need to do that.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So here's-- here
is 1, here is l.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So since xn plus 1 over xn
absolute value converges to l,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:90%
there exists an integer M0.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's a natural number.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So that for all n bigger
than or equal to M0,

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.260 align:middle line:84%
xn plus 1 over xn
in absolute value

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to--

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:90%
so here, you could write 1 as--

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:90%
this is equal to l plus--

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
I should say, minus--

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:90%
l minus 1.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So think of this as being
epsilon in the definition

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:90%
of convergence.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is over
here. l plus l minus 1.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So by the definition
of convergence,

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
for all n sufficiently
large, xn plus 1

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
over xn in absolute value
has to be in this interval.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So it has to be bigger
than or equal to 1.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Which implies that for all n
bigger than or equal to M0,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
xn plus 1 is bigger
than or equal to xn.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, I could write this as
saying that x M0 is less than

00:11:55.910 --> 00:12:03.320 align:middle line:84%
or equal to x M0 plus 1, is less
than or equal to x M0 plus 2,

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But this implies that these xn's
cannot converge to 0 as n goes

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:90%
to infinity.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Because for all n bigger
than or equal to M0,

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:90%
they are increasing.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And the only way for
an increasing sequence

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:84%
which is non-negative to
converge to zeros for them

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:90%
all to be 0.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.055 align:middle line:84%
And we're assuming
they're not 0.

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.025 align:middle line:90%
So that proves two.

00:12:48.025 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's prove one.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.860 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:90%
So suppose l is now less than 1.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, let alpha be a
number between l and 1.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to give
myself a little bit of room,

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:84%
to work as you'll
see in just a second.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So by the same
reasoning as before,

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:90%
so here's l, alpha 1 alpha.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I can write as l
plus alpha minus l.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.995 align:middle line:84%
So I should think of this
as kind of an epsilon.

00:13:34.995 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Then since xn plus 1 over xn
in absolute value converges

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to l, which is less
than alpha, there

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.315 align:middle line:90%
exists in M0 natural number.

00:13:56.315 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:05.146 align:middle line:84%
So that, for all M bigger
than or equal to M0,

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
xn plus 1 over xn
in absolute value

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.235 align:middle line:90%
is less than or equal to alpha.

00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So here I have alpha just
a little bit bigger than l.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And if I draw--

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:84%
so this is l minus
alpha minus l.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So since I have this
sequence here converging

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to l for all
insufficiently large,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:90%
this should be in this interval.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Meaning this should be less
than or equal to alpha.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Then for all n bigger
than or equal to 0,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
so let me just write this
slightly differently,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
x sub n plus 1 is less than
or equal to alpha times

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:90%
the absolute value of x of n.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's see what this means.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:84%
For all n bigger than
or equal M sub 0.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.795 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I look at the
absolute value of x sub n.

00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, this n has nothing
to do with these n.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- so then the absolute
value of x of n is less than

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.025 align:middle line:90%
or equal to x--

00:15:45.025 --> 00:15:48.782 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.225 align:middle line:90%
so maybe I'm off by--

00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's increase that by 1.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, so let's not
be confusing here.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's make this l.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's make that l.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So for all l bigger than
or equal to M0 plus 1.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So think of l as playing
the role of being n plus 1.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
This is less than or equal
to x to the l minus 1, which

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to x to the l minus 2,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
now with a square.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I have here is now alpha
times alpha x to the l minus 2.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And now, let's drop again by 1.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I can do this as long
as this quantity here

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to M. So I

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
get this is, if I keep doing
that, this is less than

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:23.029 align:middle line:84%
or equal to alpha to the
l minus M0, x to the M0.

00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.655 align:middle line:84%
And so, actually let's,
we shifted things--

00:17:49.655 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
to use this to bound

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:90%
the partial sums of the x of n.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:90%
So let M be a natural number.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at partial
sum, sum from n equals 1 to M

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
of x sub n, this is
equal to sum n equals 1.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to M0 xn plus sum from n
equals M0 plus 1 to M. x sub--

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:84%
now let me just change
dummy variables for signing,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:90%
for indexing this.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to the sum
from n equals 1 to M0 of xn.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And now, this, I'm going to
use this inequality here.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.515 align:middle line:90%
So this is kind of a mess.

00:19:21.515 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is the inequality
that I get from this.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Remember, alpha's less than 1.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Plus-- OK.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So time's l equals M0 plus 1
to M. OK, everything's fine.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Times alpha to the
l minus M0 plus 1.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So all I did here was replace
this absolute value of x to

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:90%
of x sub l.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:84%
l is just a dummy variable
for indexing these guys,

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:90%
but using this inequality here.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So, sorry, I kind of messed
that up a little bit.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing is that
we have this inequality, which

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
somehow tells you
this series is not

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:84%
that far from being
a geometric series,

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.460 align:middle line:90%
at least when l is big enough.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So then, when we take an
arbitrary partial sum,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:90%
we split it up into two parts.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that comes
up to this integer

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:84%
sub 0, which we
don't care about,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that's just a fixed number, plus
this part that we care about,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:84%
which is after this
fixed number M0.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And we use this
inequality to replace this

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:84%
by x sub M0 plus 1, alpha
to the l minus M0 plus 1.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
The thing to remember
is that little m

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:90%
is the thing that's changing.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to bound
this independent of little m.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Capital M sub 0, that's
just something fixed.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:90%
That could be 1,000.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to sum
from n equals 1 to M0

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:90%
xn, plus x sub M0 plus 1.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And now, if I change
the variable again,

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:84%
so l starts at M0
plus 1 and ends at M.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:90%
So this is now a sum if I go--

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
so now, for the second sum, n
is equal to l minus M0 plus 1.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, n starts at 0 and
ends at M minus M0 plus 1,

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:90%
alpha to the n.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, Emma, is the little-- is
the thing that's changing here.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to bound this
independently of little m.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:90%
But now we're in good shape.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Because this looks like
a geometric series.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Alpha, remember, is less than 1.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than
or equal to sum from n

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
equals 1 to M0 x sub n plus
x sub n 0 plus 1 times--

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:84%
now, instead of just being a sum
from 0 up to M minus M0 plus 1,

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:84%
why not throw all
of it in there.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is equal to n equals 0,
xn, plus x to M0 plus 1 times 1

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:90%
over 1 minus alpha.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Remember, alpha is a number
that we fixed to be less than 1.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:84%
If you try to do
what we did before

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and not fix the alpha just a
little bit to the left of 1,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and try to do
everything with 1, you

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle line:84%
would have wound up
with 1 to the n here.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And that wouldn't have
finished the proof.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't have
closed the proof.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
But given yourself a
little bit of room,

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.855 align:middle line:90%
which is why we fix this alpha.

00:23:50.855 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, this number here is
independent of little m.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:90%
So what have we proven?

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
That for all natural
numbers little m,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:84%
the nth partial sum is less
than or equal to a fixed number

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:90%
given by sum from--

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:42.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
sequence of partial sums

00:24:48.880 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is bounded and
therefore converges.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:22.460 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So kind of the simplest
application of this

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:84%
is maybe a series
that looks familiar.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:90%
So for all x--

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
so this is I guess a
theorem slash example.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But for all x in R, the series
x to the n over n factorial,

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:57.275 align:middle line:84%
n equals 0 to infinity
converges absolutely here.

00:25:57.275 --> 00:25:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.880 align:middle line:90%
0 factorial is, of course, 1.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.580 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:90%
And you just use the ratio test.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So of dx to the n plus 1,
or the n plus first term

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.970 align:middle line:90%
over x to the n.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So absolute value, and
this equals the limit as n

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of
n plus 1 factorial

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:84%
is equal to n plus
1 times n factorial.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So this cancels with
that n factorial.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And I get x over n
plus 1, limit as n

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of just
this fixed number over n

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:90%
plus 1 equals 0.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is certainly
less than 1.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by
the ratio test,

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:84%
this series
converges absolutely.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So I got a little hung
up on exactly the indexes

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and matching them up precisely.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing to
take home from this proof

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
was that when this ratio
is less than 1, then

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:84%
this series behaves very
much like a geometric series

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:90%
for as the terms get very--

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:43.510 align:middle line:84%
as you go far enough
out in the terms.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And this idea of just
trying to relate the series

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to a simple series that you
know a lot about, I mean,

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:84%
basically the only series that
you know everything about,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
namely even how to sum it,
this is how you get this test.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is also
even simpler how

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
you get the next test,
which is the root test.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So the root test,
let's take a series.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And suppose this l, this
limit l equals the limit as n

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:53.565 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of x sub
entity 1 over n exists.

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Then, two conclusions, just
kind of just like in ratio test.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.950 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:18.230 align:middle line:84%
If l is less than 1, and
this implies that the series

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:22.220 align:middle line:90%
converges absolutely.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And if l is bigger than 1,
then this series converges--

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.345 align:middle line:90%
no, the series diverges.

00:29:43.345 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And again, just like
in the ratio test,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:90%
no information for l equals 1.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:84%
You take the same series
that we looked at before.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Did I leave it up there?

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So xn-- x sub n
equals 1 for all n.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:90%
This limit here, l, exists.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:90%
It's equal to 1.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:90%
And that series diverges.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:27.790 align:middle line:84%
If you look at 1 over n
squared, and I take this limit,

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I again get 1.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:90%
But that series converges.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.747 align:middle line:84%
So for capital l equals
1, we get no information.

00:30:35.747 --> 00:30:47.440 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- and in this
case, it's even clearer how

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.880 align:middle line:84%
we're relating the series
to a geometric series.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- in my notes, I
proved two first both times.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps I should have
written it one, two.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll know for the future.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:90%
So suppose l is bigger than 1.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going to show
that this series diverges,

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:84%
again, by showing that the
terms do not converge to 0.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same idea as before.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Here's l, here's 1.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So for all n sufficiently large,
x to the n to the 1 over n

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.220 align:middle line:90%
has to be inside this interval.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And since x to the n, x sub
n to the 1 over n converges

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
to l, which is
bigger than 1, this

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:84%
implies there exists
an integer in 0

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:84%
such that for all n bigger
than or equal to M0, x

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:84%
sub n to the 1 over n is
bigger than 1, which implies

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
all n bigger than or equal to
M0, x sub n in absolute value

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than by just
taking powers of both sides

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than 1.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, since all of the absolute
values of x sub n's is bigger

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:33.650 align:middle line:84%
than 1, this implies that
this cannot converge a 0.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:43.270 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So remember, I mean, let me
remove this absolute value.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.190 align:middle line:90%
x sub n cannot converge to 0.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could go back
to the basic definition

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of convergence, of what
it means for a sequence

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:84%
to converge to a real number
x, and what it doesn't mean,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.000 align:middle line:84%
or what it means for it
to not converge to x.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So xn does not converge to 0
if there exists a bad epsilon.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So that x sub n is
outside of that interval.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:84%
As long as is outside
of that interval

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.325 align:middle line:90%
if I go far enough out.

00:33:23.325 --> 00:33:27.310 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:90%
And we certainly have that here.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Or you could use--

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:84%
so this bigger than
1, in fact, implies

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:48.700 align:middle line:84%
that the lim sup of x
of n is bigger than 1.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if I have two
sequences, one bigger

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
than the other, then the
lim sup of the bigger one

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to the lim sup

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:90%
of the other one, which is 1.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing in
this week's assignment,

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:84%
that this converges--
that xn converges to 0 if

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:16.409 align:middle line:84%
and only if the lim sup of
the absolute values of xn's

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:90%
converge to 0.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.489 align:middle line:90%
And this is not.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It's bigger than or equal to 1.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.135 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.135 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:90%
So we'll leave that there.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:37.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So now, for the other case,
that l is less than 1.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Suppose l is less
than 1, then let alpha

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:90%
be a number between l and 1.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:90%


00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Again, since this converges to
l, which is less than alpha,

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.110 align:middle line:84%
for all n sufficiently large,
this has to be less than alpha.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So there exists an integer,
I have x to the n to the 1

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:84%
over n is less than
alpha, which implies

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that for all n bigger
than or equal to M0,

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:84%
x to the n in absolute value
is less than alpha to the n.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So here again, we're
seeing this series,

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.880 align:middle line:84%
if it satisfies
these hypotheses,

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.200 align:middle line:84%
is very much acting
like a geometric series.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Remember, alpha's less than 1.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:90%


00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Then for every natural
number little m,

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:14.146 align:middle line:84%
if we look at the nth partial
sum of the absolute value,

00:36:14.146 --> 00:36:17.070 align:middle line:90%
let's say n equals 1.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.430 align:middle line:84%
This is we split it
up again into a part

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:32.650 align:middle line:84%
that we don't really care
about, plus an interesting part.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.837 align:middle line:84%
Remember, little m is the
thing that's changing.

00:36:35.837 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
This should look like a little
m compared to capital M0.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.060 align:middle line:90%


00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is less than or equal
to sum from n equals 1 to M0,

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.030 align:middle line:90%
x sub n.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is just
a fixed number.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Plus now we can put this
inequality, n equals M0 plus 1,

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.960 align:middle line:90%
m alpha to the n.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:10.552 align:middle line:84%
And this is less than or
equal to sum from n equals M0.

00:37:10.552 --> 00:37:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go kind of fast
here, because I'm running out

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.020 align:middle line:90%
of space on the board here.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll write this
out in just a minute.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:90%
But why this is true.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And this part here is less
than or equal to 1 over 1

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.420 align:middle line:90%
minus alpha.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Because what do I do?

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.435 align:middle line:90%
This sum is a finite sum.

00:37:31.435 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly
bigger than if I

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:46.790 align:middle line:84%
make the lower bound smaller
and the upper bound larger.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the nth
partial sum corresponding

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:84%
to a geometric series
with non-negative terms,

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:90%
the alpha to the n.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's less than
or equal to sum from n

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 to infinity of alpha
to the n, which equals 1 over 1

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:90%
minus alpha.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:07.718 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's how we got this term.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
partial sums corresponding

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to the series with
absolute values is bounded.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that series with
the absolute values converges.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have absolute
convergence.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:28.960 align:middle line:90%


00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me state a theorem
about alternating series.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.000 align:middle line:90%
It is not--

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I prefer not to call it an
alternating series test,

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.660 align:middle line:84%
because there's
nothing really to test.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at least with
the ratio and root test,

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.240 align:middle line:84%
you have to recompute
a limit, which

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.815 align:middle line:90%
might require some work to do.

00:38:50.815 --> 00:39:02.920 align:middle line:90%


00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, at least to me,
that's kind of a real thing,

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that you have to do
a little work to test

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.590 align:middle line:90%
whether a series converges.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And for alternating series,
the test is, you look at it.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't compute anything.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.110 align:middle line:90%
You look at it.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So I prefer not to
call this theorem

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.230 align:middle line:84%
about alternating series
an alternating series test.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:90%


00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.945 align:middle line:84%
So the theorem is, for
alternating series.

00:39:42.945 --> 00:39:46.440 align:middle line:90%


00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And the statement
is the following.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.990 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Let x sub n be a
monotone decreasing

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:13.710 align:middle line:90%
sequence converging to 0.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.700 align:middle line:90%


00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So because this thing is
monotone, and monotone

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.900 align:middle line:84%
decreasing and converging
to 0, it's all--

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:90%
so let me--

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll put this in parentheses.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:33.200 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Therefore xn is bigger than
or equal to 0 for all n.

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:44.600 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I cannot have a monotone
decreasing sequence converging

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.678 align:middle line:84%
to 0 if one of the
xn's is less than 0,

00:40:49.678 --> 00:40:51.095 align:middle line:84%
because they keep
getting smaller.

00:40:51.095 --> 00:40:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.990 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- this is
all of the hypotheses.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
compute anything.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Then the series minus 1
to the n, xn, n equals--

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:84%
let's of course, we don't have
to start at 1 in particular.

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:23.020 align:middle line:84%
But at least for this statement,
let's make it precise.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Sum from n equals 1 to
infinity of minus 1 to the n,

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.870 align:middle line:90%
x to the n-- x sub n converges.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And we can just say
convergence, not necessarily

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.800 align:middle line:90%
absolute convergence.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Because again, if we
look at minus 1 to the n,

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:84%
1 over n, which is 1 over n is
a monotone decreasing sequence

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.050 align:middle line:90%
converging to 0.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.120 align:middle line:84%
That converges,
but not absolutely.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.380 align:middle line:90%


00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we have x sub n
equal 1 over n squared,

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.950 align:middle line:84%
again, 1 over n squared is a
monotone decreasing sequence

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.030 align:middle line:90%
converging to 0.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.530 align:middle line:90%
That would converge absolutely.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So we just have a statement
about convergence.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:07.870 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So how we're going to
do this is, we are--

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.440 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like how
we proved convergence

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:27.080 align:middle line:84%
for p series, in
that we're going

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.790 align:middle line:84%
to show that a certain
subsequence of partial sums

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:90%
converges.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're going
to use that to show

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.990 align:middle line:84%
that the full sequence
of partial sums converge.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:45.630 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So let me state
this as claim one.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So the subsequence
of partial sums,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:09.625 align:middle line:84%
S sub 2k, so this is just the
sum from n equals 1 to 2k.

00:43:09.625 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:90%


00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:23.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to show
this converges.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So again, just to be
complete, S sub m,

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.910 align:middle line:84%
this is the nth partial
sum. it is the sum from m

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:32.800 align:middle line:90%
equals 1 to m.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:45.315 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.315 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So how we're going
to do this is,

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:84%
we're going to show that
these partial sums are

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.030 align:middle line:84%
in fact monotone decreasing
and bounded from below.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:44:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Monotone decreasing,
basically because these guys

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.710 align:middle line:90%
are monotone decreasing.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And bounded from below
by the same reasoning.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:90%
So let's show that.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:20.440 align:middle line:90%


00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:31.340 align:middle line:84%
For k, a natural number, if I
look at S 2k, so this is a sum.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:38.320 align:middle line:84%
It equals 1 2k, minus
1 to the n x sub n.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Now I have the n equals 1 term,
which I can write as minus x--

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:50.170 align:middle line:84%
so just writing this
out in a certain way.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is minus x1
plus x2 minus x3 plus--

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and then n equals 2k is even.

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.860 align:middle line:90%
So then I get plus x 2k.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.880 align:middle line:90%


00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to x
sub 2 minus x sub 1,

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:84%
plus x sub 4 minus x sub 3,
plus all the way to x sub

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.810 align:middle line:90%
2k minus x sub 2k, minus 1.

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sequence is
monotone decreasing.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So x sub 2 going to be
smaller than x sub 1.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
x sub 4 is going to
be less than x sub 3.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:45.750 align:middle line:84%
x sub 2k minus x sub 2k
minus 1 is less than 0.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So since this is
monotone decreasing,

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.605 align:middle line:90%
this is bigger than or equal to.

00:45:52.605 --> 00:45:57.330 align:middle line:90%


00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So what I just said has nothing
to do with this inequality

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing here--

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:04.370 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:07.960 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.610 align:middle line:90%
So I kept everything here.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And now I add x sub 2k plus
2 minus x sub 2k plus 1.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:22.540 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.465 align:middle line:84%
So what I was saying
was that the x sub n's

00:46:25.465 --> 00:46:26.890 align:middle line:90%
are monotone decreasing.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:30.560 align:middle line:84%
This term is right
after this term.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's smaller than this term.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So this term here is
less than or equal to 0.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:42.910 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this thing
plus itself plus something

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:49.990 align:middle line:84%
that's negative is less
than or equal to this thing.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is this thing
on the right hand side?

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:21.730 align:middle line:84%
This is just a x 2k minus
plus x 2k, minus x 2k plus 1,

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:24.940 align:middle line:90%
plus x sub 2, k plus 1.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is the k plus
1 2k plus 1 partial sum.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:90%


00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Thus this series is
monotone decreasing.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:06.910 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So to show that the subsequence
of partial sums converges,

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.350 align:middle line:84%
we just have to show
that this subsequence is

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:18.460 align:middle line:90%
bounded, or bounded below.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.530 align:middle line:84%
If it's monotone
decreasing, it's already

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.640 align:middle line:90%
bounded above by something.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to show
it's bounded from below.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.970 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, for all k, a natural
number, let's look at S

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:44.080 align:middle line:84%
sub 2k and group term
slightly differently.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.060 align:middle line:90%
So this is equal now to--

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write it as
minus x1 plus x sub 3.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:59.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:04.780 align:middle line:84%
x sub 2 minus x sub 3,
plus x sub 4 minus x sub 5,

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:14.740 align:middle line:84%
plus so on, plus x 2k
minus x 2k minus 1.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:28.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think-- ah,
no, that's not right.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:31.600 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:37.490 align:middle line:90%
So this is minus 2 plus x of 2k.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:37.990 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.546 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.546 --> 00:49:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is right.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.760 align:middle line:90%
So this is equal to minus--

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.770 align:middle line:84%
so again, the x sub n's
are monotone decreasing.

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So x sub 3 is
smaller than x sub 2.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is non-negative.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:00.400 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.480 align:middle line:84%
This is also non-negative,
because x sub 5 is smaller

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.160 align:middle line:90%
than x sub 4, so on and so on.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.980 align:middle line:90%
So this is also non-negative.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So S sub 2k is bigger than
or equal to minus x sub 1.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Plus non-negative terms, so 2k.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And remember, x sub
n's, these are monotone

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:26.110 align:middle line:90%
decreasing converging to 0.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that
they're all non-negative.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is bigger than or
equal to minus x sub 1.

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:41.260 align:middle line:90%


00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Thus, what do we get?

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So for all natural
numbers k, I have minus x1

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.670 align:middle line:84%
is less than or
equal to S sub 2k.

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And because these are
monotone decreasing,

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:84%
this is always less than
or equal to S k equals 1.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- so if you like
S sub 2, is just minus x sub 1

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.210 align:middle line:90%
plus x sub 2.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So this sequence of
numbers is bounded

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.490 align:middle line:84%
between this real number
and this real number.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, it's bounded.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.912 align:middle line:84%
And since it's
monotone decreasing,

00:51:17.912 --> 00:51:18.870 align:middle line:90%
it has to have a limit.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:35.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.610 align:middle line:90%
So S sub 2k converges.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:47.730 align:middle line:90%


00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's call this limit something.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:52:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's call it S. And we'll
show that the sequence

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.370 align:middle line:84%
of partial sums
converge to S now.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.280 align:middle line:84%
We just showed this for
along a sequence of--

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.080 align:middle line:84%
along a subsequence
of partial sums.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's show it converges to
S along the full sequence.

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is, if
you like, claim 2,

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:36.710 align:middle line:84%
which is that the full sequence
of partial sums converges to S.

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do this by
brute force using epsilon M

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.760 align:middle line:90%
argument.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.840 align:middle line:90%
So remember, to show something--

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:50.260 align:middle line:84%
a limit of something equals
S means for all epsilon,

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.220 align:middle line:84%
there exists a capital M, so
that for all M bigger than

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.120 align:middle line:84%
or equal to capital M, S sub
M minus S in absolute value

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.830 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.600 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.710 align:middle line:90%


00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Since S sub 2k convergence to S,
there exists M0 natural number.

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:25.280 align:middle line:84%
So that all k bigger than
or equal to M0 S sub 2k

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.025 align:middle line:84%
minus S in absolute value
is less than epsilon.

00:53:28.025 --> 00:53:33.800 align:middle line:90%


00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, we haven't used
at all in this proof

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:39.230 align:middle line:84%
that the xn's really
converge to 0.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.810 align:middle line:84%
We did use that they were
non-negative at one point.

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But now, this is where
we'll use a conversion to 0,

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:48.110 align:middle line:90%
because here's the intuition.

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:52.890 align:middle line:84%
The S sub 2k's are
converging to something.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So now, I just have to
look at the odd ones.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:54:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I've shown all the even
partial sums converge to S.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So if I can show the odd
partial sums also converge to S,

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.580 align:middle line:90%
then essentially, I'm done.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.920 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between an even partial sum

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.540 align:middle line:90%
and an odd partial sum?

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just x to the
2k plus x sub 2k plus 1,

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.080 align:middle line:90%
which is converging to 0.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.280 align:middle line:90%
So they don't differ by much.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially the
whole argument right there.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So since xn's converge to 0,
there exists natural number M

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:43.030 align:middle line:84%
sub 1 so that for all n bigger
than or equal to M sub 1,

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.860 align:middle line:84%
x of n is less than
epsilon over 2.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.110 align:middle line:90%
I should have written Epsilon.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Over 2 here.

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.070 --> 00:55:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Choose M to be the maximum
of two numbers 2M0 0

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:04.700 align:middle line:90%
plus 1 and M1.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.265 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see why I made these
choices in just a minute.

00:55:07.265 --> 00:55:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So suppose m is bigger
than or equal to M.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:20.350 align:middle line:84%
We now want to show that S sub
m minus S is less than epsilon

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.630 align:middle line:90%
in absolute value.

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:24.610 align:middle line:90%
So there's two cases.

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:33.560 align:middle line:84%
If m is even, then m
over 2 is bigger than

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.360 align:middle line:84%
or equal to capital M over
2, which is the max of these.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.250 align:middle line:84%
If I divide by 2,
that's certainly

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:44.030 align:middle line:90%
bigger than or equal to M0.

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I use this first
inequality, S sub m minus s,

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:57.440 align:middle line:84%
which is equal to S2 times m
over 2, minus S. Now, m over 2

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is an integer bigger
than or equal to m sub 0.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.963 align:middle line:90%
So I can use this inequality.

00:56:02.963 --> 00:56:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It's less than epsilon over
2, which is less than epsilon.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And now, we do odd.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:28.578 align:middle line:90%


00:56:28.578 --> 00:56:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So again, m is bigger than
or equal to capital M.

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's two
cases, even and odd.

00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:38.900 align:middle line:84%
If m is odd, let k
be this integer now.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Since m is odd, m
minus 1 is even,

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:42.980 align:middle line:90%
divided by 2, that's an integer.

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:47.470 align:middle line:90%


00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And so, this is--

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:56.200 align:middle line:90%
so m equals 2k plus 1.

00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:03.840 align:middle line:90%


00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And since m is bigger
than or equal to M0,

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.430 align:middle line:90%
this implies a couple of things.

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:14.320 align:middle line:90%
This implies that this integer--

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:20.500 align:middle line:84%
so our m, this
implies that 2k plus 1

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.970 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 2.

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:24.700 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.810 align:middle line:90%
So m is just equal to 2k plus 1.

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's bigger
than or equal to m,

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:31.480 align:middle line:84%
which is bigger than or
equal to 2 m sub 0 plus 1.

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, k, this integer
here, is bigger than M0.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:44.900 align:middle line:90%


00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Also, m is bigger than or
equal to m sub 1 as well.

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, m is bigger
than or equal to m.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And m is bigger than or equal
to the max of these two things.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's bigger
than or equal to 1.

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Then if I look at S of n minus
S, this is equal to S sub m--

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:15.880 align:middle line:84%
so the nth partial
sum is equal to the m

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:29.420 align:middle line:84%
minus first partial sum plus
the next term minus S. Now

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:32.030 align:middle line:84%
m minus 1, in terms
of the integer k,

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:34.580 align:middle line:90%
is equal to 2 times k.

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:41.130 align:middle line:90%


00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going to take this
S and group it with this guy.

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:58:55.130 --> 00:59:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, since k is bigger
than or equal to m sub 0,

00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:06.160 align:middle line:84%
we can use this
inequality here after we

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.640 align:middle line:90%
do the triangle inequality.

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than
or equal to S 2k

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.700 align:middle line:84%
minus S, plus the absolute
value of this thing.

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So again, since k is bigger
than or equal to m sub 0,

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I can use this inequality to
get this is less than epsilon

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:29.530 align:middle line:90%
over 2, plus this guy.

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And since m is bigger than
or equal to, capital M, which

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:35.800 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal
to capital M sub 1,

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.480 align:middle line:90%
I can use this inequality.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.930 align:middle line:90%


00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:45.130 align:middle line:90%
And this is less than epsilon.

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So we've done the case of m
even or m odd, m bigger than

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:51.960 align:middle line:90%
or equal to m.

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:57.430 align:middle line:84%
So in summary, we've
shown that if m

00:59:57.430 --> 01:00:00.880 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal
to m, S sub m minus S

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.570 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the S
sub n's converge to S.

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think I have enough
time to do this next theorem.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.490 align:middle line:90%
So we'll stop there.

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:20.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:32.030
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.447
Well, I guess I
really should have

00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:37.130
said "goodbye," because
this is the last lecture

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.330
in our course--

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.030
not the last assignment,
but the last lecture.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.720
The reason I said "hi" was,
why quit after all this time

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.880
with saying that?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.820
And we've reached
the stage now where

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
we should clean up
the vector spaces

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.610
to the best of our
ability and recognize

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.820
that, from this point on, much
of the treatment of vector

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.360
spaces requires
specialized concentration.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.519
In fact, I envy
the real people who

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.140
make regular movies
where they have

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.060
stuntmen when things get tough.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.860
I would continue on
with this course,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.870
except that I don't
have a stuntman

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.270
to do these hard
lectures for me.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.467
And also, the particular
topic, as I told you last time,

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.550
that I have in mind for
today-- the subject called

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.020
eigenvectors--

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.400
has two approaches to it.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.070
One is that it does have
some very elaborate practical

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.620
applications, many
of which occur

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.600
in more advanced subjects.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.270
It also has a very
nice framework

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.570
within the game of
mathematics idea.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.350
And my own feeling was that,
since we started this course

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.350
with the concept of the
game of mathematics,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.420
mathematical
structures, I thought

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.210
that, rather than go into
complicated applications,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.240
I would treat
eigenvectors in terms

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.880
of the structure of
mathematics as a game.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.910
In fact, as an
interesting aside,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.890
I'd like to share with
you a very famous story

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.300
in mathematics, that, when the
first book on matrix algebra

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.949
was written by Hamilton,
he inscribed the book with,

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.890
"Here at last is a
branch of mathematics

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.190
for which there will never be
found practical application."

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.760
He did not invent the subject
to solve difficult physics

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.510
problems.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.940
He invented the
subject because it was

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.280
an elegant mathematical device.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.900
And so I thought that
maybe, for our last lecture,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.960
we should end on that vein.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.760
At any rate, the subject for
today is called eigenvectors.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.600
And from a purely game point
of view, the idea is this.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.650
Let's suppose that we
have a vector space V

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.710
and a linear mapping, a
linear transformation, f,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.690
that maps V onto itself, say.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.430
And the question is, are
there any vectors in V other

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.510
than the zero vector,
such that f of v

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.620
is some scalar multiple of v?

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.440
You see, the reason I exclude
the zero vector, first of all,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.230
is that we already know that,
for a linear transformation,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.720
f of 0 is 0.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.810
And c times 0 is 0 for all c.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.250
So this would be trivially
true if v were the zero vector.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.530
So what we're really
interested in--

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.290
given a particular
linear transformation,

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.480
are there any vectors
such that, relative

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.960
to that linear transformation,
the mapping of that vector

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.420
is just a scalar multiple
of that vector itself?

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.830
In other words, does f
preserve the direction

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.320
of any vectors in V?

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.650
By the way, don't confuse
this with conformal mapping

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.770
that we talked about
in complex variables.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.700
In conformal mapping, we didn't
preserve any-- in general,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.370
we did not preserve
directions of lines.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.630
We preserved angles.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.670
In other words, an
angle might have

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.160
been rotated so that the
direction of the two sides

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.180
may have changed.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.770
It was the angle
that was preserved

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.240
in the conformal mapping.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.210
What we're asking now is,
given a linear transformation,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.370
does it preserve any directions?

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.230
And to illustrate this
in terms of an example,

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.140
let's suppose we
think of mapping

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.190
the xy-plane into the uv-plane
under the linear mapping f

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.839
bar, where f bar maps x, y into
the 2-tuple x plus 4y comma

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.130
x plus y.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.700
In other words, in terms
of mapping the xy-plane

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.640
into the uv-plane,
this is the mapping--

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.150
u equals x plus 4y,
v equals x plus y.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.190
It's understood here,
when I'm referring

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.890
to the typical xy-plane, that
my basis vectors are i and j.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.370
Notice, by the way, that
if I look at the vector i,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.380
i is the 2-tuple 1 comma 0.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.170
Notice that when x is 1 and
y is 0, u is 1 and v is one.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.850
So f bar maps 1 comma
0 into 1 comma 1.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.280
Again, in terms of
i and j vectors,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.820
f bar maps i into i plus j.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.930
And i plus j is certainly
not a scalar multiple of i.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.990
Similarly, what
does f bar do to j?

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.190
j, relative to the basis i and
j, is written as 0 comma 1.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.890
When x is 0 and y is 1, we
obtain that u is 4 and v is 1.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.720
So under f bar, 0 comma 1
is mapped into 4 comma 1.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.540
Or in the language of
i and j components, f

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.440
bar maps j into 4i plus j.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.550
And that certainly is not
a scalar multiple of j.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.050
In other words, 4i plus
j is not parallel to j.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.090
On the other hand, let me
pull this one out of the hat.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.510
Let's take the
vector 2i plus j--

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.930
in other words, the
2-tuple 2 comma 1.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.200
When x is 2 and y is 1,
we see that x plus 4y is 6

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.220
and x plus y is 3.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.170
So f bar maps 2 comma
1 into 6 comma 3.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.290
And that certainly
is 3 times 2 comma

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.390
1-- see, by our rule of
scalar multiplication.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.410
In other words, what this says
is that the vector 2i plus j

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.240
is mapped into the vector
which has the same sense

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.480
and direction as 2i plus
j, but is 3 times as long.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.140
So you see, sometimes
the linear transformation

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.020
will map a vector into a
scalar multiple of itself.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.340
Sometimes it won't.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.750
Sometimes there'll
be no vectors,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.680
other than the zero vector,
that they're mapped into--

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.150
scalar multiples of themselves,
and things of this type.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.630
But that's not
important right now.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.300
In terms of a game, what
we're trying to do is what?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.430
Solve the equation
[INAUDIBLE]---- well,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.140
let's give it in
terms of a definition.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.470
First of all, if we
have a vector space V,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.350
and f is a linear transformation
mapping V into itself,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.760
if little v is any non-zero
element of the vector space V,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.590
and if f of v equals c
times v for some scalar--

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.150
for some number c--

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:08.750
then v is called an eigenvector
and c is called an eigenvalue.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.320
In other words, if a vector
has its direction preserved,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.150
geometrically speaking,
all we're saying

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.610
is that if the direction
doesn't change,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.980
the vector is called
an eigenvector.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.132
And the scaling factor--

00:07:20.132 --> 00:07:20.840
which means what?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.210
Even though the
direction doesn't change,

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.880
the image may have a
different magnitude,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.820
because the scalar c here
doesn't have to be 1.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.820
That scalar is
called an eigenvalue.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.240
And I'll give you more
on this in the exercises,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.130
and perhaps even in
supplementary notes

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.380
if the exercises seem
to get too sticky.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.300
But we'll see how
things work out.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.610
For the time being,
all I care about

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.130
is that you understand
what an eigenvector means

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.260
and what an eigenvalue is.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.910
Quickly summarized, if f maps
a vector space into itself,

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.060
an eigenvector is
any non-zero vector

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.140
which has its direction
preserved under the mapping f--

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.130
that f maps it into a
scalar multiple of itself.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.910
There is a matrix approach
for finding eigenvectors,

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.980
and the matrix
approach also gives us

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.040
a very nice review of many
of the techniques that we've

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.350
used previously in our course.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.330
For the sake of
argument, let's suppose

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.730
that V is an n-dimensional
vector space,

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.660
and that we've again chosen a
particular basis, u1 up to un,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.810
to represent V.
Suppose, also, that f

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.470
is a linear mapping
carrying V into V.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.049
Remember how we used the
matrix approach here?

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.030
What we said was, look at.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.530
The vectors u1 up to un
are carried into f of u1

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.179
up to f of un.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.549
And that determines the
linear transformation

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:48.170
f because of the fact of
the linearity properties.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:53.240
In other words, when you
take f of a1 u1 plus a2 u2,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.840
it's just a1 f of
u1 plus a2 f of u2.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.720
So once you know what
happens to the basis vectors,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.150
you know what happens
to everything.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.870
But since we're expressing V in
terms of the basis u1 up to un,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.340
that means that f of
u1, et cetera, f of un

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.220
may all be expressed as linear
combinations of u1 up to un.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.540
And that's precisely what
I've written over here.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.420
We also know that the
vector v that we're

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.920
trying to find--
see, remember we're

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.540
trying to find eigenvectors.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.476
The vector v, relative
to the basis u1 up to un,

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:31.723
can be written as the
n-tuple x1 up to xn.

00:09:31.723 --> 00:09:33.890
And now I won't bother
writing this, because I hope,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.570
by this time, you
understand this.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.430
This is an abbreviation
for saying what?

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.930
The vector v is x1 u1
plus et cetera xn un,

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.590
because I am always referring
to the specific basis

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.670
when I write n-tuples without
any other qualifications.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:56.930
Now, the question was, how did
the statement f of v equal cv

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.260
translate in the
language of matrices?

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.870
Remember that we took
this particular matrix

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.420
of coefficients and wrote--

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.490
well, we transposed it.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.540
Remember what we said?

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.610
We said that the
matrix A would be

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.630
the matrix whose first column
would be the components of f

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.640
of u1 and whose nth column would
be the components of f of un.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.620
In other words, what we did was,
is we said that to take f of v,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.990
we would just take the matrix--

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:33.870
notice how I've written it,
now-- not a1,1, a1,2, a1,1,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.710
you see?

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.380
a2,1, a3,1, et cetera--

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.250
you see, these make up
the components of f of u1.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.950
These make up the
components of f of un.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.082
That's what was
called the matrix A.

00:10:47.082 --> 00:10:53.040
v itself was the n-tuple x1 up
to xn, which became the column

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.210
matrix X when we wrote
it as a column vector.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.410
Remember that.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.070
And then what we said
was the transpose

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.340
of that would be c
times this n-tuple.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.310
But if I write this
n-tuple as a column vector,

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.530
I don't need the
transpose in here.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.110
In other words, in
matrix language,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.080
with A being this
matrix and X being

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.530
this column matrix, this
translates into the matrix

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.000
equation A times X
equals c times X,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.810
where we recall that the
matrix A is what's given,

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.930
and what we're trying to
find is, first of all,

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.900
are there any vectors X that are
mapped into a scalar times X?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.010
In other words, are
any column matrices

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.100
that are mapped into a scalar
times that column matrix

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.525
with respect to A?

00:11:42.525 --> 00:11:46.950
And secondly, if there are
such column matrices, what

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.380
values of c correspond to that?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.410
Well, notice, by ordinary
algebraic techniques--

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:57.180
because matrices do obey many of
the ordinary rules of algebra--

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:04.530
AX equals cX is the same
as saying AX minus cX is 0.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.960
Notice that we already
know that matrices

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.720
obey the distributive rule.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.780
In other words, I could factor
out the matrix X from here.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.700
Of course, I have to
be very, very careful.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.130
Notice that capital
A is a matrix.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.990
Little c is a scalar.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.510
And to have A minus c
wouldn't make much sense.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.110
In other words, since
A is an n-by-n matrix,

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.060
I want whatever I'm
subtracting from it

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.620
to also be an n-by-n matrix.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.360
So what I do is the little
cute device of remembering

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.390
the property of the
identity matrix I sub n.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.350
I simply replace X by I sub
n times X-- in other words,

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.900
the identity matrix times
X. That now says what?

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.350
AX minus c, identity
matrix n-by-n--

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.780
identity matrix
times X equals 0.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.260
Now I can factor out
the X. And I have what?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.220
The matrix A minus c
times the identity matrix

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.030
times the column
matrix X equals 0.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.920
Now, remember, back
when we were first

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.160
talking about matrix
algebra, we pointed out

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.730
that matrices obey
the same structure.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.200
Matrices obey the same structure
with certain small reservations

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.460
that numbers obey.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:22.890
For example, we saw that if
A was not the zero matrix,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.690
AX equals zero did not imply
that X equals zero like it

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.220
did in ordinary arithmetic.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.590
But it did if A happened to
be a non-singular matrix.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.410
In other words,
what we did show was

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.730
that if this particular
matrix had an inverse, then,

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.310
multiplying both
sides of this equation

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.470
by the inverse of
this, the inverse

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.640
would cancel this factor, and
we'd be left with X equals 0.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.980
In other words, if A
minus cI inverse exists,

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.260
then X must be the
zero column matrix.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.600
Now, remember what X is.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.515
X is the column
matrix whose entries

00:14:01.515 --> 00:14:05.610
are the components of the v that
we're looking for over here.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.700
Keep in mind that we were
looking for a v which

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.830
was unequal to zero.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.650
If v is unequal to 0, in
particular, at least one

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.560
of its components must
be different from 0.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.320
So what we're saying is, if A--

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.250
if this matrix here,
with its inverse, exists,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.190
then X must be the
zero column matrix,

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.050
which is the solution
that we don't want.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.340
In other words, we won't
get non-zero solutions.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.260
Or from a different
point of view,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.800
what this says is, if we want
to be able to find a column

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.780
vector X which is not the zero
column vector, in particular,

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.750
A minus cI had better
be a singular matrix.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.960
In other words, it's
inverse doesn't exist.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.400
And as we saw back in block
4, when a matrix is singular,

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.680
it means that its
determinant is 0.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.890
Consequently, in order
for there to be any chance

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:03.210
that we can find non-zero
solutions of this equation,

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:08.190
it must be that the determinant
of A minus cI must be 0.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.560
And by the way, what does
A minus cI look like?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.430
Notice that I is the
n-by-n identity matrix.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.860
When you multiply a
matrix by a scalar,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.240
you multiply each entry of
that matrix by that scalar.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.250
Since all of the entries off
the diagonal are 0, c times 0

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.520
will still be 0.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.140
So notice that c times the
n-by-n identity matrix is just

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:41.050
the n-by-n diagonal matrix,
each of whose diagonal elements

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.330
is c.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.870
And now, remembering what
A is, and remembering

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.170
how we subtract two
matrices, we subtract

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.840
them component-by-component.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.640
Notice that the only non-zero
components of cI are the c's

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.990
down the diagonal.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:04.480
What this says is, if we take
our matrix A, A minus c In is

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.210
simply, from a
manipulative point of view,

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:11.590
obtained by subtracting c from
each of the diagonal elements.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:17.230
You see, it's a1,1
minus c, a2,2 minus c.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.600
But every place else,
you're subtracting 0,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.940
because the entry here is 0.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.130
So this is what this
matrix looks like.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.530
I want its determinant to be 0.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.490
Last time, we showed how
we computed a determinant.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.400
Notice that the a's
are given numbers.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.500
c is the only unknown.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.130
If we expand this determinant
and equate it to 0,

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.700
we get an nth degree
polynomial in c.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.130
I'm not going to go into
much detail about that now.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.090
In fact, I'm not going to go
into any detail about this now.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.250
I will save that
for the exercises.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.490
But what I will do is take
the very simple case, where

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.500
we have a two-dimensional
vector space,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.710
and apply this theory
to the two-by-two case.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.000
And I think that the easiest
example to pick, in this case,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.290
is the same example as we
started with-- example 1--

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.819
and revisit it.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.250
In other words, this is
called "example 1 revisited."

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.089
That doesn't sound--

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.920
Let's just call it example 2.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.460
In example 2, you were thinking
of a two-dimensional space

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.290
relative to a particular basis.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:26.470
The 2-tuple x comma y got mapped
into x plus 4y comma x plus y.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.780
In particular, 1 comma 0
got mapped into 1 comma 1.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.640
0 comma 1 got mapped
into 4 comma 1.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.410
The only reason I've
left the bar off

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.300
here is so that you
don't get the feeling

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.610
that this has to be
interpreted geometrically.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.740
This could be any
two-dimensional space

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.960
relative to any basis.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.510
But at any rate,
using this example,

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.470
remembering how the matrix A is
obtained, the first column of A

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.850
are these components.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:52.990
That's 1, 1.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.110
The second column of A
are these components--

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.040
4, 1.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.760
So the matrix A
associated with f

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.900
relative to our given basis that
represents the 2-tuples here

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.390
is 1, 4, 1, 1.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.180
If I want to now look
at A minus c I2--

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.390
see, n is 2, in this case--
the two-by-two identity

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.750
matrix-- what do I do?

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:20.470
I just subtract c from each
diagonal element this way

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.620
so the determinant of
that is this determinant.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.120
We already know how to expand
a two-by-two determinant.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.320
It's this times this
minus this times this.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.500
This is what? c
squared minus 2c.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.050
Plus 1 minus 4 is minus 3.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.780
This is c squared
minus 2c minus 3.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.140
And therefore, the only way
this determinant can be 0

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.580
is if this is 0.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.040
This factors into c
minus 3 times c plus 1.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.240
Therefore, it must be that
c is 3 or c is minus 1.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.630
In other words, the only
possible characteristic-- or,

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:57.970
eigenvalues, in this
problem, are 3 and minus 1.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.700
And we'll see what that means
in a moment in terms of looking

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.000
at these cases separately.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
You may have noticed I
made a slip of the tongue

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.720
and said characteristic
values instead of eigenvalues.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:12.130
You will find, in many
textbooks, the word eigenvalue.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.980
In other books, you'll
find characteristic value.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.650
These terms are used
interchangeably.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.590
Eigenvalue was the
German translation

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.150
of characteristic value.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.120
So use these terms
interchangeably, all right?

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.010
But let's take a
look at what happens

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.640
in this particular example,
in the case that c equals 3.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.810
If c equals 3, this
tells me that my vector v

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.050
is determined by f of
v is 3 times v, where

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.920
v is the 2-tuple x comma y.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.420
Writing out what this means
in terms of my matrix now,

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.985
my matrix A is 1, 4, 1, 1.

00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.340
v written as a column
vector is this.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.640
And 3 times this
column vector is this.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.980
Remembering that to compare
two matrices to be equal,

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.230
they must be equal
entry by entry,

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.870
the first entry of
this product is what?

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.450
It's x plus 4y.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.750
The second entry is x plus y.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.440
Therefore, it must be
that x plus 4y equals 3x,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.020
and x plus y equals 3y.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.470
And both of these two conditions
together say, quite simply,

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.440
that x equals 2y.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.230
And what does that tell us?

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.120
It says that if you take any
2-tuple of the form x comma y,

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.820
where x is twice y--

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:30.230
in other words, if you take the
set of all 2-tuples 2y comma y,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.570
these are eigenvectors.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.690
And they correspond
to the eigenvalue 3.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.740
And I'm going to show you that
pictorially in a few moments.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.690
I just want you to get
used to the computation

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.130
here for the time being.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.010
Secondly, if you want to
think of this geometrically,

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:50.840
x equals 2y doesn't have to
be viewed as a set of vectors.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.500
It can be viewed as
a line in the plane.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.190
And what this says is that
f preserves the direction

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.800
of the line x equals 2y.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.980
Oh, just as a quick
check over here--

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.780
whichever interpretation
you want--

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.020
notice that if you
replace x by 2y--

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.930
remember what the
definition of f was?

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.190
f was what?

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:17.330
f of x, y was x plus
4y comma x plus y.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:22.190
So if x is 2y, this
becomes 6y comma 3y.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.660
In other words, f of 2y
comma y is 6y comma 3y.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.200
That's the same as
3 times 2y comma y.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.640
And by the way, notice
that the special case

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.860
y equals 1 corresponded to
part of our example number

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.800
1, when we showed
that f bar of 2 comma

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.220
1 was three times 2 comma 1.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.980
In a similar way,
c equals minus 1

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.230
is the other
characteristic value.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.520
Namely, if c equals minus
1, the equation f of v

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.720
equals cv becomes f
of v equals minus v.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.710
And in matrix language,
that's AX equals minus X.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.710
Recalling what A and
X are from before,

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.390
remember, A times X will be
the column matrix x plus 4y,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.070
x plus y.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.970
Minus X is the column
matrix minus x minus y.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.020
Equating corresponding entries,
we get this pair of equations.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.730
And notice that both
of these equations

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.670
say that x must equal minus 2y.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.180
In other words, if the x
component is minus twice the y

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.430
component, relative
to the given basis

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.530
that we're talking
about here, notice

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:35.090
that the set of all 2-tuples
of the form minus 2y comma y

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.400
are eigenvectors,
in this case, and

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.420
the corresponding
eigenvalue is minus 1,

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.490
and that f preserves
the direction

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.990
of the line x equals minus 2y.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.010
And I think, now,
the time has come

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.450
to show you what
this thing means

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.270
in terms of a simple
geometric interpretation.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.400
Keep in mind, many
of the applications

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.070
of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors come up

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.010
in boundary value problems of
partial differential equations.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.130
I will show you, in
one of our exercises,

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.730
that even our linear homogeneous
differential equations may be

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.710
viewed as eigenvector problems.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.330
They come up in
many applications.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.730
But I'm saying, in terms
of the spirit of a game,

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.310
let's take the simplest
physical interpretation.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.970
And that's simply the mapping of
the xy-plane into the uv-plane.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.970
And all we're saying is
that the mapping f bar

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.550
that we're talking about-- what
mapping are we talking about?

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.130
The mapping that
carries x, y into--

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.720
what was it that's written down
here? x plus 4y comma x plus y.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.720
What that mapping does is
it changes the direction

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.430
of most lines in the plane.

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.880
But there are two lines that
it leaves alone in direction.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.870
Namely, the line x equal 2y
gets mapped into the line u

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:48.170
equals 2v, and the
line x equals minus 2y

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.200
gets mapped into the
line u equals minus 2v.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.770
By the way, notice we are not
saying that the points remain

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.790
fixed here.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.630
Remember that the characteristic
value corresponding

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.955
to this eigenvector was 3.

00:24:01.955 --> 00:24:05.780
In other words, notice
that 2 comma 1 doesn't get

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.670
mapped into 2 comma 1 here.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.340
It got mapped into 6 comma 3--

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.950
that the characteristic
value tells you,

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:17.660
once you know what directions
are preserved, how much

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.230
the vector was stretched out.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:25.250
In other words, 2i plus j get
stretched out into 6i plus 3j.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.500
Well, I'm not going to go
into that in any more detail

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.300
right now.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.220
All I do want to
observe is that, if I

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.230
was studying the
particular mapping f bar,

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.810
notice that the lines x equal
2y and x equal minus 2y are,

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:44.000
in a way, a better coordinate
system than the axes x and y,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.880
because notice that the
x-axis and the y-axis

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.880
have their directions
changed under this mapping.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.420
But x equals 2y and x
equals minus 2y don't

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.260
have their directions changed.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.230
In fact, to look at this
a different way, let's

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.630
pick a representative
vector from this line

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.610
and a representative
vector from this line.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.230
Let's take y to be 1.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.270
In this case, that
would say x is 2.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.355
In this case, it
says x is minus 2.

00:25:07.355 --> 00:25:12.010
Let's pick, as two new vectors,
alpha 1 to be 2i plus j

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.230
and alpha 2 to be
minus 2i plus j.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.750
And my claim is--

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.380
I'll write them
with arrows here,

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.630
as long as we are going to
think of this is a mapping.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.610
My claim is that
alpha 1 and alpha 2

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.000
is a very nice basis
for E2 with respect

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.560
to the linear transformation f.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.710
Well, y?

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.110
Well, what do we already
know about alpha 1?

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.320
Alpha 1 is an eigenvector
with characteristic value 3.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.720
In other words, f of
alpha 1 is 3 alpha 1.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.870
Alpha 2 is also an eigenvector
with characteristic value

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:45.020
minus 1.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.360
So f of alpha 2
is minus alpha 2.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.520
Notice, then, therefore, from
an algebraic point of view,

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.270
if I pick alpha 1 and alpha
2 as my bases for-- well,

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.770
I should be consistent here.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:01.600
I called this V. I suppose
it should have been E2,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.520
simply to match
the notation here.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.690
But that's not important.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.170
Suppose I pick alpha 1 and
alpha 2 to be my new bases.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:15.316
Notice, you see, that f of alpha
1 is 3 alpha 1 plus 0 alpha 2.

00:26:15.316 --> 00:26:21.900
f of alpha 2 is 0 alpha
1 minus 1 alpha 2.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:27.590
So my matrix of f, relative to
alpha 1 and alpha 2 as a basis,

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.470
would have its first
column being 3 and 0.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:34.230
It would have its second
column being 0 and minus 1.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:39.020
In other words, the matrix now
is a diagonal matrix, 3, 0, 0,

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.340
minus 1.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:44.390
It's not only a diagonal matrix,
but the diagonal elements

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.660
themselves yield
the eigenvalues.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:53.550
Notice how easy this matrix
is to use for computing--

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:58.530
A times X-- if X happens to be
written relative to the alphas,

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.770
because the easiest type
of matrix to multiply by

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.900
is a diagonal matrix.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.520
And I'm not going to go through
this here, but when you write--

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.260
when you pick the basis
consisting of eigenvalues,

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.960
eigenvectors, and write
this diagonal matrix,

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.600
the resulting diagonal
matrix gives you

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.240
a tremendous amount
of insight as to what

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.710
the space looks like.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.900
And I'll bring that
out in the exercises.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.390
All I want you to get
out of this overview

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.510
is what eigenvectors are
and how we compute them.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.510
And I thought that,
to finish up with,

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.980
I would like to give you a very,
very profound result, which

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.700
I won't prove for you,
but which I will state--

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.500
has, also, a profound name.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.120
But I'll get to
that in a moment.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.950
I call this an important aside.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.540
It really isn't an aside.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:53.200
It's the backbone of much
of advanced matrix algebra.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.810
But the interesting
thing is this.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.540
Remember, given an
n-by-n matrix A,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.700
we were fooling
around with looking

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:05.040
at the determinant of
A minus cI equaling 0

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.037
and trying to find a scalar
c that would do this for us.

00:28:08.037 --> 00:28:09.870
That's how we get the
characteristic values.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.520
A was the given matrix.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.560
I was the given identity matrix.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.870
c was a scalar
whose value we were

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:21.270
trying to get the determinant
of this matrix to be 0.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.980
The amazing point is that
if you substitute the matrix

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.885
A for c, in this equation, it
will satisfy this equation.

00:28:30.885 --> 00:28:32.790
And what do I mean by that?

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:38.790
Just replace c by A over here,
and this equation is satisfied.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.470
By the way, that
may look trivial.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.510
You may say to me, gee, whiz.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.440
What a big deal.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.720
If I take c and
replace it by A, this

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.760
is A times the
identity matrix, which

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.050
is still A. A minus
A is the zero matrix.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.000
And the determinant of the
zero matrix is clearly 0.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.930
The metaphysical thing here
is, notice that c is a number.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.380
It's a scalar.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.650
And A is a matrix.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.620
Structurally, you
cannot let c equal A.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.620
All we're saying is
a remarkable result,

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.830
that if you mechanically
replace c by A,

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.290
this equation is satisfied.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.680
And before I illustrate that for
you, I've made a big decision.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.328
I'm going to tell you what
this theorem is called.

00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:24.120
I wasn't originally
going to tell you that.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.700
It's called the
Cayley-Hamilton theorem.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.270
And by my telling you this
name, you now know as much

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.740
about the subject as I do.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.390
That's why I didn't want to
tell you what the name was,

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.910
so I'd still know something
more than you did about it.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.770
But that's not too important.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.840
Let me illustrate
how this thing works.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.120
Let's go back to our matrix
1, 4, 1, 1, all right?

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.920
The determinant of A
minus cI, we already saw,

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.770
was c squared minus 2c minus 3.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:58.070
My claim is, if I
replace c by A in here,

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.410
this will still be obeyed, only
with one slight modification.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:02.480
See, this becomes what?

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.030
A squared minus 2A.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.900
And I can't write minus 3,
because 3 is a number, not

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.740
a matrix.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.390
It's always
understood, when you're

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:16.440
converting to matrix form,
that the I is over here.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.900
And if you want to
see why, you can

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:23.060
think of this as being A to the
0, and think of the number 1

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.070
as being c to the 0.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.690
In other words,
structurally, this

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.840
is A squared minus 2A
minus 3A to the 0 power.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:35.000
This is c squared minus
2c minus 3c to the 0.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.790
And my claim is
that this equation

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.130
will be obeyed by the matrix A.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.240
Let's just check it out
and see if it's true.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.180
Remember that A was
the matrix 1, 4, 1, 1.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.660
To square it means
multiply it by itself.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.960
If I go through the usual
recipe for multiplying

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.570
two two-by-two
matrices, I very quickly

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.460
see that the product
is 5, 8, 2, 5.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:01.490
Notice that, since A is 1, 4,
1, 1, multiplying by minus 2

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.840
multiplies each
entry by minus 2.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.540
So minus 2A is this matrix.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.620
Notice that minus 3
times the identity matrix

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.210
is a diagonal matrix
that has minus 3

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.580
as each main diagonal element--

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.040
in other words,
this matrix here.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.550
And notice, now, just
for the sake of argument,

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.250
if I add these
up, what do I get?

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:26.720
5 minus 2 minus 3, which
is 0, 8 minus 8 plus 0,

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.820
which is 0, 2 minus 2 plus 0,
which is 0, 5 minus 2 minus 3,

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.720
which is 0.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.910
In other words, this sum
is the zero matrix, not

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.710
the zero number.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.190
You see, technically speaking
here, in this equation here,

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.190
the 0 refers to a number,
because the determinant

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:47.400
is a number.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.010
But here, we're
talking about, it

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:52.100
satisfied in matrix language.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.910
And what this means is
that matrices can now

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.035
be reduced by long division.

00:31:59.035 --> 00:32:00.660
So I'll give you a
very simple example.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.880
But what the main
impact of this is,

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.710
I can now invent power
series of matrices.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.410
In other words, I can
define e to the x, where

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.520
x is a matrix, to be 1
plus x plus x squared over

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.600
2 factorial plus x cubed over 3
factorial, et cetera, the same

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.220
as we did in scalar cases.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.940
And the main reason is that,
once I'm given a matrix,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.520
and I find the basic polynomial
equation that it satisfies,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.800
I can reduce every
matrix to that.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.360
Let me give you an example.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.040
The key thing I want
you to keep in mind

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.400
here is that we already know,
for this particular matrix A,

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.140
that A squared minus 2A
minus 3I is the zero matrix.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.747
Suppose, now, I wanted
to compute A cubed.

00:32:45.747 --> 00:32:47.330
Now, in this assignment
here I'm going

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.480
to show you how I can reduce
matrices by long division.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.820
And in the exercises,
I'll actually

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.740
do the long division for you.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.250
But what is long division
in factoring form?

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:03.180
What I'm saying is, I know that
A squared minus 2A minus 3I

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.380
is 0.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.930
So I would like to write
A cubed in such a way

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:10.350
that I can factor out an A
squared minus 2A minus 3I.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.950
The way I do that is I notice
that I must multiply A squared

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.560
by A in order to get A cubed.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.920
The trouble is, when I
multiply, I now have a minus 2A

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.350
squared on the right-hand
side that I don't want,

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.580
because it's not here.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.100
And I have a minus 3A on the
right-hand side that I don't

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.970
want, because it's not here.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.740
So to compensate for that, I
simply add on a 2A squared,

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.030
and I add on a 3A.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:34.530
In other words,
even though this may

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.120
look like a funny
way of doing it,

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.140
a very funny way of writing A
cubed is this expression here.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.290
And the reason that I
choose this expression is,

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:49.170
notice that this being 0 means
that A cubed is just 2A squared

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.060
plus 3A.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.690
Moreover, notice that I can
still get the structural form A

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:59.760
squared minus 2A minus 3I out
of this thing by writing it.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.730
Seeing that my first term here
is going to be 2A squared--

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.220
so I put a 2 over here--

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.860
this gives me my 2A
squared, which I want.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.929
This gives me a minus 4A.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.659
But I want to have
a plus 3A, so I add

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.510
on 7A to compensate for that.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.120
This gives me a minus 6I,
which I don't have up here.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.050
So to wipe that
out, I add on a 6I.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.270
In other words, another
way of writing I cubed,

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.600
therefore, is this plus this.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:32.010
And since this is 0, this
says that A cubed is nothing

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.770
more than 7A plus 6I.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.969
In fact, in this
particular case,

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:40.710
notice that any power
of A can be reduced

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.340
to a linear
combination of A and I,

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:48.120
because as long as I have even
a quadratic power in here,

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.330
I can continue my long division.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.650
It's just like
finding a remainder

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.270
in ordinary long division.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:58.620
You keep on going until
the remainder is of a lower

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.835
degree than the divisor.

00:35:00.835 --> 00:35:02.460
In this particular
case, I've shown you

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.070
that A cubed is 7A plus 6I.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.440
And I picked an easy case
just so we could check it.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.060
Notice that we already know
that A squared is 5, 8, 2, 5.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.920
A is 1, 4, 1, 1.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.200
So A cubed is this times this.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.450
Multiplying these
two-by-two's together,

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.640
I get this particular matrix.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.890
On the other hand, knowing
that A is 1, 4, 1, 1, 7A

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:31.230
is this matrix, 6I
is this matrix--

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.600
and if I now add 7A and 6I--

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.620
how do I add?

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.030
Component-by-component.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:43.940
I get 7 plus 6, which is 13, 28
plus 0, which is 28, 7 plus 0,

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.480
which is 7, 7 plus
6, which is 13.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:53.130
In other words, 7A plus 6I is,
indeed, A cubed, as asserted.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.570
And I think you can see now
why I wanted to end here.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.950
From here on in, the course
becomes a very, very technical

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:03.980
subject and one that's
used best in conjunction

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.370
with advanced math courses that
are using these techniques.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.710
So we come to the end of part 2.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.780
I want to tell you what
an enjoyable experience

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.550
it was teaching you all.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.950
If nothing else, as I
told you after part 1,

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.670
I emerge smarter, because it
takes a lot of preparation

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.680
to get these boards pre-written.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.720
I couldn't do it alone,
and I would like--

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.050
in addition to the camera
people, the floor people,

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:30.540
there are three people who work
very closely with this project

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.090
that I would like to single out.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:34.490
I would like to thank,
especially, John Fitch, who

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.270
is the manager of our self-study
project, who also doubles

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:42.970
in as director and producer
of the tape, the film series,

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.320
and is also my advisor
for the study guide

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.640
and things of the like.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.340
I would like to thank
Charles Patton, who

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.960
is the one responsible the
most for the clear pictures

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.320
and the excellent photogenic
features that you notice of me,

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.240
the sharpness of the camera.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:03.080
I would also like to thank
Elise Pelletier, who,

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.660
in addition to being
a very able secretary,

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.930
doubles in in the master control
room as the master everything,

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:12.620
from running the video tape
recorder to making hasty phone

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.600
calls and things of this type.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.660
I would also like to thank
two other colleagues, Arthur

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.330
[INAUDIBLE] and Paul Brown,
administrative offices

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.540
at the center, who have provided
me most excellent working

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.750
conditions, and finally,
Harold [INAUDIBLE],, who

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.760
was the first
director of the center

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.540
and whose idea it was to
produce Calculus Revisited Part

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.430
1 and Part 2.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.910
It has been my pleasure.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:38.560
I hope that our
paths cross again.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.880
But until such a time,
God bless you all.

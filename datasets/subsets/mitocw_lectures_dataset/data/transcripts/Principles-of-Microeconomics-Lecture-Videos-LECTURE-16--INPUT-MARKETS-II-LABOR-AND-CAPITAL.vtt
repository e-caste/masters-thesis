JONATHAN GRUBER: All
right, let's get started.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.219
Today, we're going to continue
our discussion of factor

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.400
markets.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.580
If you recall, last
Monday, we started

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.190
talking about the labor market.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.640
And we talked about how workers
make the decision between work

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.750
and leisure.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.340
And we talked about
the implications

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.090
for setting the wage
rate in the labor market.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.440
What I want to do today is
return to that labor market

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.960
equilibrium and talk
about the important case

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.580
of the minimum wage.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.920
So today, I want to talk about
the labor market equilibrium

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.730
and how it's affected
by the minimum wage

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.670
because it's an interesting case
which allows us to introduce

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.980
some complications as to how we
think about the labor market.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.580
So let's go back and think
about the labor market.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.705
So let's go to figure 16-1.

00:00:59.283 --> 00:01:00.950
The labor market,
like any other market,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.160
has a price and a quantity.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.952
The quantity is the
amount of labor supply.

00:01:03.952 --> 00:01:05.510
That's on the x-axis.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.510
The price is the wage.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.460
That's on the y-axis.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.990
The supply curve
that's upward sloping--

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.550
typically we'll assume an
upward-sloping supply curve.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.230
But as we discussed last time,
that doesn't have to be true.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.750
If income effects dominate
substitution effects, which

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.310
they very well may,
you could actually

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.840
have a backward-bending or
downward-sloping supply curve.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.490
So we talked about
that last time.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.093
Having taught that
interesting case,

00:01:30.093 --> 00:01:31.760
typically, we'll
assume supply is upward

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.790
sloping or at least
not backwards bending,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.770
not downward sloping.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.342
But remember, that's
an assumption.

00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:39.800
So this upward-sloping
supply curve

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.730
is not necessarily as obvious
as a downward-sloping demand

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.440
curve is.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.190
Downward-sloping demand
will almost always

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.648
exist unless there's
a weird Giffen

00:01:47.648 --> 00:01:49.580
good, whereas
upward-sloping supply is

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.297
a little more questionable.

00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:53.630
So we have the equilibrium,
and we have this equilibrium

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.200
at L1 workers at a wage W1.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.830
So now we know where
this comes from.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.470
So basically, going
all the way back

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.560
to producer theory where
we just gave you a W,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.295
now we're telling
where the W comes from.

00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:07.670
We're telling you where the
wage comes from that you then

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.270
plug into the firm's
optimization for them

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.910
to produce goods.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.880
Now, let's imagine that
we have a minimum wage.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.020
So let's go to figure 16-2.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.230
So this is a
regulation which says

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.150
that you're not
allowed to pay workers

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.460
below some minimum level.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.590
And let's say we set that
minimum wage at the level W2

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.470
above the market wage W1.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.490
Quick question.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.260
What would happen
if we passed a law

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.623
and set a minimum wage
that was below W1?

00:02:39.623 --> 00:02:41.290
So there'd be a
regulation which insists

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.400
you couldn't pay workers
below W2, but W2 is below W1.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.040
What would that do
to the labor market?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.700
Nothing.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.500
And here's the key point.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.720
Markets in economics
will always endeavor

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.450
to avoid government
regulations if they can.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.720
So if a government regulation
is not binding, it won't matter.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.755
Markets will just avoid it.

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:03.130
So the interesting case is
only where the minimum wage is

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.140
binding, as in the figure 16-2.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.890
So what happens?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.770
Well, if you set a
minimum wage at W2,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.718
workers at that high wage
would love to work a lot.

00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:17.510
That's a high wage.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.980
They're high in
the supply curve.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.670
They would like to
work L sub s hours.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.380
They would like to
supply L sub s amount

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.450
of labor supply to the market.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.240
Firms, however, if forced
to pay a high wage,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.290
W2, are going to
say, wait, I'm only

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.980
going to pay that high wage if
the marginal revenue product

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.450
of labor is sufficiently high.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.010
Remember, we talked about the
marginal revenue of product

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.760
last time.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.643
It's the marginal product
of labor times the price.

00:03:42.643 --> 00:03:44.310
So if you're going
to raise the wage I'm

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.680
going to have to pay workers,
unless that affects the market

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.590
price, I'm going to need to
have a higher marginal product

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.030
of labor, right?

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.100
The demand equation
was, I said, the wage

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.315
equal to the marginal product
of labor times the price.

00:03:57.315 --> 00:03:58.690
Well, if the price
hasn't changed

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.302
with the minimum
wage going in, I'm

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:02.260
going to need a high--
if the wage is forced up

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.420
by the minimum wage, I'm
going to need a higher

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.860
marginal product of labor.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.200
How do I get a higher
marginal product of labor?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.620
By hiring less workers because
the marginal product of labor's

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.920
diminishing.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.220
So if you're going to force
me to pay a higher wage,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.959
you're going to force
me to only hire workers

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.910
until the point where the
marginal product of labor

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.800
justifies that higher
wage, which means I'm

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.870
going to hire fewer workers.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.110
So firms demand only L sub d.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.270
Well, workers can't get jobs
firms don't want to give.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.760
So the equilibrium is L sub
d jobs at a wage W sub 2, OK?

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.350
What does this do to welfare?

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.070
We can see before, before the
minimum wage was in place,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.750
the market featured a consumer
surplus that-- here, consumers

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.010
are firms, right?

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.190
But there was a consumer
surplus of A plus B plus C.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.410
That is, firms
were willing to pay

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.030
what was on the demand curve.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.950
They only had to pay W1.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.830
So their surplus
was A plus B plus C.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.700
Workers were willing to
work at a wage that's given

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.130
by the supply curve S sub 1.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.380
They were paid at W sub 1.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.960
So they got a
surplus of D plus E.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.240
So here, the firms get
the consumer surplus.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.800
The workers get the
producer surplus

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.360
because the workers
are now the producers.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.430
Now let's say you roll
in a set minimum wage.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.230
Well, two things have happened.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.770
One thing is you've then
transferred some resources

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.640
to workers.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.570
That's the area B. You've taken
the area B that firms used

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.310
to get, and now workers get it.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.070
That's the idea.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.040
You want to make
workers better off.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.230
So you transferred to
workers the area B.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.350
On the other hand, you've
created a deadweight loss

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.590
of the area C plus
E. You've created

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.340
deadweight loss in
the area C plus E

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.100
because now there
are fewer jobs.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.930
There are workers
who would happily

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.480
work at a higher
wage who are not

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.180
being allowed to work by
the limited demand that

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.940
comes from the minimum wage.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.830
So the bottom line is you end
up with fewer workers, a higher

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.230
wage, and ambiguous
welfare implications.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.480
Clearly, social
welfare goes down.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.370
Whether worker
welfare goes up or not

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.010
depends a bit on the size of
area B versus the size of area

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.730
E. It's not clear if worker
surplus goes up or not.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.160
It depends on size of B
versus E. In this diagram,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.710
workers are a net better off,
but it doesn't have to be true.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.700
What's clear is that social
welfare has gone down.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.200
Because remember,
as I talked about,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.408
the cheat, the shortcut I
talked about when we talked

00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:35.430
about oligopoly, is,
roughly speaking,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.330
welfare is proportional to
the quantity in the market.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.830
Essentially, the
further you deviate

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.230
from the perfectly
competitive quantity,

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.263
the bigger the deadweight loss.

00:06:45.263 --> 00:06:47.430
So that's what happens if
you put in a minimum wage.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.050
Questions about that?

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.700
OK?

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.820
Well, that seems
pretty straightforward,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.320
and that's what I
learned growing up

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.420
as a kid in economics class.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.432
But then some empirical
economists, some very famous

00:06:58.432 --> 00:06:59.890
empirical economists,
started doing

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.340
a series of articles that
actually studied, gee,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.030
what happens when the
minimum wage does change.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.590
They did things
like, for example,

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.290
comparing what happened
when New Jersey raised

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.500
its minimum wage but the state
of Pennsylvania next door

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.433
did not, and looked at fast
food workers in New Jersey,

00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:20.100
where the minimum
wage went up, compared

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.180
to fast food workers
in Pennsylvania

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.310
where the minimum
wage didn't go up.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.040
And what they found was
there was no difference

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.850
in employment, that jobs
didn't fall in New Jersey

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.180
even though the
minimum wage went up.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.680
And a series of
follow-on studies

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.860
continue to find that, actually,
higher minimum wages didn't

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.560
seem to cause jobs to
fall, which is directly

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.300
in contradiction
with this graph.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.130
So what's going on?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.855
That led to a big
question and revision

00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:50.930
of what's going on in these
markets that leads to that.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.970
And there's really
three possibilities

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.590
for what's going on.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.270
Possibility one is that the
minimum wage wasn't binding.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.370
Maybe New Jersey set a minimum
wage below the market wage.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.540
But actually, empirically,
that's not true.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.140
We can look at what workers were
paid before the minimum wage.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.180
It was well below where
the minimum wage was

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.190
set for restaurant
workers that were studied

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.367
in that most famous study.

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:17.200
So this is not true.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.280
The minimum wage was binding.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.900
There's a second
possibility that's

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.710
absolutely consistent with a
perfectly competitive market.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.470
What's a possible
answer for why I

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.970
could impose a minimum wage in
a perfectly competitive labor

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.881
market and have
employment not go down?

00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:33.381
Yeah?

00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:35.370
AUDIENCE: Price goes up.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.780
JONATHAN GRUBER: The price
that the firm charges goes up.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.530
But in a perfect
competitive labor market,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.480
that still wouldn't happen.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.980
You might see some
price adjustment,

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.438
but you'd still
see some adjustment

00:08:45.438 --> 00:08:46.830
in the marginal
product of labor.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.110
But what else
about this diagram?

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.640
Yeah.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.952
AUDIENCE: The firm's demand for
labor is perfectly inelastic.

00:08:51.952 --> 00:08:54.160
JONATHAN GRUBER: The firm's--
actually, you're close.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.690
It'd be the worker's supply of
labor is perfectly inelastic.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.620
It's the right idea.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.170
If workers are perfectly
inelastic in their supply

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.540
of labor, then the
same amount of workers

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.110
will work no matter
what the wage.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:12.290
So basically, you're just
going to essentially end up--

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.290
you'd also, in fact--
that's a good point-- also

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.832
get inelastic demand,
the same thing.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.370
If either supply or
demand is inelastic,

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.450
you'll end up with no
effect of a minimum wage.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.920
So that's another possibility.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.890
But in fact, we've
done a lot of studies.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:34.970
So you could have
inelastic supply or demand.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.810
But in fact, we've done lots
of studies of supply and demand

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.810
in these markets,
and that's not true.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.060
Remember, supply was
largely inelastic for men,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.030
but it was somewhat
elastic for women.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.500
And these low-income
markets have

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.050
a good mix of men and
women working in them.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.270
Demand has been shown
to be somewhat elastic.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.850
So neither supply nor
demand's very elastic,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.040
but they're sufficiently elastic
that that rules out as zero.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.880
So the third possibility and the
one economists have focused on

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.070
is that we're not in a
competitive labor market.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:13.060
They're focused on a
noncompetitive labor market.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.150
Just like we discussed
noncompetitive markets

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.120
for goods with a
monopoly and oligopoly,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.990
you can have noncompetitive
markets for labor.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.260
It's the basic same idea.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.460
So now let's look at--

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.260
so when we thought
about-- let's go back,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.570
think about perfect
competition, the basics

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.848
of perfect competition.

00:10:32.848 --> 00:10:34.390
We thought about
perfect competition.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.700
The basic idea was, remember,
I talked about laying out

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.330
a bunch of rugs in a market
where you could literally

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.760
shop costlessly across
all the people selling

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.450
their little fake Eiffel towers,
little statue Eiffel towers.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.680
And you could perfectly shop.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.125
It was easy to go
from carpet to carpet.

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:51.250
There was full information.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.760
The prices were posted.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.760
And so basically
what you ended up

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.680
was perfectly elastic demand
facing any given firm.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.780
Any given firm, if
they tried to charge

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.630
one cent more for their Eiffel
tower, no one would buy it.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.980
If they charged one cent less,
they'd immediately run out.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.420
Everyone'd buy it.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.787
Well, when we are
modeling labor markets--

00:11:12.787 --> 00:11:14.870
and I discussed this last
time, but not very well.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.240
So I want to come back to it.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.980
When we're modeling
labor markets,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.560
we're thinking about the same
feature of perfect competition.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:28.820
But here, it's not
consumers shopping

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.320
over where to buy their goods.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.040
It's workers shopping
over where to work.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.980
It's workers saying, gee, in
a perfectly competitive labor

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.180
market, the idea is I know
what I could earn at any firm

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.130
and I can easily
shop across firms,

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.690
see where I'm going to work.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.020
So if any firm tried to pay me
one cent less than the market

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.230
wage, I'd never work there.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.090
And if they tried to pay me one
cent more than the market wage,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.710
every worker in the world
would want to work there.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.100
So in a perfectly
competitive labor market,

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:03.410
any given firm faces a perfectly
elastic supply of labor.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.481
So we can see that
in figure 16-4,

00:12:06.481 --> 00:12:09.064
which we actually showed-- and
I'll let you skip this since we

00:12:09.064 --> 00:12:09.564
covered it--

00:12:09.564 --> 00:12:12.410
16-4, which I actually
showed in the last lecture.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.510
Remember the last lecture.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.820
I was focused on this
downward-sloping demand curve,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.430
but I casually threw in
this flat labor supply curve

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.080
and botched explaining it.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.720
Now I'm explaining it,
hopefully more clearly, which

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.850
is to any given firm,
the labor supply curve

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:35.330
is perfectly elastic because
workers can perfectly

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.290
shop across job opportunities.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.450
So if that firm tried to pay
less, they'd get no workers.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:46.100
So they faced a perfectly
elastic supply of labor.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.680
But just like, in
reality, there's

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.265
no such thing as a perfectly
competitive product market,

00:12:51.265 --> 00:12:52.640
in reality, there's
no such thing

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.770
as a perfectly
competitive labor market.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:59.060
In fact, we can't shop easily
across all possible jobs

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.430
and know what every
job could pay.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:06.200
And the fact that we can't means
that firms on the labor market

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.270
side will have market power.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.940
Just like we talked about
monopolists and oligopolists

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.620
having market power
over consumers

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.410
through barriers to
entry, firms will

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.160
have market power over workers
because workers can't perfectly

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.520
shop across their
job alternatives.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.570
So as a result, firms
may be able to get away

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.883
with paying you less than
what you might earn elsewhere.

00:13:32.883 --> 00:13:34.550
In a perfectly
competitive labor market,

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.930
a firm could never
pay you less than what

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:37.850
you're worth elsewhere
because you'd just

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.170
go work somewhere else.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.200
But now, if McDonald's wants to
pay you less than you might get

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.260
at Wendy's, but it's hard to
go find out what Wendy's going

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.690
to pay you-- you have to go
a distance down the road,

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.430
and you have to ask
them, and you're shy

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.950
and it's embarrassing-- then
McDonald's might be able to get

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.480
away with paying you less than
you might earn at Wendy's.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.880
So this is very much
parallel to monopoly.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.520
In fact, we call
this a monopsony.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.300
A monopsony is a
labor market where

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.270
firms have market
power over workers

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.230
just like a monopoly is a
goods market where firms have

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.800
market power over consumers.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.900
Now, this is not so crazy.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.980
And in fact, it applies
very much to me.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.350
Think about my situation at MIT.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:28.490
I've been here 25 years.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.130
I just got my 25th
year rocking chair,

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.880
although actually it's
not a rocking chair

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.102
because it comes in the box
with the rockers off it.

00:14:34.102 --> 00:14:36.560
And it arrived in my office,
so it's sort of a short chair.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.658
My wife's 5 foot, and
she always complains

00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:39.950
how chairs are too big for her.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.790
So she sat, and she's like,
it's a perfect chair for me.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.998
So now I have a nonrocking
rocking chair in my office

00:14:43.998 --> 00:14:44.810
that she sits in.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.740
But anyway, I've been
at MIT for 25 years.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.710
It's going to be really
hard for me to move.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.845
I like my house.

00:14:51.845 --> 00:14:52.720
I like my colleagues.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.440
I like my friends.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.810
Kind of, I like my
view out the window.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.090
It's going to be kind
of hard for me to move.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.220
Moreover, it'd be pretty
hard for me to figure out

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.870
what I'd get paid if I moved.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.770
I can't go to other
universities and say,

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.870
hey, what would you
pay me if you hired me?

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.490
That's be awkward.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.490
I can't really ask my
colleagues what they make.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.080
That's awkward.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.220
So at the end of the day,
MIT has market power over me

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.343
because I don't
really want to move

00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:19.760
and I can't really
figure out what

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.070
I'd get paid if I did move.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.170
And MIT will exploit
that market power over me

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.280
by paying me less than
I might earn elsewhere.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.360
And we know this as a
fact because in academia,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.480
the only way to get a raise is
to go get an offer from someone

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.710
else and have them say how
much more they'll pay you,

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.618
and then you take that to your
boss and they say, match this.

00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:43.160
But if you're not
willing to do this,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.760
as, frankly, MIT knows
I'm not willing to do,

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.830
then MIT can
essentially underpay me.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.270
So basically, any
responsible profit-maximizing

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.020
or even nonprofit employer
will exploit this market power

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:01.380
and they'll pay me less
than my market wage.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.120
And that means that MIT
will earn surplus on me.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.370
In a perfectly
competitive labor market,

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.680
the firm earns no
surplus on the worker.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.080
They pay the worker their
marginal revenue product.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.750
So if you go to this figure,
what am I paying the worker?

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.990
What I'm paying them is
exactly the marginal revenue

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.890
product just like, in
a competitive market

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:28.745
for the goods, a firm is selling
at exactly their marginal cost.

00:16:28.745 --> 00:16:30.870
So just like a firm makes
no surplus in a perfectly

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.710
competitive goods market,
a firm hiring workers

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.270
makes no surplus in a
competitive labor market.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.620
But in a monopsony market, the
firm makes surplus over me.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.590
They pay me less than they'd
have to because I don't shop

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.330
and find a better opportunity.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.817
Now, are there questions
about how that market works?

00:16:49.817 --> 00:16:51.650
I'm not going to do all
the math and graphs.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.960
It's all the same as monopoly,
just flipping demand and supply

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.190
curves.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.340
It's a pain in the ass.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.390
I'm not going to do it.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.910
I just want you guys to
understand the intuition.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.750
So please, since I
went through this,

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.880
are there questions about
this or how it works?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.660
OK.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.045
Now let's take this
noncompetitive labor market

00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:11.220
and let's throw
in a minimum wage.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.859
Well, as before,
if the minimum wage

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.900
is below what the firm
was already paying,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.947
there's no effect.

00:17:16.947 --> 00:17:18.780
So let's assume it's a
binding minimum wage.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.210
Now, let's say the
binding minimum wage

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.990
is above what my true
market wage would be,

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.510
what my wage would be in the
perfectly competitive market.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.400
So in a perfectly
competitive market,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.110
my wage would equal my marginal
revenue product of labor,

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.550
right?

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.530
That's in a competitive market.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.190
In this noncompetitive
market, my wage

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.560
is below my marginal
revenue product of labor.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.440
Firms are exploiting me
because I can't effectively

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.677
shop for a better job.

00:17:52.677 --> 00:17:54.260
I don't want to or
it's hard to do so.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.040
Now, in this
noncompetitive market,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.560
if we set a minimum
wage that's higher

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.570
than the marginal
revenue product of labor,

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.840
then the analysis is just
like it's a competitive firm.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.280
Once that marginal
wage is higher

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.072
than the marginal
revenue product of labor,

00:18:12.072 --> 00:18:15.450
it's just like a
competitive firm.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.670
So it's not that interesting.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.870
The interesting case is, what
if the minimum wage comes in

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:25.740
and it's above the wage I make
but below the marginal revenue

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.250
product of labor?

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.910
So let's say McDonald's,
someone working there

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.030
yields a marginal revenue
product of labor of $10,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.550
but they're only being paid $7.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.100
Let's say you roll in
minimum wage of $9--

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.930
so above what they're
being paid now,

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.390
but below their actual marginal
revenue product of labor.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.520
Will the firm fire that worker?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.456
Why not?

00:18:49.456 --> 00:18:50.908
Yeah.

00:18:50.908 --> 00:18:53.823
AUDIENCE: They're still paying
them-- they're still making

00:18:53.823 --> 00:18:55.293
a profit off of that worker.

00:18:55.293 --> 00:18:57.210
JONATHAN GRUBER: They're
still making surplus,

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.600
which is as long as the
marginal product of labor's

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.990
bigger than the wage,
they love that worker.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.740
So before-- so let's write
down the numbers as an example.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.880
So imagine my marginal revenue
product of labor at McDonald's

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.660
is $10, but my wage is $7.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.370
And then you come and you
set a minimum wage of $9.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.950
Well, 10 is still
greater than 9.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.430
So the firm has no
desire to fire me.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.130
So all you've done is
just given me money.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.640
And where'd that
money come from?

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.700
The surplus the firm earned.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.330
So all you've done is
shifted the surplus from--

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.960
you've shifted producer
surplus to consumer--

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.980
I'm sorry, consumer surplus--
consumers are the firms--

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.440
to producer surplus,
the workers.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.430
So in a monopsony
market, a minimum wage

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.350
doesn't cause deadweight loss.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.750
It just shifts surplus around.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.670
And that's a really
important outcome

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.130
because that, once again,
says the government isn't

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.500
always bad here.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.390
This is just like--
if you want to think

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.240
about this graphically, go
back to exactly the analysis we

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.070
did of regulating monopolies.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.470
Remember we talked about
regulating monopolies.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:17.810
We talked about, if a regulator
comes in and sets a price

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:21.680
below the monopoly price but
above the competitive price,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.500
it reduced the deadweight
loss of monopoly.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.410
It's the same thing.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.970
And if you set a minimum
wage above the market wage

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.460
but below the marginal
revenue product of labor,

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.710
then you simply transfer
surplus to workers

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.270
without causing deadweight loss.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.050
Now, that raised the
question, of course,

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.760
is the minimum wage
in between the wage

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.340
of the marginal
product of labor?

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.140
Well, we don't know,
but let's go back

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.910
to the studies that
motivated this.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.440
The very fact that
the minimum wage

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.940
doesn't seem to
cause unemployment

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.900
suggests we are
hitting the sweet spot,

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.570
suggests we are hitting
the sweet spot, that we're

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.510
basically managing, with the
minimum wage policy, at least

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.570
to date, to essentially
just find a way,

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.370
without the government
spending any money,

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.700
to shift resources from
businesses to workers.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.390
So what does this mean?

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:13.090
Well, it means that around the
level of current minimum wages,

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.620
we can raise the minimum
wage by a small amount pretty

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.840
costlessly.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.728
It doesn't necessarily mean
that a $15 minimum wage is OK.

00:21:20.728 --> 00:21:22.270
So in some sense,
the existing-- this

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.150
is the important thing
about empirical economics.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.580
You only learn the answer in
the range that you study it.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.200
So for example,
there've been studies

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.320
that have looked at what happens
if you have a $10 minimum wage,

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.848
and those show no unemployment.

00:21:33.848 --> 00:21:35.890
There haven't been studies
that show what happens

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.870
if you have a $15 minimum wage.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.720
Now, Seattle just actually
put in a $15 minimum wage

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.777
about two years ago.

00:21:41.777 --> 00:21:43.360
So we actually can
run the experiment.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.590
And the early evidence
is the Seattle $15

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.390
minimum wage did lower
employment, that the Seattle

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.360
$15 minimum wage actually went
above the marginal revenue

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.830
product of labor.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.945
And once it's above, you're
back in the competitive case.

00:21:57.945 --> 00:22:00.320
You're back in the case where
you're lowering employment.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:00.980
Yeah?

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.848
AUDIENCE: How can you increase
competitiveness in the market?

00:22:04.848 --> 00:22:06.890
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that's the other question,

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.200
is how could you
increase-- so you tell me.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.950
How could you increase
the competitiveness

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.840
of a labor market?

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.450
AUDIENCE: You make it easier
to tell how much money you

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:17.870
would get at each place.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.320
JONATHAN GRUBER: So Norway
has a day every year

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.110
they call Envy Day,
which was yesterday,

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.960
I believe, where they literally
can go online and look up

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.240
anybody's income in Norway.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.270
They literally make public
every single person's tax return

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.770
in Norway.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.540
And you can go online and
look at what everybody makes.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.900
That would do it.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.150
So you could provide
more information.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.130
You could make it easier
to move between jobs.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.422
For example, there's a lot
of restrictions in our labor

00:22:45.422 --> 00:22:48.110
market, like noncompete
clauses, which

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.760
say that if you
work for one firm,

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.385
you can't ever go
work for another firm

00:22:51.385 --> 00:22:54.260
in that industry for x years.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.125
That gives some monopsony
power to firms, et cetera.

00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:59.750
So we could do things which try
to loosen the flow of the labor

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:03.680
market, and that would
close this gap between wage

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.650
and marginal revenue
product of labor.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.020
Now, let's go back to Seattle,
just to conclude this.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.870
This doesn't mean the
Seattle policy was a bad one.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.420
The bottom line is what
we learned from Seattle

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:20.360
was that basically,
employment fell a small amount

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.100
and a bunch of workers
made a bunch more money.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.070
So is that good or bad?

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.600
Well, it depends.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.600
If you're one of the
people that lost their job,

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.345
it's really bad.

00:23:27.345 --> 00:23:29.970
If you're one of the workers who
got a raise up to $15 an hour,

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:30.930
it's good.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.670
How do you weigh them
against each other?

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.400
That's exactly what we'll talk
about in a couple lectures.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.720
So once we start talking
about normative economics,

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.480
about is a policy good or bad,
there's typically trade-offs.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.988
And this is a classic example.

00:23:43.988 --> 00:23:46.530
What we're learning here is, is
the minimum wage in the range

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:51.930
we are now, right now, the
federal minimum wage at $7.25--

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.020
the evidence suggests
it could easily rise

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.767
without causing that trade-off.

00:23:56.767 --> 00:23:58.350
The evidence suggest
we could increase

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:02.120
the federal minimum wage
by some nontrivial amount,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.980
at least up to $9 or
$10, without causing

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.150
much of a trade-off.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.800
But once you get too
far ahead of that,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.817
there starts to be a trade-off.

00:24:09.817 --> 00:24:10.650
Question about that?

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.200
Yeah.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.360
AUDIENCE: Are there any states
where it's actually still

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:14.987
that low?

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:16.070
JONATHAN GRUBER: Oh, yeah.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.650
Many states don't have
their own minimum wage.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.242
Massachusetts is at $11,
but we're pretty unusual.

00:24:22.242 --> 00:24:23.450
We're one of the higher ones.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:27.990
A number of states have $7.25
as the minimum wage, OK?

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.490
And the evidence seems to be,
from states like Massachusetts

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.138
and others which are on the
$10, $11 range, it doesn't

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:34.180
seem to lower employment.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.680
It seems like we could clearly--

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.960
we'd be safe raising that
federal minimum wage.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.325
We would simply be
transferring resources and not

00:24:41.325 --> 00:24:42.200
causing unemployment.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.788
Yeah?

00:24:42.788 --> 00:24:44.860
AUDIENCE: Is there
anything about the cost

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.530
of living in areas where the
minimum wage is more expensive?

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.340
Is it possible that if a
McDonald's worker makes

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.256
more money in this
state, McDonald's is

00:24:53.256 --> 00:24:54.040
more expensive in that state?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.748
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a great question.

00:24:55.748 --> 00:24:58.600
So what I assumed was I
assumed firms would just say,

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.800
oh, you got me.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.900
I'm going to throw some
of my profits at workers.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.770
Firms don't have to do that.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.330
Firms could say, well, if
you make me pay workers more,

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.070
I'm going to raise my price.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.310
Now, if it's a
competitive output market,

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.350
that shouldn't happen, right?

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:15.270
Because in a competitive
output market--

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:15.790
well, no.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:16.780
Marginal cost goes up.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.470
It's not clear.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.470
It's not clear whether
that would happen or not,

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.070
and the evidence is
that it's unclear

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.750
whether higher minimum
wage causes higher prices

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.417
or whether it just
comes out of profits.

00:25:24.417 --> 00:25:25.860
We don't know yet, OK?

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.360
All right, so that's what I
want to say about labor markets.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.568
Now I want to move on and
talk about capital markets.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.450
Now, as confusing as our
discussion of labor markets

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.470
was, that's easy compared
to capital markets.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.860
Capital market's a lot
harder to understand.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.137
And that's because
capital itself--

00:25:45.137 --> 00:25:46.970
labor's something you
get your hands around.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.130
It's the time you spend at work.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.440
Capital is this sort
of amorphous thing

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.630
that I've kept
pushing off defining.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.012
So I'll define it now.

00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:57.470
We talk about capital as this
vague collection of buildings

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.190
and machines and the other
stuff that goes into production.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.240
And we know where
labor comes from.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.730
It comes from our work.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.140
But where does
capital come from?

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.900
Well, capital is
a harder concept,

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.070
but there's one unifying thread
that all elements of capital

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.820
have, which is they
represent the diversion

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.990
of current consumption
towards future consumption.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.920
Capital is about
diverting consuming today

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.000
towards consuming in the future.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.380
In fact, the original concept
of capital came from farmers.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:38.400
Farmers, every year, when
they would pick their grain,

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.150
they had a choice.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.180
They could eat all
the grain, or they

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.860
could save some to plant
for next year's grain.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.050
Now, the more they saved, the
more they'd have next year,

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.290
but the less they'd have today.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.390
So farmers faced a trade-off--

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.030
literally, consumption today
or consumption next year.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.520
That's what we mean by capital.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.090
In other words, in
today's market economy,

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:04.240
the link is not that direct,
but it's the same basic idea--

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.870
that firms have a choice,
firms and their investors

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.140
have a choice.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.400
They can take what they
make and eat it now,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.240
or they can invest it in
having more in the future.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.507
So basically, when we
think about capital,

00:27:20.507 --> 00:27:22.965
we're not going to think about
capital as physical capital.

00:27:22.965 --> 00:27:26.030
We're really thinking about
capital as financial capital.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:30.740
What links all types of capital
is their financial aspect.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.470
What links machines and
buildings is all the aspect

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.600
that, by putting
money into them today,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.690
you have less you can
spend on fun stuff today,

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.330
but more you'll be
able to spend tomorrow.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.890
And it's this
financial aspect that

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.080
links all forms of capital.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.420
Now, how do firms get
the money to invest

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.720
in machines and buildings
and stuff like that?

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.950
They get it through going
to the capital market.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.830
Where do firms get this
money that they invest?

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.550
They get it through going
to the capital market, which

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.060
is basically the pool of
money that firms can draw on

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.835
to make their investments.

00:28:08.835 --> 00:28:10.460
So think of it
literally as I'm a firm.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.335
I want to build a building
and buy a machine.

00:28:12.335 --> 00:28:14.860
I literally go over, and
there's a big pool of money.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.710
And I have to take the money out
of there to go buy my machine

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.780
or build my building.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.320
And where does the money
in that pool come from?

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.940
It comes from household
savings decisions.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.180
So the capital
market is a market

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:38.520
where the demand for capital
comes from firm's interest

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.030
in investing and having
more in the future.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:47.110
The supply of capital comes
from people's decisions to save.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.110
And essentially,
the money firms use

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:54.010
to buy stuff is
borrowed from people.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:57.780
And that's the bottom line
of how capital markets work.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:03.320
So just as the
supply of labor that

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.930
determines how many
workers a firm can hire

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.870
comes from your decision
of how hard to work,

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.180
the supply of capital
that determines

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:15.110
how many machines a firm can
buy comes from your decision

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.060
of how hard to save.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.840
So let's look at figure 16-5,
equilibrium in capital markets.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.330
Let's start with the demand.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.060
We already talked, last
lecture, demand for capital.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.870
The demand for capital comes
from the marginal revenue

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.610
product of capital.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.560
It's the marginal product
of the next machine.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.410
So the demand comes from
the marginal product

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.780
of the next machine times
the price the firm can

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.270
get for its output, which
is the marginal revenue

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.430
product of capital.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.290
So it's the same
logic as for labor.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.940
There's nothing
interesting there.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.490
Same logic as for labor.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.830
The supply's what's
more interesting here.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.870
Where does supply come from?

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:00.440
The supply comes from
household savings,

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.610
how much money is
around for firms

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.460
to actually get to
get these machines.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.780
And how do they get it?

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.130
They borrow.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.600
And what do they borrow at?

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.540
They borrow at the
interest rate I.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:18.220
So I represents the
rate that firms pay

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.560
households to get their money.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.430
So think of this as-- we'll
talk about how it really works.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.240
But in theory, the idea is
think of literally a marketplace

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.690
in the center of town.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.420
Downtown Boston, Haymarket,
there's this marketplace.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.850
And a firm comes and says,
I need to borrow money

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.110
to buy a machine.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.830
And a person's there
with their savings

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.110
and they say, well, I'll
loan you some money.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.030
What interest rate
you going to give me?

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.890
And that's the
market for capital.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.800
So where the supply of capital
meets the demand of capital

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.030
yields the interest rate.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.820
So basically, what this means is
as the interest rate's higher,

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.660
what that means is I have
to pay people back more

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.920
to borrow their money.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.240
So an interest rate of 10%,
if I borrow $10 from you,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.990
I pay you back
$1.10 next period.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.450
If I borrow $10, I pay you
back $1.10 next period.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.330
If the interest rate's
20%, if I borrow $10--

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.200
if I borrow $1--

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:09.932
I'm sorry.

00:31:09.932 --> 00:31:12.140
If I borrow $1 from you, I
pay you $1.10 next period.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.450
If I have 20% and I borrow $1, I
pay you back $1.20 next period,

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.960
et cetera, OK?

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.200
So basically, that
is essentially

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.340
how the transaction works.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.680
And the key point
here is the reason

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.260
the supply curve is
upward sloping is

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.300
the more you're willing
to pay me for my money,

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.250
the more I'm
willing to lend you.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.290
So if you come to me
and say give me $1

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:35.960
and next year I'll give you
back $1, I'm like, I don't know.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.793
Why would I do that?

00:31:36.793 --> 00:31:39.470
If you say, give me $1 and next
year I'll give you back $1.10,

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.510
you're like, OK, now
I'm interested. $1.20,

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.832
I'm very interested.
$1.50, for sure.

00:31:43.832 --> 00:31:45.290
Literally, I just
give you my money

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.790
and, next year, I
get back 50% more?

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.470
Why not?

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.700
So basically, the higher
the interest rate,

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.370
the more I'm willing
to loan the firm

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.662
and, therefore, you get an
upward-sloping supply curve.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.515
Now, of course,
in reality, people

00:31:59.515 --> 00:32:02.015
don't actually-- we don't sit
in Haymarket, downtown Boston,

00:32:02.015 --> 00:32:03.440
and give money to firms.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.410
In reality, this
transaction happens

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.350
through capital markets.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.700
And essentially, there are three
mechanisms by which implicitly

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.820
I loan money to firms.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:24.090
The first is I could
literally buy corporate debt.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.790
I could literally loan
the money to firms.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.310
I could literally go
and the firm could say,

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:34.270
I, General Motors,
am issuing a bond.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.980
This is through
bond, issuing a bond.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.610
And the way that bond works is
I promise that for every dollar

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:43.990
you spend buying my bond,
you'll get 1 plus I dollars back

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.160
at the end--

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.007
or next year, say, depends
on how long the bond is.

00:32:49.007 --> 00:32:51.590
So literally, you're loaning the
money to the firm by buying--

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.430
you're buying their
promise to pay you back.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.400
Now, a second way you can
loan money to the firm

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.890
is through investing
in their equity.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.870
You can buy their stock.

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:06.400
The way this works is GM says
to you, buy a piece of me

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.490
and you'll get paid back not
some fixed interest rate,

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:13.080
but you get paid back
according to how well GM does.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:16.170
So with corporate
debt, I get paid back

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.270
something that's predetermined.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.210
When I buy stock or
equity, I don't get back

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.573
a predetermined amount.

00:33:22.573 --> 00:33:24.990
I get back some-- it depends
on how well the company does.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.920
But it's the same basic idea.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.160
I'm giving the company
some money today

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.950
in return for my getting
more money, I hope, tomorrow.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:34.590
That's the diversion
of consumption

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.670
from today to tomorrow.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:41.110
And the third thing I could do
is I could put it in the bank.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.000
Now, how is that
loaned to companies?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.210
Because the bank then
loans it to companies.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:50.485
Why do banks say they'll pay
you interest on your money?

00:33:50.485 --> 00:33:51.610
Why did banks going crazy--

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:52.327
I'll give you 1--

00:33:52.327 --> 00:33:53.410
it used to be interesting.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.520
Now it's 1%, 2%.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.920
When I was a kid, I
was like 10%, 12%.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.175
We'll give you lots of money.

00:33:58.175 --> 00:34:00.550
And we'll talk later about
why it was so much higher when

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.343
I was a kid.

00:34:02.343 --> 00:34:03.760
Why are banks so
eager to do that?

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.170
It's not out of the
goodness of their heart.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:06.965
It's because when you give
them dollars, they turn around

00:34:06.965 --> 00:34:07.870
and loan them.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.412
They add a bunch to
the interest rate

00:34:09.412 --> 00:34:10.550
and loan them out to firms.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.580
So those dollars
you're giving the banks

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.350
and they're paying
you 2% interest,

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.580
they loan to firms at 6%.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.110
And that's why bankers are rich.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.965
So basically, the reason a bank
exists is because it's a way--

00:34:22.965 --> 00:34:24.340
corporate debt
and equity markets

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.955
are hard and complicated.

00:34:25.955 --> 00:34:27.830
It's much easier to put
your money in a bank.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.800
You put your money in a bank.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.383
But when you put
your money in a bank,

00:34:30.383 --> 00:34:32.409
you're essentially
loaning it to companies.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.570
That's essentially
what you're doing.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.510
So through these mechanisms,
we have a capital market

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:42.190
where essentially, by my
putting money away and diverting

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.235
from today's consumption,
I'm loaning to a firm.

00:34:44.235 --> 00:34:45.610
They'll produce
more, and they'll

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:49.070
pay me back more in the future.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.889
Questions about that?

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:55.170
OK, so let's talk about where
the supply curve comes from.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.920
We know where the
demand curve comes from.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.837
It just simply comes
from the marginal revenue

00:34:58.837 --> 00:35:00.350
product of capital.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.940
Where does supply
curve comes from?

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:08.000
The supply curve comes from what
we call intertemporal choice.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:15.020
As I said, economists like
putting fancy names on things.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.840
That helps us get
paid more money.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.760
It just means choosing over
time, intertemporal choice.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.400
Intertemporal choice
is essentially about

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.280
how do you decide
how much to save.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.410
What's going to
determine that is

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.690
going to be your
decision of how much you

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:35.050
value money today versus
valuing money tomorrow.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.980
So for ease, let's imagine
I'm considering two periods,

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.105
this year versus next year.

00:35:42.105 --> 00:35:44.563
When I talk about periods, I'm
talking about days and years

00:35:44.563 --> 00:35:45.450
and whatever.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.380
It's the basic logic.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.680
It's about now
versus the future.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.597
Whether I say days or
years, it doesn't really

00:35:49.597 --> 00:35:50.305
matter right now.

00:35:50.305 --> 00:35:52.805
The point is I'm just talking
about today versus the future.

00:35:52.805 --> 00:35:55.000
So let's talk about this
year versus next year.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.020
And let's imagine prices
aren't going to change.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.460
I'll come back to
prices next lecture.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.590
But let's imagine the price of
goods aren't going to go up.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.183
There's no inflation
in this economy,

00:36:02.183 --> 00:36:03.350
which is roughly true today.

00:36:05.438 --> 00:36:07.480
And let's suppose I'm
going to take next year off

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.063
to care for my children.

00:36:09.063 --> 00:36:11.230
Lord knows why I'd want to
do that when the youngest

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:15.310
one's 19, but imagine
they still need my care.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.280
So let's say I'll take next--
this example gets dated.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.580
Let's say I take next year
off to care for my children.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:27.580
And let's say my income
is $80,000 a year.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.193
Now, here is my--

00:36:29.193 --> 00:36:30.985
but I'm going to take
next year off unpaid.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.740
So I'm going to work
this year for 80k.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.580
Next year I'm going
to take off unpaid.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.320
So I have a couple of choices.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.770
I could work this year,
earn my 80k, spend my 80k,

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.150
and have nothing
next year to live on.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.190
I could work this
year and eat nothing

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.770
and save all of
the 80k to live on,

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.640
or some combination in between.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.640
And we could illustrate--
but the key difference

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.370
is every dollar
that I don't consume

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.738
this year that I save to consume
next year earns interest.

00:37:03.738 --> 00:37:05.280
And that's where
the trade-off comes.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.488
So let's look at figure 16-6.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.430
This is a familiar-looking
optimization diagram.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:18.020
Now my optimization is not
over pizza versus cookies,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.740
but my optimization is over
consumption this period

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.180
versus consumption next period.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.350
It's a bit mind-blowing.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.140
We're a little
science-fictiony here, right?

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.540
We're now not talking about
choosing between two goods,

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.160
like leisure and consumption
or cookies and pizza.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.720
Now I'm talking about two time
periods, consumption today

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.280
versus consumption tomorrow.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.460
But that's the key
thing about the tools

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.725
we learn with consumer choice.

00:37:41.725 --> 00:37:43.225
Those tools are
incredibly powerful.

00:37:43.225 --> 00:37:45.865
You just need to shove your
problem into that framework.

00:37:45.865 --> 00:37:48.240
And we're going to shove our
problem into this framework.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:52.240
The problem we're facing is how
do I decide how much to save.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.710
Well, savings is a bad
just like labor's a bad.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.590
What do we do when we
have a bad to model?

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.850
We don't model the bad.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.190
We model the complementary good.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.860
So our choice is, how
much do I consume today?

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.630
My choice is, how much
do I consume today

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:16.100
and how much am I going to save?

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:20.263
Well, saving is a bad, but the
other way to think about it

00:38:20.263 --> 00:38:21.680
is, how much am I
going to consume

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.350
today versus how much am I
going to consume tomorrow?

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:28.220
Then that's two goods and I can
model them against each other.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.650
And that's what I
do in figure 16-6.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.940
I model consumption today
versus consumption next year.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.930
So here's my choices.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.170
As I said, if I consume
everything today,

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.470
I'm at the
x-intercept at 80,000.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:45.900
I have 80,000 to consume
today, nothing next year.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.750
If I consume everything
next year, what do I get?

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.900
Well, let's say the
interest rate is 10%.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.450
What that means is then
I'll have $88,000 next year.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:57.820
Why will I have more next year?

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.850
Because by saving,
I earn interest.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.090
By diverting my consumption to
the future, I earn interest.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:07.730
At 10%, that means I would
have $88,000 next year.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:11.530
So my budget constraint is the
line with the slope minus 1

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:16.670
plus I. My budget constraint is
the line with the slope minus 1

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:20.720
plus I. In other words,
the price of consumption

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:27.130
today in terms of consumption
tomorrow is minus 1 plus I.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.220
OK, let me think about it.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.137
Let me say that again.

00:39:29.137 --> 00:39:30.930
It's really confusing.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:35.553
The price of consuming today
instead of consuming tomorrow,

00:39:35.553 --> 00:39:37.470
assuming no inflation--
so prices are the same

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:38.550
in the market--

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:41.940
is minus 1 plus I.
Think about that.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.120
I find it useful to think back
to the labor case for parallel.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.530
In the labor case, what did we
say was the price of leisure?

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:50.780
What was the price of leisure?

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.322
Someone raise their
hand and tell me.

00:39:52.322 --> 00:39:53.280
In the labor-- yeah?

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:53.670
AUDIENCE: The wages.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:54.060
JONATHAN GRUBER: The wages.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:54.835
Why?

00:39:54.835 --> 00:39:57.540
AUDIENCE: Just because that's
the opportunity cost of not--

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:57.870
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.430
So by that same
logic, can tell me

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:02.610
why is the price of
consuming today 1 plus I?

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.810
AUDIENCE: Because if
you choose to save,

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.708
then we're effectively richer.

00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:10.750
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.000
The opportunity
cost-- remember, we

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.240
are an annoying discipline
with a dismal science.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.103
We're telling you, hey, enjoy
that cookie, but by the way,

00:40:19.103 --> 00:40:21.520
if you weren't eating that
cookie, you could have 1 plus I

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.890
cookies tomorrow.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:27.310
So just like we nag you for
sitting around watching TV,

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.800
we nag you for eating
today by saying,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.940
hey, the more you consume today,
the less you can have tomorrow.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.200
And in fact, that trade-off
is that for every cookie

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.220
you consume today, you forgo
1 plus I cookies tomorrow.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.630
So that's the budget constraint.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.390
The slope is the opportunity
cost of consuming today

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:47.250
in terms of
tomorrow's consumption

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.380
or next year's
consumption, which

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.645
is 1 plus I. That's the slope
of the budget constraint,

00:40:52.645 --> 00:40:54.920
is the opportunity cost.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.272
And then, then we say, OK, well,
that's the opportunity cost.

00:40:58.272 --> 00:40:59.480
That's the budget constraint.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.890
Well, how do I decide?

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.110
Well, then we know how to
make these decisions, which

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.700
is go to utility function.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.070
You can write down the
utility function, which

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.795
is a function of C1 and C2.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.720
Now, what is C?

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.450
C is all my pizza and cookies,
but we're aggregating it up.

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.970
Just like our utility
function last time

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.680
was a function of
leisure and consumption--

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.347
we said consumption was
the bundle of goods you eat

00:41:25.347 --> 00:41:26.430
and leisure is this thing.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.515
Now we're saying, OK,
our utility function now

00:41:28.515 --> 00:41:30.210
is a function of this trade-off.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.853
Now, you might
say, wait a second.

00:41:31.853 --> 00:41:33.520
How can both those
be utility functions?

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.937
And the answer is you have
some meta-utility function that

00:41:35.937 --> 00:41:38.250
includes consumption today,
tomorrow, leisure, pizza,

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:40.170
cookies, et cetera.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:43.650
But we can think about
this in sequential steps.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:47.160
First, we decide how we're
going to split our income.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.710
Then we can decide what to
spend it on each period.

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:52.155
Then you can do a separate
consumer maximization decision.

00:41:52.155 --> 00:41:53.655
But our first
question is simply how

00:41:53.655 --> 00:41:54.972
am I going to split my income.

00:41:54.972 --> 00:41:56.430
Well, that's going
to be a function

00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:01.430
of my taste for consumption in
this period versus next period

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:05.300
and the price the bank will
pay me for delaying consumption

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.850
till next period.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.590
Now, what happens?

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.090
Questions about that?

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.100
Now, what happens
in the scenario

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.580
when the interest rate goes up?

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.900
What do you think happens if
the interest rate goes up?

00:42:22.352 --> 00:42:22.852
Yeah?

00:42:22.852 --> 00:42:26.622
AUDIENCE: There's [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:26.622 --> 00:42:27.580
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.140
So what do you
think you should--

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.810
what do you think will happen
to your consumption pattern?

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:32.350
Yeah?

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:33.760
AUDIENCE: You should
spend less today.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.540
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Spend less today

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.490
and save more because
it's rewarded.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.650
And why is that not
necessarily true?

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.430
Yeah?

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.350
AUDIENCE: Because you might only
need a certain amount of money

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:42.850
to live.

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.835
So you don't have to
save as much today

00:42:44.835 --> 00:42:45.710
because you'll make--

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.860
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because
of what two effects?

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.620
Income and substitution effects.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.790
You gave exactly the intuition
that the substitution effect

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:54.460
gives you.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.670
The substitution effect
is exactly right.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.620
If the interest
rate goes up, that's

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.747
like the price of
consumption today going up.

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.330
And if the price of
something goes up,

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.410
the substitution effect
says you do less of it.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.873
But if interest rate
goes up, you're richer.

00:43:10.873 --> 00:43:12.790
And if you're rich, you
do more of everything,

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.500
including consuming today.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.770
The income effect
goes the other way.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:17.598
It's like labor.

00:43:17.598 --> 00:43:19.390
Once again, income and
substitution effects

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:22.117
is why we bothered
telling you so.

00:43:22.117 --> 00:43:24.450
Because income and substitution
effects, in these cases,

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.367
go against each other.

00:43:25.367 --> 00:43:29.400
Let's look at figure 16-7, OK?

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.760
In figure 16-7, we
start at point A.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:38.510
Now imagine the interest
rate doubles to 20%.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.300
Now imagine the
interest rate doubles.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.270
As you said, that pivots the
budget constraint upwards.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.560
You could still consume
only $80,000 this year,

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.950
but now for every dollar you
save, you get $1.20 next year.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:52.570
That has two effects
on your decision.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:56.020
The substitution effect, we get
by drawing an imaginary budget

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.880
constraint-- that's
the dash line--

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.590
tangent to the original
indifference curve

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.230
but at the new slope.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:06.880
By definition, that means
you consume less today.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.823
You consume less
today by definition.

00:44:08.823 --> 00:44:10.240
If the price of
something goes up,

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.820
the substitution effect
always says you do less of it.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.240
You consume less today,
which means you'll save more.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:22.120
Remember, savings is just
income minus consumption

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.030
in period one.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:30.280
So just as labor was
24 minus leisure--

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.770
and so if we just solve for
leisure, we could get labor.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:38.150
Savings is just income minus
consumption in period one.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.790
So if we solve for consumption
in period one, we get savings.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.910
People see that?

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.910
So basically, the point here
is the substitution effect

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:52.300
says, well, gee, the price
of consumption in period one

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.800
just went up.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.460
It's more costly in terms
of future consumption.

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.960
I'm going to do less, but then
my savings is going to go up.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.090
Substitution effect
says you save more.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.290
But the income effect
says, wait a second.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.080
You're now richer.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.030
Every dollar of your
savings you are doing now

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:09.280
yields twice as
much in interest.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.210
If you're richer, you'll consume
more of everything, including

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.950
period one consumption.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:18.048
So the income effect takes
you back the other way.

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:20.090
Now, whether the income
effect dominates are not,

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:20.810
we don't know.

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.227
In this case, it
doesn't dominate.

00:45:22.227 --> 00:45:24.200
In this case, you
still, on net, end up

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.840
consuming less in period
one and saving more.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.637
But we don't know what's
going to dominate.

00:45:30.637 --> 00:45:32.720
And in fact, the evidence
here is incredibly weak.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.940
I won't spend a long
time on the evidence

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.830
because it's not nearly as
interesting and strong as labor

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:36.580
supply.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.108
The evidence is incredibly
weak even about the sign.

00:45:39.108 --> 00:45:41.400
And let's come to the intuition
that was given for why.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.800
Well, think about how people
make savings decisions.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.380
Lots of people
have savings goals.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.720
I want to have x by
the time I retire.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.342
Typical way if you ask
people about their savings--

00:45:52.342 --> 00:45:53.800
if you ask them,
they typically say

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.800
I want to make sure I
have x in the bank in case

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.650
I'm in an accident.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:59.080
I want to make sure I have
y by the time I retire.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.930
Well, in those models, if
the interest rate goes up,

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.335
savings rates go down.

00:46:04.335 --> 00:46:06.710
Because after all, to hit a
target with a higher interest

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.510
rate, I can save less.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:10.045
So it's actually
not that surprising

00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:11.420
that you'd have
a higher interest

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:13.280
rate leading to less savings.

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.170
It's kind of
intuitive, actually.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:17.600
If people have savings
targets, a higher interest rate

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.710
would lead to less savings
because they can get

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.520
to their target more easily.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.040
So actually, we don't even
know which way this goes.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.123
It's, I think, one of the
great unsolved mysteries

00:46:24.123 --> 00:46:27.120
in economics empirically,
is, once again,

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.000
we typically assume--

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.470
and with a gun to
my head, I would

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:32.810
say it's probably true that
higher interest rates leads

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:34.660
to more savings.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.930
But the evidence on which
that rests is pretty weak.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.420
And the key point for you is
to understand it's uncertain

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.480
and it depends on whether
income and substitution

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.540
effects dominate.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.030
Questions about that?

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.640
OK.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.740
So now let's step back
and put it all together

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:55.873
and think about you making
your decision about life.

00:46:55.873 --> 00:46:57.290
You can think about
your decisions

00:46:57.290 --> 00:47:02.040
about your life in three steps.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:06.820
Step one is you decide
how hard to work.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:09.760
Step one is you decide, how
much money do I want to make?

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.010
Well, that's about
maximizing utility

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:15.530
over consumption and leisure.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:18.200
Step two is, having decided
how much you're going to make--

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.713
and that yields your labor.

00:47:20.713 --> 00:47:22.880
Step two is, deciding how
much you're going to make,

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.693
you decide, well, how do I
want to spread that over time?

00:47:25.693 --> 00:47:27.860
How much do I want to consume
today versus tomorrow?

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.660
Well, that's about
intertemporal choice.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.480
That's about deciding
on C1 versus C2,

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.980
and that's going to
yield your savings.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.260
Step three is, now that
I know how much I'm

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.070
going to consume
each period, now

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:42.280
I want to maximize utility
across all my goods

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.890
I might want to
consume-- x2, across all

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.870
the goods I want to consume.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:50.240
That was our original
cookies and pizza example.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.510
So you could think of
it as a hierarchical set

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.240
of consumer
optimization problems

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.100
that you're going to solve.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.230
Now, you might say,
well, gee, Jon,

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:02.290
that's sort of confusing
because, in fact, the interest

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.180
rate and how much am I
saving could determine

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.160
how hard I work, right?

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.933
Let's say the interest
rate goes way up

00:48:07.933 --> 00:48:09.100
and I have a savings target.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.320
I have to work less hard
to hit that savings target.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.830
And I'd say to
you, good for you.

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.488
Take more advanced economics.

00:48:14.488 --> 00:48:16.030
More advanced
economics, we recognize

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:18.322
this is one integrated whole
and we allow these systems

00:48:18.322 --> 00:48:20.080
to affect each other.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.490
But for here, just think of
them as separatable steps,

00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.630
independent steps.

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.280
But in practice,
I hope you can see

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.910
the steps will be integrated
and they'll affect each other.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:30.410
Think of it.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:33.190
If the price of a good
you really want to buy

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:36.310
goes up a lot, not only will
you buy less of that good;

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:38.505
you might save more to
buy it and work harder.

00:48:38.505 --> 00:48:40.630
So you can imagine how
these things are integrated.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.340
But for now, we'll keep
them separable, OK?

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.210
Questions about that?

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:45.710
OK.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.293
Next time, we're to
come back and talk

00:48:47.293 --> 00:48:49.940
about all the interesting
stuff in capital markets

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.910
and how we make decisions
about how much to save

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:54.880
and things like that.

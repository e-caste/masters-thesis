00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.790
PROFESSOR: Welcome back to 8.20.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.550
In this section and
the following ones,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.000
we talk about paradoxes
in special relativity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.070
A paradox is something which is
absurd or self-contradictory.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.830
So we have statements
which don't really make

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.490
any sense when put together.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.430
The pole in the barn paradox
is rather interesting.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.540
And we will analyze this, and
at the end of the discussion,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.430
we hopefully agree that
there is no paradox here.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.770
It's a pseudo paradox.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.940
So the situation is as follows.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.070
We have Alice.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.240
She has a pole.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.740
The pole is 10 meters long
in her reference frame.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.750
And Bob is very proud
of his New England

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.390
barn which is, in his
reference frame, 8 meters long.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.020
Alice, however, is moving
with a velocity of 0.6 times

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.040
the speed of light, which gives
us a gamma factor of 1.25.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.760
Does the pole fit into the
barn is the question, or not?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.190
So stop here and think
about this for a second,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.630
and we will continue
with an analysis of this.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.340
So here is the analysis
for Alice's frame

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.920
and the analysis
for Bob's frame.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.040
For Alice, the barn
in her reference frame

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.870
is Lorentz contracted.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.320
It's 6.4 meters long, but
her pole is 10 meters long.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.230
So we should clearly
answer this question

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.470
by saying it doesn't fit.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.320
In Bob's frame, the
barn is 8 meters long,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.150
and the pole is
Lorentz contracted--

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.900
also 8 meters long.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.800
So Bob will say, yeah, it
fits-- it just barely fits.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.260
They're exactly the same
size, so yes, it all

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.850
fits into the barn.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.860
And here is where
you might think

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.290
this is an absurd statement.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.570
They cannot be both right.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.232
We will see they can.

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:03.630
They can both be right.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.450
They just disagreed on
the fact that events

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.190
happen simultaneously.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.320
What are the
crucial events here?

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.150
When does the barn
hit the end-- does

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.430
the pole hit the
end of the barn,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.120
and when does the back of the
pole hit the front of the barn?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.830
Those are the two things
we have to study in detail.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.520
But let's get to it.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.000
How can they, or why
can they disagree?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.150
So the idea is that you
draw space-time diagrams

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.910
for the pole in
the barn, and show

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.090
that there's no paradox by using
the world lines of the pole.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.550
Before we do this, we're going
to analyze this a little bit

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.020
more.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.620
So assume that the front of the
pole enters the barn at time

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.610
equals 0 for both Bob and Alice.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.820
Then Bob observes the
pole entering his barn,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.790
and it takes 44.4 nanoseconds--

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.120
8 meters divided by 0.6
times the speed of light--

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.250
for the front of the pole to
reach the back of the barn,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.330
and the back of the pole to
reach the front of the barn.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.280
So after 44 nanoseconds,
in Bob's reference frame,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.770
the pole is in the barn.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.700
Alice, however, sees the
barn Lorentz contracted.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.470
It's 6.4 meters long.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.570
She moves this 0.6 times
the speed of light.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:39.080
So for her, she reaches the
back after 35.6 nanoseconds,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.890
in which case, Bob's
clock only shows

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.620
28.4 nanoseconds,
because Alice's clock

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.690
time is Lorentz contracted.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.230
So we can clearly conclude
here that that's not

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.920
enough time for Bob such that
the pole actually entered

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.240
the barn for the full length.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.380
So the back of the
pole is still outside.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.670
So we want to consider
three different events.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.960
The first event is
after 44 nanoseconds,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.890
and in the space of 8 meters
in Bob's reference frame.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.940
For Alice-- this is the
situation we just analyzed--

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.560
36.6-- 35.6 nanoseconds passed.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.080
And in her reference frame,
the front of the pole

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.540
is at 0 meters.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.270
The second event is
then the other side

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.460
of the barn in Bob's
reference frame

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.750
after 44.4 nanoseconds 0 meters.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.750
He sees-- or she sees that
55 nanoseconds have passed.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.750
We use Lorentz
transformation here,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.745
but the position
is minus 10 meters.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.580
And the last point is 28.49
nanoseconds and 0 meters.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.250
That is the observation
when Alice sees the end

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.570
of the-- front of the barn--

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.270
the front of the pole
at the end of the barn.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.240
That translates
into Alice's frame

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:12.320
a 35.6 nanoseconds,
and minus 6.4 meters.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.960
So the minus 6.4 meters
tells you very clearly

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.550
what we just already said.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.690
The back of the pole
is still outside.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.110
So that's the quantitative or
numerical kind of evaluation.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.180
And we can also show
the very same thing

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.056
in the space-time diagram.

00:05:30.056 --> 00:05:32.500
So we show the
space-time diagram here,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.920
and this is Bob's
reference frame.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.210
So the pole just touched
the front of his barn,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.430
and the barn is
located at 8 meters--

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.620
the end of the barn
is located 8 meters.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.520
The front of the barn
is located at 0 meters.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.060
After 44 nanoseconds, there's
event number one and event

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.170
number two.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.850
The pole is fully in the barn.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.050
But we can also show the
pole in event number three.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.790
So one-- where is
the end of the pole?

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.190
We look at this diagram here.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.820
Where is the end of the pole
when the front of the pole

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.510
hits the end of the barn?

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.920
You see clearly there's
a piece sticking out.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.370
We saw that there's--

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.700
in this event here,
6.6 meters in Alice's

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.900
frame still seeking out.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.930
So we see that event number
three is located here,

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:43.860
and not all of the pole is
actually contained within the.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.420
So Bob and Alice disagree
on whether the front

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.440
and the back of the pole are
in the barn simultaneously.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.430
That's where the situation
becomes contradictory.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.440
They don't agree that two events
which happened at the same time

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.050
in their reference frame--

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.870
in Bob's reference frame
occurs at the same time

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.450
in Alice's reference.

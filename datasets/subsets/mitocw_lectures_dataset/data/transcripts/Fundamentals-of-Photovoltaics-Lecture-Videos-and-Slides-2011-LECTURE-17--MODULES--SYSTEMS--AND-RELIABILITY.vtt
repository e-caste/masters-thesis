00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.790
PROFESSOR: So modules,
systems, and reliability.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.140
What we're going to do is talk
about how we go from the cells,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.520
or from the films,
to full modules

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.294
and, finally, to systems.

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:38.710
So our first
learning objective is

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.890
to describe, more or less, the
DNA or anatomy of a PV module.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.285
This will be a bit of a prep
for the visit to Fraunhofer

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.630
CSE, where we'll
get to see the labs

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.410
and see all the materials
that go into a PV module.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.140
So just establishing
some definitions

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.660
up front so we're all
speaking the same language--

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.181
you start out with
either a film.

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:56.680
Right?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.630
If you're depositing
a thin film material,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.260
which is usually divided
into discrete devices

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.489
using laser processing,
or you can start out

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.430
with a discrete wafer which
has been processed into a cell.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.010
The module is the
combination of many

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.859
of these cells, shown
very generically right

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:14.150
here without the interconnects.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.312
Because you can tie
up the cells together

00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:17.770
in parallel or in
series, depending

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.820
on what sort of voltage
and current outputs

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520
you desire from your module.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.810
And then finally the modules are
situated together in an array.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.730
That's showing a combination
of six modules forming

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.560
that array right there.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.260
And as you can see, modules are
typically this size right here.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.120
They're usually about this
size or even a little larger.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.280
They're rather heavy,
so you can get a sense.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.426
They're not extremely light.

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:45.884
The majority of
that mass is coming

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:49.370
from the glass in the front,
some from the aluminum as well.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.420
And they're comprised
of many materials.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.190
If you were to take this
apart-- which we'll actually

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.334
see the individual components
at Fraunhofer CSE--

00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:58.500
you'll notice that there
are many materials involved

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.162
in making one of these modules.

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:02.120
From the back skin
materials, the junction box,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.480
the aluminum framing on the
side, the glass on the front,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.910
the encapsulant materials that
fuse everything together--

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.729
that bind everything--
and the cells,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.970
the solar cell
devices themselves.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.419
So our first step is to
walk through the anatomy

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.085
of a module, at least in theory,
so that when we actually see it

00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:22.680
at Fraunhofer CSE, we'll
have a better sense of what

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.790
we're looking at that.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.910
Yeah.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.410
Ashley?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.787
AUDIENCE: Here, what
determines that specific size?

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:28.620
We've already talked
about the pseudo-square

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.811
and how you have to balance
those two different cost

00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:33.310
parameters.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.917
But why that size specifically?

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:37.500
PROFESSOR: Why that
size specifically?

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.920
We're going to get to
that in a few slides.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.490
It comes, as you
probably guessed,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.197
from some historical reasons.

00:02:43.197 --> 00:02:44.420
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.980
PROFESSOR: So some
basic principles

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.900
about solar modules-- there's
quite a diversity of modules

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.390
when you look at them.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.370
These are examples just
within one company,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.930
just to highlight the
range of module types

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.860
that you might see.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.830
Right here, you can see
in this particular module,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.850
there's very little
anti-reflective coating

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.760
on the glass.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.440
So you're able to look
through the front glass

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.870
and see some white spaces
in between the cells.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.880
We know, from the lecture
on crystalline silicon PV,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.580
that when you see these little
gaps in between the cells,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.720
those are pseudo-squares.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.220
Right?

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.060
Those are those round ingots
of Czochralski silicon

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.660
that have been
sliced into wafers.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.000
And then the edges
have been shaven off,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.460
and you have that stop sign
type pattern of a solar cell.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.440
Right?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.820
So that way you know, OK, these
are single crystalline cells

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.560
lined up in a module together.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.590
And there's very little
anti-reflective coating

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.131
on the glass, which
means that you're

00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:41.026
losing a fair amount
due to reflectance.

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:42.650
The module on the
right-hand side right

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.140
here has that anti-reflection
coating on the glass.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.910
It could be an index
of refraction gradient

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.240
to absorb more of the light.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.270
It could also be surface
texturing to scatter the light

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.660
and trap it by total internal
reflection once it gets inside.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.980
There's a few different
ways that one can do that.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.890
Usually with a film
coating is the most common.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.720
And here on the
left-hand side, we

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.190
have a similar
sub-cell component

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.560
but much larger module comprised
of a larger number of cells

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.300
with a higher power output.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.910
And we can see quite
a wide variance

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.240
of different types of modules.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.380
That will be an important
message in a few.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.207
The water rinse cycle really
depends on where you're at.

00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:31.290
For the modules on my roof,
we just leave them up.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.850
Here in New England,
it's pretty much OK.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.830
If we did have trees that
deposited leaves nearby,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.140
we'd have to clean it off
in the fall, but we don't.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.850
If you're mounting
modules in the Middle

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.920
East, where that
fine-grained sand exists

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.960
and, if you're within 10
kilometers from the coast

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.620
where you have the salt and
the seawater in the air,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.240
you can get this really
hard-to-remove sand

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.330
caking the modules.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.490
And you would have to clean them
much more frequently than this.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.640
As a matter of fact, I
believe the numbers are--

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:09.400
in Abu Dhabi, the capital of
one of the Emirates in the UAE,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.690
if you were to just leave your
modules out near the ocean,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.260
near the desert, you
would have a 40% drop

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.230
in module output over a month.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.090
So that's what happens
in certain environments.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.050
In certain others,
like New England,

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.530
we're more buffered
in that regard.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.330
We have frequent rain,
and we don't have the dust

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.530
coming from any nearby desert.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.420
Typically, there
are no moving parts,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.040
and typically there's a 20- to
30-year manufacturer warranty.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.930
Some of the newer materials
that have been less tested

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.200
might give, say, a 10-year
manufacturer's warranty

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.620
and have to offset the
risk in years 10 to 20

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.640
by lowering the cost up front
or lowering the price up front.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.300
So we have some basics
about solar modules

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.500
just to situate ourselves.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.250
Let's dive into the
module DNA, since this

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.710
is where the rubber
hits the road.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.690
I'm going to show
this to you in theory,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.450
and then we're
going to see reams

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.020
of these module innard materials
when we visit Fraunhofer.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.280
So we start with the
solar cells themselves.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.570
These are these little
blue objects right there.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.070
Typically, these
cells are already

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.670
strung together at that point.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.137
They have contact metallization
on the front side, which

00:06:25.137 --> 00:06:27.720
we deposit, say, for example,
by screen printing, which you've

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.520
done in the lab downstairs.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.970
And then you string
them together

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.340
using a machine called
a tabber-stringer

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.240
to connect one cell to the next,
essentially the front of one

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.880
cell to the back of the next.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.830
And they're all
lined up like that.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.530
And you deposit layers of EVA,
which is ethyl vinyl acetate.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.595
This is typically the
encapsulant material used.

00:06:47.595 --> 00:06:49.470
It's shown in red right
here in this drawing.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.580
It's the encapsulant material
used for crystalline silicon

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.640
PV.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.900
On the back side,
there is a sheet

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.140
of material called Tedlar.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.015
Despite it being drawn
in yellow right there,

00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:02.320
it's the white
skin material here.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.340
It's this white material
right around here.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.720
And we have the glass
on the front side.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.670
And typically,
it's low-iron glass

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.640
so it can transmit
the ultraviolet light,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.570
or a large portion of it,
to give better blue response

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.580
to your solar cells.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.761
So you're capturing a larger
portion of the solar spectrum.

00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:22.260
OK.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.630
So we have the different
components right there.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.760
One little piece of
trivia about EVA--

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.470
for the chemists
in the room, what

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.580
do you think this
would decompose into?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.590
Let me just give you
a little hand here.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.910
If you had some-- let's see.

00:07:47.432 --> 00:07:48.100
All right.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.255
So these represent
methyl groups, hydrogens,

00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:53.380
carbon, carbon, carbon,
double bonded to an oxygen.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.596
Anybody recognize?

00:07:54.596 --> 00:07:56.064
AUDIENCE: It looks like acetone?

00:07:56.064 --> 00:07:56.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.710
So if you're looking
at the decomposition

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.860
of this little group
right here, you

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.140
could easily envision it
decomposing into acetic acid

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.060
from the name ethyl
vinyl acetate.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.430
So if you have a thin
film material that

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.490
could react with
the encapsulant,

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.580
you could decompose
your encapsulant

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.252
and cause a degradation of not
only the encapsulant itself,

00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:21.960
which would block some
of the light going

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.560
through, but of the solar
cell absorber material, too.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.990
So that's why, in many
thin film materials,

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.480
there are other encapsulants
used, like PVB, polyvinyl

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.730
butyral.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.190
And some folks are even
talking about getting away

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.020
from glass and EVA
altogether and just

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.230
putting down, say, an
organic resin-type material.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.580
Maybe a very hard
polymeric material

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.990
that could be used in a floor
in a clean room, let's say.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.490
Yeah.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.048
AUDIENCE: Is the low iron
content of the glass also

00:08:55.048 --> 00:08:58.380
important to prevent
all impurities

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.760
getting into the silicon
or are we past that point?

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.800
PROFESSOR: So the question
was is the low iron

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.460
content in the glass also
useful for preventing impurities

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.690
from getting in.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.390
I would say, if you're
producing-- the diffusivity

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.060
and solubility of
impurities in a solid

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.770
typically follow
Boltzmann statistics,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.040
meaning they increase
exponentially with temperature.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.870
It's an entropy-driven effect.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.910
And as a result of being at room
temperature, the transmission,

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.080
or the diffusivity and,
hence, the solubility

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.760
of iron inside of the
bulk silicon is very low.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.150
And, even over a 20-year span,
the total diffusion length

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.180
of the iron from the
glass into the silicon

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.290
would be rather small.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.970
Now, point taken, if you
were to, say, create a quartz

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.540
tube to do your phosphorus
diffusion at 800 degrees C

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.080
or 850 degrees C and you had
iron inside of that quartz

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.540
tube, then it could very
easily diffuse into your wafer.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.780
So it is important to be
considerate of impurities

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.870
and the effects thereof but
at low temperatures-- close

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.262
to room temperature-- there's
very little risk of it

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.440
moving around.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:57.940
Good.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.750
So Tedlar, this back
skin material right here,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.767
forms an almost
impenetrable back layer.

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:06.350
You might want to
put little asterisks

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.930
around-- sorry, little
quotes around impenetrable.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.940
Nothing is absolutely
impenetrable

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.410
but it is a very
tough, tough material.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.810
If you were to take a piece
of Tedlar and try to break it,

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.250
try to rip it or tear it, even
the strongest in the class

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.400
would be challenged
in that regard.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.230
And we'll have a chance
to do that at Fraunhofer.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.640
The aluminum frame
provides rigidity.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.140
Right?

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.520
So the mechanical
engineers in the room

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.590
would understand
that the bending mode

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.820
of this glass, or the
twist, is prevented

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:43.610
by these rigid extruded
aluminum components

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.470
right here in the back.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.220
And you can see that
a lot of the mass

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:53.460
is concentrated away
from the centroid, which

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.330
results in a larger stiffness,
prevention of a larger bending

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.510
moment-- second
moment, if you will.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.010
OK.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.540
So there's a fair amount
of mechanical engineering

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.120
that goes into the design
because you want to minimize

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.450
commodity material costs.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.850
You want to minimize
the amount of materials

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.440
that go into the
module, but you still

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.060
want it to last for 20 years.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.135
You still want it to be
resistant to snow loads,

00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:13.912
to wind loads.

00:11:13.912 --> 00:11:15.370
You don't want it
to break, and you

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.411
don't want to make good
on your 20-year warranty.

00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:21.180
That costs you money
as a manufacturer.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.530
So the circuit design
in most modules

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.300
follows something
very similar to this.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.285
Now, what you see when
you glance at this,

00:11:28.285 --> 00:11:30.660
what you should be looking at
is-- here are the contacts.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.590
Those are the leads
coming out of the module.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.940
They're essentially
these leads coming out

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.360
in the back of the junction box.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.550
If you want to turn it
around again, here we go.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.210
So here are the module
leads coming out.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.460
And the question is,
how do I string together

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.340
the cells inside of my module?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.530
How do I string together
these cells right in here

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.840
to provide the greatest
value to the customer?

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.020
Do I connect them all in
series and make just one

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.354
long, snaky electronic path?

00:11:56.354 --> 00:11:57.770
Do I connect them
all in parallel?

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.920
But that would require
a lot of wiring.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.530
Do I do something in between?

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.530
And if you were to
come up close to here

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.330
and inspect it,
what you would see

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.370
is that you have
strings in parallel.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.920
So you have one going from
here, down and around.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.106
That's one, two, and three.

00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:17.042
Right?

00:12:17.042 --> 00:12:19.794
Three of these
strings, and they're

00:12:19.794 --> 00:12:22.210
connected-- those three strings
are connected in parallel.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.350
Each string is comprised
of several solar cells.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.140
Now, for historical reasons, the
crystalline silicon solar cell

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.730
modules have typically had
strings of around 36 cells

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.390
connected in series.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.820
What this does is it yields
a maximum power point

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.880
voltage somewhere in the
range of 17 to 18 volts.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.270
If you remember the
VOCs of your solar cells

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.040
and that maximum power point,
the voltage of your solar cells

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.280
are some around 0.5.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.750
And so you take 36 cells,
divide by 2-- or multiply

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.110
by 0.5, if you will.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.040
And you're landing
somewhere in this ballpark.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.380
And what that does is it enables
you to hit, even under lower

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.600
light conditions,
the overpotential

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.070
needed to charge a
rechargeable battery.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.500
So if there's a 12-volt
battery and the voltage output

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.260
of the battery is
between, say, 12

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.610
and kind of dropping down
to 10 before it starts

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.260
using its utility-- when
you try to start your car

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.219
and it doesn't really turn over
and you can start your engine,

00:13:19.219 --> 00:13:21.260
it's probably because the
voltage in your battery

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.690
has dropped to about 10 volts.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.040
The overpotential needed
to charge it, 13-plus,

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.190
that's what you're
hitting with the string.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.220
And that's, for
historical reasons,

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.680
why we had this number of
cells connected together.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.010
As grid-tied systems
become more common,

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.770
though, this constraint
is being reduced.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.686
Over 90% of all of
our solar modules

00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:45.310
today are connected to the grid,
including the ones in my home.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.280
So when I'm not there and it's
producing excess electricity,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.820
it's pumping it into the grid.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.440
And maybe we're using
some of my electrons here.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.320
I don't know.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.380
So as grid-tied systems
become more common,

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.200
you care less about meeting
the overpotential requirements

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.930
for a battery.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.034
You care more about matching
the output of your solar module

00:14:04.034 --> 00:14:05.700
with whatever inverter
technology you're

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.710
using to convert the
DC power into AC power.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.300
Number two, why do they
spec the modules that size?

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.095
You notice that I could
lift it, just barely.

00:14:16.095 --> 00:14:17.220
I'm a university professor.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.510
I sit in my chair and
think most of the time.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.680
A person, somebody strong out
there in the field mounting

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.477
modules, say if Jessica in the
back were a module installer,

00:14:25.477 --> 00:14:28.060
she could lift this no problem
probably with her pinky finger.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.680
And that's why they're
bite-sized, right?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.974
They're a single-person,
liftable, installable modules.

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:35.640
You can't make them
too big, or else you

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.510
start needing cranes which, of
course, has its own benefits

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.991
for large field installations.

00:14:39.991 --> 00:14:41.990
Wouldn't really make sense
with our current mode

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:43.750
of installation on residential.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.576
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:48.202 --> 00:14:53.040
AUDIENCE: If you had a
battery-- if you were charging

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.970
a battery with the module,
you also wouldn't want

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.469
to have too many volts, right?

00:14:59.469 --> 00:15:01.510
Maybe that's a really
basic electronics question.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the question is, do you

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.040
benefit by having
larger overpotential

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.100
when recharging a battery?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.580
Well, I'm not a battery
expert, so I'll definitely

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.452
caution on this.

00:15:14.452 --> 00:15:16.910
I would imagine that there
would be some law of diminishing

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.410
returns.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.534
You would be limited in
terms of the recharge rate,

00:15:19.534 --> 00:15:21.900
not by the overpotential
but by some other component

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.640
like the electrolyte
diffusivity,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.970
let's say, inside of your
system-- as an example.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.417
But I would defer that
to the battery experts.

00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:31.000
My impression, though,
is that you get

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.208
a law of diminishing returns.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.110
Packing fraction in the modules.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.800
So we talked about the
different cell sizes

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.830
if you're processing
discrete cells.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.120
The higher packing fraction
enables lower glass encapsulant

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.980
and cost per watt peak.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.900
The lower packing
fraction, you get

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.060
to play some games with
optical concentration.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.300
For here, for instance, if you
have space between your cells,

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.940
you can have a diffuse
Lambertian scatterer

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.160
in the back which will reflect
the light at a different angle,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.140
scattering it.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.020
And that light could be trapped
by total internal reflection

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.130
inside of the glass if the
angle reaching the glass

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.200
is, say, 15 degrees or greater.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.070
So you can play
some games there.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.690
That's why the Tedlar
back skin being white

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:20.310
is typically used in most solar
modules, so that we reflect

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:22.350
and then scatter and
then trap the light that

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.110
comes in in between the cells.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:32.340
So to put this into
another fancier,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.160
three-dimensional framework-- we
have our interconnected cells.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.330
We have our encapsulant
above and below.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.100
The encapsulant material
is an interesting thing.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.840
It's solid at room
temperature but it

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.460
begins to flow at
around 150, 175 degrees

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.460
C which means, if
you've ever put

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.360
a plastic bottle in the oven
and you've noticed how it begins

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.160
to melt and sag and
droop, that's essentially

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.442
the type of flow that you
would experience inside

00:16:59.442 --> 00:17:00.650
of this encapsulant material.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.240
And it flows around the cells.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.568
And it fuses them together
with the glass on top,

00:17:05.568 --> 00:17:07.359
and they stick together
once they cool down

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.410
to room temperature.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.970
That forms what's
called a laminate.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.730
Because now you
have the back skin--

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.506
the frame isn't
shown right here--

00:17:16.506 --> 00:17:17.839
you have the back skin material.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.290
You have the
encapsulant, the cells,

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.706
the encapsulant
on the other side,

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:24.130
and your glass on the front
side all together forming

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.000
a nice stack of materials.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.610
And they're stuck together,
or bound, by the encapsulant.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.080
That's called a laminate.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.430
It doesn't resist bending
very well, or twist very well,

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.280
because it doesn't yet
have the frame on it.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.630
But it certainly can be
transported around the factory

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.540
and moved from one
station to another

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.290
without risk of, say,
the cells falling out.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.470
They're pretty well fused there.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.390
In terms of moving
to new materials,

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.090
there's a lot of work right now
to squeeze the commodity costs

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.240
out of solar module
manufacturing.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.260
If you look at the percentage
of cost of commodity materials

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.230
in the solar module,
it is quite high.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.580
And so people are focusing
on new types of transparent

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.000
front surface materials
that let the light in,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.641
glass replacements.

00:18:03.641 --> 00:18:04.140
Right?

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.660
You could envision--
we have many examples

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.280
of really hard, resistant,
polymeric materials

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.300
in our daily lives.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.840
People are looking into those.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.070
The encapsulant materials--
ethyl vinyl acetate

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.340
is fairly expensive, and there
aren't that many companies

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.600
that manufacture it.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.390
And so people are looking
to options to replace it.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.490
Tedlar even more so,
that back skin material.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.234
Although the challenge there
is a lot harder, a lot tougher.

00:18:28.234 --> 00:18:28.900
No pun intended.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.500
It's a really strong material.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.740
And a lot of our modern
chemistry or chemical

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.070
engineering goes into
making and designing it.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.160
And then finally finding some
replacement for the frame.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.022
People are talking
about frameless modules.

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:44.730
That means taking off
this aluminum piece

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.650
right here on the side and
just leaving the laminate

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.530
and somehow providing
the mechanical rigidity

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.930
to the laminate and avoiding the
cost of the extruded aluminum

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.100
components.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.610
So a lot of work going
in in module design.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.530
This is a picture of folks
mounting the aluminum framing

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.070
onto the module.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:08.530
These are essentially
large steel components

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.670
that are pushing the
aluminum into the module

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.640
and making sure that there's a
snug fit between the aluminum

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.890
and the module itself.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.610
As you can see by the size
and shapes of these cells,

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.310
that gives you an indication
of what company that is.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.850
Module technology--
there's some work as well

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.420
going into
replacing-- let's see,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.450
here we go-- replacing the
tabbing-stringing step.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:33.950
Right?

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.019
So this is a machine
the tabs and strings

00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:37.060
the cells to one another.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.341
We'll see one at Fraunhofer.

00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:40.090
It's really impressive
when you see it go,

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.631
but it's also quite expensive.

00:19:41.631 --> 00:19:43.880
And so if you could get rid
of the tabbing stringing--

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.710
imagine just lining
up the little cells

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.340
like cookies on a cookie sheet.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.180
And they all are interconnected
by contact with whatever back

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.330
skin material is on the
back that is printed,

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.160
let's say, with the
circuitry already.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.429
You would wind up in
a situation like this,

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:59.220
where you have your
cells in direct contact

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.304
with some printed
circuitry on your back.

00:20:01.304 --> 00:20:03.720
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom--
and you're off and running.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.340
In this particular case, you see
these little white dots here.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:13.380
The grid pattern on that cell
is a radial spiderweb pattern

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.200
that emanates from
that central point,

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.730
collects current from
nearby-- essentially,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.540
an area about that
big is collected,

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.730
let's say by that little
point right there.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.920
And then there's a hole drilled
through the solar cell where

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.110
the metal is wrapping
through to the back.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.960
And that's where it's making
contact with the back side

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.300
right there.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.480
And there are other
regions of the solar cell

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.130
that are making contact with
the bulk, the base, if you will.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.560
So you have both of your
n- and your p-type contacts

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.330
on the back side
of your solar cell.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.050
And that's what's
shown in this drawing.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.570
So there are attempts, as
well, to put all the contacts,

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.400
or connect the
contacts, onto the back

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.770
to enable this
monolithic manufacturing.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.270
Yes.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.907
AUDIENCE: How does
that not short?

00:20:53.907 --> 00:20:54.490
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.330
So how is that not a short?

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.270
Let me show you how that
would not be a short.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.600
What I'm going to do is attempt
to draw two different cell

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.020
designs that could
lead to not shorting.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.040
One cell design that
could lead to not shorting

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.600
would be-- let's say this
would be our front surface.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.756
Our base is-- I'm going
to draw it flat here

00:21:17.756 --> 00:21:19.380
in the back just for
simplicity, but it

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.160
could be textured as well.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:30.750
I'm going to call this a lightly
doped semiconductor material.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.810
And then I could
have heavily doped--

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.960
let's say this would be--
I'm going to exaggerate

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.000
here just for effect.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.460
This could be my heavily
n-type doped material.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.000
This could be my heavily
p-type doped material.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.180
So I'm drawing p plus, n plus,
another n plus, another p plus.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.540
So I have charge separation
occurring at these regions

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.260
right here and then
contacts on the other side.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.510
This is my electron contact.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.050
This is my hole contact.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.760
This is my electron contact.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.490
This is my hole contact.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.020
And now what's happening
is photoexcited carriers

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.490
are being generated in here.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.577
But the field that separates
them is all in the back.

00:22:12.577 --> 00:22:14.410
And so now the carriers
are being separated,

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.030
electrons being collected by
the darker-shaded, rather,

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.270
the shaded areas,
and the holes being

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.890
collected by these unshaded
contacts here in the back.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.770
And, if I'm clever about
my contact positioning,

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.757
here I have kind of an
interdigitated electron

00:22:27.757 --> 00:22:28.590
and hole collectors.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.170
Right?

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.430
I'm able to collect both without
having any sort of shunting.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.400
Another design might
be-- let's see.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.710
So this is called an
Interdigitated Back Contact

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.326
structure, or IBC.

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.660
AUDIENCE: What is
it, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.610
PROFESSOR: Actually,
less relevant

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.120
in this particular case.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.070
In most interdigitated
back contact cells,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.010
it's actually n-type silicon,
lightly doped n-type silicon,

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:58.190
just because point defects tend
to have smaller capture cross

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.190
sections than n-type
silicon and p-type silicon.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.090
So minority carrier
lifetime tends to be larger.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.080
Another cell design, again,
looking at cross section,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.850
you might have-- this
being your solar cell--

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.850
you could add texture,
but I'm omitting it just

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.670
for simplicity.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:20.130
Now, let's see, we drill a
hole using a laser right here.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.120
So we have a very thin hole.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.300
Of course, in three
dimensions, there's

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.470
mechanical rigidity by
the bulk of the material

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.560
in the other dimension.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.184
But we have this hole
drilled through--

00:23:29.184 --> 00:23:31.890
and we can make about 18,000
of these holes in about

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.820
six seconds with modern
laser technology,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.700
so it's really not that
hard to make this happen.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.190
Although a lot of engineering
effort is put into it,

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.267
but it is possible.

00:23:42.267 --> 00:23:44.600
And then you could have your
contact metallization, say,

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.630
for electrons right here.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:56.490
You could have the p-n
junction like this.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.340
So this, here, could be
your n plus material.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.430
Again, n plus material, this,
by effect, would also be.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.140
And you can have your
p materials over here.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.200
And you could make
contact to the back right

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.720
here and contact to
the back right here.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.810
And as long as there's no metal
short between the electron

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.530
and hole-- say, for example, you
generate an electron hole pair

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.360
here, the electron
goes up to here.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.600
It goes through the metal to
the back and gets pulled out.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.560
And the hole goes to
this contact over here,

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.790
and that's how you
separate the charges.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.740
So this would be an example
of an emitter wrap through

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.260
or a metal wrap through
device technology.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.070
Also shown-- MWT,
Metal Wrap Through.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.750
So we have at least two
different device geometries

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.410
and many more device
architectures that could fit in

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.680
with this future vision.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.930
The problem right now is that
the printed back skin materials

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.770
cost about five times more
than the non-printed ones

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.780
just because they're
very low scale.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.620
People haven't
investigated it much.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.610
So any time you introduce
a new technology

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.360
into the market-- you'll
hear it over and over again

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.568
in these innovation and
entrepreneurship classes here

00:25:05.568 --> 00:25:07.550
at MIT-- you have to
be significantly better

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.050
than the competition.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.740
If you're only a
little bit better,

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.537
you face an enormous
barrier to entry

00:25:13.537 --> 00:25:15.870
because you have the rest of
the industry pedaling along

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.540
on their bicycles
in a huge peloton,

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.270
benefiting from each
other's drafting,

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.720
and you're on your own bike
facing your own headwinds.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.220
Right?

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.310
Trying to build everything
up-- your own factory,

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.930
your own expertise.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.810
It's challenging.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.300
But I'm not trying to put
a damper on innovation.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.145
I'm just trying to qualify the
areas of greatest opportunity

00:25:32.145 --> 00:25:35.099
and lowest resistance to change.

00:25:35.099 --> 00:25:36.140
Go ahead, prove me wrong.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:36.990
Make a difference.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.984
Without that sort of
headstrong mentality of,

00:25:42.984 --> 00:25:44.400
gosh, I know I
have something here

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.310
and I'm just going to prove
the world that I have it,

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.685
we wouldn't have, for example,
the Pilkington plate glass

00:25:48.685 --> 00:25:51.325
process working-- or float
glass process, sorry.

00:25:51.325 --> 00:25:53.700
We'd still probably be pouring
and grinding and polishing

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.580
our panes of glass and
they'd be very expensive.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.520
That was a little side story,
but it took them about 10 years

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.310
to develop the
float glass process

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.224
inside of a company
owned by a family,

00:26:05.224 --> 00:26:06.890
as opposed to a
publicly traded company.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.525
So they could
continue losing money

00:26:08.525 --> 00:26:10.650
over a long period of time
until they perfected it.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.899
And once they got it right,
the whole world copied it,

00:26:12.899 --> 00:26:14.870
but it took 10 years
of good investment

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.340
for them to get it right.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.230
All right.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.620
Let's move on.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.982
We're going to talk about
module spec sheets here.

00:26:21.982 --> 00:26:23.440
When you came into
class today, you

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.436
should have picked
up one of these.

00:26:26.436 --> 00:26:31.490
This is an example of a First
Solar module spec sheet.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.630
What it does is it hits
you front and center.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.760
The company name-- First Solar.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.790
FS Series 3-- that's the name
of the module, and PV module.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.480
So it gives you the
mechanical description,

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.482
the size, the weight.

00:26:45.482 --> 00:26:46.940
And then, on the
back, it gives you

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.130
all of the technical
parameters that you've wanted.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.790
So on the backside
of the-- we'll

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.590
go to the First
Solar spec sheet.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.090
OK.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.230
Well, on your spec
sheet right here, you

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.950
can look at some
of the parameters.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.940
There's power at the
maximum power point,

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.780
voltage and current at
the maximum power point,

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.117
the VOC, the ISC, and so forth.

00:27:07.117 --> 00:27:09.200
You have a bunch of different
parameters including

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.505
the temperature sensitivity.

00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:11.170
Right?

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.040
How much does the power degrade
with increasing temperature?

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.190
So all of these things
we've studied in class,

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.070
and now when you pick up
the spec sheet you're a pro.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.090
You look at it, and
you're like, oh yeah.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.790
I know what that does.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.880
I know what that means.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.130
I know how to model the
energy output of the system.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.740
And that's essentially what the
engineers do when they pick up

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.700
the spec sheet.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.327
They read it.

00:27:30.327 --> 00:27:32.660
And then they input those
parameters into their computer

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.822
models, and they can predict how
these modules will perform out

00:27:35.822 --> 00:27:38.770
in the field at
a given location.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.330
OK.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.900
And so you have a variety
of different spec sheets.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.240
These are the modules
that are on my roof.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.740
They're Sharp 187-watt modules.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.690
You have, for example,
right here an example

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.500
of an Evergreen Solar module.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.040
Let's spend a minute here
looking a little more deeply.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.600
These modules, these
Evergreen Solar modules,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.540
are the same size, but there are
three different power outputs.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.290
And I think we went
through this already.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.230
We have good cells, medium
cells and bad cells.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.980
And they're binned together
in the different modules

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.910
so that they can extract
the maximum price

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.260
from the consumer.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.150
So that's why you have the
three different ratings of power

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.771
for three different
types of modules

00:28:19.771 --> 00:28:22.020
with, essentially, the same
form factor, the same size

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.050
and weight.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.244
They're just
different-quality cells.

00:28:25.244 --> 00:28:26.180
Yeah.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.230
So that's that.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.700
Temperature
coefficients, so forth.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.000
OK.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.100
One thing to note right
here is, on the back sides

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.580
of your modules, you typically
have a little diagram that

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.235
shows you how to interconnect
one module to the next.

00:28:41.235 --> 00:28:42.610
And those are the
cables that are

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.930
used to do the interconnection.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.200
There are some companies
trying to get fancy right now

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.340
and saying, well, instead
of interconnecting and then

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.580
affixing the modules
separately, why don't we

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.340
just make these modules
that kind of click together?

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.120
And part of the clicking
process is the interconnection

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.050
electrically, and the
other part, obviously,

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.620
is the mechanical rigidity.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:07.920
So there's certainly room for
optimization on module design.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.420
Yeah.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.100
Jessica.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.600
AUDIENCE: When they're
sold-- when modules are sold,

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.432
they're advertised for their
voltage at maximum power point,

00:29:13.432 --> 00:29:13.931
right?

00:29:13.931 --> 00:29:15.095
PROFESSOR: Mm-hmm.

00:29:15.095 --> 00:29:17.636
AUDIENCE: What's a software that
we should use-- I'm actually

00:29:17.636 --> 00:29:18.046
using this for another class.

00:29:18.046 --> 00:29:20.840
What's the software that we
should use that maximum power

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.291
point voltage into-- translate
that into what it's actually

00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:26.737
going to be? [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:26.737 --> 00:29:27.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:32.130
So the question became how do
I go from a module spec sheet,

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:35.590
like this, with this
data right here,

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.190
and translate that into number
of kilowatt hours produced

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:43.100
per unit time-- day, year--
at a given site location.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.220
The best program that I know
of that encompasses all of this

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.700
would be a program called
PVWatts, produced by NREL.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:54.420
PVWatts, all together,
and you can look it up,

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.030
you can use it
online, and you can

00:29:56.030 --> 00:30:02.570
input your specific module spec
parameters into the program.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.490
Now, that said, we
have a lot of the tools

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.010
to do the estimates ourselves.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.980
If you ruffle back
to homework-- I

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.590
think it was
homework number two,

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.000
we calculated the
output of a solar system

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.270
based on the module
spec parameters.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.070
And so now that we can
pick up a module spec sheet

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.470
and read it in a
bit more detail,

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.688
we can perform those estimates
a little bit more accurately.

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:24.790
Yep.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:25.290
Omar.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.755
AUDIENCE: Your first solar
panel is a lot smaller

00:30:27.755 --> 00:30:29.400
than that panel right there?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.250
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.630
AUDIENCE: So is there a
reason why First Solar

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.630
goes with smaller cells?

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.296
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:34.296 --> 00:30:38.530
So why is this First Solar
module, the FS Series 3 module,

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.770
a little smaller than some
of the crystalline silicon

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.200
modules?

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.690
For thin film
deposition, especially

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.050
for this closed-space
sublimation process

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.080
that First Solar
uses, you're limited

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.910
in terms of the deposition area
by the uniformity of deposition

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.090
over a large region.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.870
So if you're sputtering
the material,

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.440
it's typically
related to the size

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.610
of your target and the
distance to your substrate.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.400
That will limit the maximum size
that you can deposit uniformly.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.900
And you probably want to deposit
within plus or minus 2%, let's

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.400
say.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.420
Maybe 5%.

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.430
I'm not extremely privy to the
precise tolerances in the PV

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.230
industry in terms of thin
film thickness variation,

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.980
but that would be my estimate.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.570
And in terms of these thermal
evaporation processes,

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.430
again, it's how the
machine is designed.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.640
So I imagine you could
probably go bigger.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.060
Is it cost effective?

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.270
Question mark.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.950
Somebody at First Solar most
obviously did the cost analysis

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.440
and said that this is the
optimum between a variety

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.880
of different factors, between
manufacturability and ease

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.475
of installation.

00:31:42.475 --> 00:31:42.975
Yeah.

00:31:42.975 --> 00:31:45.433
AUDIENCE: Is there any reason
why they don't put efficiency

00:31:45.433 --> 00:31:46.390
on this sheet?

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.030
PROFESSOR: Is there a reason
why they don't put efficiency

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:48.950
on the sheet?

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.700
Well, you could
probably very easily

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.470
calculate the efficiency, right?

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.100
There are two types of
module efficiencies.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.420
There is what's called
total area efficiency, where

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.080
you take the total
area of your module

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.740
all the way up to
the aluminum frame

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.140
and calculate that as your area.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.640
So you take your power--
your maximum power

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.140
rated at AM 1.5 sun conditions
and divide it by the area.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:17.244
There's also a variety of
other less straightforward ways

00:32:17.244 --> 00:32:18.910
of calculating
efficiency, some of which

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.250
take the active area
of the cells only.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.740
Others exclude the frame.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.570
And so the module efficiency is
not extremely straightforward

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:29.070
parameter.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:32.817
It has to be specified based
on what areas is assumed.

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.400
That would be my
estimate for why they

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.566
didn't put it right on here.

00:32:35.566 --> 00:32:38.159
And secondly, their module
efficiency, if you do the math,

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:40.450
that one probably turns out
to be somewhere between 11%

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:41.890
and 11.5%.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.740
Now they're hitting 12% or so.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.960
That's not a very high
number compared to, say,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.390
a crystalline silicon module.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.630
And so it wouldn't be
probably something they

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.484
advertise in their spec sheet.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.930
Describe how PV module
power output is affected

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.510
by the cell mismatch losses.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.890
Warning-- I'm going to
lose some of you on this.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.330
Those of you without a very
strong electrical engineering

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.470
or physics background,
I'm going to pick you up

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:13.900
at point number three, so
plant a flag right here.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:14.860
We'll come back to it.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.220
But for those who
care to follow along,

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.290
this is some really
fun stuff that

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.180
can get into why we want
to match our cells properly

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.840
in terms of their outputs.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.750
So the total current
output-- this

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.570
is the ideal diode
equation without all

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.700
the fancy two-diode
model, recombination

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.330
of the space charge region,
recombination of the bulk,

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.550
without the series resistance
and shunt resistance.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:40.280
Just a very simple explanation
of this ideal diode model.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.130
What we're doing is our M is
the number of cells in parallel

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.450
and our N is the number
of cells in series.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.520
So we go back to our
equivalent circuit diagrams

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.940
where we have two voltage
current sources that

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.460
are connected in series.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.930
If you connect
those two in series,

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.460
now the voltages will add.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.500
So the effective voltage
across the entire system,

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.360
if you draw a black box around
your two individual voltage

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.850
producers, the effective
voltage across the entire system

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:11.900
will be voltage 1 plus
voltage 2, in series.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:15.280
The currents-- now, if you
think about the current,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.489
you can think of current--
the first order--

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.941
as a river of electrons trying
to flow through your circuit.

00:34:21.941 --> 00:34:23.440
If there's any
bottleneck somewhere,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.590
that's going to limit
the current that can flow

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.389
through the entire circuit.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:29.520
So the combined
current is going to be

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.982
limited by the worst performer.

00:34:31.982 --> 00:34:34.190
In mathematical terms, it
would be the harmonic mean.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.690
1 over effective current
would be 1 over current 1

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.150
plus 1 over current 2.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:42.469
So what we see here is, if
we have a number of cells

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:45.526
connected in
parallel-- now, instead

00:34:45.526 --> 00:34:47.400
of having them connected
in series like this,

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.158
you connect them in parallel--
now the currents are adding.

00:34:50.158 --> 00:34:52.449
And the voltage will be
limited by the worst performer.

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:54.040
Because the
potential across both

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.630
is going to be
limited by whatever

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.300
the lowest potential is.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.080
So when we connect in
parallel, we add currents.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.130
And when we connect in
series, we add voltages.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.550
That's a very simple
way to think about it,

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:10.360
and that's why we have the
M appearing here up top.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.022
If you have a number of
cells connected in parallel,

00:35:13.022 --> 00:35:14.480
you will essentially
be multiplying

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.050
the [? illuminated ?] current
of one cell by whatever M it is.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.750
And if you have a number of
cells connected in series,

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.490
that will impact the voltage.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:23.990
OK.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:31.580
So that's an expression
that is useful for N and M

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.360
number of identical cells
connected in either series

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.980
or parallel, respectively.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.260
And in practice, if we have
bad performers in the bunch,

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.080
if we have one cell
that's performing worse

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.320
than another, either because
it is intrinsically worse--

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.360
it is a defective cell
that somehow got in there

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.990
or became defective during use--
or it's a temporary effect.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.580
Maybe a seagull just
landed on top of that cell

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.330
and is shading it.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.650
Right?

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.800
So whatever the reason is--
temporary or permanent--

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.260
that cell number 2,
now, is a bad apple.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.000
And so if we're looking
at parallel mismatches,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.430
we take what we know
about cells in parallel.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:12.150
OK.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.110
The voltage is limited
by the worst performer.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.242
And we look at the
individual IV curves

00:36:17.242 --> 00:36:18.450
of the good and the bad cell.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:23.170
This is the good cell right
here, this curve there.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:23.680
Right?

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.412
And so this, now,
is positive power.

00:36:26.412 --> 00:36:28.370
Essentially, power coming
out of the solar cell

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.040
is plotted in the
first quadrant.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.180
We have a lot of
power coming out

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.440
and a large voltage
for our good cell.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.050
Here's our bad cell right there.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.560
So slightly lower
current outputs

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.640
given by the logarithmic effect.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.980
And the voltage is lower,
significantly lower,

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.320
than, say, the good cell.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.060
And so the combined
output right here,

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.100
the current at short
circuit current conditions,

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.220
is going to be the sum
of the good and the bad.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.660
So that's there.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.050
The voltage is going to be
the harmonic mean, so limited

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.990
by the worst performer.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:04.420
That's how low-voltage
cells can really

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.170
mess up parallel strings.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:11.560
So for example, this set
of two rows of cells,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.940
this one right here, which
is all connected in series.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.650
It's connected in parallel
to this one and this one.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.960
And so if one of these
three subsets of cells

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.710
has a lower voltage
than the others,

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.280
the combined voltage
output of the entire module

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.960
will be lower.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.350
Similarly, now we've
put them in series,

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.420
if we have a bad
cell that's producing

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.050
less current than the
good cell-- and notice

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.900
that they're saying
open circuit voltage now

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:47.330
just for the thought experiment
here in the classroom.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.870
Typically, if a cell is
performing worse than current,

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:50.860
it will also have
a lower voltage.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.818
But just for the thought
experiment right here,

00:37:52.818 --> 00:37:56.640
we have bad cell, good cell.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.880
Bad cell has about half the
current of the good cell.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.060
So the voltage output
in series is going

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.710
to be the addition of the two.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:03.380
Boom, boom.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.440
Then you're up to here.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.190
But the current output will be
limited by the worst performer.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.140
And again, the combined
output of this set

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.860
of cells connected in series is
going to be right around here.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.070
And so based on your
cell performance--

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.310
if you know that
your voltage has

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:21.450
a certain variance in
your manufacturing line

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:23.991
and your current has a certain
variance in your manufacturing

00:38:23.991 --> 00:38:26.190
line, that might entice
you to string together

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.940
your cells in one
way or another,

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.880
depending on how you want
to mitigate your losses.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.060
Shaded cells-- so up to
now, everybody kind of

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.260
gets based on Kirchhoff's
laws and so forth

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.064
from equivalent circuit
diagrams, so we're rolling.

00:38:42.064 --> 00:38:43.730
Now we're going to
get the shaded cells.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.630
And here's where it
becomes a little bit more

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.660
difficult to understand
absent the reading

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.660
in that book over there.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.440
Did everybody get a chance
to see the blue book?

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.920
Did it make its
rounds over here?

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.650
No, it didn't.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:56.190
Why don't we pass
the blue book around?

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.750
Omar over there didn't get
a chance to see it yet.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.250
We're going to
consider that we have

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.250
10 identical solar cells
connected in series,

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.340
and this one over
here is shaded.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.740
What happens now?

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.590
So this is described, I believe,
in figure 5.7 in the book, one

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.600
with the green little tab.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.610
We've assumed that the
combined IV characteristic

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.500
of the n good cells
is this one right here

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.270
and the one bad cell
is this right here.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:30.810
So it's a little bit of a
strange IV characteristic.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.450
And what happens next?

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:38.050
If you combine the two in series
and you use the same protocol

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.000
that we've done so far,
the voltage will add.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.780
So whatever voltage gain right
here has been added over here.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.930
But the current is
going to be limited

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.830
by the worst performer,
which happens to be

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.800
this solar cell right here.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.640
And so the combined
output is going

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.280
to be lower-- significantly
lower-- than those

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.030
of the good cells.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.910
And that's what happens
when one cell in a string

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.800
is shaded if there aren't any
fancy electronics to allow

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.000
the current to bypass it.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.710
Furthermore, this
amount of power

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.840
will be dissipated
in the bad cell when

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.990
the string is short circuited.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:15.080
It can change a bit when you
start moving toward operating

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.940
conditions, but it's a
sizable amount of power being

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.370
dumped into that bad cell.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:23.820
And in practice, that
cell is reverse biased.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.490
Let me show you using
our wonderful PV

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:32.900
CD-ROM exactly why that is.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:37.090
So here we have two solar
cells connected in series.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:41.840
And they're both producing
an equal amount of current

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.880
because they have an equal
number of these yellow arrows

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.380
incident on them.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.190
And they're equal in
every other aspect.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.250
So it's still a thought
experiment right now.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.560
The current that is cycling
through this circuit,

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.320
in the external
circuit right here--

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.272
the magnitude of that current
is being indicated by the color.

00:41:00.272 --> 00:41:02.230
And, in this particular
case, it's very bright.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.040
It's bright green.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.940
It indicates a lot of current
is flowing through it.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.040
So, up to now,
everything makes sense.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.050
This is in short
circuit conditions,

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:11.020
so there's no voltage.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.620
There's no potential
across either cell.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.030
It's in short
circuit conditions,

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.710
and current is flowing through
this circuit right here.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.640
Now I'm going to
mismatch the two cells.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.381
I'm going to exchange one of
the cells for a bad apple.

00:41:25.381 --> 00:41:25.880
OK.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.082
First off, I know,
just from what

00:41:28.082 --> 00:41:30.540
we've been talking about so
far that the current is limited

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.540
by the worst performer,
that the current flowing

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.910
through the external circuit
is now going to be lower.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:38.040
And the first order-- it's more
or less approximate to what

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.795
the current is in this bad cell.

00:41:39.795 --> 00:41:41.170
So the bad cell
right here, which

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.700
is indicated by the two arrows
now instead of the four,

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.452
this shaded cell right here
is producing less current.

00:41:47.452 --> 00:41:49.410
And so I know, based on
what we've talked about

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.570
so far, that the
combined current output

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.160
of the entire circuit is going
to be approximately this one.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.290
So hence you see a
darker color represented,

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.372
the same color that's
flowing through the cell.

00:42:00.372 --> 00:42:01.830
So what happens to
the large amount

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.050
of current that's being
generated inside of this one?

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:06.067
That cell still has
the capacity to produce

00:42:06.067 --> 00:42:07.150
a large amount of current.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.720
Where is it going?

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.410
Well, some of that current is
going through this cell right

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.305
here, forward biasing
it, which would

00:42:14.305 --> 00:42:18.460
result in a negative bias, or
reverse bias, of the bad cell.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.750
Because the potential
across this combined system

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:22.780
still has to be zero.

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.410
You're in short
circuit conditions,

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.100
so the potential here has to be
equal to the potential there.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.975
So what I've effectively
done is I've reverse

00:42:28.975 --> 00:42:32.520
biased my bad cell.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.660
And we'll get to why
that's a problem later on.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.076
Those who are
electrical engineers

00:42:36.076 --> 00:42:38.110
can already begin
conjuring up ideas

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.200
of reverse biased breakdown.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.140
We'll explain why reverse
bias is bad in a few.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.590
Now, if you had a series
of these cells connected--

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.500
a bunch of these cells
connected in series--

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.380
and they were all producing
copious amounts of juice,

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.795
and you had one bad
apple in your string,

00:42:54.795 --> 00:42:56.920
you would be dumping a
considerable amount of power

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.690
across that.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.939
Or you could be dumping a
considerable amount of power

00:42:59.939 --> 00:43:01.590
across that one cell.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:04.640
And that's where
this graph right here

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.666
comes from, the power
dissipated within the bad cell.

00:43:07.666 --> 00:43:09.290
And that's a problem
because if there's

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.210
any weakness in the p-n
junction of that bad cell

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.030
and you're reverse
biasing it, you're

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.582
going to be flooding
a lot of current

00:43:15.582 --> 00:43:17.040
through that one
little spot, which

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.085
means that that spot's
going to heat up.

00:43:19.085 --> 00:43:22.660
And it's going to form a hot
spot, which has the potential

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:23.450
to get very hot.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.300
And we know that the
encapsulant materials

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.460
flow at around 150
to 175 degrees C,

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.210
and some other material
failures can occur above that.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:35.020
So hot spots are bad.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.370
If you reverse
bias your devices,

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:39.830
you can enter what's called
a breakdown regime that,

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.230
essentially, is
driven, oftentimes,

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.820
in a real solar cell by isolated
points and your weaknesses

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.600
in the p-n junction where
current is going to flow.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.240
And that leads to the hot
spot failure I just mentioned.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:55.600
Here's thermographic imaging--
not using the fancy camera

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:58.485
that we have downstairs, using
a much simpler camera out

00:43:58.485 --> 00:43:59.720
in the field, lower cost.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.440
These are high enough
temperature variances

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.590
to be able to detect using
pretty low-tech technology.

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.315
It's not a small
amount of current

00:44:07.315 --> 00:44:08.440
going through a solar cell.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.070
These are large, massive
amounts of current

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.920
going through defective
cells in the field.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.990
And so you can use these
cameras to visualize

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.369
the underperforming
cells inside of modules.

00:44:19.369 --> 00:44:20.410
Now, that's pretty nifty.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:24.730
All right.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:27.580
So we planted that flag,
and let's come back to it.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.330
We're going to describe
how microinverters

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:32.630
and microelectronics can improve
module performance output.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.880
Even if you didn't follow
all the detailed explanation

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.680
until now, you can
appreciate the fact

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.200
that a bad apple or bad
solar cell, connected

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.660
in series or in parallel
with the rest of them,

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.660
can cause the combined output
of the module to be lower.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.260
And so we're going to talk
about how microelectronics

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.330
and eventually microinverters
can help resolve that,

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:55.950
either on a cell level or on a
larger module-to-module level.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.610
The simple principle of a
bypass diode of a cell is this.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.990
If the reverse bias
current becomes too large,

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:05.010
instead of forcing the current
to flow through the bad cell,

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.310
you can force it to flow
around a bypass diode.

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.180
And therefore, it
short circuits--

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.940
it leaves the cell
out of the circuit.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.700
Right?

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.430
The current is
flowing around it,

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.220
and so you result in less of
a degradation of your module.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:22.410
To put it from an equivalent
IV curve perspective,

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.520
instead of adding this IV curve
here with the rest of them,

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.530
you're simply moving
the current around it

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.940
so you would have the n
good cells, and that's it.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.050
End of story.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.070
The 10th cell would just be
taken out of your circuit.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.970
It would be pushed aside.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:37.660
OK.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.595
So on a cell level,
that make sense.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.620
Let's skip over a couple
of these, I think.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.100
On a module level, as well,
it can make a lot of sense.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.770
And here, it really
does because the shading

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:54.384
losses on a module level
tend to be more severe.

00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:56.550
You can have, for example,
a tree in the wrong place

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.890
or a telephone pole
somewhere, shading

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.680
one particular module in an
array, an array of modules.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.506
On my roof, for example,
there are 12 Sharp 187s.

00:46:06.506 --> 00:46:10.280
So if you have a series of
these modules up on the roof,

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.240
you can cause the
current to circumvent

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.910
one of the modules that's
underperforming, again,

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.380
using the bypass diodes.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:21.660
And those are fairly standard
in most of the junction boxes.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:25.930
So inside of here, there is
some very simple electronics

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:30.010
to prevent the modules
from becoming power sinks

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.210
and perhaps even drawing
power from the grid.

00:46:36.629 --> 00:46:37.129
OK.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:46.160
So microinverters--
some people say, well,

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.560
instead of just managing
power on a DC basis

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.010
and either dealing
with the mismatch loss

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:56.160
or cutting bad apples out
of the circuit altogether,

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.120
let's do something even better.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:03.090
Let's try to-- to put this in
childhood education terms--

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.320
let's let every module perform
up to their greatest potential,

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.487
and then everybody is happy.

00:47:07.487 --> 00:47:07.986
Right?

00:47:07.986 --> 00:47:09.830
So we're going to convert
the power directly

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.367
on the back of the module
into AC, alternating current.

00:47:12.367 --> 00:47:14.450
And then we're going to
use electronics from there

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:17.750
to essentially add
the currents together

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.690
once we have defined
the voltage at 120 volts

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:22.100
at alternating current.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.700
And the advantage of that
is that if one module is

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.920
underperforming, instead
of contributing zero,

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.180
it's now contributing
some fraction.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.450
If the mismatch was small enough
not to trip any of the bypass

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.960
diodes but still degrade the
power of the overall system,

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.610
now you're able to
recover-- you're

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:39.580
able to allow that good
module to perform up

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.070
to its true potential
instead of being dragged down

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.190
by the others.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:44.850
And so the
microinverter companies

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:48.290
that are proposing, and
actually marketing and selling,

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.500
modules that apply the
electronics directly

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.250
in the back of the
solar panels have

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:54.310
the advantage of
being able to eke out

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:57.190
several additional percent of
total power from the array,

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:58.420
from the system.

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.550
The disadvantage of distributing
these microinverter components

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.587
over every single module is?

00:48:03.587 --> 00:48:06.170
AUDIENCE: You have to make a lot
of them, and they cost money.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.850
PROFESSOR: You have
to make a lot of them.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:07.516
They cost money.

00:48:07.516 --> 00:48:11.160
They're costly, and-- mean
time between failures?

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:11.700
Increases.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.200
Right?

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:12.750
Potentially.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:13.940
Potentially.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.462
So if you have an
inverter-- how many people

00:48:16.462 --> 00:48:18.420
know how long an inverter
lasts before it needs

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.710
to be replaced, typically?

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:21.430
5 to 10 years.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:24.121
Now it's up to, say,
7 to 12, but yes.

00:48:24.121 --> 00:48:25.120
Somewhere in that range.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.052
Less than the 20- to 30-year
life span of your array.

00:48:28.052 --> 00:48:30.260
So now if you have these
distributed little inverters

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.664
across every solar
panel and they fizz out

00:48:33.664 --> 00:48:35.330
after a certain amount
of time, somebody

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:36.830
has to go up there
and replace them.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.750
First, identify where they went
down and then replace them.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.700
So microinverter longevity
is an important part

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.060
of reducing risk and
marketing inverters.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.490
So the microinverter community
is helping to push, or improve,

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.644
the quality of inverters over
the entire solar spectrum,

00:48:51.644 --> 00:48:52.560
which is kind of cool.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.060
Yeah.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.484
AUDIENCE: What's
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.645
PROFESSOR: So, my understanding
from Rajeev Ram, who

00:48:59.645 --> 00:49:02.380
is actually down in
ARPA-E right now--

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.290
he's a professor at MIT
who's been assisting

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.390
the DOE over the past
couple of years-- most

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:12.120
failure in inverters relates
to the power electronics itself

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.160
and the high speed
switchers that are used.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.700
That's my understanding.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.170
I could look into
that a little bit more

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:22.140
and get you more details about
precise inverter failure modes,

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.257
but that is my
rudimentary understanding

00:49:25.257 --> 00:49:26.340
from discussions with him.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:32.640
Sorry, my screen
is still cracked.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.255
It's going to be fixed tonight.

00:49:34.255 --> 00:49:36.005
Advantages of integrated
power electronics

00:49:36.005 --> 00:49:37.338
is maximum power point tracking.

00:49:37.338 --> 00:49:38.340
This advantage is-- OK.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:38.680
Yep.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.270
OK.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.830
And so it's still a
relatively hot topic.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:46.380
There was an ARPA-E call for
improved power electronics

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:50.140
across solar and
other industries.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.514
And there is some discussion
in the PV community

00:49:52.514 --> 00:49:54.805
as to how much to adopt this
new technology, especially

00:49:54.805 --> 00:49:56.910
in residential systems.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:00.540
So trends in
installations in general.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:06.750
In the past, installations
were heavily labor-intensive.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.070
There is now a large
amount of pre-assembly

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.190
done before the
modules hit the roof,

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:14.850
but there's still
a sizable number

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:18.440
of components that go into
every single solar module.

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.220
And that takes time, to
mount everything out there

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.340
in the field.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.530
So what are some other--
what is the dream

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.450
of any solar installer?

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:31.077
Is to get this roll of
material just unrolls, unfurls,

00:50:31.077 --> 00:50:33.660
onto the roof and using a staple
gun-- bang, bang, bang, bang,

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.180
bang-- or a nail gun.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.780
Everything is locked down.

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:37.720
It's lightweight.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:43.435
It doesn't underperform
when it gets too warm.

00:50:43.435 --> 00:50:45.560
These are all the specs
that would constitute, say,

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.390
an ideal solar module.

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.900
We don't get that lucky.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.934
We have to make
compromises in reality.

00:50:51.934 --> 00:50:53.350
Say, for example,
on my roof there

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.986
was a soft spot on the roof
that had to be worked around.

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:57.860
The structural engineer
had to be called back

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.230
and evaluate and figure out
whether or not it needed

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:01.510
reinforcements and so forth.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:05.180
So we're still far
away in terms of where

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.810
we need to be for
solar installations

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:10.510
to really be truly low cost.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:14.510
And a lot of it has to do with
the balance of system design.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.860
So I mentioned a few
companies are attempting

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:24.470
to integrate the connections
into this facile click-lock

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.730
mechanism.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:28.480
There have been patents filed, I
think, since the 1990s on this.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.140
Probably even earlier.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.855
More recently, some
companies have marketed

00:51:32.855 --> 00:51:34.770
a product in this regard.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:38.930
And of course, that increases
the facility of installation.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.660
There's even a few
that are selling,

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.380
I think, it was Akeena at
Lowe's and, for a time,

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.985
BP Solar was selling
at Home Depot.

00:51:44.985 --> 00:51:46.610
They're examples of
companies beginning

00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:49.390
to market their product
at hardware stores.

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.890
Question.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.390
AUDIENCE: Could you
define exactly what

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:52.590
you mean by balance of systems?

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:53.215
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:51:53.215 --> 00:51:56.640
So balance of systems
is defined as everything

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.300
beyond the module.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.620
So that would include
the wiring, the framing,

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.860
the racking, the inverter.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.490
Yes.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.320
That is balance of systems.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.900
Excellent question.

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.180
Excellent question.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.540
So we're going to talk
about some of the tests

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.170
that the PV module
must pass to ensure

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.560
reliable multi-decade
service life in the field

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.640
and some of the
shortcomings of the tests.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.550
I'm going to motivate
this by saying

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:26.300
there's reason to be
concerned, in the early days

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.800
of the industry, about
performance and reliability.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.180
This was a study done
by Arne Jacobson.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:33.290
The group that's working
with the World Bank

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:36.740
will be as well working with
Arne Jacobson on the class

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:37.560
project.

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.160
He's a professor at Humboldt
University in California.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.950
During his PhD with
Dan Kammen in Berkeley,

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:47.180
he did an audit of rated
versus actual power

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.020
outputs of solar modules in
the field of Kenya in Africa

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:53.390
and found a rather
large discrepancy

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:56.540
between what was promised and
what was actually delivered.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:00.560
This is a great example
of field work being

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.620
done-- good old-fashioned
detective work-- that leads

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:05.570
to changes in the industry.

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.700
That got a number of
the under-performers

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.360
to improve their product.

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.470
So I mentioned there's a
question of the customer.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:17.380
Am I getting the real value
that I've been promised?

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.659
Especially in the absence
of independent monitoring.

00:53:19.659 --> 00:53:21.700
If you're not actively
measuring the power output

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.160
and recording it, there's
always that question lingering.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.950
So module testing
and reliability

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:29.880
is meant to ensure product
quality and output quality.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.885
Secondly, it's safety.

00:53:30.885 --> 00:53:33.010
I mentioned that these
thermographic cameras-- this

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:35.575
is an example in an
array, of a hot spot.

00:53:35.575 --> 00:53:36.810
It's not too hot right now.

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.180
It's 36 degrees or so,
but everything else

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.690
is down around 15.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:43.940
If you imagine this being
on a sunny day-- a really

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.190
sunny day-- this
hot spot potentially

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:48.470
could be getting up much higher.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:49.900
So that's obviously of concern.

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.010
And there's as well
hot spots or heat

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:58.240
that can be generated from
the junction box on the back.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.680
This contains a fair amount
of electronics, again.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:04.570
And if there is some failure of
the electronics inside of here,

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.640
you can have the combined power
output of the entire module

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.300
arcing through a given
component back here causing

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.810
sparks to fly.

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:16.400
And this is where this Photon
International article from 2009

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:21.085
comes in where they say
it's extremely important--

00:54:21.085 --> 00:54:22.460
the upshot of the
entire article,

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.190
I gave it to you
in its entirety.

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:28.860
But the upshot is let's
not play with fire,

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.030
meaning let's make
sure that the safety

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.040
standards of solar modules
are really up to spec

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.730
so that the risk of something
catastrophically bad happening

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.910
is negligible.

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:42.610
Because there's nothing
worse for a nascent industry

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:45.565
than to have some,
dare I say it,

00:54:45.565 --> 00:54:49.640
Fukushima equivalent occur on
some very high-profile event

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.290
that causes public opinion
to sway against it.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.640
So making sure that
modules are safe

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.730
is of utmost importance
to preserving

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:59.480
the positive image of solar.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.190
And that's what this article
here is meant to convey,

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:04.070
and you're welcome
to read it in detail.

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:06.950
It cites one particular example
where that didn't happen

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:13.520
and it did lead to it a little
PR event-- well-justified,

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.240
in fact.

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.570
Shown here are a series
of tests that one

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:21.820
can conduct with solar modules.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:28.460
I showed a list of different IEC
tests, standardized protocols.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:33.490
These are a series of tests,
typically between 12 and 20,

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:37.250
that represent a battery of
tests for the solar module.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:40.530
And if they pass it,
they are IEC certified.

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.800
And you'll see on the back
of certain spec sheets,

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.760
like this one from
First Solar right here,

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.770
the different testing agencies
that have certified the module,

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:52.220
these little logos represented.

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.460
So it says it's UL
certified, CE mark,

00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:00.000
certified according
to IEC spec 61646.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.250
That's the one right up there
at the top and so forth.

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:05.730
So certification
is very important.

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.720
What happens during testing?

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.580
Well, we'll see it because when
I designed the Fraunhofer CSE

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:14.490
labs, we designed it, Roland
Schindler and I, with the IEC

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:15.480
tests in mind.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.280
So each of the
pieces of equipment

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.400
out there are to test one
component of the IEC test.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.860
Included in the test is
environmental cycling,

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.780
where you take a
module, stick it inside

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.027
of what looks like an oven.

00:56:28.027 --> 00:56:29.985
And it heats it up, cools
it down, heats it up,

00:56:29.985 --> 00:56:31.860
cools it down or maintains
a high temperature

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:32.907
with high humidity.

00:56:32.907 --> 00:56:35.490
Different types of environmental
chambers do different things,

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:39.540
but they're meant to simulate
an accelerated aging process.

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.840
Again, since most
diffusion processes

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.030
are driven by
Boltzmann statistics,

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:48.020
there's an exponential increase
with increasing temperature.

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:51.790
And hence, we can simulate
accelerated degradation

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:53.290
at higher temperatures.

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:54.860
So it's not uncommon
that you hear

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.860
about 85/85 tests,
which mean 85 degrees

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:01.250
Celsius at 85% humidity.

00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:03.020
So that is a massive jungle.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:06.110
We don't have, thankfully,
places on earth like that.

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:09.080
The maximum temperatures
are at around 45, 50,

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.520
55 degrees C typically and,
in those cases, very dry.

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.440
But in here, 85
degrees Celsius--

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.700
it's still below the
boiling point of water.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:19.310
Very high humidity
and the humidity,

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:21.810
if there is any place for the
humidity go inside the module,

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:24.510
if you have any failure of
your encapsulant material

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:26.300
or it can get inside, it will.

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.100
And it will begin
degrading your module.

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.680
You'll see the power
output decrease.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:33.490
And after three months subjected
to that sort of torture,

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:36.170
if the module is poorly
designed, oftentimes

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.670
it will fail.

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:39.590
Now, some of the
shortcomings of these

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:44.460
tests-- that
humidity cycle isn't

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:48.900
necessarily, with the module,
experiencing an applied bias

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.580
voltage.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.590
So if there's any
electromigration affect,

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:53.370
you might not
detect it with that.

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:55.350
So there are people
designing new forms

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:58.312
of tests that will
probe other failure

00:57:58.312 --> 00:58:00.020
modes, other degradation
mechanisms, that

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.978
aren't necessarily captured
in these IEC tests.

00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:02.940
Do you have a question?

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:03.440
No.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:03.950
No question.

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:04.100
OK.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:04.255
Yeah.

00:58:04.255 --> 00:58:04.755
Over here.

00:58:04.755 --> 00:58:07.667
AUDIENCE: What is the failure
mode of degradation by water?

00:58:07.667 --> 00:58:08.500
PROFESSOR: By water?

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.000
Yes.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.350
So water, humidity--
typically what happens

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:14.860
is, in the laminate
itself, there

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.617
will be some part at the
edge that water can get in.

00:58:18.617 --> 00:58:20.450
Not always, but in the
poorly designed ones,

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:22.680
yes, and so the water
can get in and begin

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.170
diffusing into the module.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:28.270
So if you have a thin
film material that

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:31.130
reacts with water, you might
degrade the actual absorber

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:32.080
layer itself.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.160
If you have a silicon
device, the water

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.740
could react with
the metal and cause

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:39.870
it to corrode-- cause it
to oxidize, in other words.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:44.340
And of course, in reacting
with the ethyl vinyl acetate,

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.730
it can cause the encapsulant
to delaminate from the cells

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:48.890
and tear apart.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.822
And so you see this
discoloration of the module.

00:58:51.822 --> 00:58:53.280
Those are some of
the failure modes

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.830
that can occur when water
gets in through the side.

00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:59.200
If it managed to
permeate the encapsulant

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.480
materials themselves,
those sorts of effects

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:05.235
can occur directly as opposed
to coming in through the sides.

00:59:05.235 --> 00:59:06.160
Another question.

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.450
AUDIENCE: So they presumably
test some small fraction

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:10.085
of the modules.

00:59:10.085 --> 00:59:10.710
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:16.155
AUDIENCE: That they [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:16.155 --> 00:59:16.780
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.300
So they presumably test some
small fraction of the modules.

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.120
And then, if those
modules pass the test,

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.290
which take several
months to conduct--

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:27.080
and that's why there's a large
barrier for module innovation--

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.880
but if they pass
those tests, then they

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.900
assume that every module-- yes.

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:35.380
So there are a series
of, I would say,

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.790
definitions of what
constitutes a major alteration

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:39.040
to the process.

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.240
So if you majorly
alter your process,

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.390
then you have to get
your module recertified.

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.500
But if you stay
within those bounds,

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:50.860
then you can continue selling
under the old certification.

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.280
It's not too
dissimilar to the way

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.170
our food is tested by the FDA.

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:57.080
It's not every single hamburger.

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.490
It's a spot test.

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:03.414
In this particular case, these
are examples of the newest

01:00:03.414 --> 01:00:04.830
technologies to
come off the line,

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.586
and you get a couple
of chances to pass.

01:00:06.586 --> 01:00:08.960
If you fail the first one,
it's not the end of the world.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.490
It just means that you
have to pass the next time

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:14.160
or else you have a
stain on your record.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.190
And many of the companies
now have their own facilities

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:18.569
to do these tests in-house.

01:00:18.569 --> 01:00:20.610
They still send them out
to the certified testing

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:23.670
bodies that are independent to
get the final seal of approval.

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:26.540
But they know fairly well
before they send them out,

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.940
are we going to pass or not?

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.498
In the early days
it was-- you always

01:00:29.498 --> 01:00:31.164
had to hold on to the
seat of your pants

01:00:31.164 --> 01:00:32.060
because you never
quite knew what

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.680
was going to happen when
the test results came back.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:39.020
But now it's much better,
much more predictable.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.530
And my favorite test out
of all the ones in there--

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:45.310
there are a number, if you
imagine a dozen to 20 tests,

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:48.670
from illuminating it and
measuring the power output.

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:51.790
One of my favorite tests
involves a hail gun.

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:56.290
So in a similar manner to
how the FAA tests windshields

01:00:56.290 --> 01:01:00.530
of planes and plane engines
by shooting frozen chickens

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.960
or turkeys at them, in
this particular case,

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.050
we're shooting frozen balls
of water at the modules

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.580
and seeing if they crack.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.920
That's one of the ones.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.120
You can envision, as
well, an immersion test

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.850
underwater combined with
bending to see if there's

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.320
any failure in the module.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.210
So they are tested
quite extensively using

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.900
these protocols.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.310
And the objective is to
ensure quality and safety

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:24.990
to the consumer.

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:26.667
AUDIENCE: What's
the top right test?

01:01:26.667 --> 01:01:27.750
PROFESSOR: This top right?

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.749
Oh, top right over here?

01:01:28.749 --> 01:01:32.310
This is a mechanical loading
test, what it appears to be,

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:37.452
where you just exert
what is typically--

01:01:37.452 --> 01:01:39.660
that's what it appears to
be in this particular case.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.368
I could be wrong.

01:01:40.368 --> 01:01:43.770
But my understanding is that
this module is constrained

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.400
on the edges right now and
that there's a load being

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.080
pushed down in the center.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.670
You could also envision
a sandbag test where

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:53.780
you load physical sandbags.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.450
There are a variety of
different types and variants.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.750
Yep.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:02.250
OK.

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.950
So that comes from the
First Solar spec sheet.

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:08.890
Describe the differences between
various types of PV systems.

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.890
Since we're running
short on time,

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:13.880
this is a bit of
a repeat from what

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.920
we talked about the very
first day in class--

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:18.800
the non-tracking, the tracking.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.110
So I'm going to fly through that
into grid-tied and stand-alone.

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:24.841
So grid-tied and
stand-alone systems

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:25.840
is very straightforward.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.940
If you have a system
that is tied to the grid,

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.245
somehow it has to be able
to interface with the grid.

01:02:30.245 --> 01:02:33.510
Let me go to that in a second.

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:34.205
Here.

01:02:34.205 --> 01:02:35.830
So if you're having
a grid-tied system,

01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:39.330
that means that your house
or solar array, whatever

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:41.299
it is that's producing
the electricity,

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.340
has to be tied to the grid
and interface with it.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:47.100
Since the electricity
is alternating current,

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.990
there has to be a
device to convert

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:51.540
the direct current power
into alternating current.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.020
And that's called the inverter.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.980
We've already touched upon that
a few times over today's class.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.960
And these objects range in size.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.460
For the ones in the
house, you could

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.960
find inverters that
are about yea big that

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.557
can handle a few kilowatts.

01:03:04.557 --> 01:03:06.640
The ones that are handling
these large solar field

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.295
installations, or
segments thereof--

01:03:09.295 --> 01:03:11.170
let me find a large
solar field installation.

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:11.714
Here we go.

01:03:11.714 --> 01:03:14.130
Here are some pictures of large
solar field installations.

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:15.264
This is a road.

01:03:15.264 --> 01:03:16.680
These little green
dots are trees.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.620
That's a big field
installation right there.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:24.810
Those inverters are
warehouse-- can be much larger

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:30.270
sized than the smaller ones
that you'd find in your house.

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:33.520
And so, listing the major
balance of system components,

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:38.085
the PV array would be connected
to the grid by an inverter.

01:03:38.085 --> 01:03:40.210
The excess power would be
sent to the grid, causing

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:41.660
the meters to spin
backward, which

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.180
is a very gratifying
observation from a homeowner's

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.981
point of view or, at the
very least, a rate payer,

01:03:47.981 --> 01:03:49.230
utility payer's point of view.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.450
The act of sending the
power back to the grid

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:59.170
is a bit of free riding because
I'm not paying for the grid.

01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:01.654
I'm a consumer, but I'm getting
credit for the electricity

01:04:01.654 --> 01:04:02.820
that I put back in the grid.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:05.485
But I'm not helping to
maintain the grid, necessarily.

01:04:05.485 --> 01:04:07.610
I'm paying some transmission
and distribution costs

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:11.610
on my utility bill, but that's
essentially the same cost

01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:13.700
that everyone else is paying.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.920
Utility companies have begun
getting wise about that

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.180
and have begun
leveraging surcharges

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.270
based on the input
of solar electricity

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:21.665
into the grid, which I now pay.

01:04:21.665 --> 01:04:22.990
So I'm no longer a free rider.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.740
I was for a little bit.

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.240
So, mounted onto the
roof or the ground.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.800
If you mount the
solar panels, you

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.380
need racking and
framing materials.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.920
That's also balance of systems.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.440
OK.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.570
So.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.070
Check.

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:37.280
Check.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:37.780
Check.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.430
Check.

01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:42.340
You typically have, as
well, a circuit breaker,

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:46.120
or just a very simple lever
that disconnects the solar panel

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.200
from the grid.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.360
Why is that important?

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:53.270
The utility companies know
that, on my house in Cambridge,

01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:55.695
there's a solar array
and that that array

01:04:55.695 --> 01:04:57.130
is connected to the grid.

01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:59.700
Let's imagine a tree
falls on the power lines

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.850
during the next storm,
and the utility crew

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:04.190
has to go out there to
repair it during the day.

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:06.780
They know that, although the
rest of the grid is down,

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.770
there's that one little power
center on my house that's

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.117
injecting power into the grid.

01:05:11.117 --> 01:05:12.700
And so they'll come
along to my house,

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.641
disconnect the solar
panels from the grid.

01:05:14.641 --> 01:05:16.890
They'll go to my neighbors,
disconnect theirs as well.

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:18.848
Go to the person across
the street who also has

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.210
solar panels, disconnect them.

01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:23.880
Then go to work on
the utility line.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.540
So that's why the
external circuit

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.490
breaker is very important.

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:31.650
Back to inverters.

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:34.090
Modern efficiencies of
the inverter component

01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:37.970
range between 94%
and 97% typical.

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:42.770
Record inverter efficiencies up
to 99% have been demonstrated.

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:45.590
And they all have what's
called maximum power point

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:49.800
tracking, which means that
they will be able to sense what

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.900
the combined output is
of the array on your roof

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.950
and adjust the
resistance in the circuit

01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:59.070
to match the
maximum power point.

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:02.070
And that way you're producing
the maximum amount of power

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:05.150
that you could be, potentially,
under any given illumination

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:06.050
condition.

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:08.480
So a lot of fancy electronics
goes into the inverter.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:13.360
I really have to give them a
lot of respect in that regard.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.900
Typically five to seven, maybe
even 10-year manufacturer

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:16.400
warranty.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.800
And the mounting
methods-- we talked

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.150
about mounting and racking.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:27.230
This type was fairly common
in the early days of solar

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.730
where you'd have these field
installations, especially built

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:31.780
on hills in California.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.370
I would say most common now is
really just mounting directly

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:36.450
on a roof-- oftentimes, flat.

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.900
For large field installations,
one-axis trackers

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.490
are very common nowadays.

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:42.610
Tracking as a function
of time of day

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:45.280
and then manually
adjusting the entire array

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.680
for season, if need be.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.060
So the grid-tied systems
causing meters to spin backward.

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.020
Again, very gratifying.

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:55.970
And this is an example
of my utility bill, where

01:06:55.970 --> 01:07:00.300
you have a balance
of $163 negative,

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.170
so they're giving me credit
over the course of a year.

01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:07.010
In the winter time-- this was an
example of a month in December

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:09.930
when a lot of snow
happened and the panels

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.280
were covered for quite a
while, or at least partially

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.480
shaded by the snow for a while.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.590
And we drew power from the
grid on net that month.

01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:22.920
But on all the other months
we, on net, produced power.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.590
And negative numbers aren't
shown in the scale here.

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.410
But if they were shown,
you'd see probably

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:30.830
greater negative value
in the summertime when

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:34.470
others were producing a lot of
power in the summer-- more sun.

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:37.250
And at the end of the year,
they draw a line at the bottom.

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:38.920
And they say, did
you owe us money?

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.420
No?

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:40.580
All right, great.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.900
If we owed you
money-- tough luck.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.670
If we're zero, then
everybody's happy.

01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:48.710
So we typically produce
more electricity

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:50.640
than we consume in our house.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.970
And that's an example of what
happens on a practical level.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.245
Off-grid grid PV systems,
just ever so briefly.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.224
So let's imagine that you're
running some illicit business,

01:08:04.224 --> 01:08:05.390
and you want to be off-grid.

01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:10.480
Or let's imagine that-- instead,
a more realistic example,

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.870
let's say that you're
afraid of the next power

01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:17.490
outage, of being out of power
for the next 7 to 10 days

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:20.180
after the storm passes
through your house.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.790
And you want to isolate yourself
from the grid, if need be.

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.689
You would want to have
a charge controller that

01:08:27.689 --> 01:08:31.600
would be able to distribute
the power to the DC loads,

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.970
or to batteries to store
them, and then the inverter,

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:37.939
going through the AC loads
or to the grid thereafter.

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:41.870
So it is possible to architect a
system that is semi-autonomous.

01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:46.350
But it does require more
components and more cost.

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:49.010
And I just wanted to emphasize
one thing as we close up.

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:51.310
Life is really good as
an installer right now.

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:53.899
If we flashed back to
four or five years ago,

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:57.560
life would have been really
good as a solar panel producer,

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.250
especially if you were involved
in the feedstock industry.

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:02.450
But now the prices
of modules have

01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:06.979
been severely squeezed
by low-cost competition

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:08.359
from overseas.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:13.729
And the pricing of modules is
around $1.03 per watt peak.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:17.700
This is some of
lowest price modules

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.340
that are out there right now.

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:22.359
And the price of installing
the system on your roof here

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:24.790
in the US is around $5.20.

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:27.260
Who's pocketing the $4.20?

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.080
Who gets to keep that money?

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.990
Is it the installer or
the module producer?

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:33.120
AUDIENCE: The installer.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.529
PROFESSOR: It's got
to be the installer.

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:35.080
Right?

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.359
And who's suffering right
now in the industry?

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:41.090
No matter where you
are-- US, China, Germany.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:43.210
Who's suffering right now?

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:44.350
The module producers.

01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:46.890
The people manufacturing
this stuff right here.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:47.870
All right.

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:50.689
Which brings me to my
current topic of the day.

01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:52.740
Everybody picked up
this one right here,

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.890
this Greentech Media article?

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:56.190
This is really current.

01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:58.200
November 8, that
was two days ago.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:58.700
Eric Wesoff.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.430
He's higher up there
in Greentech Media.

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:05.270
And he's writing about
the China-US trade

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:10.720
war that's evolving pitting--
within the US-- pitting

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.890
the module manufacturers
against the installers.

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:18.140
So the installers,
these guys who

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:20.060
are pocketing a lot
of money right now,

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:21.830
are saying no, no, no, no.

01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:23.250
Let the Chinese modules come in.

01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:24.270
It's great.

01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:26.076
It keeps our costs low.

01:10:26.076 --> 01:10:28.700
The folks who are manufacturing
the modules, on the other hand,

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.560
are saying, well, wait a second.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.414
They got unfair treatment
by their government.

01:10:33.414 --> 01:10:35.330
And the Chinese module
manufacturers, in turn,

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:37.660
are saying, well, it's not only
us who are getting subsidies

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:38.100
from the government.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.891
Look at yourselves.

01:10:38.891 --> 01:10:39.850
You got subsidies, too.

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:41.430
And US manufacturers
say, well, you

01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:43.480
got more subsidies than we did.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.859
So it's evolving into a little
bit of a complex situation.

01:10:47.859 --> 01:10:50.150
There are some people trying
to cut through all of that

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:55.030
and say, with very simplistic
messages, free trade.

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:58.100
Or certain other people saying,
made in USA is important.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.220
Or other people
saying, this isn't

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.375
fair for one reason or another.

01:11:02.375 --> 01:11:04.000
But it's important
to really understand

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.780
the complexity of what's
going on in the context

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.100
of a dynamically
changing market.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:12.120
The market is
changing quite a lot.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.820
In the past, the module prices--
and I say past, recent past,

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:19.060
as in a year ago-- module
prices were upwards of $2.50,

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.130
$3.00 per watt peak.

01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:23.940
It's only in the oversupply
condition created within

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.910
the last year and a half where
the module prices have dropped

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.850
precipitously down to $1.00.

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:32.080
And that happens when you're
in an oversupply condition,

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.100
whereas these
installation prices really

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.337
haven't budged too much.

01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:40.920
They're enjoying the fact that
it's in an oversupply condition

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.260
and there's still a
market for the modules.

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.920
So it's complex.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:49.970
We'll explore some
of the complex issues

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:53.630
in our next few classes, and
we'll dive into that in detail.

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:56.730
I'll leave, for you to study on
your own, life cycle analysis.

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.480
It's very important.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.330
Life cycle analysis--
in a nutshell,

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:04.060
it really depends on what you
consider in your analysis,

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.770
where you draw the box.

01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:09.540
And at the end of the
day, module recycling

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.750
is going to be important
as well for determining

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:17.220
the ultimate impact, both in
terms of CO2 impact, energy

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:20.647
payback, and environmental
impact of PV in the long run.

01:12:20.647 --> 01:12:22.230
So I'll leave you
with those thoughts.

01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:25.330
And we'll see us on Tuesday.

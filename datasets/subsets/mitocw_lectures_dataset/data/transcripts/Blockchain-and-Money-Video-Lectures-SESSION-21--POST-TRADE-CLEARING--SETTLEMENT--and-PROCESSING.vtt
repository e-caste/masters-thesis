00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.790
GARY GENSLER:
Today's a little bit

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.010
of a discussion about clearing
and settlement systems.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.720
Maybe you feel you've
heard everything

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.270
you needed from Jeff
Sprecher when he was asked

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.340
a question when he was with us.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.180
Jeff runs some of
the largest clearing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.860
houses in the world at
Intercontinental Exchange

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.660
not only because he started
in the energy business,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.650
but he has big credit default
swap clearing houses and energy

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.630
clearing houses and the like.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.740
And he said, well, I don't know
about blockchain technology

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.910
for clearing and settling.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.180
But I'm going to try this
Bitcoin project that you all

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.800
know about and he talked about.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.277
But today we're going
to try to dig into,

00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:08.360
well, maybe there's something
there, because there

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.010
are projects going on.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.380
And why are there projects?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.580
They're mostly permissioned
and not permissionless systems.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.160
But I think there's
something there.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.560
This will be one of
the more optimistic--

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.120
if you're judging how often
I get to the maximal side,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.540
I think there is probably
something there, at least

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.420
for permissioned blockchain
projects in the clearing

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.940
and settling.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.270
I'm going to-- we'll, of
course, go through the readings.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.060
And these are the sort of
topics we'll go through.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.010
Clearing and settling services--

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.330
I'm going to try to set this
stage as to what this is.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.210
Frankly, when I was on
Wall Street for 18 years,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
I couldn't really define
what clearing and settling.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.960
Sorry, Ross.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.950
You thought I could define
it when I was on Wall Street?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.790
What's that?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.570
AUDIENCE: I just strictly know
someone else can't either.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.362
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:00.872
Yeah.

00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:03.080
Well, when you're in the
merger and acquisition area,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.910
you usually don't
think about what

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.657
it means to clear
something and to settle it.

00:02:07.657 --> 00:02:09.199
And frankly, even
usually when you're

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.110
on the trading floor, that's
something somebody else

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.840
takes care of.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.580
Just the nature of--

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.470
how many people have worked
on trading floors here?

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.970
All right.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.850
So I'm going to have seven
or eight of you start.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.310
And you're on notice now.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.490
In about eight to 10 minutes,
you're going to help.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.147
You might prove what I just said
to Ross, that you can't define

00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:36.480
what clearing and settling
is because somebody else took

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.100
care of it.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.400
But we'll see.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.140
We'll see.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.450
And then we'll talk about
blockchain technology

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.060
applicability, some of the
projects that are going on,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.330
and then move over to this.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.135
There was a reading from
the International Swaps

00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:54.600
and Derivatives
Association, ISDA,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.090
what they're doing around
smart contracts in this space.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.613
But what I want to do
first is a little bit

00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:04.530
of talking about final
projects, because we're

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.120
at that time of the year.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.420
And this is to help.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.990
Then I'm going to go through
eight or nine questions.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.280
If you haven't already
thought through your projects,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.690
these are eight
or nine questions

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.740
that I would think you'd
want to think about,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.810
which is another way of
saying it will probably

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.260
enhance your performance.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.530
What else can I say?

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.260
And number one-- and it's
a little, small print.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.890
I'm sorry.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.110
Or no, it's not too bad--

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.340
is what's the value creation
proposition, or pain point,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.100
if you wish.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.070
So are you creating value?

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.428
Are you solving a pain point?

00:03:45.428 --> 00:03:47.220
Or as Jeff Sprecher
would say, what are you

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.880
doing that's going to make
something cheaper, faster,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.610
better?

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.470
What's the value proposition?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.880
Whatever space.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.320
There's two or three groups
that are doing trade finance.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.220
There's one or two
doing payments.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.990
There's some group
doing commercial--

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.470
I mean, consumer credit
rating or so forth.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.942
There's a wide variety.

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:14.400
There's one or two
groups that have

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.209
come to see me that are doing
things outside of finance.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.660
But regardless, what's
the value proposition?

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.170
What pain points
are you addressing?

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.900
Or as Jeff would say,
what are you going

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.000
to do better, faster, cheaper?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.960
If you can't answer
that threshold question,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.820
shake it loose.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.350
Kick it around.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.270
Or move on to a different
use case, frankly.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.950
Secondly, [INAUDIBLE]
you get into,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.170
like, what is this
blockchain technology?

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.610
What transactions or data
is going to be recorded?

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.650
Because this is
fundamentally, ultimately,

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.130
a database technology, even
the permissionless systems.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.210
And you'll see a later
question is why this versus

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.860
traditional database system?

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.810
But what transactions,
what data--

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.880
whether it's health
care records,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.260
whether it's consumer
credit data, supply chain,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.350
moving a piece of property
along a supply chain,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.230
but what is the actual data
and transactions that you're

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.550
recording?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.820
Questions?

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.510
What multiple stakeholders
need to write and read access

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.590
to the ledgers?

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.390
And I underline
the word multiple.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.080
Because really, when you think
about the value proposition

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.950
of blockchain technology,
it's about immutable records,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.180
or so-called immutable records.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.630
That's verifiable,
immutable records

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.090
amongst multiple parties.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.560
And it cost extra money.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.710
Everything we've been studying
about in this semester

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.330
is about there's
more complexity.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.290
There's more cost, in some
way, of this decentralized,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.300
even permissioned systems,
decentralized system.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.100
But you get something for it.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.100
You get some verification
of transactions, of data,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.070
of mutability.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.800
But you also have
to have some logic

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.420
that there's
multiple parties that

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.600
need to both write and read.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.390
A distributed database
that just does read only--

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.290
I can read my Bank of
America bank account.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.230
I can see what's in
that sort of ledger.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.180
It doesn't have to
be on a blockchain.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.720
So multiple parties writing,
why is that important?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.700
Forming consensus,
in this circumstance.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.610
Which specific cost of
verification or networking

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.510
are you lowering?

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.780
We talked about a lot of
the verification costs,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.350
whether it's privacy,
censorship resistance,

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.258
whether it's some direct cost.

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:50.800
Maybe you're going
right at something

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.590
that's got a bunch of
economic rents in it.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.750
So there was a series
of verification costs

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.460
we talked about.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.490
What networking costs
are you trying to reduce?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.430
There's probably been
something in the order

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.470
of 4,000 or 5,000 white
papers, many that you can find.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.062
You can't find all of them.

00:07:13.062 --> 00:07:14.770
But if you're going
at something that you

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.660
think a white paper
has been written about

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.240
or a blockchain company
has been started on,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.080
figure out what the
competition is doing.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.920
And for the two groups,
and it may be more,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.620
that are doing something around
trade, finance, and supply

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.730
chain, you know there's a
bunch of stuff you can read.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.260
We'll be studying
it next Tuesday.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.973
Alin?

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:35.390
AUDIENCE: Can you give us an
example of a networking cost?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.670
I'm not sure what that is.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.690
GARY GENSLER: So
networking cost is often

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.170
why people are using
a native token.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:50.730
But networking costs are
how to jumpstart a network.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.270
Uber jumpstarted a
network, in a sense,

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.850
without blockchain technology.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.750
But an example of
networking costs

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.200
are if you walked
out of the airport

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.790
and you didn't think any drivers
are using this application,

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.480
then you wouldn't be terribly
interested in using it.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.720
So--

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.860
AUDIENCE: But who
incurs the cost?

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.760
GARY GENSLER: Often the cost
of building a network can

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.860
be a tremendous startup cost.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.052
So how to start a
network often is

00:08:22.052 --> 00:08:23.760
you go to a bunch of
venture capitalists.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.010
You raise money.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.600
You advertise.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.430
And you try to get participants.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.900
And one of the challenges
of health care records--

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.990
we don't have our health
care experts in here today.

00:08:39.825 --> 00:08:40.700
I was looking around.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.240
We have two students from
Harvard's public policy

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.170
school doing graduate work
and sometimes join us.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.460
But health care
records, for instance,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.650
there's some really interesting
blockchain technology

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.070
solutions.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.920
But the networking
challenge is how do you

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.500
get a bunch of medical
providers, hospitals, doctors,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.350
and users to actually
join the network.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.230
So that would be an
example of network cost

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.395
is basically adoption often.

00:09:11.395 --> 00:09:12.020
Does that help?

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.645
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.730
GARY GENSLER: What are
the competitors doing?

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.380
I'm not looking for plagiarism.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.580
But if you're in a space,
payments or supply chain

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.130
or consumer credit
or some others,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.010
where there's three or six
or 10 white papers out there

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.680
and maybe somebody has
even raised 20 million

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.050
or a couple million in an ICO,
then it would be interesting.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.730
You should feel free
to look at those.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.470
And maybe you'll
be informed by it.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.220
And you'll say, yeah,
I'm doing it better.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.550
Or they've got it poorly here.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.070
Or their project's in Estonia.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.730
And I'm going to do a
digital ID project in the US.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.240
And our regulatory system
is different than Estonia.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.060
But I wouldn't be bashful about
looking at the competition.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.400
In fact, I would say that's--

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400
we're a business school.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.130
You always look at
the competition.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.040
And you see if you can do
either what they're doing better

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.140
or what they're doing
in a different geography

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.500
or in a little bit
different market.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.750
Back to how Alin likes
to define things,

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.660
I've not used the term
blockchain technology yet

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.120
on this slide, have I?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.940
But why are append-only logs
at multiple party consensus

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.780
the best solution?

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.730
Which kind of goes
back to why not just

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.960
a traditional database.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.390
But why append-only,
timestamped, verifiable logs?

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.420
They're connected by
cryptographic hash functions.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.790
But why have these logs?

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.770
And why have multiple
parties in essence

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:46.665
form a consensus about
the state of the ledger?

00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:47.307
Alin?

00:10:47.307 --> 00:10:47.890
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.590
I have a question about the
timestamped, apend-only logs.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.420
Is that only relevant
in blockchain,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.210
that traditional
databases do not

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.740
have these kinds of features,
timestamp and append-only logs?

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.740
GARY GENSLER: They
can have time--

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.690
timestamps in essence.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.130
In essence, it's innovation
of the early '90s.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.070
And then Satoshi
Nakamoto grabbed it.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.520
It was the concept that
you take a block of data

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.120
and you connect it to the next
block with a cryptographic hash

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.862
function.

00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:22.820
And once you've done
that, then it's committed.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.050
You can't amend
anything that's before

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.460
because it's a unique hash.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.880
And traditional databases did
not have similar commitment

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.380
schemes.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.360
They do have other
commitments schemes, but not

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.720
this commitment scheme of
taking a block of data,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.700
having the hash function,
which then means never shall

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.520
you amend what came before.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.960
That's how I understand it.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.295
Did you have a different view
on traditional databases?

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:54.670
AUDIENCE: Well,
I guess this gets

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.620
to the root of the question.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.510
Is there something new
about blockchain technology?

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.050
In my opinion, there
isn't, actually.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.140
20 years ago, we knew how to
make a traditional database

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.380
and make it full of power and
make it a census protocol,

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.497
or what people nowadays like to
call a permissioned blockchain.

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:13.580
So we knew how to do that.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.372
And that would give
you an append-only log.

00:12:15.372 --> 00:12:18.820
It's nothing exceptional.

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:22.600
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.800
So there are debates as to
where is the border and boundary

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.420
between a permissioned
blockchain

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.190
and a traditional database.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.210
But I've chosen to, at
least for this class,

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.890
a hyperledger fabric, we'll
call that a blockchain project.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.970
But recognize there are some
who would say, well, that's--

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.610
unless you have a native token,
it's not really blockchain.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.275
Eric.

00:12:49.275 --> 00:12:56.330
AUDIENCE: --one could call point
recent days that the trust is

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.760
the key attribute that's not
the factor in this equation,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.290
because you can get a multiple--

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.950
I mean, multiple party consensus
doesn't have value on its own.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.760
It's actually multiple
party consensus is--

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.140
it's actually something you had
to come up as a necessity that

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.150
stems from the fact
that you're dealing

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.960
with a decentralized arrangement
in which you're not trusting

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.940
any of the parties
that intervening

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.790
in the exchange of information.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.620
Right?

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.020
GARY GENSLER: Well, I
agree with the first half,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.130
that you wouldn't even
want to use Hyperledger

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.880
Fabric unless you really
need multiple parties writing

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.870
to the ledger.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.990
And I think that does
separate it a little bit.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.860
You could take an
Oracle database

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.340
and allow it to be
multiple parties, too.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.130
But I think that separates it.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.220
You might be more the
purist than I am, Eric.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.220
I don't think it has to
be completely open, where

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.710
you don't know all
the participants.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.600
But even in a
financial-- we'll talk

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.090
about the Australian
Stock Exchange

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.630
in a half an hour or so.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:17.230
And when we talk about that,
that's a limited closed loop.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.060
But they believe that
they are actually

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.083
taking a lot of cost out
of the verification side.

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:23.500
They think they're
getting a lot--

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.750
they're lowering
verification costs.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.150
And they would contend they're
lowering networking costs,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.490
because they don't have
the same reconciliations

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.550
between multiple databases.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.590
Now, you might call
that verification cost.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.630
But I think they would
call it both verification

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.140
and networking cost.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.390
There's multiple back offices
no longer reconciling.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.010
If your final project has
a permissionless system

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.160
with a native token, why
do you need a native token?

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.450
Is it to jumpstart the ICO that
you want to raise money for?

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.520
I'm not averse to that.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.000
But at least fess up
and say that's how

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.950
we're crowdsourcing this thing.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.250
If it's about that
you really believe

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.130
there's some benefit
to the token economics,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.660
that it's an incentive system
to run your new competition

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.230
to Uber or an incentive
system for health care records

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.470
or an incentive system
for supply chain,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.810
talk about what that
incentive system is.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.280
And are you trying to motivate
jumpstarting the network

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.210
or maintaining
the network later?

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.308
And it could be both.

00:15:35.308 --> 00:15:36.100
It could be either.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.770
I'm just saying it would be
good to have a discussion.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.350
Is the native token
just about crowdfunding?

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.930
Is the native token
also about jumpstarting

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.580
this network and
then an incentive

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.580
to maintain the network
amongst multiple parties?

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.780
What trade-offs of scalability,
performance, privacy, security,

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.620
coordination?

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.510
I'm not asking
you to solve that.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.600
And in fact, you can even jump
ahead three and five and seven

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.240
years and assume that
some of these things

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.980
will be taken care of.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:13.110
So recognize that in the
permissioned blockchains,

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.420
they seem to have a
higher performance, a lot

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.700
higher performance, than the
native token permissionless

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.630
systems.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.940
But if you're proposing a native
token permissionless system,

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.510
I'd just like a short
discussion of how much

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:32.460
these scalability issues matter
to you, particularly when

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.280
most of the native token
permissionless systems

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.920
can't handle much
more than 1,000

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.980
or a handful 1,000 of
transactions a day.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.740
It is true that Bitcoin handles
quite a bit more than that.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:49.200
But five or 10
transactions a second,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.720
is that going to work for
whatever your solution is?

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.980
In fact, I'd like to see some
groups use native tokens.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.010
I want to have a variety of
things I read in December

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.860
rather than reading
all permission systems.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.170
And then again, can a
permissioned blockchain

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.920
or traditional
database adequately

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.839
address whatever
use case if you do

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.030
have a permissionless system?

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:22.119
Thinking about that, how can
broad adoption be realized?

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.619
Are you going to use a native
token to equip broad adoption?

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.952
How are you going to get a
bunch of hospitals signed on?

00:17:26.952 --> 00:17:29.200
How are you going to get a
bunch of banks signed on?

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.908
You're going to do
like Jeff Sprecher did

00:17:30.908 --> 00:17:33.428
and give 50% of his equity away.

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.970
There was that
conversation he talked

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.280
about he had with Goldman
Sachs, that he realized

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.070
that was the only way to
get his business started

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.130
in the late 1990s.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:48.590
But just how are you going
to get that adoption?

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.260
And to the extent, this
might be a paragraph,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.410
but what type of customer
interface or how might it be

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.518
better than other customer UIs?

00:17:57.518 --> 00:17:59.060
So these are just
some of the things,

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.060
if you were thinking
about a real business.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.510
And I think that the
market is moving away

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.750
from that big,
frothy bull market,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.020
where there was as many as
400 or 500 ICOs a month.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.330
And it was raising anywhere
from 2 to 5 billion a month.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.200
October was about 200 ICOs.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.790
And it was about 800 million.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.220
And I think it's going
to continue to decline,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.165
partly because they
don't all work.

00:18:28.165 --> 00:18:29.540
But partly because
people are now

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.560
getting more rigorous as
to what's really going on.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.687
If you are using a
permissioned blockchain,

00:18:36.687 --> 00:18:38.270
you don't have to
tell me whether it's

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.388
Hyperledger or Corda.

00:18:39.388 --> 00:18:41.180
But if somebody does
and you have something

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.570
thoughtful to say there,
I'm intrigued to find out

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.300
why this one versus that one.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.180
It's really just to show
your critical analysis

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.810
of this subject.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.570
And if you want
to prove yourself

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.020
on why it's Corda versus
Hyperledger Fabric,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.880
that'll be interesting if
somebody has a point of view.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.440
But I'm not looking for that
level of either computer

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.620
science knowledge.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.360
This is from a
business perspective.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.170
Think of me as a
venture capitalist.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.820
If I was investing, how
you pull it together.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.270
So any questions on that?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.890
So we had six or
seven people that

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.440
actually worked in banking.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.792
Who did we have at this table?

00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:26.258
Ah.

00:19:26.258 --> 00:19:27.050
So what's clearing?

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.110
AUDIENCE: If I
recall correctly, you

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.230
need to prove the identity
of the other party

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.640
in order to make sure
that you're sending

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.640
the asset to the right--

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:40.920
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.580
So you have to
prove the identity.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.140
So it's about validating and
authenticating an identity.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.730
Anything else in clearing?

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.270
Who else worked in trading?

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.110
I had somebody back at
the back table worked in--

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.646
ah.

00:19:52.646 --> 00:19:55.830
AUDIENCE: Is it that they
have the assets to be traded?

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.840
GARY GENSLER: They have
the assets to be traded.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.770
Well, most equity markets
trade on transaction date

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.560
plus two days.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.720
So somewhere in
that two days, you

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.820
have to confirm
they have the asset.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.730
That is correct.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.000
You don't have to do
it on t plus zero,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.380
normally by t plus 1.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.240
AUDIENCE: I think--

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.990
I could be wrong.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.050
But I think you had to do
as well would be the stock

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.380
exchange knowing what is
the net exposure that you

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.380
have at the [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.240
GARY GENSLER: Net exposure.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.140
Net exposure.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.110
Very key thing.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.480
So there's authentication.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.130
At some point between
execution and transaction,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.100
you have to actually know
you have the security--

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.260
and then net exposure,
which we're going

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.850
to look at on another page.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.900
This simple chart of two
people cutting the lawns,

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.330
but a buyer and seller meet.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.500
But a buyer and seller
meet in an exchange

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.950
in traditional securities
markets through brokers.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.360
That's called an
inner mediated access.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.323
In the crypto exchange
markets, those two brokers

00:21:04.323 --> 00:21:06.240
on the left-hand side
and the right-hand side,

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.495
the sellers and buyers
brokers, don't exist.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.480
In the crypto exchange
markets, basically you

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.980
have direct access
to the market.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.710
But in the traditional
stock exchanges,

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.025
whether it's London,
Tokyo, New York, Beijing--

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.982
where's the exchange in India?

00:21:32.982 --> 00:21:34.370
AUDIENCE: Mumbai.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.720
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
it's at Mumbai now?

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.590
I forgot.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.460
30 years ago, I visited it
and walked on the floor.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.990
It was called the Bombay
Stock Exchange back then.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.440
But regardless of where
the stock exchange is,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.320
there's some clearing house
separate from the stock

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:54.490
exchange doing these functions
that we just talked about.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:22:00.240
So three steps-- execution.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.988
What's it mean to
execute a trade?

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:03.780
Alpha, do you know what
it means to execute

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.652
a trade without reading?

00:22:05.652 --> 00:22:06.360
Should I go back?

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:06.985
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.710
Because I've traded before.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:11.730
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.900
That's why I called on you.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.400
AUDIENCE: We did a great job
with a separate execution team.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.670
That helped us with that.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:21.990
But signing the docs,
making sure that the account

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.470
information is all there, if
it's been done through NSDA.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:25.470
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.740
So this sounds like it's
about derivatives, executing

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.730
a derivatives contract.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.610
But what if you're just buying
100 shares of Apple stock?

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.435
What's it mean to
execute a trade?

00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:38.310
AUDIENCE: To be on the
phone or on the screen

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.830
and agree on a price
and a quantity.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:40.955
GARY GENSLER: There you go.

00:22:40.955 --> 00:22:43.970
It's just you bid a price.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.440
And somebody hits the
bid or lifts the offer.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.480
Those are the terms when
you're on the phone.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.070
I left your offer.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.970
I hit your bid.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.640
Or at least it
was when I did it.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.420
Still?

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.360
Or no, maybe not.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.590
What's that?

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:01.220
Still.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.820
All right.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.320
Question?

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.248
AUDIENCE: Just not
on the phone anymore.

00:23:05.248 --> 00:23:06.212
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:06.212 --> 00:23:07.250
GARY GENSLER: Ah, yeah.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.560
That's it.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.260
What's that?

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.640
AUDIENCE: You just hit a button.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.450
GARY GENSLER: Just hit a button.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.658
AUDIENCE: I worked on the
[INAUDIBLE] desk at Goldman

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:15.190
So we didn't talk to anyone.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.175
GARY GENSLER: You
didn't talk to anybody?

00:23:17.175 --> 00:23:19.050
Can you go months without
talking to anybody?

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.570
AUDIENCE: No, we
talked a little.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.990
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.942
AUDIENCE: We talked
a little bit.

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:22.700
[? But it was always ?]
[? kinda ?] weird.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.050
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.600
I guess I'm a dinosaur.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.360
Yeah.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:27.860
Yeah.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.280
The screens that I used to
look at at Goldman Sachs,

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.120
it was green.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.800
You know.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.190
You know the screens.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.250
Kelly is thinking, what
is he talking about?

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:40.750
Right?

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.610
Look it up on the internet.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.370
[? You're ?] [? fine. ?]
[? You're ?] [? fine. ?] There

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.280
wasn't any color
on those screens.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.100
So execution is
basically I buy, you

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.070
sell, we agree upon a
price, a price and a volume.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.620
That's really what execution is.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.170
But when you execute, you still
need to do a few other things.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.892
And it's called
clearing and settling.

00:24:05.892 --> 00:24:07.600
When I was on a trading
floor, I couldn't

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.142
have told you what
the difference was

00:24:09.142 --> 00:24:10.520
between clearing and settling.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.070
That was something
somebody else did, frankly.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.770
I'll admit it.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.440
They were really
terrific professionals.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.460
But they had their job.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.110
I had a different job.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.380
Clearing is performing
all of these functions.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.810
Authenticating
somebody is there,

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.860
making sure you actually
have those securities,

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.680
and importantly this
thing called netting.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.780
How about settlement?

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:33.620
Anybody want to say?

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.828
I know it's written up there.

00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:36.680
But anybody want
to just say what--

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.390
we've talked about ledgers
for seven or 10 weeks now.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.730
What do you think a
settlement really means

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.190
in the context of a ledger?

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.290
Did I see a hand up here?

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.190
Yes, I did.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:51.240
I did see a hand up.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:51.990
What's settlement?

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.190
AUDIENCE: Running the
entries on the ledger.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.497
What's in, what's out.

00:24:54.497 --> 00:24:55.330
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.000
It's making a final
recording on a ledger,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.280
finally moving
something on a ledger.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.480
You could be moving the
ownership of an asset

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.940
or the ownership of cash.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.840
And when you do both
at the same time,

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.130
it's called delivery
versus payment, or DVP.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:21.490
It's just a final change
of data record on a ledger.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.630
In the old days--

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.010
I'm talking about
before I was doing it.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.970
But 40 years to
hundreds of years

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.240
ago, it was
physically delivering

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.840
a physical piece of paper which
was a equity security or a bond

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.100
security.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.850
But it all got dematerialized
starting in the 1970s.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.950
And by the 1990s,
it was pretty much--

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.260
in this country and the UK--

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:48.400
it was pretty much
dematerialized securities,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.960
that everything's digitized now
in the equity markets in nearly

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.290
every country that
you're all from and maybe

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.200
with some small exceptions.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.240
So execution is I buy,
you sell, volume price.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.760
We've legally agreed
to something verbally.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.810
And billions of dollars
can trade on the phone

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.330
or in the computer.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.650
Legally, it's executed.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.620
Clearing is trying to make
sure that you actually

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.780
have the securities, and
I actually have the cash.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.670
We do some netting.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.320
We authenticate.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.680
And settlement is actually
moving the data on the ledgers.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.020
Three steps.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.460
This is the benefit of netting.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.750
It was just one chart that
I could find somewhere.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.690
It's actually the
Australian Stock Exchange

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.540
had it on their website.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.430
But if you have multi-parties
in the transaction,

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.400
which was on the
left hand side--

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.460
and these are just arrows of
all the different transactions

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.850
that could occur in
one little example--

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:56.310
and instead you interpose
a central intermediary,

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.840
you can do a lot of netting.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.270
And look at participant
C. Participant C

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:05.890
only has an exposure of
selling 35 of whatever they're

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:10.930
selling, some stock, versus
all these other transactions.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.610
And this is a very simple case.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:20.940
But if you have 20 or a hundred
clearing members that are all

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.300
big brokerage houses and
they're doing thousands or even

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.550
hundreds of thousands
of trades a day,

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:32.690
you have an awful
lot of transactions.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.750
And the gross transactions
versus the net

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.560
is quite a difference.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.660
That netting can bring down
numbers 90 plus percent

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.410
or maybe even 99% or more.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.780
So central intermediaries--

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.060
I know this goes against Satoshi
Nakamoto's whole concept--

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:57.370
but central intermediaries came
about in the securities market

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:58.580
for a bunch of reasons.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.890
But one of the biggest
ones was netting.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.140
Brotish?

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.990
And it's a really
important concept

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.640
in the back office
of Wall Street.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.473
AUDIENCE: I'm not
familiar with the concept.

00:28:11.473 --> 00:28:12.370
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:13.540
GARY GENSLER: You're
saying you're familiar?

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.000
AUDIENCE: I'm not familiar
with this concept,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.460
so a clarification question.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.657
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:28:17.657 --> 00:28:19.240
AUDIENCE: When we
do netting, it seems

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.250
that we are losing
a lot of information

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.630
here from the
gross transactions.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.680
So is it--

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.100
GARY GENSLER: That's right.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.990
AUDIENCE: --just the
transfer of the asset

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.940
is done through the
netting, but the records

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.040
of all the gross
transactions are still there

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.450
with the central intermediaries?

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.825
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question.

00:28:32.825 --> 00:28:35.230
So are we losing information?

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:41.110
Or are we just lessening the
lines of counterparty risk

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.400
in the transactions?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.290
And the answer is,
if done properly,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.880
you still keep the
information of all of these.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.880
And in the real world, this
is just eight transactions.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.910
It's netted down to four.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:56.410
Right?

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.720
So this is eight transactions
netted down to four.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.110
Usually this is millions
of transactions netted down

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:06.420
to tens of thousands or maybe
millions of transactions

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.010
literally netted down to, if
there was 100 clearing members,

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.200
it would be 100
transactions, because they'd

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:21.750
each have one net transaction
per security, per security.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.000
And so you need to
keep the information

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.430
of the millions of
transactions to properly

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:29.880
record for your
customers, for your taxes,

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.210
for all sorts of other reasons.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.270
But you've netted down
for counterparty reasons.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.270
Does that help?

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.390
Question over here.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:40.890
Sean.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.145
AUDIENCE: I was just curious.

00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:45.220
It's very understandable
for equities.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.796
But for principal
commodities, [? the full ?]

00:29:47.796 --> 00:29:52.060
commodity derivatives, for
instance in the clearing space,

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.540
does it actually involve
the physical delivery

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:59.700
of the netted
commodity [INAUDIBLE]??

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.242
Because there's a different type
for delivery, and how that--

00:30:02.242 --> 00:30:02.950
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.590
So Sean's asked
the question, what

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.660
if you're not dealing
with digitized assets,

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.990
but physical assets?

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.490
I think.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:09.780
You used the word commodity.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.865
But I was presuming
you meant physical.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.370
So some of the innovations
of the 19th century

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.740
relate here when
they started to have

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.770
standardized contracts
for commodities

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.610
that were held in warehouses.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:31.550
In essence, to facilitate
some of this netting

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:34.730
was also why central
warehouses, this clearing

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.890
house in the middle in
physical commodities,

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.310
could be a warehouse that held
the gold, held the silver,

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.830
held the corn or wheat.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.560
And if they're holding
that corn or wheat,

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.230
they started to have
specifications as to what

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.390
standards there were.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.850
In gold and silver,
it was percent.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:59.065
It was called the,
let's see, assay--

00:30:59.065 --> 00:31:00.440
I'm trying to
remember the word--

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.100
but what percent
gold or silver it is.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.070
But in corn and wheat,
there was a more detailed

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:12.680
what's going into the warehouse
to commoditize it so that it

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.990
was a standard contract.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:20.230
If it's truly physical and not
commodity, it's much harder.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:26.290
Then you can't really net down
my house versus Shimon's house.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.905
They're two different houses.

00:31:28.905 --> 00:31:31.460
Does that help?

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.870
But literally by the
late 19th century,

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.200
even in the commodities
space running out of Chicago,

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.140
they figured out
central clearing houses

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:43.610
with a lot of counterparty risk.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.560
So there's an economic
reason we have

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.970
centralized clearing houses.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:51.980
And the biggest economic
reason is netting.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:56.330
And netting lowers something
called counterparty risk.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.530
Instead of having literally
millions of transactions,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.660
you'll have thousands.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.398
And you'll have less
counterparty risk.

00:32:04.398 --> 00:32:05.690
It also lowers one other thing.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.130
So it lowers counterparty risk.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.130
And what is the other
thing you think it lowers?

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.223
Anybody?

00:32:11.223 --> 00:32:12.390
AUDIENCE: Transactions cost.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.682
GARY GENSLER: Transactions
cost because it's efficient.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.850
We used to call it you take
a lot of lines off the page.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.520
So in the old human
days, you'd have

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.390
to have fewer humans
actually pushing paper.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:29.650
Hugo.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.230
AUDIENCE: Another
clarification question.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.650
So from the participants side,
so from a hedge fund side

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.615
or whatever or a
trading desk side,

00:32:39.615 --> 00:32:41.740
do they just go about their
day trading everything?

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.183
And then the next day
the clearing house

00:32:44.183 --> 00:32:46.600
tells them, OK, you made all
these transactions yesterday.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.420
But we really only
need 35 [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.790
Or how does it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:56.110
GARY GENSLER: In that
case, looking back to this,

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.760
you are either the
buyer or seller.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.200
And you're dealing
with a broker.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.713
So if you're a hedge
fund, you often

00:33:03.713 --> 00:33:05.380
enter into an arrangement
with a broker.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.640
And it's called a prime
brokerage arrangement.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.640
And you might have a prime
brokerage arrangement

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.680
with more than one
Wall Street firm.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.580
But you rarely would have
it with more than three.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.130
So even if I'm doing a
trade through Merrill Lynch,

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.900
if my prime brokerage
arrangement is

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:25.420
at Goldman Sachs, Merrill is
going to get a commission.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.970
But they're going to give up
my prime brokerage arrangements

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:28.870
to Goldman Sachs.

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:32.950
And that helps me, me the hedge
fund, get more netting as well.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.100
And that's a development
in the last 20 years,

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.670
this concept of prime brokerage.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.260
But to answer your
question, yes.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.370
I go about my business.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:43.560
I trade all day.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:48.130
And unless I get a phone call
or an electronic communication

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.870
from my prime brokerage
saying you've hit your lines,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:56.880
you do have credit limits and
position limits in essence.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.650
But your prime brokerage--

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.650
and I might say, well, I
need something moved over.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:05.220
I need some more credit today.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:05.862
But yes.

00:34:05.862 --> 00:34:08.070
You go about your business
until your prime brokerage

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.020
says slow down.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.520
Shimon?

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.690
AUDIENCE: But [INAUDIBLE]
question says that

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.580
if you're a lot like LTCM--

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.372
GARY GENSLER: Long-Term
Capital Management.

00:34:18.372 --> 00:34:20.622
AUDIENCE: --at some point,
they were running a balance

00:34:20.622 --> 00:34:22.230
sheet of a trillion dollars.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.409
And part of the reason
why, when bankrupt is they

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:27.145
didn't want to use
one prime broker,

00:34:27.145 --> 00:34:29.270
because they don't want to
reveal all their trades.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.389
But then their prime
brokers could not

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:35.570
net out their positions, because
I may hold one leg with you

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.739
and another leg with you.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:41.120
The net may be zero.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.429
But there's no way for
you to actually reconcile

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.670
that or reconcile that risk.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.610
So it's a real problem.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.360
GARY GENSLER: Long-Term
Capital Management

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.250
was a hedge fund
operating in Connecticut.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.590
It was founded in
the early 1990s

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.790
by a man named John
Meriwether, who

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.610
is a very famous trader
from Salomon Brothers

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.300
and very successful.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.460
And then he started it with
some remarkable finance

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.060
faculty from here, at
MIT, and elsewhere--

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.000
Bob Merton, who is
a Nobel laureate.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.220
Brilliant, brilliant
team of folks.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.940
But they ran into a little
challenge four years later.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.750
They had about $125 billion
balance sheet, $4 billion

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.800
in capital, and 1.2
trillion in swaps.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.000
Why do I know the numbers?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.880
I got the phone call with my
one-year-old sitting on my lap.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.620
And I picked up the phone.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.120
And I said, hello?

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.790
And the voice on the other
line said, Treasury operator.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.830
I've got the Treasury
secretary for you.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:43.820
And I get on the phone.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.930
I go, yes, Bob?

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:45.960
It was Bob Rubin.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.210
It was the Treasury secretary.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.950
Bob, what's up?

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:48.850
It was a Saturday.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.980
Isabel was on my lap.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.590
He says, do you know anything
about Long-Term Capital

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:54.180
Management?

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.050
He goes through
some of the figures.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:56.800
I'll never forget.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.020
He says, I hear from Alan--

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.090
that would be Alan Greenspan,
who was the head of the Federal

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:02.620
Reserve--

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.005
I hear from Alan that they
have over a trillion dollars

00:36:05.005 --> 00:36:06.710
of derivatives.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.470
That's Shimon's number.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.357
He says, is that a big number?

00:36:10.357 --> 00:36:12.440
Well, you have to understand,
Bob's sense of humor

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.410
was quite-- at that moment,
he knew it was a big number.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.990
So I flew up the next day.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.630
And with somebody from
the Federal Reserve

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.660
Bank in New York,
Peter Fisher, we

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.880
sat around the
conference table looking

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.040
at these facts and figures.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.850
And then I got back on the plane
and flew back to Washington

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:34.840
to be with my family.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.510
The next day was actually Rosh
Hashanah, the Jewish holiday.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.230
And I wasn't going to work.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.910
And I had to call Bob and
his deputy, Larry Summers,

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.160
up and give them my feedback.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.040
And I said, this
thing's going down.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.100
Bear Stearns was
their prime brokerage.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.010
And Bear Stearns, who 20
years later failed themselves,

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:58.730
but Bear Stearns said, we're
pulling the prime brokerage

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.460
account if you can't
post another half

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.015
a billion dollars by Wednesday.

00:37:04.015 --> 00:37:05.390
Well, there was
no way they could

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:07.010
post another half
a billion dollars,

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.840
because their $4
billion of capital

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.210
we could best figure on
that Sunday was somewhere

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:16.427
covering around 400 or 500
million at that point in time.

00:37:16.427 --> 00:37:18.010
Well, when you have
a lot of leverage,

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:20.860
you have $1.2 trillion of
derivatives which are all

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.690
sort of leveraged in
one way or another

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.660
and you've got $125
billion balance sheet, even

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.870
with the best minds, the
best finance faculty--

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.160
and they really are
terrific individuals.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.440
And Meriwether was
quite a trader.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.390
Sometimes markets
go against you.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:42.210
Correlation risk, liquidity
risk, and so forth.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:47.090
So they pulled the plug
the next day, basically.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.850
That's the Long-Term Capital
Management story I remember.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:54.140
But it's just because I
kind of had to live it.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.620
But to answer your question,
you can trade all day

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:02.550
until your prime broker
says, Hugo, slow down,

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.980
because they're
extending credit to you--

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.250
the prime broker is--

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:09.510
intraday.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.520
And one of the big risks,
one of the big risks

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.300
in the financial crisis--

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.710
and certainly Ben Bernanke,
who is chairing the US Federal

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:20.190
Reserve and others had to deal
with it in the middle of 2008--

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.800
is most commercial banks,
so they don't have a broker.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.700
They're banks.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.690
They're the brokers
themselves-- were extending

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.150
significant amount
of intraday credit

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:36.980
to each other that, in 2008,
wasn't terribly well measured

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.460
in the repo markets
and in other markets.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.400
And that's changed subsequently.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.250
But you wouldn't
have been a big bank.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.130
You would have probably
been shut down.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.360
Sorry.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.160
Or maybe not.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:57.020
So netting is the biggest
benefit of clearing.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.770
But it's also efficiency
and taking down

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:04.320
a lot of operating
lines of code.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.000
This is a chart.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.420
I'm not going to spend
a lot of time on it.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.550
But this is right off the
Australian Stock Exchange

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:09.050
website.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.970
And I thought, well,
why not take that?

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:15.040
They have 2 million investors,
the market participants

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.160
or brokers in a much
smaller market than the US.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:24.340
And Australia has 77 brokers,
registered, regulated brokers.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.840
And then they have the clearing
house called CHESS, C-H-E-S-S,

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.090
which I can't quite remember
what it all stands for.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.490
But SS is Settlement System.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.170
Clearing house--

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.900
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.660
What's it?

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.942
AUDIENCE: Clearing House
Subregistered System.

00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:43.400
GARY GENSLER:
Subregistered System.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.300
Thank you.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.890
Is it Equity for E?

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:46.890
AUDIENCE: There is none.

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:48.600
GARY GENSLER: There is none.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.910
But they have the Australian
Stock Exchange Clear

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.080
and Australia Stock
Exchange Settlement,

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.050
because they actually put it
in two different places, two

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.400
different things.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.100
The clearinghouse is doing
what we talked about--

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.850
mostly netting, lowering
the lines of code,

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.320
and then settlement.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.700
And basically, because we're
in a trade day plus two days,

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.440
on the first day is all the
clearing and the netting.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.490
And you better show up
with your securities.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.160
And on the second
day is settlement.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.820
Electronics and technology
could make this simultaneous.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.560
But most market
participants like

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.050
to have some ability to do
gross trading against net's

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.640
positions.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.030
So there's a lot of
economics and market practice

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:43.510
and structure behind keeping
some delayed settlement.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.260
And the markets have
grown up around that.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.500
Ross.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.555
AUDIENCE: If it's not delayed,
if it was instantaneous,

00:40:50.555 --> 00:40:52.430
wouldn't that get rid
of the benefits of net?

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.940
And you'd have to have every
trade go right through.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.240
So it has to be that you
wait until the end of the day

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.948
or whatever period
[INTERPOSING VOICES]..

00:40:58.948 --> 00:41:01.860
GARY GENSLER: So Ross just
raised the number one reason,

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:08.070
economic reason, why
simultaneous clearing

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:13.650
and settling is not
that likely to happen.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.660
The markets have
built themselves

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.400
around the benefits
of netting and also

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.390
stock loan, the ability to
borrow that security somewhere.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.220
But you're absolutely right.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:31.870
If there were simultaneous
execution and settlement, which

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.840
is what the Bitcoin network
in essence is supposed to be

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.973
and blockchain networks can
be, then you, in essence,

00:41:38.973 --> 00:41:39.640
have to prefund.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.510
Every time Hugo
trades, he's going

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.630
to have to provide
his security to trade.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.790
But then Tom would get
the security faster.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:57.790
It would change the entire
prime brokerage model.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.190
It doesn't mean markets,
Ross, couldn't adapt

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.860
and be structured that way.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.230
But it would be fundamentally
a different structure.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:08.280
Is this is a hand up?

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.670
AUDIENCE: So the [INAUDIBLE]
is really big with derivatives.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.180
I don't see it.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.290
I don't see what we use--

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.400
I don't see it being a
primary issue with equities.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.140
So if you were going to apply
this to equities, trading,

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:23.890
any cash instrument
basically, I don't

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:27.520
see the huge economic
value for netting.

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:32.230
GARY GENSLER: The huge economic
benefit for netting currently

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:36.095
is a lot of
operational efficiency.

00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:36.720
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.470
But if you're going to
place that with some--

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:40.180
GARY GENSLER: No.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:45.520
And then also, because there
is two day counterparty risk,

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.880
you are lowering
that two day whatever

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:55.460
measure equity volatility, two
day equity volatility risk,

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.210
usually not collateralized.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.120
AUDIENCE: I'm just
commenting on whether this--

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:12.240
you said the price that you pay
for replacing this system with

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.088
the blockchain based one would
be that you cannot net up.

00:43:16.088 --> 00:43:18.380
GARY GENSLER: I should have
said something in addition.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.270
And the market
participants would have

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.090
to then prefund their trades.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.120
I think the larger thing--

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.580
so if I speak in too much
financial technology,

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:33.930
let me say current markets
are you can sell or buy

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:39.910
a security without owning the
security or having the cash.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.420
You can buy something
and not have the cash.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.480
You have to deliver
the cash in two days.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.700
And usually by that
evening or the next day,

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.580
you have to show
you have the cash.

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.520
You can sell a security
without owning the security.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.320
And you only have to
really kind of deliver

00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:00.910
it, generally speaking,
the next day, on t plus 1.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.690
If you went to a true
simultaneous clearing settling

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.270
and execution market,
you'd have to have

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:12.140
the cash and the security
before you execute.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.380
And I think that's the
larger piece of it,

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.657
much larger than netting.

00:44:17.657 --> 00:44:18.990
AUDIENCE: I understand the cash.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.580
But you need the
security, right?

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.620
Because if you're
going to buy it--

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.380
if you sell it and
you don't have it,

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:30.140
then you know it's going
to take two days to get one

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.262
to cover your first.

00:44:32.262 --> 00:44:34.720
GARY GENSLER: So through your
prime brokerage arrangement--

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.310
Hugo, remember, has a couple.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.235
He's a big hedge fund.

00:44:38.235 --> 00:44:40.360
And he has what's called
a prime brokerage account.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.570
Not at Bear Stearns
any longer, but maybe

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:44.750
it's at Goldman Sachs.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.420
He's kind of fancy.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.370
He's getting that.

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.220
Then his prime
brokerage account,

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.620
in his legal contractual
arrangements with them,

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:58.440
they will find that
security for him, maybe

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.060
from some other customer.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.550
Maybe that security is
held in somebody else's

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.410
what's called a margin account.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:08.520
And they will enter into
what's called a stock borrow.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.640
But when he executes
on the phone,

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.670
he doesn't technically
already have that security.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.540
He could be shorting it.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:20.190
And his prime brokerage
account could then go find it

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:23.550
from the Goldman Sachs network.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.820
AUDIENCE: But it's not
because you have plus two.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.450
But it's because
you have a broker.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.200
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.133
That's right, combined
with t plus 2.

00:45:31.133 --> 00:45:31.800
Let's take this.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.060
And then I'm going to move on.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.102
AUDIENCE: Can you just
take that one step further

00:45:35.102 --> 00:45:37.770
and explain why that's
beneficial broadly

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:39.950
versus just the system
we've grown accustomed to?

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.700
GARY GENSLER: It's a
really good question.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.783
Is this just the system
we've grown accustomed to?

00:45:43.783 --> 00:45:45.120
Or is it beneficial?

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.020
It's hard to tell.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.550
It is definitely
the system we've

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.700
grown accustomed to over
a couple of centuries.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:55.870
And as we've gone from
transaction date plus five,

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:58.500
which most markets
were I'm talking

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.200
about 50 and 100
years ago, maybe it

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.030
was even t plus
10 at some point.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:07.850
But t plus five to t plus
three to now t plus two,

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:09.240
we've started to challenge that.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.090
But in the US, the
Depository Trust Corporation

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.460
provides same day settlement.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:20.300
And very few accounts ask
to do same day settlement.

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:23.990
And I think it might be just
they've grown accustomed to it.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:27.320
But I think there is some
benefit in this stock,

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.710
loan stock borrow side.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.750
But I stand with
what I said earlier.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:37.100
I think the market could
work the other way.

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:40.620
But it would be
a big adjustment.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.510
And there are some
benefits, because then

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:45.780
Hugo, this hedge fund,
is being extended credit

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.580
by his prime brokerage account.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:50.810
And the prime broker is
making some money on it.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:55.970
But also Hugo's taking
risk in that arrangement.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.960
Prefunding it would
be a different model.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.380
Some argue it would have less
liquidity in the marketplace.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:07.595
It would make shorting
stocks a little costlier.

00:47:07.595 --> 00:47:08.720
I'm not sure they're right.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.700
But their argument
is that I'd have

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:15.920
to borrow the securities
always, 100%, and halve it off

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.760
before I sell, even if I'm
a multi-billion dollar hedge

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.788
fund that has some
credit worthiness.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:25.810
Kelly.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:31.210
AUDIENCE: So the paper mentions
that their new system fails

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:35.170
to basically recognize these
challenges, such as the fact

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:37.000
that it'd be
advantaging the capital

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.632
and operational efficiencies.

00:47:38.632 --> 00:47:40.090
But it goes on to
say that it would

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:43.080
be a step backwards for the
world's most liquid market.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.000
So what would necessarily
be implications

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.620
for illiquid markets?

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:50.530
Would it basically be that
people can make trades

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:54.275
without having to interface
with extensions of credit?

00:47:54.275 --> 00:47:56.650
GARY GENSLER: Are you talking
about illiquid markets that

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.960
are centrally cleared
or illiquid markets that

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.692
have no central clearing?

00:48:00.692 --> 00:48:01.900
AUDIENCE: I guess maybe both.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.380
I'm just trying to understand
what the counter would

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:09.130
be, that saying that there would
be advantages, efficiencies

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:10.520
in liquid markets.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.750
But what with the opposite be?

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.930
Would there not be implications
for the [INAUDIBLE] markets?

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.463
GARY GENSLER: So
Kelly's asking--

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:21.130
I don't remember the
comment, because it

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:24.680
was in the Australian
Stock Exchange one.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:30.430
So in non-cleared
markets, things

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:33.400
that are just so
illiquid-- my house.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.240
It's not cleared.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.400
It's not centrally cleared.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.400
Certain parts of the derivatives
markets aren't centrally clear.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.360
They're not, quote,
"liquid" enough.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.110
So I don't know.

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.580
I don't know the comment.

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:45.750
Maybe see me in class.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:49.080
And I'll look at the comment
and try to nail it for you.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.610
Is that all right?

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:54.520
So I wanted to put this chart
up, because it was from 2011.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.070
I remembered it when
I was at the CFTC.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:59.290
But somebody at
the Fed of Chicago

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:02.890
made this chart about
the US clearing systems.

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:05.700
Yellow are all clearing houses.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.900
Red, the SEC, the Federal
Reserve, New York--

00:49:11.162 --> 00:49:12.238
AUDIENCE: SBD?

00:49:12.238 --> 00:49:13.030
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.190
SEC, CFTC, and the
Federal Reserve.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.090
But they might have--

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:17.590
New York.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.093
I don't even know
who New York SB--

00:49:19.093 --> 00:49:21.010
AUDIENCE: New York State
Board of Derivatives.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:23.420
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.340
Somebody from the
Chicago Fed was

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.760
trying to make the case that
our regulatory system in the US

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.080
was a little bit complicated.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.350
And I think this was in
the midst of the debate

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.000
about Dodd-Frank,
that they thought

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.280
all oversight of
clearing houses should

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.140
move to the Federal Reserve.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.940
But I remembered the
chart and found it.

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.900
And I wanted to
share it with you.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.590
But the yellow are all
the clearing houses.

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:47.870
There are a lot of
clearing houses in the US.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:49.410
There's one for bonds.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:50.870
There's one for equities.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.970
There's multiple
ones for derivatives,

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.550
both from cash and
interest rate derivatives

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:58.370
to energy derivatives to
credit default derivatives

00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:59.480
and so forth.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.080
There's ones for options.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:08.080
So I just wanted to lay it out.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.300
Finance is pretty complex.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:15.200
This is all
digitized, by the way.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.960
But in this
complexity, that's also

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.570
where I think there's some
opportunity, whether it's

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:24.200
permissioned blockchain
and not fully permissioned

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.190
list with tokens,
and inspired by--

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.800
the green are exchanges.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.230
And I don't even think they
put a color up for brokers,

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.730
did they?

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:39.890
Because then you'd
have hundreds.

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:44.330
There are multiple parties
sharing ledgers and reconciling

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:45.170
their ledgers.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.210
Reconciliation means
I keep a ledger.

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.510
Tom keeps a ledger.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.480
It's both on our
database systems.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.245
And we keep testing and ensuring
that we have the same records.

00:50:57.030 --> 00:51:00.120
This is a system that,
by its complexity

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:05.960
and by its copies of
ledgers and reconciliation,

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.100
has a lot of opportunity
for greater efficiency.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.620
And the question is whether
blockchain technology,

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:17.260
maybe permissioned, can bring
some of that efficiency.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.480
That's the thought.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.272
And that's what the
chart was just trying--

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.490
by the way, the Congress
didn't agree with the Fed.

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:28.550
They left the authorities
at the SEC and CFTC.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.880
And those are for
stories other times.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.580
I personally felt it could
be a shared authority.

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.650
And we ended up with
some shared authorities.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:41.010
But I thought that the CFTC
and SEC have domain knowledge.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:44.270
And it really important to keep
the SEC involved in securities

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:48.260
clearing and the CFTC involved
in derivatives clearing

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:52.970
for that domain knowledge, but
that the Federal Reserve also

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:55.700
came in under something called
Title VIII of Dodd-Frank.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.440
And they also got authorities.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.320
So we made it more complicated,
because now there's

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:04.430
multiple dotted lines for this.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:08.060
The Federal Reserve basically
has an account with everybody.

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:12.410
Or they have some
oversight of everybody.

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:14.335
So then the question on
blockchain technology,

00:52:14.335 --> 00:52:16.460
could you take the clearing
house out of the middle

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.470
and do the thing on the right?

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.500
And my question for you all is,
do you think the economics--

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.570
I'm not talking
about the technology.

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:26.930
I'm not talking about
whether it's performance.

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.540
If you wish, you can go five
or 10 years down the road

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.660
and say it's got all this
scalability and performance.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.110
Do you think the technology,
without something

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:40.250
in the middle, what's
the economics about that?

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.200
Anybody?

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:42.970
Eilon?

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.880
AUDIENCE: I still want
to support the left side

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.645
for liquid markets
because of the netting.

00:52:47.645 --> 00:52:49.020
GARY GENSLER:
Because of netting.

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:49.603
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.180
I can't see a
blockchain solution

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.850
working well when
you need netting

00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:00.720
to enjoy the efficiencies
of selling and shorting,

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.580
shorting basically.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.372
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:53:02.372 --> 00:53:05.580
But the question really
is, can you somehow,

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:10.090
on the right with
shared ledger, still

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:12.410
get some benefit of netting?

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.910
Right?

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:14.950
You're saying you're
inclined here,

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:19.820
because you want to get the
netting for economic reasons.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.690
So as a ledger structure,
can you get the netting here?

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.620
Shimon?

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.120
AUDIENCE: You don't
need the netting

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.090
if it happens simultaneously.

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:32.273
Netting is it it is basically--

00:53:32.273 --> 00:53:33.440
again, with cash instrument.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.857
I'm not talking
about derivatives.

00:53:34.857 --> 00:53:36.710
Derivatives is a
different issue.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.330
With cash instruments,
the only reason

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:39.410
why you have
counterparty risk is

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:41.610
because it's not clear--
it was my understanding.

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.640
Correct me-- is
because you don't

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.890
have instantaneous settlement.

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:47.480
If you have a
[INAUDIBLE] settlement,

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.897
then you don't
care about netting.

00:53:48.897 --> 00:53:51.550
AUDIENCE: You care because you
face so many transaction fees.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:52.092
AUDIENCE: No.

00:53:52.092 --> 00:53:53.925
But that's going to be
a lot more efficient.

00:53:53.925 --> 00:54:00.570
So why-- again, do you think the
[? real ?] transaction fees are

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.300
a big economic issue here?

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:02.910
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:03.930
That's what I think.

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:06.040
GARY GENSLER: And I'm
sorry that you don't.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.220
AUDIENCE: So now it's fine.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:07.762
I don't know.

00:54:07.762 --> 00:54:08.726
I mean, I don't know.

00:54:08.726 --> 00:54:11.030
For really intense
help, how much

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:15.050
do you pay per transaction with
the clearing house and without?

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:18.950
Maybe the net will give you
only 10% of the transaction.

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:21.230
But the cost of having
the clearing house

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:22.903
is more than 10 times.

00:54:22.903 --> 00:54:23.570
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:25.760
AUDIENCE: So the economics
depends on those numbers,

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.840
I think.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.570
GARY GENSLER: Is
that a question?

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:31.140
Hugo?

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:35.220
So you still can get
some of the netting.

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:38.250
Let's just talk about blockchain
transactions on Bitcoin.

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:40.110
You can batch transactions.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.960
So you can have multiple
inputs and multiple outputs.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.590
And that's kind of like netting.

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:46.682
Then you have to
have a second system

00:54:46.682 --> 00:54:48.390
on top of that that
keeps track of what's

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:49.557
going on throughout the day.

00:54:49.557 --> 00:54:52.430
And then it just
does the transactions

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:56.070
on a daily basis or an
hourly basis or whatever.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.570
That takes care of that netting.

00:54:58.570 --> 00:54:59.160
Right?

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.660
GARY GENSLER: So
Hugo contends maybe

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.150
you can get this economic
thing called netting

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.570
and still have a shared
distributed ledger.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.630
Or you could do it off chain.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.900
I think, Shimon
to your question,

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.360
this is a big
economic thing either

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.220
because we've just
grown accustomed to it

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:21.360
over a couple centuries or
it's fundamental to how markets

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.460
trade, that we don't prefund.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:29.770
It's that economics that
blockchain technology

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:31.690
will challenge.

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:34.060
But we might stay with
a central clearing house

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.770
if the economics are that value.

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:40.900
Well, the economics of, in
essence, not prefunding,

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:45.390
and thus, some
delayed settlement.

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:48.210
Whereas in the past, we always
had delayed settlement at first

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:50.100
because there was
so much paperwork.

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.080
We had to have
delayed settlement.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.700
We went digitized.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:59.480
And now, really in 2018, we
don't need delayed settlement

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:03.130
or batch processing.

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:05.010
So now you've
exposed, well, wait.

00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:07.670
What are the economics?

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:08.765
Tom and then Alin?

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.890
AUDIENCE: Could you still
have a delayed settlement

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:14.290
with a blockchain system just
by using a smart contract?

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:15.290
GARY GENSLER: You could.

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.920
Absolutely.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.250
AUDIENCE: I mean, you
still keep this system

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:23.210
that people are
accustomed to, but do it

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:25.910
without the economic red
for the clearing house's

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:27.080
sides or [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:27.830
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:31.010
And it's what the
Australian Stock Exchange

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:36.860
says they are using with the
digital asset company, Blythe

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.620
Masters' company that's
their outside vendor using

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.910
the HyperLedger Fabric.

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:42.350
And they're using the code.

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:47.585
They call a DAML, or Digital
Asset Machine Language?

00:56:47.585 --> 00:56:48.710
I don't know what the M is.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:51.606
But they call it DAML.

00:56:51.606 --> 00:56:52.797
Alin?

00:56:52.797 --> 00:56:53.380
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:56.063
We've said you cannot
prefund on the right.

00:56:56.063 --> 00:56:56.730
Is that correct?

00:57:01.927 --> 00:57:04.260
GARY GENSLER: I think you
could through smart contracts.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.790
I think you could find this.

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:10.860
But the challenge with just
the picture, the picture

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.110
suggests there's no
central counterparty

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.720
to do all the netting.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:19.290
And so the question is, can
you have this ledger structure

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:23.760
and still find a way to
net down all the positions?

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.610
AUDIENCE: Well,
like Shimon said,

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:28.140
there is no need for that.

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.450
You get that implicitly
by recording everything

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:31.672
and executing.

00:57:31.672 --> 00:57:33.755
GARY GENSLER: But if you're
recording-- all right.

00:57:33.755 --> 00:57:35.150
I'm agreeing with that, too.

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:36.930
But that's where I
get to if you need

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:42.360
to do Shimon's approach, which
is simultaneous execution

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.180
and settlement, then
you need to prefund,

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.550
even if that prefunding
is by nanoseconds.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:49.377
But you need to prefund.

00:57:49.377 --> 00:57:50.460
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily.

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.430
You could, sort of
optimistically, you

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:55.895
could post a transaction that
says, I want to buy a stock.

00:57:55.895 --> 00:57:57.270
And I'm not going
to prove to you

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:58.980
that I have money to buy it.

00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.900
You record it, if you were
saying optimistically.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.738
And later on--

00:58:04.738 --> 00:58:05.780
GARY GENSLER: It depends.

00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:10.200
The word record-- let me use
a different word, settle.

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:13.470
Settlement means final
legal rights have moved

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.380
from one party to another.

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.770
So the word settlement
has a meaning that I just

00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:20.060
want to come back to.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.730
It means I'm
recording on a ledger

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:25.070
that I no longer
have legal rights.

00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:26.890
So this alpha has
legal rights to it.

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.080
And I think you would have
to prefund if you were

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.480
doing true settlement ledgers.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.100
AUDIENCE: Sure, sure.

00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:38.860
I guess I'm saying it seems like
you could simulate the clearing

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.420
house.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.442
In the right side
of this picture,

00:58:42.442 --> 00:58:43.900
the clearing house
just distributed

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.070
using the consensus protocol.

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:45.940
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.593
I think you're right
that you could.

00:58:48.593 --> 00:58:50.260
But if you're going
all the way to where

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:54.590
Shimon is, like Bitcoin, and
you're doing final settlement,

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:57.170
final settlement
recordation, then I

00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:59.257
think you have to prefund.

00:58:59.257 --> 00:59:00.590
A couple of questions over here.

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:02.700
Eric, Ross.

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.470
AUDIENCE: The reason that the
prefunding was [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:11.662
performed in the validation of
the block process, because--

00:59:11.662 --> 00:59:12.620
GARY GENSLER: It could.

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:15.110
I said it could even be
done during the nanoseconds.

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:18.380
But it has to be done before
you move the settlement.

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.140
And that's what's
called clearing.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.080
So it's a question of whether
you have simultaneous execution

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:28.130
and settlement, or you still
have execution, clearing,

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:31.890
settlement, even if
separated by seconds,

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:35.250
but still literally
get granular.

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:36.000
I apologize.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.380
This stuff is that granular.

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.310
Back here.

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:43.380
And then I'm going to move on.

00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.863
AUDIENCE: Why do you
consider prefunding--

00:59:45.863 --> 00:59:46.530
maybe you don't.

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:49.315
But it seems simply
you consider prefunding

00:59:49.315 --> 00:59:50.690
before you're
allowed to transact

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:52.512
a negative economically.

00:59:52.512 --> 00:59:54.220
GARY GENSLER: I
shouldn't sound that way.

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:56.550
It's just that for
a couple years,

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:59.440
we've had delayed settlement.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.750
And so I'm saying if you are
a proponent of a system that

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:08.390
has simultaneous
execution and settlement,

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:09.810
you just have to deal with it.

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:11.720
You're changing
the economic models

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.720
that have been so common
in the capital markets.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.180
And when you take
that on, you just

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:22.240
have to think through what are
the economics of that shift,

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.280
from in essence a
delayed settlement,

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.220
thus modest but
real counterparty

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.120
risk that Hugo's got a prime
broker and he's got that,

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.380
and moving to this new
model in capital markets.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.480
So I shouldn't come
across as negative.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.320
But I'm saying at least
it's a hurdle that you've

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.320
got an adoption curve that's
going to be a challenge,

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.710
I think, at a minimum.

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:54.220
DTCC, when I first
spoke to them--

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:58.480
and I've had a lively, ongoing
dialogue with the folks

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.110
there on an occasional basis.

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:03.970
This was the biggest
issue they raised.

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:06.640
They said they looked
at blockchain technology

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.950
starting several years ago.

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:11.080
They talked to
their customer base.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.330
And they couldn't find that
their customer base really

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:16.990
wanted to go to simultaneous
execution and settlement.

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:18.430
They have same day settlement.

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:19.990
But it's end of day settlement.

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:23.253
So there's still several hours.

01:01:23.253 --> 01:01:24.670
But they said, we
don't have a lot

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:28.390
of customers that really
want simultaneous execution

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:29.680
and settlement.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.645
Now, that was commenting
on the demand side.

01:01:32.645 --> 01:01:34.020
It's another
question whether you

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:37.500
could adopt this lower cost,
do something, and change

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.420
your capital market.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:46.380
So this is another look at it.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.080
This is also from the
Australian Stock Exchange,

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.560
I think, website if I remember.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.080
But maybe it was
another website.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.870
The question is, could you
take out these middle parts?

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:57.180
This is like
blockchain architecture

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.180
for clearing
central counterparty

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.490
and the central
securities depository.

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:07.100
Because there's also somebody
who's got the central registry,

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.270
and that central registry
are the two things.

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:11.640
Could you take this
out completely?

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.510
That was the
question, in a sense.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:19.320
So here are the projects that
are actually live or being

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:19.830
explored.

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:21.330
And we're going to
talk a little bit

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:25.330
about Australian Stock
Exchange in the few minutes we

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:25.830
have left.

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:28.980
But this Australian
stock Exchange Project

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.630
started in 2016.

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.340
A bunch of requests
for proposals,

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.420
like higher digital
asset holding,

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.360
they're actually
actively working on it.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.770
It's a 25-year-old system.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:40.200
And Jeff Sprecher said it, too.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.360
He said, you know, they
had a legacy system

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.470
they needed to replace.

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.950
They decided to go with the
new technology of the day.

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:50.180
But Jeff wasn't
convinced they had to.

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.240
But they feel that it
was the right thing

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:58.250
to do, to go with that
new technology of the day.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:01.970
They believe-- and they've
put out reports as recently

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:03.830
as several weeks ago.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:05.540
They believe they're
on the right path

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.390
and that 15 or 20 years from
now, every clearing house

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:10.070
will be using what
they would consider

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:12.320
a permissioned
blockchain solution,

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.030
because it will so significantly
lower the back office

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:20.000
costs for their
market participants

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.010
who are now holding records.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:27.620
Each bank, was it 77 members
from an earlier-- yeah.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.930
Each bank has to hold records.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:32.750
It could be held
in a shared ledger.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:35.240
And they would lower
the reconciliation cost.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.980
And they believe
the second advantage

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.630
is using smart contracts.

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:41.570
Now, are they exactly
the smart contracts

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:43.170
like on the Ethereum network?

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:46.100
No, because they don't
have a native token.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.170
They don't have a DAP
and a native token.

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:51.410
But it's still automating
certain processes,

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:56.510
automating certain I'll call
it back office processes.

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.130
So they're very committed to it.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:00.950
And they're going to
roll it out in 2020.

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:05.210
And then, for 12 months,
run it simultaneous

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:07.590
with their legacy system.

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:13.980
So their cut over for
assuring that it's resilient

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.650
is at 12 month test.

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:18.510
Most major market
infrastructures

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:21.850
that roll things out do not roll
simultaneously for 12 months.

01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:24.210
But they all roll simultaneous.

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:28.380
Whether it's a month,
whether it's 90 days,

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.200
you can't cut over the back
office of the New York Stock

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.370
Exchange and just
test it for one day.

01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:36.490
Or you can.

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:40.944
It's just kind of
choppy and a big risk.

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:42.090
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.285
Are they going to use a stable
coin to settle the transaction?

01:04:45.285 --> 01:04:47.160
How are they going to
settle the transaction?

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.368
Because I can see how you
issue securities digitally.

01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:50.740
But you cannot issue cash.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:51.870
GARY GENSLER: So
this is very good.

01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:52.495
It's very good.

01:04:52.495 --> 01:04:56.940
So all of these
clearing houses, they

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.840
are the final custodian
for the security.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.900
Securities are dematerialized,
meaning they're all digital.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.890
And so those digital
assets are held on a ledger

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.710
and what's called
the golden record.

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:13.320
This is the words used in
the securities business.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.140
The gold record or the
golden record, meaning it

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.083
is the legal,
verifiable thing you

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.250
can go to in a court of law.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.020
And it says, this
is who owns this.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:22.800
Alpha owns it.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.080
Not Hugo.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.790
Sorry.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.950
You're working with Goldman
Sachs, though, right?

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:34.830
That golden record is
there for securities.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.915
Who has the golden
record for cash?

01:05:36.915 --> 01:05:38.040
AUDIENCE: The central bank?

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.700
GARY GENSLER: The central
bank or the fractional banking

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.400
system, their commercial
bank subledger.

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:49.290
Clearing houses
around the globe would

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:54.280
like to be able to have direct
access to central bank money.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:58.100
And they currently do not in
any of the major jurisdictions

01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:58.670
that I know.

01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:59.950
I think.

01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:04.790
So what Australia does now,
this is what they do now.

01:06:04.790 --> 01:06:06.800
They net everybody down.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.120
They get to t plus two.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.380
They're on that second day.

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.490
Everything's netted down.

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:14.350
And they're about to do
the whole closing out.

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:17.650
One second before they do
the security settlement,

01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:20.300
they do the cash settlement.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.382
They call this Delivery
Versus Payment, DVP.

01:06:23.382 --> 01:06:24.590
But they're a clearing house.

01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:28.000
And they do not want to take
risk with the central bank.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.420
They take all the money
and settle all the cash

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:35.170
with the Royal Bank of
Australia, RBA I guess.

01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:36.280
Do I have the right name?

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.300
Or is it a different-- is RBA
one of the banks in Australia?

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.310
But they settle all the cash.

01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:45.790
And just within a
second, they settle.

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:47.230
We think of it as DVP.

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:49.360
But it's actually
technically not.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.380
Inside their clearing
systems, they

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.540
have a form of
Australian dollars

01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:02.590
that is effectively digitally,
in their system, digital money.

01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:04.090
In essence, what
they're doing is

01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:11.497
clearing their internal digital
money versus Royal Bank money.

01:07:11.497 --> 01:07:12.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:13.520
GARY GENSLER: All right.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.750
Sorry.

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.160
So these other projects--

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.310
Estonia, the Tallinn
Stock Exchange,

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:21.690
is exploring proxy
voting and registration.

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:27.080
What's interesting-- who runs
the Estonian Stock Exchange?

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.430
NASDAQ.

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:30.030
NASDAQ.

01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:32.360
So NASDAQ runs it.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.710
And they're doing this project.

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:38.450
NASDAQ announced and went
live in 2015 on an illiquid.

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:41.650
So Kelly, you asked me
about illiquids earlier.

01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:47.750
NASDAQ started a blockchain
technology platform in 2015

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:51.140
on private securities,
which were not--

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.420
they certainly weren't liquid.

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.790
I don't know enough about
what they did there as

01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:58.370
to how illiquid they were.

01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:03.380
But they felt, all right, this
is a place we could do this.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.175
And it's still gone live.

01:08:06.175 --> 01:08:08.120
It's got very little use.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.565
But it's still there.

01:08:09.565 --> 01:08:10.940
And they say
they're going to try

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:14.720
to do it for mutual funds,
when you and I can just

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.020
by interest in mutual funds.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:22.310
And NASDAQ's going to
offer that to mutual funds,

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.290
partly because
mutual funds aren't

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:28.399
in DTCC from what I understand.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:33.720
The others are just
really some tests.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.590
Japan Exchange Group for
the Tokyo Stock Exchange

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:37.850
has done some tests.

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:38.852
They've written papers.

01:08:38.852 --> 01:08:40.310
They're sort of
interesting papers.

01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:43.729
The last one was
earlier this year.

01:08:43.729 --> 01:08:47.840
They're really trying it
just on post trade matching.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.810
One of the securities firms
in Japan, I can't remember,

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:54.620
is really pressing the Tokyo
Stock Exchange to do this.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:58.600
So there's some local commercial
politics that are going on.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.430
I can't remember
which exchange is--

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:02.149
not exchange.

01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:06.740
One of the brokerage houses
is pushing them to do it.

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.310
All permissioned systems.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:12.960
No, to my knowledge,
permissionless systems.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.490
Let's talk about ISDA for
a few minutes, derivatives

01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:20.750
common domain model.

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:24.560
One of my former commissioner's
colleagues, Scott O'Malia,

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.640
runs ISDA.

01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:32.479
That's a international
trade organization.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:37.520
It's largely, largely
dominated by the 16 big banks

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.100
around the globe that
probably transact 98% or 99%

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:46.550
of derivatives around the globe.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:50.359
And it was started in the
1980s to do all the forms,

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:54.140
all the forms to enter into the
legal contractual obligations

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.980
called swaps.

01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.760
And over the years,
it's transitioned.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.500
It's also an advocacy group.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.470
And it lobbies
various regulators

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:06.840
in Europe and the US and Asia.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.970
But they've, a year or so
ago, said, wait a minute.

01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:14.900
We could take a lot of the back
office of swaps, particularly

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:17.930
swaps that are not going
into clearing houses.

01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:20.840
So it's called the non-cleared
or uncleared swaps.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.320
And maybe we can
create smart contracts

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.110
to automate a bunch
of contractual terms.

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:28.860
So that's the
second bullet point.

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.290
And they contracted out.

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:32.480
They put out a
request for proposal,

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.700
basically, for
somebody to come up

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:37.970
with machine readable
standard representation.

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:41.300
Call it code, a
scripting language.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.220
I can't remember if it's--

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.200
oh, it's written in JavaScript.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.651
So written in Java
and JavaScript,

01:10:47.651 --> 01:10:53.150
a standard machine readable
code of various events.

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:57.830
If it's a 20-year swap that's
going to pay every quarter 80

01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:02.660
quarterly payments, each of
those quarterly payments,

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.810
fixed versus floating
payments, is somehow

01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:08.290
put into machine readable code.

01:11:08.290 --> 01:11:11.570
And Scott and ISDA's
view was, if we

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:16.010
could get a broad consensus and
publish that machine readable

01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:19.400
code that everybody agrees on,
maybe that machine readable

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.390
code could take the
place of legal contracts.

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:27.150
ISDA, for 30 plus years, one
of their lines of business

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:30.590
is creating those
legal contracts.

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.990
Maybe we can get a
step ahead of this

01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:38.170
and get consensus amongst
these 16 big banks.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:41.240
There's about 100,000
users of swaps

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.830
when you say all the customers.

01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:45.870
It's not measured in
the tens of millions.

01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:47.990
I doubt anybody in
this room personally

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:50.870
has a 20-year or 10-year swap.

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:52.430
But I don't want to embarrass.

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:54.920
Maybe somebody does.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.440
But it's an institutional
product, largely.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.850
That's their product.

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:03.880
And it covers new
transactions, rate resets,

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.930
partial terminations,
as I listed up there.

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:10.510
Questions?

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:15.380
And it's definitely very
much inspired by Ethereum

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:19.260
and smart contracts and DAPs.

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:24.360
But in essence, it's not
really blockchain technology.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.370
It's inspired by it, in a sense.

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:30.060
AUDIENCE: They're just rewriting
the contracts instead of--

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.410
they think they can have more
specificity and certainty

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:37.020
of about what the contract
means by writing it in contract.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:40.570
GARY GENSLER: And importantly,
importantly, efficiency--

01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:44.530
to automate that which
humans are still doing, even

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:46.900
if it's in written contract.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.130
So it's also automation
that's inspiring them.

01:12:52.413 --> 01:12:53.580
But you're absolutely right.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:57.030
It's taking legal contract,
getting into machine readable

01:12:57.030 --> 01:13:01.320
JavaScript code, getting
consensus on what that code is,

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.008
getting some courts
to recognize it.

01:13:04.008 --> 01:13:05.550
And then you won't
even need to write

01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:09.510
some of this, a rate reset
or a partial termination,

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.130
into the contract.

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:15.470
You'd be referencing this.

01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:17.780
The longer term
objective is to say maybe

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:23.623
we can put even more
of it right into code.

01:13:23.623 --> 01:13:26.040
AUDIENCE: People would have
to pool their money somewhere.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.290
It's like we were
talking about, right?

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.760
GARY GENSLER: That's correct.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.320
AUDIENCE: It's going
to execute itself,

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.612
which is going to have to be
a pool of money somewhere.

01:13:31.612 --> 01:13:34.580
GARY GENSLER: That you might
have to some prefund or self

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.410
fund or something.

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:38.650
Let me go back
here, and then up.

01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:42.450
AUDIENCE: If they're using
blockchain on it, it can't be--

01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:44.450
GARY GENSLER: They call
it a blockchain project.

01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:46.620
But it's a--

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.430
I think I've tried to
capture the essence of what

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:50.580
I think they have here.

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.250
It's definitely
blockchain inspired.

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:54.520
I'm just not sure it's really
stored on a blockchain.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.145
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:13:55.145 --> 01:13:58.030
Because if you look at
credit default swap,

01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:00.515
you have to reference a credit
rating somewhere digitally.

01:14:00.515 --> 01:14:03.470
And wherever that's referenced
digitally, if someone makes

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:05.990
a mistake, does a
transaction period that's

01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:07.945
based on that mistake
and it's fixed,

01:14:07.945 --> 01:14:09.820
someone's going to have
to be able to reverse

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.245
that transaction.

01:14:11.245 --> 01:14:12.620
GARY GENSLER: So
what's raised is

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.760
what about if it's referencing
some oracle, referencing

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.640
some price source,
and there's an error.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.440
I believe, as I
understand it, they're

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.300
writing some of that
into the code as well.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.630
So if it's referencing a
price off the New York Stock

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:30.080
Exchange, how it does
that, what open API

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.190
it references, how it pulls it.

01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:38.240
And they're trying
to say, let's make

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.253
sure that it's what's
really verifiable.

01:14:40.253 --> 01:14:42.170
There's one more slide
on this that will help.

01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:43.220
This is their steps.

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:47.000
This is their publicly
disclosed five steps.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.560
This was in an October paper.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.930
It wasn't part of your reading.

01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:53.330
But select the parts of
derivatives contracts first.

01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:54.622
Automation would be worthwhile.

01:14:54.622 --> 01:14:55.372
They're effective.

01:14:55.372 --> 01:14:56.000
It's efficient.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.170
Let's find something
we can automate.

01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:00.980
Ross, that's their key driver.

01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:06.680
Then try to express it the legal
terms in a more formalized way.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.870
Get some standardization
about the law.

01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:12.370
Get that be represented
as functions,

01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:14.860
meaning computer code.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.620
So where can we be
efficient and automate?

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.300
Where can we take
the legal words

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.240
and get agreement,
put it into code,

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.130
combine that into templates?

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:26.430
I think some of this
is referencing oracles.

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:29.100
And then validate that
the templates actually

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:32.400
work and, ultimately, even
get some courts of law

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.960
to accept them.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.670
That's their game plan.

01:15:40.829 --> 01:15:41.407
Shimon?

01:15:41.407 --> 01:15:43.490
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
that there is potentially

01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:45.800
huge implications beyond
efficiency, right?

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:50.590
Because if you're at
Treasury or Goldman Sachs

01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:55.950
signs a contract with
someone at Orange County,

01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:57.690
their ability to
assess what is actually

01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:03.840
written in the 30-page contract
was minimal or will be minimal.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.430
But it's a lot easier to do
risk management or assessment

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:12.660
if you could just
use it as an API.

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.730
And you have an
outside company's

01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:16.700
basically providing you
with the risk analysis.

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.627
Right?

01:16:17.627 --> 01:16:18.960
GARY GENSLER: I agree with that.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.190
We're still very much
at the early days.

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:24.210
But I think this is an
interesting, real, live thing.

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:27.100
There's a lot of
money behind this.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.260
The markets are hundreds
of trillions of dollars.

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:33.540
If my former colleague
and ISDA pulls this off,

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:36.000
they'll probably drive
some efficiency automation.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.820
They might lower some
counterparty risk and event

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.880
risk or crisis risk.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:44.640
I think you could embed
these into true blockchain

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.540
technology.

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.750
But I'm not sure it's
dependent upon it.

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:51.840
The automation of
a smart contract.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.330
Next Tuesday, next
Tuesday there's

01:16:54.330 --> 01:16:55.560
a couple extra readings.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.870
We swapped out some readings.

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:58.140
It's trade finance.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:58.980
Thank you.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:02.330
[APPLAUSE]

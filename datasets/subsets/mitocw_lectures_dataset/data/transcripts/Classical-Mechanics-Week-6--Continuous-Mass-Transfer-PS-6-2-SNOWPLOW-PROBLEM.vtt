00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.710
Let's consider another example
of continuous mass transfer.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.960
Suppose we have a
truck, and that truck

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.610
has some type of plow.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.620
And it's plowing snow.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.570
And there's some type
of external force acting

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.970
on this truck, friction,
pushing the truck forward,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.650
so let's just assume we
have some type of force, F,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.860
on the truck.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.550
And this is our snow.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.320
And what's happening
in this problem

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.550
is that the truck connects--
picks up the snow.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.420
And then, which is
at rest initially,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.990
gets the snow up to
the speed of the truck.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.690
And then the snow
falls off the plow.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.730
So how do we model this problem?

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.430
Well, let's look at our
situation at time t.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.930
And what we're going
to do is, we're

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.350
going to consider a certain
mass of snow, delta ms, that's

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.070
at rest.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.580
And our truck, it's
a fixed mass truck,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.010
is moving with a velocity
vt at time t, the truck.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.840
So now, what happens
at time t plus delta t?

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.020
Well, the truck has picked
up the mass of the snow.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.730
And the truck has now
changed its speed.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.360
So that's at time
t plus delta t.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.850
And now we want to write
down our momentum law.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.990
So we have our external force.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.250
Let's call this the
plus i hat direction.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.280
We have our external force
is equal to the limit

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.039
as delta t goes to 0 of
the momentum at time t.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.250
So we have t plus
delta t, so what

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.890
we have is the mass of the
truck plus delta ms times

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.620
v of t plus delta t.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.150
And we have to subtract from it.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.230
That's divided by delta t.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.410
And we have to subtract from
this the moment at time t.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.180
The snow is at
rest, only the truck

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.820
is moving, so we have minus
t of vt divided by delta t.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.520
Now, as usual, we're going to
say that the truck has changed

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.100
its velocity in this interval.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.340
And what we want to do now
is write out our equation.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.980
We have F equals the limit
as delta t goes to 0.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.760
Now when we write
this out, notice

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.980
that we're going to have
a number of terms here.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.329
We have mt plus delta
ms times v plus delta v

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.329
of the truce-- that's the first
term-- divided by delta t.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.870
And the second term is just
minus mass of the truck,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.220
vt over delta t.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.560
Well, first off, we
see some cancellations

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.880
between this term,
this, and that.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.550
And what we're left with is
limit as delta t goes to 0.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.010
We have the snow term, delta ms
over delta t times the truck.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.900
Now, here we have
a term, which we're

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.560
going to analyze in a moment.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.540
It has two infinitesimal
quantities.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.090
And this term is
of second order,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.680
which we're going to neglect.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.945
And finally, we have
the term of mass

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:43.480
of the truck times
delta vt delta t.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.980
So, neglecting this
second-order term

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.890
in differentials,
what we get when

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.430
we take the limit is, that
we get the force is the rate

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.300
that the snow is being picked
up times v of the truck,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.500
plus mass of the truck,
times v truck, dt.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.600
Now, the only issue that
we have to think about here

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.090
is about the rate that
the truck, the snow,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.530
is being picked up.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.560
So that's our last
consideration,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.540
but this will be our
differential equation

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.310
for adding mass,
continually, to a system.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.570
So, when we found our equations
for describing the rate

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.270
that the truck changes its
speed-- the snowplow when it's

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.260
pushing snow away, we
wrote down our equation

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.040
in terms of the external force
on the truck, the rate that

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.400
snow is being picked up
by the truck, the velocity

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.030
of the truck, the
mass of the truck,

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.863
the rate of change of
velocity of the truck.

00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:48.470
If we multiply our
equation through by dt,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.200
we have the following equation.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.070
And now what we
want to consider is

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.490
we want to focus on how
much dms is picked up

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.840
in our infinitesimal time, dt.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.470
So one way to think about that
is, let's do a little drawing.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.380
So here's our truck.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.650
And let's say at time t--
the plow is right here,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.420
so here's the picture at time t.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.750
And let's draw some snow here.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.210
Here in New England
we have lots of snow.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.700
And at time t plus
delta t, the truck

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.428
has moved a certain distance.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.560
And so, this quantity
is the amount of snow

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.880
that's picked up by the
truck and displaced.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.010
Now, the truck has moved a
distance v truck delta t.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.080
And so, we can identify the
delta ms, which in the limit

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.070
will be dms, is equal to
the density of snow times

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.780
the cross sectional
area of the plow,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.870
times the length v
of truck delta t.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.820
And so now we have an
expression for the rate

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.170
that the mass is being picked
up in this time interval.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:24.920
And we can write that
in the following way.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.440
That we see that our
differential equation

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:40.200
Fdt equals dms,
which is rho A vt,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.670
times dt-- This will
be a small interval,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:52.300
we're taking a limit now--
times another vt plus mt dvt.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.570
Now, we can bring this term
over to the other side.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.800
And so we have F
minus rho A vt squared

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:10.290
times dt equals the mass
of the truck times dvt.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.860
And the mass of the truck,
in this case, is fixed.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.780
Why?

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.640
Because when the snow
gets into the truck,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.955
at the end of this
delta t time interval,

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:21.730
it gets displaced to the side.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.680
So this is an equation that
we can separate and integrate.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:33.550
So we have dt is equal to
mt divided by F minus rho

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:40.650
A vt squared dvt,
and we integrate

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.659
from some initial time
and some final time.

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:48.070
And here, we're
integrating from v of truck

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.490
from some t initial
time to some final time.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:58.830
And that's our integral version
for our-- finding the velocity.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.050
This interval is an interval
that's not hard to do,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.380
that you should
try as an exercise

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.477
in elementary calculus.

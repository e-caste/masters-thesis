00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:24.310
IAIN STEWART: So
last time, we were

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.790
talking about the standard model
as an effective field theory.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.410
And we decided that
the power counting

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.908
would be this, epsilon,
the masses of the particles

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:35.200
in the standard model, the
scales in the standard model

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.750
divided by some new
physics scale, scale

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.843
outside the standard model.

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:41.260
And I made the
statement that this

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.480
was connected to
operator dimension,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.520
but I didn't make that precise.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.120
And I want to do that now as
the first thing we do today.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.900
So let's spend a
few minutes and talk

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.865
about marginal, irrelevant,
and relevant operators

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:18.490
and their connection
to power counting.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.900
I'm going to write power
counting over and over again.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.880
And I'm going to
abbreviate it p.c.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.710
from now on.

00:01:54.377 --> 00:01:56.210
So let's consider an
effective field theory.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:07.030
It'll be a scalar effective
field theory in d dimensions,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:19.240
standard kinetic term,
mass term, phi 4 term.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.530
So it'll be a phi 4
scalar field theory.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.230
It will be an effective
theory, so we won't stop there.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.240
And I'll just write
down up to phi 6.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.032
And then, in principle,
I could keep going.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.030
So we can look at the dimensions
of the various objects here.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.580
The action with our
units is dimensionless.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.230
h bar and c are 1.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.320
So the mass dimensions of
the field in d dimensions

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.506
are d minus 2 over 2 since the
dimensions of ddx or minus d.

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:57.077
We have to compensate for that.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:59.160
And we have to compensate
for the two derivatives.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.990
The canonically
normalized kinetic term

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.902
tells us what the
dimensions of phi are.

00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:06.360
And then we can work out the
dimensions of everything else,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.540
so mass squared dimension 2.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.130
Tau dimension-- 6 minus 2d.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.860
Lambda could be
dimension 0 if d is 4.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.360
OK.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.000
So hopefully-- somewhat
familiar stuff.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.720
So let's say we want
to study a correlation

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:48.075
function of a bunch of phis at
different space time points.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.380
And we want to look at
it at long distance.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.735
Long distance is small momenta.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.765
So the way I'm going to
make the distance long

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:10.140
is I'm going to say that all
these x's that are appearing

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.050
in my phis, x1
through xn, I'm going

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.640
to redefine them as some s
common parameter times x prime.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.380
And then I'm just going to take
s goes to infinity with the x

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.010
prime fixed.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.765
So that makes all the x's large.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.830
So when I do that, if I make
a redefinition like that,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.050
I can mess up the normalization
of my kinetic term.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.580
It'll no longer be
canonical, but I can fix that

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.770
by just redefining my field.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.140
And the way to do that
is to do the following.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.580
To find a new, phi prime,
it's equal to the old field,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.690
but rescaled by an s.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.370
And the outcome
of that is that we

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.860
get an action for the
phi prime field written

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.650
in terms of prime coordinates,
which has a kinetic term that's

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.217
the same form.

00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:33.300
But then s's start showing
up in the other places.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.530
And if you look at the powers
of the s's that are showing up,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.600
it's related also to the
powers of these parameters.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.860
Yeah.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.750
AUDIENCE: Are you sure about
the powers of lambda tau,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.678
for the dimension lambda tau?

00:06:13.678 --> 00:06:15.220
IAIN STEWART: Did
I get it backwards?

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.542
Should it be d minus 4?

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.250
AUDIENCE: I think it
should be d minus 4.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.583
And then the other one should
be d minus 6 [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.550
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.680
That looks right.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.630
Oh, you have to be--

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.800
so let's see.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.200
There's d's here, right?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.910
So it's not d.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.530
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.940
IAIN STEWART:
You've got to keep--

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.390
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.420
I stick by what I wrote.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.920
Check it.

00:06:42.928 --> 00:06:45.470
All right, so let's look at the
correlation function in terms

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.290
of the phi prime because
the phi prime is just

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.400
a function of x primes.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.540
And the x primes
are holding fixed.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.440
So if we rescale everything
in terms of the x primes,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.460
then we have some matrix element
that's not growing with s.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.020
We can make all
the s's explicit.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:14.580
So we take our
original guy, which

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.300
in terms of our new
variables looks like that.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.900
We make this redefinition.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.230
We get some powers
of s out front.

00:07:25.032 --> 00:07:38.490
And then we get something which
is just in terms of the x prime

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.510
and won't grow with s.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.180
So we can study this in various
dimensions if we wanted to.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.550
Let's, for simplicity and also
since it's the most common case

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.080
we're interested
in, take d equals 4.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.510
I still may write d's, but let's
from here on take d equals 4

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.840
and ask the question, what
happens is s gets large?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.550
So now, we've made
all the s's explicit.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.040
This is something that
you often do when you're

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.248
doing effective field theory.

00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:15.930
You can figure out how
you're going to study

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.570
the large distance behavior.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.610
You want to make
the parameter that's

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.860
controlling that limit
explicit, so you can see it.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.510
So it's not hiding anywhere.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.385
And that's what we've
done with this algebra.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.392
So as s goes to
infinity, because we

00:08:34.392 --> 00:08:35.850
have this explicit
s squared there,

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.085
the m squared term is becoming
more and more important.

00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:53.310
It's called relevant.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.495
Child term is becoming
less important.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.540
Because if I put in d equals 4,
then this is s to the minus 2.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.690
It's tracking the s's, making
it less important as s grows.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.710
And the lambda term is equally
as important as it was before.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.040
And the terminology that
goes along with this

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.660
is an association.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.663
So that was a statement
about parameters.

00:09:34.663 --> 00:09:36.580
We could also make a
statement about operators

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.840
since obviously they were
part of the story here

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.625
that gave the s factors.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.295
So we would say that phi
squared is a relevant operator.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.815
The phi 4 is marginal.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.297
And phi 6 is irrelevant.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.860
And you can see, because of
the argument that we made,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:32.638
that this was just directly
connected to dimension,

00:10:32.638 --> 00:10:34.430
so either to the
dimension of the operators

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.013
or to the dimension
of the parameters.

00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:40.500
OK, so we're connecting
something that we can say,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.490
which is the power counting.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.990
In this case, we're
controlling that

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.560
with s using s as our
control parameters

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.152
to look at long distances.

00:10:47.152 --> 00:10:48.860
And we're seeing that
that gets connected

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.330
to dimensions of operators.

00:11:18.972 --> 00:11:19.930
Is there any questions?

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.880
So let's take s
finite, but large.

00:11:35.525 --> 00:11:37.150
Usually, we're not
interested in taking

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.107
it all the way to infinity.

00:11:39.107 --> 00:11:40.690
Although we may make
it as large as we

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:48.710
want to study some
long distance behavior.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:54.550
And so what I just said
is that we can see,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.620
from the powers of
s, the importance

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.550
of the various terms.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.490
Relevant terms are more
important than marginal terms.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.698
And marginal terms are more
important than irrelevant

00:12:08.698 --> 00:12:09.815
terms.

00:12:09.815 --> 00:12:10.690
The words say it all.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.270
So that means that, if you want
to think of how to do the power

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.790
counting and you don't want to
think of introducing this s,

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.100
since that was kind
of just our choice--

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.078
we introduced it as a way of
thinking about this question.

00:12:31.078 --> 00:12:32.870
But if we went back to
the original action,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.870
we should have a way of
doing the power counting

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.368
from that without having
to do this rescaling.

00:12:37.368 --> 00:12:38.660
And we know how to do that now.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.240
This exercise teaches
us that we can just

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.768
look at mass dimensions
of the parameters

00:12:43.768 --> 00:12:44.810
to do the power counting.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:13:03.340
So if we just associate a
power to the parameters,

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.470
we're still in d equals 4.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.690
Then we would get
this association,

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.940
this being the statement
that it's relevant, marginal,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.228
and irrelevant.

00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:16.270
And we can do a power
counting in this lambda nu.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.965
And we can then say,
in a language which

00:13:42.965 --> 00:13:44.590
would be familiar
from Feynman diagrams

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.612
where we do everything
in momentum space,

00:13:46.612 --> 00:13:48.070
that the momentum
we want to study,

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.640
p, has to be much less
than this lambda nu.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.820
And we'll do the power
counting to lambda nu.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.060
And that will make the,
for example, tau term

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.863
an irrelevant, less
important, operator.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.270
So there's one comment here.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.080
We did the scalar field theory
just because it's simplest.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.530
It also has a relevant operator.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.350
And we see that relevant
operators actually

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:26.750
can be dangerous
because we'd like

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.060
to set the power counting
for the whole problem

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.900
by the kinetic term.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.180
We'd like to say that
the kinetic term, which

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.450
was canonically normalized
and had no s's in it,

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.130
we'd like to say that
that was relevant,

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.613
that that's part of the
leading order Lagrangian.

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:41.780
But when we went through
it, we found something that

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.270
was more relevant, the master.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.385
Phi squared could become even
larger than the kinetic term.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.771
So we have to be careful
about relevant operators.

00:14:55.771 --> 00:14:58.820
And then this is, of course,
related to the Higgs fine

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.320
tuning.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.230
So even though I'm using
a scalar field theory,

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.880
I'm, for the most part, going
to just fine tune and ignore

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.910
this problem, since if I was
using something fermionic field

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.710
theory, I could
set things up so I

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.030
could ignore it from the start.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.500
But still using a scalar
field theory is convenient.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.500
So I want to also come
back to something else

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.340
that we mentioned last time and
go into a little more detail.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.090
And that is the
discussion of divergences.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.700
So last time, we
said that there was

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.390
two different ways of thinking
about renormalizability,

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.330
a traditional sense
of renormalizability,

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.170
renormalizability of
the standard model,

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.450
or an effective field
theory way of thinking

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.580
about renormalizability.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.430
So I want to come back to that
with our example of this scalar

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.160
field theory.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.260
So let's get rid of this
issue of having something that

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.690
can upset the power
counting either

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:01.460
by taking m to be 0 or just
fine tuning it to be small.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.380
And what that means is I
just demand that, as s grows,

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.760
I shrink m.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.880
And if I do that, then I can,
by hand, tune term and this term

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.925
to be the same size.

00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:16.550
So if you like, I'm
assigning a scaling

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.760
to m in order to make the
mass term be always as

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.080
important as the kinetic term.

00:16:25.882 --> 00:16:27.590
So with that little
proviso, we can start

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.120
thinking about divergences.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.910
And when we start
drawing Feynman diagrams,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.460
they will generically
have divergences.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.870
So we could have two
four-point interactions,

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.590
which I label by lambda, because
that's the parameter that

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.240
shows up in the Feynman rule.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.285
If this is k and this
is some k plus p,

00:16:46.285 --> 00:16:48.410
then this guy is going to
have two pairs of lambda.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:17:05.775
And it's going to be
some integral like that.

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:09.740
We won't worry about
overall factors here.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.259
I'm regulating with
dimensional regularization.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:22.220
I'll often do that when
it's convenient for us.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.510
If you ask how this
integral diverges,

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.970
you could ask how
it diverges just

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.910
in terms of thinking about it in
terms of some parameter that's

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.030
controlling the
ultraviolet, like a cutoff.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.000
So even if I am using dim
reg, I could ask, what's

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.950
the power of the divergence?

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.420
And it diverges as, in
d dimensions, lambda

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.512
to d minus 4.

00:17:42.512 --> 00:17:49.510
You say d minus 4 is the
degree of the divergence.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.450
And that's because you have d
powers of k from the measure

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.620
and minus 4 from
the propagators.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.290
So if d is equal to 4, you
say degree of divergence is 0,

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.112
but that means log diversion.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:26.630
So if you take d equals 4 in a
UV, 4 powers of k downstairs,

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.330
d upstairs-- but
if d is 4, that's

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.800
4 upstairs and 4 downstairs.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.110
So it's scaling
length dk over k.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.500
So I made it Euclidean.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.990
That's exactly what
it would become.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.910
And that's like a log.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.940
So it's a log of the cut off.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:48.476
So it's a 1 over
epsilon in dim reg

00:18:48.476 --> 00:18:50.460
where d is 4 minus 2 epsilon.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.380
And if you just want to
think about what this does,

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.750
well, it's something that
renormalizes the lambda phi 4

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.360
operator.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.540
So you need a counter
term for the lambda phi 4.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.700
So you add to your
theory that counter term.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.670
And you could get rid
of this divergence.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.170
OK.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.910
So, so far-- hopefully
standard stuff.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:22.050
Let's keep going, think
about other diagrams.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:27.822
So what if I put in a tau
term and a lambda term?

00:19:27.822 --> 00:19:29.280
This integral is
the same integral.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.550
I just have different
fields on the outside.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:41.850
So it's got the same
divergence, but now

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.032
the operator it's
renormalizing is an operator

00:19:44.032 --> 00:19:45.240
with 6 points on the outside.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.660
So it's renormalizing
the tau phi 6 term.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.060
So I insert one
tau and one lambda,

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.470
and I have to get back the
renormalization of tau.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.470
Well, that's not so bad.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:10.120
We had tau from the start, if
we include the tau term, so not

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.270
really a problem from
the point of view

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.790
of a standard
renormalization program.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:23.980
But we could also include
two taus, like this, again,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:29.950
same integral, so
same divergence.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.780
And now, this
renormalizes something

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:38.770
that we haven't included yet,
something with 8 points a phi 8

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.370
operator.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.530
So in order to
renormalize that diagram

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.180
and make the theory
renormalizable

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.680
and an effective
field theory sense,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.230
we need to include
the phi 8 operator.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.160
So if I'd ignored the
dots that I wrote down--

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.675
so let me say,
without the dots--

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.132
then phi 8 wasn't there.

00:21:12.132 --> 00:21:14.340
And so then, therefore, I
would say the theory is not

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.490
renormalizable.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.640
That's what makes the
tau operator the phi 6

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.530
operator via non-renormalizable
theory in the traditional sense

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.147
if we include that operator.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.550
That's the classic
way of thinking.

00:21:40.193 --> 00:21:41.860
And the effective
theory way of thinking

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.480
is just that we have
to add that operator

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.400
as soon as this diagram
would become relevant.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.240
So we just determined
a minute ago

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.440
that tau goes like
lambda nu to the minus 2.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.900
So tau goes like 1
over lambda nu squared.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.590
And in this diagram, we
have two powers of tau.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.110
So it's even less important.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.830
So lambda nu to the fourth--

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.550
downstairs.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.408
And so when it becomes
relevant to us,

00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:23.950
we want that kind
of accuracy that we

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.290
want to include things that
go like 1 over lambda nu

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.310
to the fourth.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.690
We have to consider
this diagram.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.690
And we have to consider
adding that operator

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.690
to the effective theory.

00:22:44.827 --> 00:22:47.160
And that's the sense in which
we say that the theory can

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:57.560
be renormalized order by order
in its power kinetic parameter,

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.430
which is 1 over lambda nu.

00:23:06.322 --> 00:23:14.299
So I could order this order, but
we have to add this operator.

00:23:32.762 --> 00:23:33.760
OK?

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.760
Make sense?

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.970
Silence means that
it makes sense.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.010
Jumping up and down saying
it doesn't make sense

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.280
means that it doesn't make
sense or puzzled looks

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.305
from everybody, but
that's harder to discern.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:14.463
So we can summarize this way of
thinking in the following way.

00:24:14.463 --> 00:24:15.880
Remember with the
effective theory

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.505
that we're only
interested in computing

00:24:17.505 --> 00:24:19.510
things to some accuracy.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.300
And the accuracy controls
where we stop in the series.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:28.450
So if we're interested in
stopping at lambda nu to the r

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.300
or 1 over s to
the r-- s was big.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.510
And lambda nu is also
much bigger than the p.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.110
But let's stick to
talking about lambda nu.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:50.230
And we include all operators
that have dimensions up

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.950
to a certain level.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:58.407
And since the power counting
is connected to dimensions,

00:24:58.407 --> 00:25:00.990
we're kind of guaranteed that
we will have everything we need.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:16.220
So as I promised, what this
little argument or discussion

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.618
tells us, is how power counting
is connected to dimensions.

00:25:21.618 --> 00:25:24.160
And this is the classic way of
thinking about effective field

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.660
theory is that the
power counting is

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.864
connected to dimensions.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.600
So this seems pretty
generic actually.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.790
You could imagine that,
if I did scalars, I mean,

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.640
fermions and scalars
of gauge theory,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.250
then I could still go through
the same type of arguments,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.410
write down higher
dimensional operators,

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.680
go through all these arguments.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.400
And so it seems
that I'd actually

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.090
shown you something more
powerful than what I claimed.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.360
Because I said, here, it seems
like it's almost this, right,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.510
that power counting is always
connected to dimensions.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.050
So can anyone spot where there
was an assumption in what we

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:07.140
did that where in some case the
power counting might not have

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.999
been related to dimensions?

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.747
It's a tough question.

00:26:14.747 --> 00:26:19.488
AUDIENCE: If the power
counting isn't a ratio scale?

00:26:19.488 --> 00:26:20.280
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.810
But I want a little bit
more than that, right track.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.690
So going back to this
example that we did,

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.300
what did we assume at the
beginning that led us here?

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.910
AUDIENCE: That we
changed the mass point?

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.780
IAIN STEWART: No, the mass
wasn't so much the issue.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.710
So what it was is that we
scaled all the coordinates

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.910
by the same amount.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.550
We said all the coordinates are
getting large in the same way.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.050
And we could have done something
more complicated than that.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.500
We could have said some
components of this coordinate

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.600
are getting larger, faster
than other components.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.693
That's what you do in a
non-relativistic theory

00:26:56.693 --> 00:26:58.860
where the time component
and the spatial coordinates

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.915
would scale in different ways.

00:27:00.915 --> 00:27:02.040
So that was the assumption.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.770
We assumed, basically, that
everything was getting large.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.490
All the coordinates were
getting large uniformly with s.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.360
And we said x mu i was
equal to s x prime mu i.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.130
With a universal s for
all the components,

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.210
that was an assumption
that led us here.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.885
And we may not always do that.

00:27:29.885 --> 00:27:32.010
In fact, in some of our
examples, we won't do that.

00:27:34.925 --> 00:27:36.300
But here, for the
standard model,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.425
that's what you want to do.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.230
So if we have the standard
model, which is just L0,

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.797
the usual standard
model, then we

00:28:00.797 --> 00:28:02.630
know, as part of the
way of constructing it,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:08.300
that we wrote down all the
operators with dimension

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.500
less than or equal to 4.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.730
And we also know that
it was renormalizable

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:22.810
in a traditional sense.

00:28:35.188 --> 00:28:36.980
So now, let's talk
about the standard model

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.367
corrections, i.e. terms
in the standard model

00:28:40.367 --> 00:28:42.200
from an effective field
theory point of view

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.335
that are operators we
can write down, like L1.

00:28:50.936 --> 00:28:56.910
So L1, I can write it in the
following way, which is kind

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.300
of a convenient thing to do.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.750
Pull out the scale lambda nu.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.090
Leave over some
dimensionless constant.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.103
So I'll just use some scale
lambda nu for all the operators

00:29:10.103 --> 00:29:10.770
that I consider.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.330
And I'll just allow
for differences

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.205
between the various
scales that the operators

00:29:14.205 --> 00:29:18.600
could have to be taken up
by dimensionless constants.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.006
And O5 here is a
dimension 5 operator.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.760
The dimension of c is 0.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.290
In a power counting notation,
we say c is of order 1.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.580
That means that we
don't count any powers

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.280
of lambda nu associated to c.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.460
What we've done here is we've
made the power explicit by just

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.050
writing it in.

00:29:55.892 --> 00:29:57.850
So that's often convenient
just in the same way

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.520
it was convenient to make the
s's explicit in that argument.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.670
Now, we're just building up the
theory, writing down operators,

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.010
making the lambda nu's,
which are our power counting

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.210
parameter, very explicit.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.580
Now, the statement that,
in the standard model,

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.130
it was renormalizable in
the traditional sense,

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:22.740
I told you that what that meant
is that nothing in lambda 0,

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.520
nothing in Lagrangian 0, really
tells us about lambda nu.

00:30:35.828 --> 00:30:37.620
So we're free to take
it as big as we want.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.862
There's no constraint on it from
our leading order Lagrangian.

00:30:52.862 --> 00:30:54.570
In particular, we can
take it much bigger

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.610
than things like the
taught mass or the w mass.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.390
And we can make these
corrections as small

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:03.900
as we want.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:11.560
So L1 is, therefore, really
we can think of it as really

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.810
giving some small corrections.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:17.330
And we can adjust how small
they are by just dialing up

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.390
the scale of lambda nu.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.040
All right, so let's
get down to business

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.460
and actually talk about
what this Lagrangian is.

00:31:55.654 --> 00:32:03.370
Our notation that we index the
Lagrangian in a series, this

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.977
is our sum over n that we
talked about last time.

00:32:05.977 --> 00:32:07.810
And our power counting
is that we associated

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:12.640
this guy here with no
powers of lambda nu,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.480
this guy here with
one inverse power,

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.290
this guy here with two
inverse power, et cetera.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:24.460
And we want to think about
using this for some p, which you

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.340
could say is of
order m top squared,

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:33.490
some scale that's much
less than the lambda nu.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.380
It could be larger than on top.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.830
It could be 10 TeV,
whatever we decide.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.290
But it's just, in order
for me to write something

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.480
on the board, let
me write m top.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:44.980
OK.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.350
So how do we
construct L1 and L2?

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.630
What do we assume?

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.540
Well, one thing we assume,
or we are free to assume

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.840
and is a reasonable
assumption, is

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.980
that there are not going to be
any Lorentz invariant or gauge

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.145
invariant violating terms.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.520
OK.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.860
So we can maintain these as
symmetries of our theory.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.290
So we assume that
they're unbroken.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.910
So that means,
when we write down

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:27.480
these L1 and L2, or
generically each Li,

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.528
that we're going to have to do
it by writing down operators

00:33:30.528 --> 00:33:31.570
that are gauge invariant.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.112
Even though they're
higher dimension,

00:33:33.112 --> 00:33:38.130
we still have to satisfy gauge
variance of the standard model

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.677
and Lorentz invariance.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:49.120
So that's going to
restrict what we can do.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.918
We also construct Li from
the same degrees of freedom

00:34:00.918 --> 00:34:01.710
that we have in L0.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.710
So we know what fields to use.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.639
So that's important.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.639
It means that, once you've
got the leading order

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:20.469
effective field
theory, you know where

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:23.409
to go for the higher order
terms because you're just

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:24.429
using the same fields.

00:34:33.834 --> 00:34:36.730
I'll also make the assumption
that the Higgs vacuum

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:49.650
expectation value is going to
stay to be the value in L0.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:59.200
So the way that the gauge group
is broken by the Higgs vacuum

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.833
expectation value is
spontaneously broken.

00:35:01.833 --> 00:35:03.250
We're not going
to mess with that.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.550
And we built into this
idea that we do this

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:23.800
because there's no new particles
that are produced at p.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.810
If there was a new
particle produced at p,

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.210
then they would have
to have a mass that

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.220
would allow us to produce it.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.970
And that would mean that
it doesn't have a mass up

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.020
at this lambda nu scale.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.320
And we'd have to include it
in our effective Lagrangian.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.068
So by taking this
point of view, we're

00:35:40.068 --> 00:35:41.860
assuming that there's
no new particles that

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.610
are produced at the scale
p, only at lambda nu.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.158
And effectively,
we've integrated out,

00:35:51.158 --> 00:35:53.200
if you want to use that
language-- although we're

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.680
doing this from the bottom up.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.430
If you wanted to have
a top-down language,

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.690
you'd say we integrated
out the particles

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.270
at the scale lambda nu.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.640
OK, so that's our logic.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:12.430
So let me just start seeing
what we can write down.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.065
And for the dimension 5, it's
actually very restrictive.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:24.342
Gauge symmetry is very
restrictive for dimension 5.

00:36:24.342 --> 00:36:26.666
And there's basically
only one operator.

00:36:35.098 --> 00:36:37.000
So we won't stop at dimension 5.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.340
We'll go up to the dimension 6.

00:36:42.316 --> 00:36:48.970
At dimension 5, it turns
out that, once you satisfy

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:52.090
the gauge symmetry, the unique
term that you can write down

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:52.840
looks like this.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:05.110
And my notation is
that this guy is

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:11.933
our left-handed lepton with a
charge conjugation operator.

00:37:11.933 --> 00:37:13.100
And these guys are doublets.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.210
So the Higgs doublet
is a doublet like that.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:22.730
And the left-handed leptons,
neutrino, an electron

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.270
is a doublet like that.

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:27.810
So these are doublets.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.640
And I'm figuring out how to
contract with doublet indices,

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.960
but I have to satisfy the U1
hyper charged gauge invariance.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.640
This has no color.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.820
So that's automatically
satisfied.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.653
And then I have to
satisfy the SU2.

00:37:42.653 --> 00:37:44.570
And I've done that by
the way that the indices

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:45.665
are contracted.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.275
One thing I didn't write
down in this operator

00:37:53.275 --> 00:37:54.200
is flavor indices.

00:37:57.098 --> 00:37:58.640
So if you were to
add flavor indices,

00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.810
you could do a bit more.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:06.690
But in some sense, that's a
pretty simple generalization.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.160
So we'll still count it as
one even though we could think

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.320
about having more flavors.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.790
We're contracting things
with more flavors.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.280
And that would, of
course, affect arguments

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.600
made on gauge symmetry alone.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.420
So in all my
counting today, I'll

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.775
be agnostic about
flavor matrices.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:33.870
So when I say only, that
proviso is hidden there, OK?

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.430
So this guy is
kind of interesting

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:38.500
from an phenomenological
point of view.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.660
Because if you replace the Higgs
field by its vacuum expectation

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.300
value, which means
getting rid of H+ ?

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:50.160
And taking h0 to be a
constant, which is v,

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.860
then that gives a
Majorana mass term.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.590
So the observed
left-handed neutrino

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.850
would get a term
in its Lagrangian

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:20.850
that, after we do that,
it looks like that.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:34.780
And that's a Majorana
mass term, where

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.630
this m nu is a
parameter that shows up,

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.338
but it's built out of
the parameters that

00:39:38.338 --> 00:39:39.230
were in this thing.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.972
So once I replace
these by [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:41.972 --> 00:39:43.430
and go through the
various factors,

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.830
we get something like that.

00:39:48.577 --> 00:39:50.910
So just the fact that we know
that the observed neutrino

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:57.640
masses are less
than, say, 3.5 eV

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.220
tells us something
about the scale.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.640
So this is small.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.310
If c5 is of order 1, I
told you we know what v is.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:05.980
It's 246 GeV.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:13.380
That tells us something about
lambda nu that it's big.

00:40:20.186 --> 00:40:22.800
But we could try to
think up some reasons

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.700
why the c5 maybe have
some suppression in it

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.200
and make the c a
little bit smaller.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.650
But if C5 is order 1, then
we get a very large lambda nu

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:30.150
scale.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.340
I'll give you a problem on
your problem set to explore

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.548
this in a little more detail.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.730
I should also note that the
Majorana mass term, having

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:47.200
two neutrinos like this,
violates lepton number, which

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:55.390
is a global symmetry of the
standard model, at least

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:56.464
classically.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.840
So this guy violates
lepton numbers.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.540
You can also write down
dimension 6 operators

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.830
that violate baryon number.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.723
And I'm going to leave that,
also, as a problem set problem.

00:41:17.723 --> 00:41:19.640
So you'll figure out
what those operators are.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:35.670
So example 3, if I conserve
lepton number and baryon

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:36.170
number--

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.120
which are things that,
if they're broken,

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.058
that's obviously
having a big impact.

00:41:44.058 --> 00:41:46.100
And there's obviously
strong constraints on that.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.230
So you can ask then, if
you go to dimension 6

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.370
and we conserve those
things because they're

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:58.070
highly constrained, how many
operators are there left over?

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:58.855
And there's 80.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:14.840
So L2, we can account exactly
how many operators there are.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:22.190
And there's i from 1 to 80, some
coefficients and some operators

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.090
that are dimension 6.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.612
And if I'm going to make
a lambda nu explicit,

00:42:26.612 --> 00:42:28.070
I put a lambda nu
squared in there.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:36.900
So 80 sounds like a big number,
but big is always relative.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.580
So if you think
about 80 relative to,

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.480
for example, how many soft
SUSY breaking parameters

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.630
you have in the MSSM,
is greater than 100,

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.255
then 80 doesn't sound so bad.

00:42:47.255 --> 00:42:49.400
Also, you should
remember that, if you're

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.280
going to do some
phenomenology with this L2,

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.320
that many of the 80 are
not going to contribute.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.820
If you look at a
particular process,

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.760
only some small subset
of them will contribute.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.220
And there's many,
many, many observables

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.020
in the standard model with
all the different particles.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.620
So 80, once you
start dividing it up

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.350
into camps that contribute
to different observables,

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.940
is not such a large number.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.990
Or at least it's not
an unmanageable number,

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:15.820
and people do
phenomenology with this.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.892
So for any observable, only a
manageable number contribute.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:44.980
And I should also say that, if
you have a top-down perspective

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.460
where you have a new physics
theory that you've constructed

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.070
that has the scale
lambda nu in it,

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.470
then from this point of view
what that theory predicts is

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.385
a particular
pattern for the c's.

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.600
Hopefully, if it has
less parameters than 80,

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.990
then you get some patterns of
connections between the c's.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.140
So if you have some new physics
model that has the number

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.918
of parameters that
are less than 80,

00:44:15.918 --> 00:44:17.710
then you get connections
between these c's.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:20.050
And you could think that,
if you use this Lagrangian,

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.980
constrain the c's, that
you could test generically

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.860
for classes of new
physics theories

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.870
that are ruled in or ruled out.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.030
Because they have to, if
you match on to these c's

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:34.300
from those theories,
obey whatever constraints

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.980
you would derive
from this logic.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.670
Of course, that assumes
that the new physics

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.290
particles are at a high scale.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:46.450
So we can make
this expansion, OK?

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.610
Questions about that?

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:49.532
Yeah.

00:44:49.532 --> 00:44:51.612
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
assumption that you

00:44:51.612 --> 00:44:56.408
don't have [INAUDIBLE] freedom
is returning to the high order.

00:44:56.408 --> 00:44:57.200
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.117
AUDIENCE: If you want
them to do a [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:59.117 --> 00:45:04.060
or [INAUDIBLE] for high
order, would [INAUDIBLE] they

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.890
have to be at
higher [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:10.347
And why is it at a higher
energy than [INAUDIBLE]??

00:45:10.347 --> 00:45:11.930
IAIN STEWART: So
it's not to say that,

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.840
at higher energy, that
no new degrees of freedom

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.240
would show up if I really
probe those energies directly.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.750
But what I'm doing is I'm
saying that I'm probing

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.352
the physics at small energy.

00:45:23.352 --> 00:45:25.310
And the way that high
energy degrees of freedom

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.940
would show up is by
a contribution to one

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:29.780
of these operators.

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.150
So say I have added in
some new particle at 10

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:35.300
TeV, mass of 10 TeV.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.320
If I expand in momentum
over that mass,

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.450
then what will happen is
you'll get an operator

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.790
like this O6, where
that particle is

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:45.680
removed because I expanded it.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.180
It got removed.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.120
And its mass will be
exactly in this denominator.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.470
It'll show up here as lambda nu.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.930
So think about it as lambda
nu squared could just

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.520
be the propagator.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.516
If I had 1 over p squared
minus some massive--

00:46:01.516 --> 00:46:04.550
I don't know, some
gluino, right?

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:07.220
And then I start expanding this.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.210
The first term where I drop
the momentum is just that.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:14.700
And that could be exactly
this lambda nu squared.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.310
So the new physics particles
don't show up in Oi6.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.870
What they affect
is the pre-factor.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.350
So you don't need to add new
physics particles in order

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:31.800
could construct the operators.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.467
You're just building
those operators out

00:46:33.467 --> 00:46:35.390
of the standard model
degrees of freedom.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:36.878
AUDIENCE: So you're
still working

00:46:36.878 --> 00:46:38.180
in p but just [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.650
IAIN STEWART: Yes, yes,
then the lambda nu.

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.630
Is there another question?

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:44.130
OK.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.730
So I've been assuming
some familiarity

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:48.620
with the standard model here.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.948
And I've posted also,
as I said last time,

00:46:50.948 --> 00:46:52.740
my lecture notes on
quantum field theory 3.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.660
And there's some review
reading there if some of this

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.750
is unfamiliar to you, discussing
[INAUDIBLE] and things

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.480
like that.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:02.980
OK.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:07.305
So what kind of operators
can we have at dimension 6?

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.840
I'm not going to list
all 80, obviously,

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.370
but I'll list a few of them.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:21.430
So we could take an operator
that's the following, built out

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.390
of gluon field strengths.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:35.170
So making it Lorentz invariant
and contracting up the indices

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:43.630
and contracting up color
indices with an FABC, that's

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:47.900
an operator that's dimension 6
because the Gs are dimension 2.

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.000
That's one of the 80.

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.150
You could also do
something with fermions.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.210
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what
are the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:04.460
IAIN STEWART: Here?

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:04.960
Whoops.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.880
Yeah, what happened?

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.780
All right, there we go.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:09.280
Thanks.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.920
So here's something with a
lepton doublet and a quark

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.420
doublet.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.420
We already introduced
the notation for LL.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.020
And QL is similar,
but just up and down.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.390
So that's each
fermion dimension 3/2.

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:35.920
So four of them
is dimension six.

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.290
There's something called
magnetic operators.

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:46.550
So there's lots of
different things

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.290
that you can do
with four fermions.

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:50.980
I've only given you one example.

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:54.350
And I've posted the
reference for the paper

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:57.175
that lists all 80.

00:48:57.175 --> 00:48:58.550
So you can look
at it if you want

00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:59.758
to look at the complete list.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:08.320
So we can do something where
we have leptons, a Higgs field,

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.570
as well as a field
strength for the SU2.

00:49:19.653 --> 00:49:20.570
So this is in the SU2.

00:49:24.023 --> 00:49:25.440
And these are all
gauge invariant,

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.982
as you can convince yourself by
looking at the standard model

00:49:27.982 --> 00:49:30.110
gauge transformations
of these operators.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.160
And so if I write something like
this, where this is a doublet

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.535
and this is a
doublet and I don't

00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:35.803
write the doublet
contraction, then I'm

00:49:35.803 --> 00:49:37.095
just contracting those indices.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.460
These two here contribute to
the mu on the magnetic moment,

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.280
anomalous moment.

00:49:47.992 --> 00:49:49.920
So they contribute to g minus 2.

00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:04.700
So g minus 2 at the
muon, which is something

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:09.850
that we've measured
to very high precision

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:13.820
has what sometimes you
would call standard model

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.940
contributions,
which people usually

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.830
mean as the contributions
in our notation

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.680
from L0 and then plus
some contributions

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.470
from these higher dimension
operators, whatever

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:28.092
coefficients these
operators have.

00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:30.050
And again, I would replace
the Higgs field here

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:31.168
by a [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.870
I know they're
dimension 6, so there's

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.430
lambda nu squared downstairs.

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:40.100
One factor of dimension is
made up by the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.830
And then the next
scale that comes in

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:43.880
is the mass of the muon.

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.270
So this is the generic size
of those contributions.

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:51.590
And again, if you take into
account experimentally how well

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.010
we've measured this, it
puts a pretty strong,

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:58.040
or at least it puts a
constraint, on lambda nu.

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:02.750
Actually, it's probably stronger
than this number, some number

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:03.800
greater than 100 TeV.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.142
Maybe it's even 1,000 TeV.

00:51:06.142 --> 00:51:07.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
contribution,

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.010
it was [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:11.310
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:12.810
So the standard
model contribution

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:15.250
makes up all the
digits we've measured.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.210
And then there's some digits
where there's some uncertainty.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:19.240
We haven't [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.870
And you can constrain, based
on experimental uncertainty,

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:25.470
how big this possible
contribution could be.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:30.728
And there's 2 and 1/2 deviations
from the standard model

00:51:30.728 --> 00:51:31.520
in this observable.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.990
So you can make up for them
with an operator like that.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:39.230
But I never really pay
attention to things

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:43.820
that are less than
4 sigma personally.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.160
Though sometimes it's
interesting to get

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.450
excited about 3 sigma.

00:51:50.859 --> 00:51:53.867
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:53.867 --> 00:51:54.950
IAIN STEWART: No, I'm not.

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:55.750
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:56.860
IAIN STEWART: Yeah.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.100
So there's also
flavor on top of that.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.592
That's right.

00:52:00.592 --> 00:52:02.300
So flavor is actually
highly constrained.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:05.720
And you could put in some
assumptions about flavor

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:09.210
and then you get
to the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:09.720
OK.

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:15.320
So for the remaining 76, see
the reference I've posted.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.662
So this paper actually
wasn't the first to try

00:52:33.662 --> 00:52:34.870
to enumerate these operators.

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:37.780
As you can imagine, this would
be a pretty standard thing

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:38.830
to do.

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:40.780
But it was the first to get 80.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:44.140
And the reason that they got
80 where other people got more

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.680
is because they used
the equations of motion

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.000
to simplify the operators.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:56.530
So let me phrase that
as, is there a caveat?

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:05.980
So when they did their
counting of the operators,

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:18.750
they took the equations
of motion from L0,

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.490
and they used that
to simplify L1.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.340
So they worked out the standard
model equations of motion

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.552
that tree level.

00:53:31.552 --> 00:53:33.510
And then they applied
those equations of motion

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:41.965
to reduce the form of
the operators down to 80.

00:53:41.965 --> 00:53:44.530
So that got rid of a lot
of operators for them

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:46.210
that other people had
considered as part

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:47.377
of the counting in the past.

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:54.430
So for example-- so
you get some idea,

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:56.220
if I have a covariant
derivative acting

00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:00.240
on a right-handed electron.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.340
And the equation of motion
in the standard model

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.040
relates that to
[INAUDIBLE] couplings.

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.590
Here, I'm writing
the flavor indices

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:11.490
in the left-handed
doublet Higgs field

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:14.010
and the left-handed doublet.

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:17.726
This would be like a mass term
if I put in the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:25.920
So that's like the analog, if I
write it in terms of spinners,

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.455
of p slash u for the
right-hand electron is m u,

00:54:31.455 --> 00:54:33.330
but just written as
an equation of motion.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.730
So they're using
things like this

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:40.530
to get rid of covariant
derivatives acting

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:43.580
on the right-handed electron and
just replace it by an operator

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.100
that a priori doesn't look
like it's equivalent, which

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.280
is H dagger L.

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:55.650
Now, if you are stuck at tree
level-- which is actually

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:57.780
the language in which
they constructed

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:02.190
their paper is just
to think that you

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:04.890
apply this in a
way that is valid

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:10.870
when you look at lowest order,
the operators at lowest order.

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:13.110
Then it's pretty obvious,
actually that this is OK.

00:55:16.798 --> 00:55:18.840
If the lines that are
coming out of your operator

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.600
are always external
lines, then when

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:25.032
you look at the final
rule for those lines,

00:55:25.032 --> 00:55:26.240
you're putting them on shell.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.310
So for example, let's think
that we had an operator that

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:39.910
was not part of their list.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:45.570
So H dagger H e right
id slash e right,

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:48.300
you won't find that as
one of the ones that's

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.170
listed in the 80.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.760
You could think about the
Feynman rule for that.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.260
So there's two Higgs
particles, say,

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:02.900
and two right-handed electrons.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:07.130
And if I just take
the derivative out

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:13.790
of here and then I get a p slash
and if I use p slash as m u,

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:17.000
then I get just u bar u.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.660
And so this is, of
course, connecting us

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.110
to the left-handed doublet,
the left-handed guy.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:28.377
So this operator, in
that sense of thinking

00:56:28.377 --> 00:56:30.710
about using the equation of
motion, which are connecting

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:33.350
left and right fields,
putting them together

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:36.170
in the standard model, is
connecting this operator

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.930
to the one that we
just have H digger L.

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:42.328
And you could just immediately
get the right result just

00:56:42.328 --> 00:56:43.620
by starting with that operator.

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.440
And that's the logic
that they used.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.180
So you don't have to write this
down because it's redundant.

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:52.730
You get the same result
from writing this down.

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:56.180
So that seems fairly
straightforward at tree level

00:56:56.180 --> 00:57:00.080
and at lowest order where
all the fields are external.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:05.280
But I actually claim that it's
true regardless of what I do.

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.810
Whether I have loops, whether
I have propagators, it's OK.

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:11.250
We can do this.

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:13.330
And that seems a
lot less trivial.

00:57:19.604 --> 00:57:22.320
So they didn't know that
when they wrote their paper.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.190
At least I don't think
they did, but it is true.

00:57:33.927 --> 00:57:35.760
So that's what I actually
want to talk about

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.450
for the rest of today's
lecture because it's

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:41.050
a pretty powerful thing to do.

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:43.290
If we are allowed to use
these equations of motion

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:46.350
to simplify the form of the
higher dimensional operators

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:48.930
in our effective field
theory, it certainly

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:52.290
helps us to reduce the
number of operators.

00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:11.560
So one way of phrasing
this is what's

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.730
called the representation
independence theorem, sometimes

00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:16.720
called that.

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.220
I'll phrase it a
few different ways,

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.428
but I'll start with this way.

00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:27.400
So if we have some
field, phi, we

00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.610
can set it equal to some
combination of other fields.

00:58:31.610 --> 00:58:35.270
So phi and chi can be
scalars, let's say.

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:38.680
And this function, f, which
could be fairly complicated,

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.380
has to have at least one
property that, when chi is 0,

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:42.250
it's 1.

00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:46.630
So phi and chi both
show up linearly

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:50.283
in some term in the
function if you'd

00:58:50.283 --> 00:58:52.450
like, if you want to think
of it as a Taylor series,

00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:52.950
for example.

00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:01.150
So if that's true, the
statement of this theorem

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:07.960
is that calculations
of observable

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:14.210
that are done with phi or the
Lagrangian that's made of phi--

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:16.780
and what that really means
is that I've quantized phi--

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:32.140
will give the same results
as those with a Lagrangian

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:37.620
where I quantize chi
where I construct

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:40.692
that Lagrangian by just making
this change of variables.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:52.200
And we're going to
exploit that fact in order

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.990
to argue that we're allowed
to do what I just said.

00:59:57.758 --> 00:59:59.550
So we'll start slowly,
then we'll build up.

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:02.390
Then we'll state a more
general theorem than this one.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:03.890
Then we'll show you
how to prove it.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.100
So let's start by
thinking of an example.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.315
Examples are always good.

01:00:16.315 --> 01:00:18.190
And we'll stick with
our scalar field theory.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.910
I'm getting tired of
writing factorial,

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:27.150
so I'm choosing a little bit of
different normalization here.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.660
So I'll consider
an effective theory

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:42.300
that has these terms
at least to start.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.310
And eta has dimensions.

01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:45.280
And it's a small thing.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.760
It's like 1 over lambda nu.

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:56.560
And the statement that
we want to explore

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.250
is the fact that we can
use the equation of motion

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:18.730
to effectively drop
the last term by using

01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:21.200
the equation of motion.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.880
So how do we make use
of this statement?

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.620
Well, this tells us that we
can make changes to variable

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.360
and that we won't
change anything.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.860
So we try to make a change of
variable to make this go away.

01:01:36.268 --> 01:01:37.557
AUDIENCE: Wait, sorry.

01:01:37.557 --> 01:01:39.890
But that's not even the tree
level operation [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:40.395
right?

01:01:40.395 --> 01:01:42.920
You still have the lambda term.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.640
IAIN STEWART: Yeah, that's true.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.090
Yeah.

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:47.610
Yeah.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:52.600
I should write the
lambda term in there,

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.220
plus, minus, whatever it is.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.100
Thanks.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.530
There's a 2.

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:11.932
Thanks.

01:02:11.932 --> 01:02:14.140
All right, so how do we to
get rid of this last term?

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:25.402
Well, let's just use our theorem
by making a field redefinition.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.910
So I claim, after making
this field redefinition here,

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:41.327
that something
magical will happen,

01:02:41.327 --> 01:02:42.910
or something that
we want will happen.

01:02:51.874 --> 01:02:55.598
So we're going to integrate by
parts at will, which is often

01:02:55.598 --> 01:02:57.890
a convenient thing to do when
you're making these field

01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:58.800
redefinitions.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:09.150
So the term that's a 1/2 del mu
phi squared goes to /2 del mu

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:12.070
phi squared from the first term.

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:17.620
And then we pick
up a term that's

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.760
exactly in the form we want
to kill this extra term here

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.360
that was proportional
to del squared.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.590
And then there would be
order eta squared term.

01:03:31.113 --> 01:03:33.280
We have to consistently
make that field redefinition

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.490
everywhere, so do it at
the mass term as well.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.230
Well, let me write
out the eta term here,

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:56.005
just a eta squared term just
so you have all the terms.

01:03:56.005 --> 01:03:57.320
And we keep doing that.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.690
So we would do it also
for the lambda phi 4 term.

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:03.670
And we do it for
this phi 6 term.

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:07.920
And what you get out when we do
that is that you can write down

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.037
the Lagrangian.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.290
And you can group
together the terms.

01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:20.620
And that operator is gone.

01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:31.120
So it got cancelled by this guy.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.620
There's also these
other things that

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.870
are induced, but
really what that

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:38.740
does is it gives you
more terms that are phi 4

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.230
and more terms that are phi 6.

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.980
So you can really think
of the other terms

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.780
as just this guy here
is just adjusting

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.790
the constant of the phi 4.

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:49.630
So if it's no longer lambda,
it becomes a term that

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:52.600
has this extra piece to it.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.413
So I'm going to give you more
on this on the problem set.

01:04:55.413 --> 01:04:57.330
On the problem set,
you'll work out explicitly

01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:58.773
with these relations are.

01:04:58.773 --> 01:05:00.190
And I'll also, on
the problem set,

01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:01.660
let you think about
what's going on here when

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.827
you start considering loops.

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:13.160
In this particular example,
I'll ask you what's going on.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.160
I'll ask you to
show what's going on

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.910
and that it's still
OK when we have loops.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.910
So rather than explore this
example in more detail, which

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:26.460
I'm asking you to do
on your problem set,

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.950
let's state a more
precise definition

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:31.445
of what we're doing here.

01:05:31.445 --> 01:05:33.820
So that's the idea, that I
can make a field redefinition.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.195
When I make a
field redefinition,

01:05:35.195 --> 01:05:37.740
it's always going to do
something from the kinetic term

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.850
because the kinetic
term is there.

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:40.410
If there's a higher
order term that's

01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:42.760
proportional to
that kinetic piece,

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.850
then I can set up my
field redefinition

01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:45.990
in order to cancel it off.

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:55.002
So there's some things
that are important here.

01:05:55.002 --> 01:05:56.710
We have to make a
field redefinition that

01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:57.502
preserves symmetry.

01:05:57.502 --> 01:05:59.290
So if we make a field
redefinition that

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.900
breaks Lorentz
invariance, you can't

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:05.050
expect that you're going
to have a Lorentz invariant

01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:07.390
description after that.

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:11.730
And this statement
of f of 0 being 1

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:13.480
is the statement that
you have to preserve

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:17.740
the same one-particle states
before and after the field

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.628
redefinition.

01:06:19.628 --> 01:06:21.670
And such field redefinition
definitions basically

01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:33.860
allow the classical
equations of motion

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.400
to be used to
simplify the theory.

01:06:44.763 --> 01:06:46.680
I'll also put the proviso
in that it should be

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.970
a local quantum field theory.

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.663
And there is no
statement in this theorem

01:07:04.663 --> 01:07:06.580
that we have to stop
without considering loops

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.663
or without considering
propagators that can really

01:07:08.663 --> 01:07:13.600
make this argument hold even
beyond the level that we've

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:21.800
showed it, but with loops and
with propagators in as well.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.140
So there's some references.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.040
Again, I've posted
the one that is

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.940
closest to our discussion,
which is this paper by Arzt.

01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:39.950
There's also a classic
paper by Howard Georgi.

01:07:45.665 --> 01:07:47.790
The title of the paper is
"On-Shell Effective Field

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:48.290
Theory."

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.720
But I'll mostly follow the
notations in this paper

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.737
by Arzt in our discussion here.

01:08:00.737 --> 01:08:02.320
We'll go a little
further than he does

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.780
and elaborate a little
more, but it's basically

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.830
the same notation.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.000
OK.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.130
So how do we prove
something like that?

01:08:16.979 --> 01:08:19.319
Well, there are some
lessons in this proof.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:22.260
So it is something that's
worth going through.

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.930
So the way that I set
up my example up there,

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:31.060
I was power counting in eta.

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.899
Eta was 1 over lambda nu.

01:08:34.899 --> 01:08:40.189
So let me just write our
effective theory organized

01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:41.189
as in a series in eta.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.950
And let's consider
removing some operator that

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:53.010
looks like we should
be able to remove it

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:56.776
by making a field redefinition.

01:08:56.776 --> 01:08:58.859
And I'll try to be a little
bit generic about what

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:00.067
the form of that operator is.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.020
So I'll say it's covariant
derivative squared

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:11.700
acting on a scalar field just,
again, to make things simpler.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:13.350
But then multiply
by any function

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:16.850
of all the other fields in the
problem, and that's what t is.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.510
So phi is a complex scalar.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.229
And t is any
function that sort of

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.779
meets the needs of our
symmetries of the problem.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:40.010
And I'm just using
this other phi

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.020
as a shorthand for all the other
fields that we might consider.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:52.364
So that could be fermions,
other scalars, gauge fields.

01:09:55.952 --> 01:10:00.830
So let's say we want to get
rid of an operator like that.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.600
Oh, I should also
say that it's local.

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.990
All right, well,
let's write down

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:20.690
the generating function for
this theory, path integral

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:25.090
over the fields exponential.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:28.071
I'll regulate the problem with
dimensional regularization.

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:31.980
It's convenient.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.360
It preserves the cemeteries.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.890
That's something we want to do.

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:39.000
I write out some terms
in the Lagrangian.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:39.870
We won't need L2.

01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:41.840
We'll stop at L1.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.880
But the idea, if we
were to think about L2,

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.680
would be similar.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.961
And let me write it as adding
and subtracting something.

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:58.460
So I'll subtract td squared
phi and then add it back.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:01.390
So this is, if you
like, you can think

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.175
that L1 had a td squared phi.

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:04.800
And what I'm doing
here is removing it.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:11.130
So this is what we want.

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:11.860
OK.

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.860
So I'm just making it explicit,
but still writing things

01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:16.750
in terms of L1.

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:17.970
So there's that.

01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:21.430
And then there's the
coupling to the source.

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:26.860
And kind of in a generic
notation for each field phi k,

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:29.142
I have a source jk.

01:11:29.142 --> 01:11:31.910
And I truncate
everything at order eta.

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:39.102
OK, so that's my starting point.

01:11:39.102 --> 01:11:41.310
And then Green's functions
are obtained by functional

01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:42.840
derivatives with
respect to the j's.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.370
All right, so what
we're going to do,

01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:28.040
we're going make a change of
variable in the path integral.

01:12:32.803 --> 01:12:34.720
So of course, there's
additional complications

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.307
beyond what we were doing when
we were just thinking about it

01:12:37.307 --> 01:12:38.140
at Lagrangian level.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:45.910
There's basically two
additional complications.

01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:49.090
When we make a change a
variable in the path integral,

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:51.670
we're going to change
the Lagrangian.

01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:54.080
We're also going to
change the measure.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.808
So there could be a Jacobian.

01:12:55.808 --> 01:12:58.350
And we have to worry about what
happens with the source term.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.120
So let me just think of it as
a change of variable on the phi

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:09.620
dagger.

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.512
That's why I wanted to think
about a complex scalar,

01:13:18.512 --> 01:13:20.470
so I could think about
it as phi and phi dagger

01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:23.790
and just make the change of
variable in the phi dagger.

01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:27.760
But doing a real
scalar is just--

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.030
everything would go
through just as well.

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:37.030
So there's one term, which
is the phi dagger term where

01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:38.530
there's a Jacobian factor.

01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:42.180
So here's that promised
Jacobian for making

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.180
that change of variable.

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:53.560
Since the change of
variable is order eta,

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.540
it's not affecting L0.

01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:04.220
And I can write, in a
kind of nice notation,

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.300
the way that these eta
t terms from this change

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:08.410
of variable show up.

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:13.780
I can write them as taking
all the terms in L0,

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:16.120
looking for a phi dagger.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.320
That's the derivative.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.110
And then I replace
it by an eta t.

01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:24.590
Now, some places in L0, there
won't be just a straight phi

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:25.090
dagger.

01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:29.210
There might be a del
mu phi dagger, right?

01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:35.090
So I can take that
into account as well

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:37.090
by taking the functional
derivative with respect

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:38.790
to del mu phi dagger.

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:42.550
So any del mu phi dagger
term, if I integrate by parts,

01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:44.560
and then take the
derivative, you

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.500
can see why this
is the right form.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.200
Integration by parts is
what gives the minus sign.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:53.920
OK, so this finds all
the phi daggers in my L0

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.825
and sticks in an eta
t to order eta, which

01:14:58.825 --> 01:14:59.950
is the order we're working.

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:12.180
So anytime we had in eta,
which is these terms here,

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:15.288
then we would induce
something ordering eta square.

01:15:15.288 --> 01:15:17.580
And we're dropping those
terms, so that's not something

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.538
we have to worry about.

01:15:22.083 --> 01:15:23.250
And then there's the source.

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:26.070
And one of the sources
is 4 phi dagger.

01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:30.260
So for that particular
source, j phi dagger,

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:34.635
we induce a term
that's j phi eta t

01:15:34.635 --> 01:15:36.720
and then plus order eta squared.

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:52.500
So as I said, there's
three types of changes.

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.170
There's a change to the
Lagrangian, like in the example

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:57.360
we did before.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.906
There's a change to the
Jacobian through the Jacobian.

01:16:00.906 --> 01:16:03.285
And then there's a change
through the source.

01:16:06.377 --> 01:16:08.460
We have to worry about
whether any of these things

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:08.980
will matter.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.810
And basically, what the claim
is and where we're going

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:22.560
is considering the Lagrangian
is actually enough,

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.110
so that 2 and 3 are something
that we can kind of deal

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:26.180
with generically.

01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:28.680
And then we only have to check
that changing Lagrangian does

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.330
what we want.

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:34.420
So the claim is and
what we'll show,

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.100
without changing
the s matrix, we

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:46.858
can remove considering 2
and 3 rather generically.

01:16:52.128 --> 01:16:53.670
So we don't have to
worry about them.

01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:20.010
So some of this we'll
do next time, but let's

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:20.860
just start today.

01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:24.990
So let's first
look at del L, kind

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:29.610
of analogous to what we were
doing in our example before.

01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:41.860
So what we need is a
change of variable,

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.430
which is this one up here.

01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:47.310
And one restriction
on del L, which

01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:48.960
I mentioned as part
of the assumption,

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.910
was that this change of
variable should transform

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:58.830
in the same way as the original
phi dagger, so same Lorentz

01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:03.930
index structure, same gauge
index structure, et cetera.

01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:09.090
So that's kind of an
assumption that we said.

01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:10.680
In order to respect
the symmetries

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.010
and not mess them up with
our field redefinition,

01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:14.640
we assume that.

01:18:18.967 --> 01:18:20.300
So let's see what happens to L0.

01:18:32.565 --> 01:18:33.190
So there is L0.

01:18:36.597 --> 01:18:38.180
Maybe it has some
other terms as well,

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.797
but let's just
consider these pieces

01:18:41.797 --> 01:18:43.630
and ask what happens
with them since they're

01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:44.440
the relevant ones.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.080
So when I switch to prime
fields, I get that back again.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.380
I get m squared phi
dagger prime phi prime.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:03.165
And then I get some
new terms, which

01:19:03.165 --> 01:19:06.736
I integrate the covariant
derivative by parts,

01:19:06.736 --> 01:19:09.270
which I'm always able to do.

01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:12.070
It's nice what gauge
symmetry allows you to do.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:21.090
Then I get a term
like that, and I've

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:28.790
set things up so that this term
here does exactly what we need.

01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:31.490
I go back over here.

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:33.128
Those terms are cancelling.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.150
OK, so that's good.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.460
Now, you may be worried about
all the other terms that

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.060
get induced.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:04.898
You've removed something, but
you've induced a lot of stuff.

01:20:04.898 --> 01:20:06.440
But the point of
the effective theory

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.990
is that you already wrote down
every possible operator that

01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:11.150
was consistent with
the symmetries.

01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:13.600
So even if you induce
a bunch of other terms,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.650
they should be terms
you already have.

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:17.120
So all you're
doing with inducing

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.490
those other terms is shifting
the coefficients of the theory

01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.990
around.

01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:29.270
So L1 was already
complete in the sense

01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:33.020
of having all the terms
allowed by the symmetry.

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:36.730
And we've respected the
symmetry in the way we've

01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:38.371
made this field redefinition.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.623
So any terms that
I didn't write,

01:20:53.623 --> 01:20:55.290
which are all these
terms in the da, da,

01:20:55.290 --> 01:21:03.660
da prime are already
operators that

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.510
are present in the other
dots that I didn't write.

01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:10.520
So there were some dots here.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.640
There was some dots there.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.107
Even if I include
operators in those dots,

01:21:14.107 --> 01:21:16.690
the operators in these dots are
already present in those dots.

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:23.940
And so all I'm doing really
is shifting couplings.

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.150
OK.

01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:35.410
And that's same effective
theory just with a new name

01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:37.160
for the coefficients,
but we haven't fixed

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.330
the coefficients yet anyway.

01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:40.287
We're setting up our
effect effective theory.

01:21:40.287 --> 01:21:41.870
So whether we fix
the new coefficients

01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:45.190
or the old coefficients,
it's perfectly fine.

01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:59.550
So number two is the Jacobian.

01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:01.690
And I won't go all
the way through this,

01:22:01.690 --> 01:22:05.042
but what are we
going to do there?

01:22:05.042 --> 01:22:06.750
We're going to use
the same kind of trick

01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:09.270
that we did in gauge theory.

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:12.000
We're going to write the
Jacobian as a Lagrangian

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000
involving ghosts.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.610
So remember, when you
talked about Faddeev-Popov

01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:20.610
in some field theory
course prior to this one,

01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:25.590
you saw that you could write a
determinant as an exponential

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:27.105
involving some ghost fields.

01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:37.072
And the way that it worked
is that, up to a sign,

01:22:37.072 --> 01:22:39.030
whatever was sitting here
ended up just sitting

01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:40.080
between the ghost fields.

01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:01.931
So this is the ghost of
Faddeev-Popov procedure.

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:06.230
And we're going to just
use the same thing,

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:09.900
although [INAUDIBLE] we're
talking about scalar field

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.270
theory.

01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:23.700
So for us, we take this
guy, which is the Jacobian,

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.945
I'll take that derivative.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.540
And if you take
this thing, which

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:38.120
is sitting in
functional determinant,

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.240
and you turned it into
ghosts, then what you get

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:51.680
is a terminal Lagrangian
that looks like that.

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:04.850
So that looks like it
could do something.

01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:06.750
And I think I'll take
this up next time.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:09.350
It turns out that
this term is actually

01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:12.890
a ghost that has mass that's
of order the high scale, lambda

01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:14.830
nu.

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:17.300
And so, again, because of our
logic of the effective theory

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.058
only being valid
below that high scale,

01:24:20.058 --> 01:24:22.100
we can just effectively
integrate out this ghost.

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.190
And then it shifts
coefficients again,

01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:27.620
but I'll continue
with that next time.

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:31.760
So we have to figure out what to
do with this ghost Lagrangian.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.590
And we'll deal with
that next time.

01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:37.520
So any questions about
our halfway done proof?

01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:44.748
No?

01:24:44.748 --> 01:24:45.248
OK.

01:24:48.630 --> 01:24:50.090
So this is a pretty
powerful thing

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:52.070
that you can use in
effective field theory.

01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:54.300
And it also keeps
your eye on the ball

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:57.247
because it tells you
to think about physics.

01:24:57.247 --> 01:24:58.830
Because this leaves
physics invariant.

01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:00.800
It doesn't leave
something like if you--

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.858
say you had a theory that
had some long distance

01:25:02.858 --> 01:25:03.650
degrees of freedom.

01:25:03.650 --> 01:25:05.630
And it had some short
distance potential.

01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:08.060
The short distance
potential could be changed

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.140
by a field redefinition.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.660
It might not be
a physical thing.

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:14.900
It keeps your eye on the
ball as to what is physical

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.470
and how to talk about things.

GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.940
OK, Yeah, so let me tell
you my vision of what SMA is

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.290
and what we're supposed to do.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.540
Oh, before I do that, let
me do one more introduction.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.940
This is Professor Colin Sheppard
sitting on the other side.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.470
So he's the instructor
on the Singapore side.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.430
So basically, the four of us
are the team of instructors--

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.470
Professor Shepherd, Se
Baek, Pepe, and myself.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.420
And the class is not
quite an SMA class.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.790
It is not quite part of
the Singapore-MIT Alliance.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.290
It is part of
something else called

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.819
Singapore-MIT Alliance for
Research and Technology, SMART.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.830
And there is a very complicated
description of what SMART is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.570
and why we're
teaching the class.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.360
But the bottom line is
that this is more or less

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.900
the same class of optics
that has been taught

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.590
at MIT for the last 10 years.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010
It's actually an improved
version of the class.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.930
And it is being
broadcast to Singapore

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.510
at a very inconvenient time
for everybody involved,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.500
both in Singapore and for us.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.610
So I think it is fair.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.900
And so this is a summary,
a little bit of what I just

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.780
said about the instructors.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.310
We also have the two assistants.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.900
Primarily, you'll be
dealing with Kate,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.440
those of you who are here.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.080
She's my assistant at MIT.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.390
And for those of
you in Singapore,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.610
if you need sometimes
to turn in assignments,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.240
or desperately get hold
of me, or whatever,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.430
[? Deana ?] is your contact.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.940
She's in block S16.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.660
But anyway, Singapore
uses English

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.520
as an official
language, but as you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.050
will notice
throughout the class,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.110
there's some differences.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.235
For example, in Singapore,
we don't say "building."

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:10.340
We say "block."

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.950
So there's also some
other subtle differences

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.700
in Singapore English.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.440
OK, we will seldom give
any handouts in the class.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.280
Everything you need
is in the website.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.960
I have listed there
link over here.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.820
And when you log in there, you
will hit two, three things,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.320
actually.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.720
You'll see the syllabus
has been posted,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.180
a set of policies
has been posted,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.020
which says some obvious
things like don't copy,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.490
don't cheat on exams,
and stuff like that.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.372
And also, the first lecture
has also been posted.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.830
And I will tell you a little
bit about how we deal with the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.240
posted lectures and so on.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.380
And these are some
administrative details here

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.860
that I'm not sure if I want
to spend any time on those.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.713
For those of you
who are Course 2,

00:02:57.713 --> 00:02:59.130
if you're
undergraduate, graduate,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.910
it meets your restricted
elective requirement.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.480
If you're graduate,
it prepares you

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.570
for one of the qualifying exams
offered in the department.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.270
And a little bit about
what the class covers.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.770
So the class is
very introductory

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.990
about light phenomena and how
we design optical systems.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.610
And so this is a
bunch of pictures

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.405
I stole from various websites.

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:29.220
It shows a rainbow.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.880
It shows the galaxy
that we can capture

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.070
with advanced telescopes.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.992
It shows-- do I have a pointer?

00:03:38.992 --> 00:03:42.370
I'd better just
use this for now.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.680
Well, I guess I cannot use.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.380
Anyway, so it shows
a cell over here

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.822
captured with a microscope--

00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:50.655
which, I believe, is a
confocal microscopes.

00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:53.590
So it is Professor
Sheppard's expertise.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.990
And this is the picture of the
esophagus of a person captured

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.900
with an endoscopy.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.660
So they basically lower
the fiber bundle inside,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.120
down someone's throat.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.060
And using a technique called
optical coherence tomography--

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.310
it is an optical
imaging technique--

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.020
they capture the esophagus.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.329
And so finally,
what you see here

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.250
is, of course, an optical
disk, if you're not

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.510
familiar with those.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.530
And over here I believe
that's a holographic setup.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.360
It is a diffusion
screen, and this

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.010
is supposed to be a setup for
a three-dimensional display.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.320
When you look at it,
it creates the illusion

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.410
of a three-dimensional
projection.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.510
So if we had this, for
example, in Singapore,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.130
then I would, in
principle, appear

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.660
as if I'm standing over there.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.770
This, of course, is still at
the science fiction stage,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.340
but a lot of people
are working on it.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.990
And in fact, nowadays,
some companies,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.850
they offer a three
dimensional television

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.282
sets that you can buy for
a small additional amount.

00:04:57.282 --> 00:04:58.740
I think it's a few
hundred dollars.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.710
Samsung offers a 3D TV set.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.370
Anyway, so the
point of this slide

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.240
is that there's many
applications of optics that

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.430
are interesting in engineering.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.520
And, of course,
light phenomena are

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.630
interesting in their own right.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.475
So the class will try to
balance curiosity-based,

00:05:22.475 --> 00:05:23.850
more of a science
approach, where

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.060
we learn basic facts
about how light behaves,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.790
how it propagates, how
it interacts with matter,

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.270
and we'll balance those with
engineering applications that

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.760
are, presumably, of
interest to many of you.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.730
And for issues that have to
do with the expertise of both

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.090
of us, both of the
instructors, we

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.400
will concentrate most of
the applications on imaging.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.150
So we'll be dealing a lot
with things like microscopes

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.260
and telescopes primarily.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.500
These the major
imaging instruments.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.630
But we'll also cover some
other things for fun.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.060
For example, we'll talk
about the human eye.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.510
We'll describe its structure,
its biology, how it works--

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.510
not in great detail,
because this is, after all,

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.220
not a biology class.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.590
But just for fun,
because of the human eye

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.130
turns out to have some very
interesting optics inside it.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.380
And also, we'll
discuss very briefly

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.830
the eyes of insects, which, as
you can see from the picture

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.740
and you may already
know, they're very

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.870
different than the human eye.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.820
And we'll discuss a little
bit why they're different

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.490
and how each one
of them operates.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.970
And finally, some other
optical imaging systems that

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.770
look very surprising.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.770
This picture over
here is an instrument

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.920
called the Very Large
Array telescope, or VLA.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.410
It is located in Socorro, New
Mexico, here in the States.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.470
And it is composed
of 27 antennas.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.350
Each one of these little
white things is an antenna.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.280
It's about 27 meters tall, and
the diameter of the instrument,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.930
this branch over here,
is approximately--

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.740
well, it varies.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.080
I don't know what it was
when this picture was taken.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.520
But it can between 3 miles--

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.080
the diameter that is the size
of Cambridge, Massachusetts--

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.040
and 15 miles-- that is the
size of Washington, DC.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.210
So that is an instrument.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.085
An optical instrument,
if you can believe it,

00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:21.580
has the size of an
entire state in the US.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.450
And it is used to observe
very remote galaxies

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.310
with high resolution.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.650
So it falls a little bit
outside the scope of the class,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.690
because it uses it uses
statistical optics, which

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.390
we don't cover over here,
but we may mention it

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.720
in passing a little bit later.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.320
So this is, of course,
among other things

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.780
that you may have seen.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.730
But actually, it cannot be done.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.930
This is Luke Skywalker.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.180
I'm old enough to
have been around when

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.700
this movie came out, Star Wars.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.940
And I just want to point out
that a lightsaber can actually

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.020
not be made.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.530
It is one of these
impossible things

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.390
that you can see
in science fiction,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.920
but it violates some
physical principles.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.470
So unfortunately, it
cannot be made, but anyway,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.050
it is still fun to think about.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.460
OK, so I think I covered
the class objectives.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.740
And we have to balance
here physical intuition

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:27.080
with engineering
understanding and design.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.300
So we'll cover the fundamentals
in pretty good detail,

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.100
and we'll also cover
some applications

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.710
in pretty good detail to
the degree that we can

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.620
within the scope of a semester.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.100
So we'll try to be to be
very careful about that,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.348
how we balance the two.

00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:44.890
Sometimes the two
can compete, right?

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.140
So we'll try to balance the
competition between basics

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.870
and application.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.190
And also, we'll cover
some applications.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.170
And I mentioned,
primarily, we'll

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.540
deal with microscopy and, also,
some topics such as telescopes.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.820
There are some other topics
that I will not really

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.030
cover in class, like
optical data storage.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.060
But as I will
mention in a second,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.380
there is class projects that
are like mini research projects

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.850
that you will do
later in the semester.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.640
So you're welcome
to pick topics out

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.480
of those if you are interested.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.810
Some basics about the
sort of prerequisites.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.890
This is the basic math
and physics that you need.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.640
I think most of you have
covered these topics in your--

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.310
at least on the MIT side,
you covered those in places

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:40.470
like 18.03, and 2.004, and 8.02.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.258
So I assume that all of
you who are undergraduates

00:09:44.258 --> 00:09:45.300
have taken those classes.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.370
And there is it two textbooks.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.790
So the class is a little bit
expensive, sorry about that.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.170
There's two textbooks,
[? Hecht ?] and Goodman.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.290
We'll be using,
throughout the first half

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.840
of the semester,
mostly [? Hecht, ?]

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.540
and then, throughout the
second half, mostly Goodman.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.170
But the textbooks--
we did not really

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.330
cover the sequence
of the textbooks.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.810
You should use them
primarily as a reference.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.370
All of this stuff is posted,
by the way, on the website.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:23.300
So you don't need to
write down the book names.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.570
But anyway, so the
textbooks are reference.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.870
Your primary sources are the
notes and what you do in class.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.880
And then you can go
back and read them.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.550
And there some
other texts that are

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.590
useful if you have access
to them through the library,

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.728
and so on.

00:10:38.728 --> 00:10:40.145
Some other
administrative details.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.830
This is the grade distribution
for the undergraduate class,

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.620
2.71--

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.740
30 homeworks, 30
quizzes, 40 final.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.360
We have eight homeworks.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.860
And the homeworks are due--

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.540
actually, they are due nine
days after they're posted.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.970
So you have plenty of
time to work on them.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.250
And also, Pepe
will strategically

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.780
schedule his office hours so
that you can ask questions

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.430
before the homework.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.600
And we'll see how to do the
office hours for the Singapore

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.100
students.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.800
We'll work something
out when I get there.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.510
Anyway, the first homework
is not due until February 18,

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.410
so there's no need to
panic about that yet.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.940
And the homeworks will also
be posted on their website.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.610
And the 7.10 is very
similar, but the 7.10,

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.230
the graduate version,
also has a project.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.430
So the project also counts
for a significant portion

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.095
of the grade.

00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:46.470
And I think I
already mentioned--

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.678
this is like a mini research
project where you either

00:11:48.678 --> 00:11:53.760
give a short lecture on a
hot topic in current optics

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.190
research, or you
pick your own topic,

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.150
and you do a little
bit of calculation

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:08.040
or some simple thinking.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.750
It's supposed to
be a class topic.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.020
It's not a [INAUDIBLE] or
anything, but like a mini

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.410
research topic.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.950
In fact, there are a couple
of people already asking me

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.830
if they can do something related
to their current research.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.310
And that's perfectly fine,
but you have to sell it,

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.890
because this is a
team project, right?

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.410
So if you want to do something
related to you research,

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.100
you need to recruit
two, three, four,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.810
other colleagues from the class
and form a team around it.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:34.560
So it's up to you.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.160
And I certainly
encourage, actually,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.070
research-related
projects in the class.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.860
So this is only for 710.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.190
If you are enrolled in 701
and would like to be involved

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:52.530
in this, you are welcome
to do it, but to be fair,

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.060
you cannot get credit.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.890
However, you can
be undergraduate

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.380
and enroll in the graduate
version of the class.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.680
So for example, if
you are planning

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.440
to stay on at MIT
for graduate school,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.660
that's not a bad idea,
because the class is H-level,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.470
so it will already count you
towards some of your credits

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.280
later.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.225
So anyway, that's something
that we can discuss separately,

00:13:14.225 --> 00:13:16.610
if you like.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.538
And finally, the ugly side,
we do have quizzes, and exams,

00:13:19.538 --> 00:13:20.330
and all this stuff.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.350
I hate them myself.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.790
I hated them when
I was a student.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.710
But it's a little bit
like the dentist, right?

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.920
In You hate it, but
you have to do it.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.030
So this is the distribution
of the quizzes and the final.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.790
One important thing I would
like to emphasize, which is,

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.120
I always deliver a small
sermon when I start a class,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.720
and that has to do with
asking the question.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.590
I really think that you get the
most benefit not from listening

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.610
to me while I lecture,
especially at 7:00 AM,

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.507
you know, when, including
me, you're all sleepy.

00:13:55.507 --> 00:13:57.132
And I will be sleepy
in Singapore, too,

00:13:57.132 --> 00:13:58.460
because it's going to be late.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.710
Anyway, so you don't get the
most benefit out of that.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.470
You don't get the most benefit
by reading your book alone

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.010
at home in your bed and so on.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.840
The most benefit
you get is actually

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.800
from participating in
discussions in the classroom--

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.310
with your peers, with the
instructors, everybody.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:23.330
So I would like to encourage you
to not hesitate for any reason

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.700
whatsoever.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.540
If there's something
that bothers you,

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.060
some question, something
you're not understanding,

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:34.280
something you're uncertain,
or whatever, please do ask.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.050
There's no reason to be shy.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:45.017
Very often people--
myself included--

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.100
if you're in a big audience,
you may be reluctant.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.090
Because you say well, gee, what
if my question is not good,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.460
or what if I embarrass myself?

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.620
So there is no such thing, OK?

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.710
If a question pops
up in your mind,

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.890
the probability is very high
that someone else in the class

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.880
has the exact same question.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.960
And this person is
equally shy as you

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.700
are to ask that question.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.350
So you do yourself
a favor, and you

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.780
do many of your other
classmates a favor,

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.620
if you just interrupt me and ask
a question so please do that.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.090
And also, on my side, I will
treat all questions equally,

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.450
and I will do my best to
answer every possible question.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.460
Sometimes I might
not answer a question

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.910
if I don't know
the answer myself.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.640
This happens very
often in my classes

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.530
and, I think, in
everybody's classes.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.012
Always, someone can
come up with a question

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:35.220
that I don't know the answer.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.280
If that happens I'll tell you,
sorry, I'll get back to you

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.530
in the next lecture, right?

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.640
Anyway I think, it will
take a few lectures.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.110
Usually, in my classes, it takes
a few lectures for the students

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.618
to overcome the threshold.

00:15:49.618 --> 00:15:51.660
But I think it becomes
very productive, actually,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.670
when you engage in
discussions in the class.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.660
And yeah, don't worry
about falling behind

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.160
on the syllabus or anything.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.980
It is much more important
that we learn well what

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.320
we do learn than that we
cover a lot of material

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.100
and, in the end, nothing
has been left in your minds.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.320
So one of the benefit of
discussions, especially

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.940
arguments, if we get into
an argument about something,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.180
then everybody will
remember, right?

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.210
Because it's kind of fun to
watch people argue a topic.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:22.950
So yeah, by all means,
please interrupt and ask.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.040
And we don't have recitations,
but as you noticed,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.800
the class has a slightly
unusual schedule.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.840
You have a two-hour
lecture on Wednesday

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.910
and one hour on Monday.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.510
So we'll structure the syllabus
so that most of the material

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:41.190
is covered on Wednesday and most
of the examples, and practice,

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.460
and so on, they
happen on Mondays.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.790
So this is how we deal
with the recitation issue.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.250
And, of course, there's
also the office hours.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:17:00.050
And-- oh, yeah,
and sometimes, we

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.930
cover some mathematical
topics that some of you

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.790
may have forgotten or may
not be very up to speed with,

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.770
especially Fourier transforms.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:15.310
So when the time comes, we
might do a special lecture

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.790
in the evening, MIT time.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.700
And if we need to do
that in Singapore,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.210
we'll do it, actually,
individually with me,

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.290
sort of in my office
or something like that.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.790
Those of you at
MIT, you'll probably

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.680
do it with Se Baek or Pepe, come
back one evening after 7:00 PM,

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.578
so we obey Institute policies,
and do a math review.

00:17:35.578 --> 00:17:37.620
So this may happen once
or twice in the semester,

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.980
especially when it comes
to Fourier transforms.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.700
Because my experience.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.100
You need the
logistics of Fourier

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.010
transforms in order to
follow a significant fraction

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.190
of the class.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.750
So if you are not really up to
speed with your basic Fourier

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:01.480
from wherever you learned things
18.03 or 2.671, and so on,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.550
we'll do that for you.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:11.150
OK, this is a list of topics
that we'll cover in the class.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.970
You can browse them
in the website.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.590
I will not go through
each topic now,

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.640
because I don't want
to give it away.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.060
I want to leave an
element of surprise.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.270
But basically, the class is
divided into geometrical optics

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.250
and wave optics.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:32.570
And we'll start with geometrical
optics for about four weeks,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.270
and then we'll move
to wave optics.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.050
So the difference, it really
has to do with approximations

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.703
of when we deal with
light phenomena,

00:18:42.703 --> 00:18:44.120
it's actually very
complicated how

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.000
light interacts with matter,
and how it propagates, and so.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.640
It is really a
horrendous problem.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.950
But over the years--
over the centuries,

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.030
actually-- people have come up
with different approximations

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.800
of progressive accuracy.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.330
So geometrical optics is
the simplest approximation

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:03.170
that gives you very simple
formulas, very simple math,

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:07.280
and actually describes light
quite well up to a point.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.710
So we'll do that
first, and then we'll

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.160
graduate to wave optics,
which is a little bit more

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.800
involved mathematically,
but it also

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:21.380
gives better approximations
about the propagation of light.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.750
And then, finally, in
the very last few--

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.590
probably in the last lecture,
and only if we have time--

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.070
we'll cover a topic called
sub-wavelength optics, which is

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.510
an even better approximation.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:37.790
But that is actually pretty much
impossible to do analytically.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.890
So one has to go onto
a computer and do

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:44.090
numerical solution of a nasty
set of coupled differential

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:45.000
equations.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.230
So we'll do that not in
the computational way,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.840
but we'll cover some of
the related phenomena

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.170
and what this
approximation gives.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.650
But roughly, anyway, the
class is structured according

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.490
to these approximations.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.020
Any questions so far?

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.910
And if think of a question, you
can also interrupt me, right?

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.998
You're always welcome.

00:20:18.998 --> 00:20:20.040
Well, and one more thing.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.560
Yes, I'll tell you the one
more thing, perhaps, later.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.798
Let me start with a
little bit of history.

00:20:29.798 --> 00:20:31.840
This, of course, is not
the subject of the class,

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.790
but it's kind of fun to do.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.320
I used to start my classes with
a joke that not everybody got.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.090
I used to start by
saying that optics

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.800
is the most ancient science.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.240
Not the most
ancient profession--

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.480
that's something else--

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.820
but is the most ancient science.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.420
And I think the reason
is because humans

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.330
are very visual animals.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:21:00.160
Our vision, for those of us who
are lucky enough to have it,

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.460
our vision is one of them
most dominant census.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.240
So people got interested in
phenomena involving light

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.440
relatively early on
in the early ages.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.870
And this probably happened
across civilizations--

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:19.340
Chinese, Egyptian,
Western Greek, and so on.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.960
But as it happens, the Greeks
were the only ones to publish.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.510
They were open about what
they were discovering.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.060
The Egyptians and the
Chinese, the priests

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.690
kept everything under control.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.440
So we don't know much
about what they did.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.560
But from what we've
discovered, archaeologists

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.710
have discovered in ancient
tombs and so on, they also

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:39.940
knew quite a bit about light.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.300
Of course, the Greeks
made the major mistake--

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.570
so Greek science
was very interesting

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.730
because it was the flip
side of modern science.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:22:01.570
The Greeks had the attitude
that you can understand nature

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.970
just by thinking.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.950
So the Greeks actually
discouraged experiment.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:12.450
Strangely enough, this tradition
has followed the Greek psyche,

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.950
because if you
look at the faculty

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.110
in the mechanical
engineering department,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:21.030
there's a lot of Greeks, or
professors of Greek origin,

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.870
and lots of them
are theoreticians.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.590
Anyway, I'm just joking.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.480
But anyway, the
ancient Greeks, they

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.110
have this attitude that you
don't need to do experiment.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.070
In fact, you must
not do experiment.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.790
You have to understand
everything by thought.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.383
So because of that, they came
up with some strange ideas.

00:22:39.383 --> 00:22:41.050
So for example, the
Greeks, they thought

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:46.210
that when you look at something,
your eyes emit some substance,

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.090
which they called simulacra.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:54.940
And this absence is their
thought of what light is.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.610
So I look at you, I
transmit a substance.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.610
The substance comes back to
me, and that's how I see you.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.930
Which is, of course, a
very bizarre, bizarre way

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:03.430
of thinking.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.500
But anyway, that's
what they thought.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:11.050
And it was the Arabs, much
later in the 10th century or so,

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.917
who read the Greek script.

00:23:13.917 --> 00:23:16.250
And they said, well, that
doesn't make any sense at all.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:17.625
So the Arabs, for
the first time,

00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:19.840
thought, well, it must
be the other way around.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.620
There must be light sources,
like the sun, or a fire, or--

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.900
that's about it at the time.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.090
They didn't have
light bulbs yet.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:32.590
So it must be that they emit
something that is called light,

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.156
and that's how we see.

00:23:34.156 --> 00:23:36.920
So it took us about
1,000 years, I guess,

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.520
to resolve that question.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.100
And also, the Arabs did a lot
of the very first basic work

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.600
in optics.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.810
For example, Snell's Law,
the law of refraction

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.030
that I will cover
in a little bit,

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.740
the Arabs discovered it first.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:59.470
And then, much later,
another 400 years later,

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.010
Descartes, he did two things.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.110
He put the basic
foundations of science--

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:11.300
Descartes, you may
know this, Descartes

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.000
was the first
philosopher, I should say,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.890
who flipped the
Greek point of view.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.160
And he said that it's
actually the other way around.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.070
Science must follow experiment.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.800
Instead of just thinking about
nature and explaining it,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.570
he said that it's the
other way around--

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.000
science must be
driven by observation.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.060
So we observe something, we
create experimental conditions

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.080
to test it, and then we
come up with a theory

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.050
that tries to explain the
observation-- not the other way

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:39.750
around.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:46.067
And of course, modern science
still follows that principle.

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.150
At least hopefully, right?

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.910
Because there have
been occasions

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.560
of cheating and so on.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.170
You probably see
those in newspapers.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.060
I think there was
a guy who invented,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.930
who sort of created
data at HP Labs.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.180
Was it HP Labs?

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.730
Anyway, so there are some
people who violated principle.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.500
But hopefully, 99.9999%
of us will actually

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.500
follow Descartes, right?

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.820
We make an observation,
we report it faithfully,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.440
and then we try to explain
it to the best we can

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.020
and in the simplest
way that we can.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.290
That's the scientific method.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.650
But also, Descartes, as it
turns out, worked on optics.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.370
And he also derived
Snell's Law in his own way.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.550
And there's something called
the Descartes Sphere, which

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.650
was invented
independently by the Arabs

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.260
in the 11th century
or 12th, I forget--

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:41.050
Ninth, actually--
and then Descartes

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:46.710
reinvented it about
400 or 500 years later.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.635
Then, the next major advance
in optics came from Newton--

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.720
actually, Newton and
Huygens, who tried to explain

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.790
light in two different ways.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.650
Newton was of the
opinion that light

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.970
is a bunch of particles
that travel in air.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.890
And he tried to explain various
phenomena like refraction

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.790
from a prism, and so
on, based on this idea.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.830
Huygens thought that
light is a wave very

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.380
similar to water waves.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.690
They did not know about--

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:21.042
I believe Newton also
postulated that sound is a wave.

00:26:21.042 --> 00:26:22.500
But for some reason,
Newton thought

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.550
that light is not a wave.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.950
In fact, the two of them fought.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.780
I don't know if the fought over
it, but they disagreed over it.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.960
But I guess because
Newton was more famous--

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.090
he was a professor, a Lucasian
professor at Cambridge--

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:43.060
so Newton's view
actually prevailed

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.470
for several years, prevailed.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.080
And the particle
theory of light was

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.590
dominant until about
a century later

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.410
when people experimentally--

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.540
again, here comes the
scientific method--

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.620
people experimentally observed
phenomena like interference

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.900
that would only be described
if light were a wave.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.240
So the particle theory
got a big hit then,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.290
because it could not explain
diffraction, interference,

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.370
and so on, and so forth.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.760
But yet, people were observing
them in the laboratory.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.620
Of course, now, after
one more century, people

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.230
discovered that, guess what?

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.790
Both theories are correct.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.520
With quantum mechanics,
light can be thought of as

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.490
both as particle and as a wave.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.640
And in fact, Einstein and
some other scientists--

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.480
Schrodinger, Planck, and so on--

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.520
they reconciled the
two points of view.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.940
Not perfectly-- there
still some puzzling aspects

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.770
of the quantum theory of light.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.330
But I think
nowadays, most people

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.010
are comfortable with
the idea that you

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.940
can use both approaches to
describe light phenomena.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.340
You simply select
the ones that best

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.670
suits your approximations
and your conditions

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.970
at any given moment.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.420
So for example, if
a particle approach

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.730
is sufficient to describe the
phenomenon, then you use it.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.570
And of course, there's also,
typically-- or, not typically,

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.730
always--

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:10.660
let me restate.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.100
There had better be an
equivalent wave description

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.620
of whatever phenomenon
you're describing,

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.320
but it may be more
complicated, right?

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.980
So in that case, you
use particle theory.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.980
Or the other way around.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.410
If it is easier to describe
something as a wave,

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:30.513
you opt for the
wave description.

00:28:30.513 --> 00:28:32.930
So of course, in this class,
we don't cover quantum optics

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:33.430
at all.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.050
Professor Shapiro in the
electrical engineering

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:39.110
department offers a
class in quantum optics.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.630
And I suppose that there
is also a quantum optics

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.080
glass for those of you
who are interested.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.250
It's a very elegant topic.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:54.260
So the other major
advance in optics

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.700
came in the middle
of the last century,

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:04.160
when the laser was
invented and the technique

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.780
called holography called
holographic was invented.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.420
Not because holography is
somehow dominant in practice.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.345
I mean, you see holograms
typically in museums.

00:29:14.345 --> 00:29:15.640
It's no big deal.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.530
But holography turned out
to be a very interesting

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.800
mathematical way of
looking at optics.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.510
Now, that really
had a major impact

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:28.520
in the subsequent development
of optical science.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.800
So for this reason,
both of these inventions

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.260
led to Nobel prizes.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.320
They were very major advances
in the field of light.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:43.150
And especially after the
invention of the laser,

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.460
optical science
had a huge impact

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.630
on everyday applications.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.070
If you think about
devices you use

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.750
in your everyday life, every
time you pick up a telephone

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.262
or you use the internet,
there's typically-- especially

00:29:56.262 --> 00:29:58.720
if you use it long-distance--
there's some optics involved.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.040
Because the signals propagate
through optical fibers,

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.530
at least in part of the
telecommunications network.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.950
If you're unlucky
enough to have surgery,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.560
there's many kinds
of laser surgery.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.470
Lots of clinical
medical diagnosis

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.840
is done using
high-end microscopes,

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.840
including confocal microscopes,
optical coherence tomographers,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.920
and so on, and so forth.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.700
These are all
commercial instruments.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.620
There's applications
in industry--

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.820
for example, laser cutting,
laser welding, laser metrology

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:39.990
that is used in high-end
precision engineering

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.010
applications.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.040
And of course, finally, every
time you pick up a computer,

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.520
the chips that are all made
using optical lithography,

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.590
which is a really highly
sophisticated form of optical

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.580
imagine.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.000
And I use the term "optical"
here in a very general way.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.440
Most of it is really optical.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.670
We use light.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.430
In some really extreme,
high-end applications,

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.290
they use electron lithography.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.940
But still electrons, behave like
light when it comes to this,

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.500
to this scale.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.740
So basically, the same equations
that we use to describe light,

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.050
they use them to describe
imaging by electrons.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:26.930
So that is really a huge, huge,
huge domain of application.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.450
It still remains a very
active scientific field.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.340
So if you look at the
list of Nobel Prizes--

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.080
this is a very incomplete list
that I compiled from the Nobel

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.970
website--

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:42.320
even that latest Nobel
Prize that was awarded--

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.740
in chemistry, actually; it
was in the field of optics--

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.010
these fellows, they
invented something,

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:53.675
green fluorescent
protein, which is--

00:31:53.675 --> 00:31:55.880
I may embarrass myself
now, because I don't

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.200
understand the biology of it,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.020
But my very simple
understanding is

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.920
that they can genetically
program this protein

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.020
to get into some animals' DNA.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.430
So they basically create animals
that have this protein embedded

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.340
in their genes, and
then these proteins

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:18.655
can also be designed to turn
itself on or off depending

00:32:18.655 --> 00:32:19.780
on happens with the animal.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.610
For example, if the animal
is exposed to a disease,

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.550
or if it is exposed to a
certain chemical agent,

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.100
or anyway, whatever
is of interest

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.790
to the particular
biological experiment,

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:35.330
it sounds kind of funny, but
the animal becomes fluorescent.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.330
Or more interestingly,
certain parts

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.110
of the tissue of the
animal-- for example,

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:44.510
the liver, or some tissue of
interest-- becomes fluorescent.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.230
So then you can pump the
animal with a laser beam,

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.660
you can measure the
fluorescence that is coming out

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.670
of the animal's
tissue, and then you

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.940
can derive conclusions about
what happened to the animal.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.830
So this is a fantastic way of
studying genetics, studying

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.960
diseases, studying a number of
different and very important

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.400
biological phenomena.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.780
So for that reason,
these fellows

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.810
were awarded the Nobel Prize.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.600
And actually, many
people, including myself--

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.210
at least not yet, but I'm
sure in Colin's lab, already,

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:24.860
we'll use animals
that are genetically

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.940
modified with this--

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.700
It's called GFC, green
fluorescent protein--

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.980
to study various
biological phenomena.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.550
Now it is a very commonly
used technique in microscopy.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.780
So this was the most recent
optics-related Nobel Prize.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.810
There's a bunch of others.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.825
My favorite is actually--

00:33:43.825 --> 00:33:44.900
where is it?

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.430
This one.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:51.010
In 1997, this was a
given for optical traps.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.640
So an optical trap
is actually a way

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.860
to move particles
by using light.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.370
It's a very surprising
thing, because none

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:02.210
of us in everyday life will
experience mechanical force

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.680
from a light beam.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.027
But in actuality, there is one.

00:34:05.027 --> 00:34:06.860
If you are sitting in
the back of the light,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.090
you are feeling the force.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.100
This once is very weak.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.370
It's in the range of
femtonewtons, typically--

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.550
a really tiny, tiny force.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:18.020
But we're also very big, so the
force is not enough to move us.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.300
But if you're really tiny--
like a cell, for example--

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.730
the force, especially if
you design the optical right

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.860
with a very highly
focused beam, you

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.860
can boost that
force to the range

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.770
of, perhaps, a few piconewtons.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.010
Not really that's a very
high force, but anyway,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.989
in that order of
magnitude, it can

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.690
be enough to actually
move a particle.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:41.520
So you can make, you can apply
mechanical forces using light.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.719
So this was another Nobel Prize.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:48.110
So anyway, the reason
I'm bringing this up

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.270
is because this is a
very exciting field.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.469
At least-- well, I'm partial,
because I work on it,

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.380
but it's a very exciting field.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.970
People come up with clever,
crazy inventions all the time.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.810
And many, many of
these inventions have--

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.570
usually, they have
a very high impact.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:11.450
And so it is interesting to
see both sides of the coin,

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.730
both the science
side of the coin

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.820
that is purely
curiosity-driven, and very often

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.190
people in government
question it,

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.410
because they say, well,
why are you guys doing

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.940
all this crazy stuff?

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.100
Who cares about optical forces?

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.900
But of course, these
people are so excited,

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.310
because history shows
that most of the time,

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.650
these curiosity-driven
discoveries,

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:37.040
they end up having a huge
impact in everyday life.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:44.540
Some crazy persons-- they
were French, American,

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.010
and Chinese-American, right?

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.680
Three crazy persons
thought about focusing

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.180
light to move particles.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.030
Then, all of a sudden, this
is used in biological research

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.940
to try to understand
diseases like malaria.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.470
I don't know if any of Professor
Subra Suresh's students

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:03.410
are here, but one of my
colleagues, Subra Suresh,

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.840
studied malaria using
this technique that

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.530
won the Nobel Prize in 1997.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:13.350
So it is our duty as
engineers, or scientists,

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.650
or whatever the case
may be to emphasize

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.750
to the people in
government and politics

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.450
that yes, there is value
in fundamental science

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.550
when they bash it
and they say that,

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:27.820
what, you guys are playing
in laboratories, and so on.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.380
OK, so I went onto my tirade.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:34.288
And any questions?

00:36:38.212 --> 00:36:39.170
AUDIENCE: I've got one.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:40.212
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

00:36:40.212 --> 00:36:42.200
AUDIENCE: So I think I'm on.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.015
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yes, can you hear him?

00:36:45.015 --> 00:36:45.560
OK.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.185
AUDIENCE: It says
that you can describe

00:36:47.185 --> 00:36:50.640
how an electron beam images
in a similar way as optics.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.500
But electrons
interact with matter.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.428
So how does light
interact with matter?

00:36:54.428 --> 00:36:55.470
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:56.490
So we will cover that.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.880
Of course, they interact in
very different ways, right?

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.920
The fundamental difference is
that electrons are fermions,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.400
so they cannot really
be in the same state.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.090
Photons are bosons, so they can
actually be in the same state.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.360
So what I really should
have said-- and thank you

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.600
for pointing it out--
is that in free space,

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.340
they're described by
the same equations.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.380
Of course, when they
get inside matter,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.062
their behavior is
quite different.

00:37:27.062 --> 00:37:28.520
But again, for
example, if you look

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.220
at the electrons that go
ballistically through matter,

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.880
they experience an effect that
is very similar to refraction.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.350
So you can describe--

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.550
you still see Snell's
Law, and so on.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.720
But of course, you see
these additional phenomena,

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.930
like all the electrons, which
you don't see in light beams.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.100
So you're absolutely right.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.480
There's some
significant differences

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.950
which are very important.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:56.260
But there's also some
very, very dominant

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.970
and prominent commonalities.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.100
The same goes for
light and sound.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:06.585
And our department recently
merged with ocean engineering.

00:38:06.585 --> 00:38:07.960
And in ocean
engineering, there's

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.270
a lot of professors
who do acoustics.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.620
So as a result, I
started sitting in--

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.110
at the beginning,
out of curiosity,

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.360
I started sitting in a couple
of the acoustic classes.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:21.580
And also, this year, I sat in
the doctoral exam in acoustics.

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.730
And I was surprised to
see the same terms--

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:28.420
diffraction, refraction,
Snell's law, waveguiding,

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.000
all of these things, they
happen in acoustics as well.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.220
So you could say the
same thing about sound.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.130
To some approximation,
sound effects

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.120
are identical to optics,
identical to light diffraction.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.120
But there's also cases of
interaction between sound

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.120
and matter that is radically
different than interaction

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.710
between light and matter.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.535
For example, I think it
is impossible for sound

00:38:50.535 --> 00:38:52.000
to ionize matter.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.650
Light can ionize matter.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.460
I think sound has to be pretty
darn strong to ionize, right?

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:02.230
So there are significant
differences, but also some very

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.690
convenient commonalities.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.800
So all of a sudden, by studying
one field, all of a sudden,

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.100
you discover that you can
understand quite a bit

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.608
about a different field.

00:39:10.608 --> 00:39:11.650
So that's kind of useful.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.765
Any other questions?

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.960
Let's start by saying a few
things about what is light.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.260
So light is actually
a form of energy.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.235
Really that's the simplest--
that's the only correct way

00:39:34.235 --> 00:39:35.450
to describe it.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.820
It is a form of energy
that is transmitted

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.160
as an electromagnetic wave.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.170
That's a quite
correct description.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:46.490
But as I said before, you can
think of it either as particles

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.360
or as waves.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.220
So the particles are
officially called photons.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:58.940
And what is a photon is actually
not an easy thing to describe.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.070
Various scientists
over the centuries

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.860
fought over the
definition of a photon.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.930
And we certainly don't
want to go into quantum

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.880
optics in this class.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.150
So we'll think of photons
in a very simple-minded way,

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.120
as bullets that carry energy--

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:20.630
a very small amount of energy,
as we'll see in a second--

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:25.020
and they follow
certain trajectories.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.860
So the trajectories
we'll call rays.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:32.250
And I will describe these
rays a little bit later.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:36.380
Now, the photon, one thing that
the photons do have in common

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.340
is their speed.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.310
It is, of course, the speed
of light, which, in a vacuum,

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:46.080
is the familiar 3 times 10
to the 8 meters per second.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.060
How much energy they carry?

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:53.230
Well, the amount of energy is
given by Planck's constant,

00:40:53.230 --> 00:41:00.360
which is a very small amount of
6.6 10 to the minus 34 joules

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.920
times second, and then
multiplied by a frequency.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.490
OK, so the frequency
is, of course, hertz.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:07.710
So the units work out.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:12.570
The product over
there is energy.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.680
What is the frequency?

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.380
Where does it come about?

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.900
Well, to really justify the
presence of a frequency there,

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.130
I have to see it.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.500
I have to go, actually,
to the other way

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.430
of describing light, which is
as an electromagnetic wave.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:31.200
And of course, the name
"wave" implies some sort

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.120
of oscillatory motion.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.420
So the horizontal axis
here is the direction

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.050
of the propagation of the light.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:41.550
So the light is propagating
from the left to the right.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.140
What is the vertical axis?

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.050
The vertical axis is an
electric field, actually.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.870
It is the same spot that you
have in a capacitor where

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:50.460
you charge it.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.020
So it is convenient to describe
it as an electric field.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.920
You can also describe
it is a magnetic field--

00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.690
the same stuff that you see when
you have a refrigerator magnet.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.980
You can put either quantity
over here in the vertical axis

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.470
because there are a couple
of electromagnetic fields by,

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.500
as the name suggests, it
is a coupled oscillation

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.973
of electric and magnetic fields.

00:42:12.973 --> 00:42:14.640
For now, let's stick
to electric fields.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.030
In this class, I will say very
little about magnetic fields.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:22.110
When I describe light as
a wave, I will by default

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.960
refer to an electric field, OK?

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.270
So light is an electric
field that oscillates

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.370
as a function of position.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.870
And of course, a
wave is not static.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:38.590
You, all of you, have seen
waves in the Singapore

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.930
Harbor, the Singapore River.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.510
You cannot see waves on the
Charles right now because it is

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.570
frozen.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.630
But during more
normal times, you

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:47.910
can see waves on the Charles.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:52.660
So you know a wave implies
both a spatial structure--

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.430
if you look at the
picture of a wave,

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:58.690
you see oscillatory
in the picture--

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:01.510
but also time, because
a wave travels in time.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.570
So in the context here,
the time valuable--

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.540
well, OK, I'll
[INAUDIBLE] that back.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.880
But after some time
lapse, the wave

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.270
will actually move a
little bit further, OK?

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:17.080
So this is the sense of
the wave propagation.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.140
So since you have an
oscillatory quantity here,

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.920
the period is called
the wavelength--

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.900
the period in the space domain.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:30.820
So the distance between two
peaks of the electric field

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.520
oscillator there would
define it as a wavelength.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.260
And it is related to the
frequency, this quantity that

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.470
enters in the particle
description of light uses

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.030
this equation here.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.040
The speed of light
equals the product

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.765
of the wavelength
times the frequency.

00:43:48.765 --> 00:43:50.150
So we'll do the
calculation here.

00:43:57.625 --> 00:43:59.000
Well, before we
go calculation, I

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.740
need to say something
about what is--

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.990
I think I did something I
was not supposed to do here.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:09.760
But anyway, the blackboard
went up by itself.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:14.460
But this classroom
is highly automated.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:19.850
So I guess there's some
things that cannot be done.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:24.340
OK, so what are the
typical wavelengths?

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.820
So the electromagnetic spectrum
actually spans all wavelengths

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.580
from sort of infinitely
long, or kilometers long,

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.270
to very, very short,
down to nanometers.

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:42.560
The visible light, the light
that we see with our own eyes,

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:48.860
is in this range over
here between approximately

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:58.523
650 nanometers or so and
450 nanometers or so.

00:44:58.523 --> 00:44:59.440
So what's a nanometer?

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.750
It's 10 to the minus 9 meters.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.620
So let's pick a
convenient number here.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.475
Let's say lambda equals--

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.640
how about I do this here?

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.400
OK, this is the wavelength.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.265
So our other question
is c equals lambda nu.

00:45:27.265 --> 00:45:35.580
So it means that nu equals 3
times 10 to the 8 over five

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.220
times 10 to the minus 7.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:45.530
So this is something of the
order of 6 times 10 to the 14--

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:46.470
what?

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:47.570
Hertz, right?

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:51.050
It's a temporal frequency.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.390
So this oscillation
that I showed

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:57.230
before, it's a very
high-frequency oscillation.

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.420
is in there in the
order of 10 to the 14

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.600
had now we don't listen
to the radio anymore

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:10.870
we listen to you know podcasts
or our satellite and so on.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:15.970
So we're not very familiar
with radio frequencies.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.950
But I'm old enough to
remember when you tuned

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:22.150
your radio to 104.3 Megahertz.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:26.390
That happens to be
Boston's WBCN station.

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:31.290
So OK, Boston's WBCN station
emits at 100 megahertz.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.380
It is actually the same stuff--

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:36.590
I'm going to force the machine
to do what I want it to do,

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:38.960
so I'm going to keep this down.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.320
OK, so let's say nu
equals 100 megahertz.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:50.570
That is 10 to the 8, correct?

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:56.240
So therefore, the
wavelength now is what?

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.700
c over the frequency
so it is 3 times

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:08.040
10 to the 8 meters per second
over 10 to the 8 hertz.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.350
So this is now 3 meters.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:12.650
So it is still the same stuff.

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:16.310
It is still light, if you wish,
but of a much, much longer

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.770
wavelength at the
radio frequencies.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:23.120
So you can see that
electromagnetic waves can span

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.850
a very broad range of scales.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.940
In this class, the
wavelengths of interest

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.610
are in this range
between the dashed lines

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.370
and the infrared,
which nominally

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:38.390
ends at about 10 micrometers,
and the ultraviolet,

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:43.470
which nominally ends
at about 30 nanometers.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.080
Where do the names come from?

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.680
"Infra," in Latin,
means "below"--

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.000
below red.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.160
So therefore, the term "infra"
refers to what, the frequency

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.258
or the wavelength?

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.830
The frequency, right?

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:04.770
Infrared has longer
wavelengths than visible,

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:08.490
and therefore it has
smaller frequencies.

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:12.170
So it is below the
red in frequency.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:15.400
"Ultra," of course, means
higher, also in Latin,

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.770
so "ultraviolet" means higher
frequencies than violet light.

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.980
Not "violent" light,
but "violet" light.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.740
OK, and the major
difference, if you

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.620
look at light
propagation in free space

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.890
it doesn't really matter which
wavelength you are considering.

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.720
But of course, the
interaction with matter

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.900
is radically different as
you change wavelengths.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.500
So it is similar to the question
you asked about electrons.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.680
It is also true for
microwaves, or even

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.920
for electromagnetic
waves themselves.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.410
The way visible light
interacts with matter

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:55.730
is very different than
microwaves and RF waves,

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.970
and it is also very
different than X-rays.

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.920
So X-rays are actually
the next highest

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.350
in frequency after ultraviolet,
and even higher in frequency

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:07.460
are gamma rays.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.010
And I guess we stop there.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:11.680
But actually, we don't stop.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.970
The frequency can go, in
principle, all the way

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:14.570
to infinity.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:19.070
But the gamma rays is the
highest that we can observe.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:21.140
Now, I promised to
do a calculation

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.850
of the energy-- how much
energy is carried by a photon.

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:29.920
So remember the
formula, equals h nu,

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.060
where h is 6.6 times 10 to
the-- remember how much it was,

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.880
the exponent?

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.600
34, right?

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:48.350
So let's pick one here-- let's
say this one-- which is visible

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:49.610
wavelength.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:56.500
So it is six times 10 to
the 14 times inverse second.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.460
OK, so these
conveniently cancel.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.670
And 6 times 6 is--

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:04.990
let's call it 10
for convenience.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:08.030
So it is 10, and this
is 14, of course.

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.840
So this is 10 to
the minus 20 joules.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.220
OK, my arithmetic
is, obviously, wrong.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:18.710
OK, what is the
pedagogical message here?

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.470
That when we do order of
magnitude calculations--

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:25.498
6.6 times 6.6 times
equals 10, let's--

00:50:25.498 --> 00:50:26.540
actually, I got it wrong.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:27.945
I should have put "100."

00:50:27.945 --> 00:50:30.640
So minus 19.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.460
OK, so just the order
of magnitude, right?

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.330
I'm not looking for
the exact answer here.

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.060
Actually, it's very interesting.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.450
I did my graduate in Greece.

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:43.500
And over there, the
professors were very careful.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:47.160
So here, they would have
written 39.6, or whatever

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.928
it is-- the actual number.

00:50:48.928 --> 00:50:50.720
Then, I went to graduate
school at Caltech.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.970
And I took my first class
in quantum electronics

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.020
by a fellow called
Amnom Yariv, who

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.300
is pretty well-known
in the field of lasers.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.710
So we walked into
classes, and he

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:03.220
started doing things like
that-- that pi equals 3,

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.710
pi squared equals 10.

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:06.960
And at first, I was horrified.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.230
But then I realized he had a
point-- that very often, it

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:13.470
is pointless to do exact
calculations if you're

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.420
looking for an order
of magnitude result.

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.082
For example, is the bullet
going to crash into a wall,

00:51:18.082 --> 00:51:19.290
or is it going to go through?

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.820
Is it going to go back, or what?

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:22.612
For that, you don't
need the exact numbers.

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:27.193
Of course, exact numbers are
valuable in some other cases.

00:51:27.193 --> 00:51:28.610
It's kind of an
interesting skill,

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.370
to know when to do
an half-calculation

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.190
and when to do an exact
calculation, and what

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:36.710
level of accuracy
you need, depending

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.153
on the resources that you
have, the time that you have,

00:51:39.153 --> 00:51:41.320
the nature of the answer
you're looking for, and on,

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.560
and so forth.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.680
OK, so for our purposes here
for now, 6 times 6 equals 100.

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.470
So we'll get a very
small energy, right?

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:52.790
It's 10 to the minus 19 joules.

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:57.710
If you go to higher frequencies,
in the range of X-rays,

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:02.390
the energy would go up by
a factor of maybe a couple

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.163
of orders of magnitude.

00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:06.080
So in these kinds of
frequencies, of energies,

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.230
if you go up to 10 to the
minus 16 joules or so,

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:12.110
it becomes comparable with
the ionizing radiation.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:16.850
So you see now why light
frequency is very important

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:19.210
when it comes to
interaction with matter.

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:21.710
Because visible
light, the photon,

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:25.190
each photon that impinges
on an atom in a material

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.380
has a relatively low energy.

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.180
It can do something
to the material--

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:30.530
we'll talk about it later--

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:31.850
but it cannot ionize it.

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:33.500
If you increase
the frequency, you

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.080
increase the energy of the
photon, and all of a sudden,

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:39.860
you can get ionizing effects.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.140
So these sort of
calculations give you

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.490
an idea of what's going on.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.610
And of course, if you
conclude the energy carried

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:57.620
by a microwave photon, it will
be several orders of magnitude

00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:58.120
lower--

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.580
I think something like five
or six orders of magnitude

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.220
smaller.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.510
OK, any questions about that?

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:07.680
About photons or--

00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:17.392
Let me say a few things
about wave propagation.

00:53:17.392 --> 00:53:19.850
At the beginning of the class,
we'll do geometrical optics.

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:22.610
But I want to say a
few things about waves

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:26.432
that we need before geometrical
optics begins to make sense.

00:53:26.432 --> 00:53:27.890
So the first things
that we learned

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:29.540
is wavelength and
frequency, right?

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:34.140
These two things are important
even in geometrical optics.

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.490
The wavelength is a
very important concept.

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:39.840
The thing I want to talk about
is, a little bit, to show you

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.520
what the wave looks like.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.760
So this is very simple,
one-dimensional wave.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.350
And what I've done
is I have plotted it

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:49.150
at different snapshots in time.

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:54.150
So the horizontal axis, again,
is the propagation distance

00:53:54.150 --> 00:54:00.360
that the wave is propagating,
and the vertical axis is--

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.410
well, this part of the
small axis is time,

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.750
and then I have captured
different snapshots.

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.950
So as you can see, there's
a sense of motion here.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:12.600
If you latch on a
peak of the wave,

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.270
you will see that at
different instances,

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:18.600
the peak is moving from
the left to the right.

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.350
And of course, the
symbol uppercase

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:22.180
T here is the frequency.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.300
I think it was defined
in an earlier slide.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.650
It is simply the inverse--

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:29.370
I'm sorry, that is the
period, the temporal period,

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:33.820
the inverse of the
temporal frequency.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.960
And of course,
after one full time

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.700
period, the wave
replicates itself.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.630
So if you look carefully at
this wave from over here,

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:46.300
it is identical to the
wavefront at t equals 0

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.680
that I'm not tall
enough to reach.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.690
So you can pick arbitrarily.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:57.080
You can pick any
point in the wave.

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.690
I happened to pick a peak.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.200
OK, I happened to pick a
peak, and I tracked that peak

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.730
as the wave propagates.

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:06.970
I could equally well have
picked a point over here

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:07.960
and tracked it.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.330
It would also have
propagated the same way.

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:17.120
And so this concept of a point
in the wave, if you wish,

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:21.230
or more generally
a surface of a wave

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:26.760
that propagates with a
wave as a function of time

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.030
is called a wavefront.

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:32.630
And the term is very suggestive.

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:33.920
It implies motion.

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.673
It's like a battlefront.

00:55:35.673 --> 00:55:36.590
What is a battlefront?

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:39.650
It's the people who are
unlucky enough to have

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:42.590
been picked to be at the
frontline of the battle.

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:47.780
So if you've seen all these old,
horrible movies about battles

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:49.640
in the Middle Ages,
you see all these guys

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.795
with their shields going ahead.

00:55:51.795 --> 00:55:54.020
And that's a
battlefront, moving.

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.150
So a wavefront is
a similar concept.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:01.040
You have a front that is moving
as the energy of the wave

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.060
is propagating.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.060
So it's perhaps not a
very interesting wavefront

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.250
because it is
one-dimensional, right?

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:11.610
The wave is propagating
along a sort of linear axis.

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:15.780
In a second, I will show you
more interesting wavefronts

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.753
that are of relevance
in this class.

00:56:19.753 --> 00:56:21.420
The other thing I
want to point out here

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.660
is, again, I want to bring up
the concept of the wavelength.

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.730
And we defined the
wavelength already

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:29.070
as the distance
between two peaks.

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:31.200
So if you look at
two peaks over here,

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.080
the distance is, by
definition, of a wavelength.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.140
But also, the wavelength,
it has a different meaning.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.540
If you look at it from the
point of view of propagation

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.150
of the wave, it is
also the distance

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:45.240
that the wave propagated in--

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.020
how long?

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.660
Well, one period, right?

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.400
And in fact, this is
where the equation c

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.140
equals lambda nu comes from.

00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.830
I'll let you do
that as a homework.

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:04.720
But if you think about
it, if you treat the wave

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:11.030
as a particle that
took 3 seconds to move

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:15.520
lambda units of distance,
then its velocity c

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.520
must obey this
equation over here.

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.310
It's a one-line
derivation kind of thing.

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:22.910
I'll let you do
it as a homework.

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:25.630
And also, I want to
emphasize that this equation

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:30.340
that we called the spatial
relation in the previous slide,

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:33.460
it is only true if light
propagates in free space

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.110
or in uniform media.

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:39.268
If you put light, for
example, in a confined space,

00:57:39.268 --> 00:57:41.560
this equation changes, and
it becomes a little bit more

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.360
complicated.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.600
But in this class, we don't
deal with this phenomenon.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.690
If you want to learn about
more complicated dispersion

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.930
relations, you will have to
take Professor Fujimoto's class

00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:55.600
in electrical engineering.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.780
I might mention something
like this in passing,

00:57:57.780 --> 00:57:59.520
but not in great detail.

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.080
For this, we will
be happy enough

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:05.950
to take this as a dispersion
equation of the light.

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:07.950
But again, I want to alert
you that there's also

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:12.900
other dispersion
relations that may occur.

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.970
OK, the other thing that I will
not spend too much time here,

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:20.880
but it will come up later with
great force and great detail

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.600
is the concept of phase delay.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:28.190
So you probably remember this
from your trigonometry class.

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:30.500
If you have a
periodic phenomenon

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:34.430
or a periodic function, you can
pick an arbitrary point in time

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:36.200
and call it your reference.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.390
And then, as the
phenomenon evolves,

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:43.890
you can refer to this initial
point as if with a phase delay.

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:46.760
So the phase delay
is relative to 2pi,

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.310
which measures one full cycle.

00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:54.590
So then you can interpret
these snapshots over here

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:58.850
as phase-delayed versions
of the original wave.

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:04.580
So for example, between
0 and 1/8 of a period,

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.660
your phase delay equals pi
over 4, because 2pi over 8

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.460
equals pi over 4.

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:13.190
So this is a concept that
will come up again, as I said,

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:14.550
in great detail.

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:19.620
I just wanted you to be a little
bit aware of it right now.

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.280
What I really wanted
to emphasize over here

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.380
is that light does not
usually propagate along

00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:30.150
an exact one line, as I
showed in a previous line,

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:31.770
but it propagates in 3D space.

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:33.040
So it can expand.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.040
It can contract.

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.450
It can do weird things, right?

00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:38.340
So to do that, we
need a slightly more

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:39.360
elaborate description.

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.017
So this is an attempt
to plot 3D space.

00:59:43.017 --> 00:59:45.100
And if you think about the
wavefront in this case,

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.390
it is a surface
that moves from left

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:51.240
to right as a function of time.

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.292
So as the wavefront propagates,
the surface is moving.

00:59:54.292 --> 00:59:56.000
By the way, this is
a fictitious surface.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.220
I'm not thinking of a
physical surface or anything.

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:03.680
But if you think about the
energy that the light carries,

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.430
the energy is actually moving
as the wave propagates.

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:09.410
This is how you can
connect the two.

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.200
If you go out to the Charles--

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.970
OK, you have to wait until
April when it unfreezes--

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:16.990
but if you look at the
waves on the water--

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:19.490
of course, you can do it at
home on your bucket or something

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.130
like that--

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:22.630
but if you look at the waves,
there's also a physical sense,

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.770
because the water
wave, there's a crest.

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:26.420
So there wavefront
of the water wave

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:30.687
is the crest that moves
as the wave propagates.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.800
So these surfaces, the weapons,
they can have different shapes.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.490
They cannot have arbitrary
shapes because they're governed

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:43.880
by the laws of
light propagation.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.860
But certain allowable shapes
turn out to be very simple,

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.930
and we will be dealing
with them a lot.

01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:53.480
So the simplest is
a planar wavefront

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.960
that, as the name
implies, is a plane.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.260
And the next simple is
a spherical wavefront,

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:03.450
which, again, as the name
implies, is a sphere.

01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:08.330
So you can think those as
our two major wavefronts

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:10.770
that we'll be dealing with
throughout the class--

01:01:10.770 --> 01:01:12.830
the planar wavefront
and the spherical.

01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:14.980
And we'll-- yes.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.530
AUDIENCE: So in the last slide,
you showed the electric field

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:18.760
as being the y-axis.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.070
But here, it's space, not field.

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.790
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes, so
that is correct, and thank you.

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:28.620
And I should relabel the slide.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:34.380
Here, the two axes, they
correspond to x and y,

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.370
the space coordinates, yeah.

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:40.200
And the electric field is not
found here because I cannot

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.100
plot a fourth dimension.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.750
So what is happening here is the
electric field is maximum at t

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.230
equal to 0.

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:51.690
So at t equals 0, the electric
field is maximum on this plane.

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:54.630
If you wait 1/8 of
a period, the field

01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:56.220
will be maximum at this plane.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.620
If you wait another
1/8 of a period,

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:00.540
the field is maximum
on this plane.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:03.090
So the wavefront, in
this case, is the maximum

01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:04.290
of the electric field--

01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:06.480
the crest, if you wish,
of the electric field--

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.740
as it propagates through space.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:10.790
And the same is here.

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:14.990
Again, these surfaces mean
that the field is maximum

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:17.160
on the surface at t equals 0.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.340
And then, 1/8 of a
period later, the field

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:22.660
is maximum on the surface,
and so on, and so forth.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.260
Thanks, yeah.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:28.020
So that's a very
important clarification.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.400
Now, what do you think
should happen to the energy

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.370
density in the two cases?

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:36.170
Suppose I have a
fixed amount of energy

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:40.438
that is entered in on the left.

01:02:40.438 --> 01:02:41.730
Are they different in some way?

01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:43.387
Yeah.

01:02:43.387 --> 01:02:45.543
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:45.543 --> 01:02:46.960
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.280
Can I can ask you to push
the button and repeat that?

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.290
Yeah.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:55.170
AUDIENCE: The plane
wave's energy is constant,

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:58.050
energy density is constant,
and the spherical wave's energy

01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:59.582
density is smaller.

01:02:59.582 --> 01:03:00.790
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Correct.

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:01.720
AUDIENCE: As it expands.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.137
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Correct, yes,

01:03:03.137 --> 01:03:04.990
because energy has
to be concerned.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:10.410
So in this case, the
wavefront is invariant,

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.360
so the energy must
remain constant.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.520
In this case, the
wavefront is expanding,

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.270
so the energy density will
decrease as you go away.

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:21.360
We will make this
more precise later.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.590
We'll define what we
mean by energy density.

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:25.710
In fact, it is called intensity.

01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:28.420
So we'll define that.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.390
So basically if you
measure the energy

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:34.500
in watts per area, watts
per centimeter square,

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.630
in this case, it has
to decrease in order

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:38.640
to make sure that the
energy you started

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.190
with at the center of the
sphere is preserved throughout.

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:46.800
The next concept I would
like to define is the ray.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.140
And the reason we
introduced wavefronts

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:53.550
is primarily because I wanted
to define relatively precisely,

01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:56.550
now, what I mean by a ray.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:00.470
For the next 4 weeks, we will be
talking about rays exclusively,

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:02.070
OK?

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:05.160
So a ray is basically a
normal to the wavefront.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.670
That is the correct,
accurate definition of a ray.

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:11.820
You take this surfaces,
you plug the normals,

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.807
and these lines are the rays.

01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:15.390
So in this case, the
rays are parallel

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:18.360
because all the surfaces
are parallel planes.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.910
In this case, the
rays form a fan,

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:23.680
like a divergent
fan, that attaches

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.270
at each point on the spheres.

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:31.280
The fan components are
normal to the surfaces.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.230
And you can also think
of them as trajectories

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:39.846
over which the particles
of light propagate.

01:04:39.846 --> 01:04:41.590
It is not, perhaps,
very accurate

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:44.200
to think of the particles
as photons in this case.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.740
So think of them as some sort
of fictitious light bullets that

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:52.370
propagate down the
ray trajectories.

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:54.020
And the rays have
several properties,

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.050
which I will ratify
later in the class.

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:59.800
The rays have to be continuous
in piecewise differential.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.480
A ray cannot jump, for example.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.430
You cannot have a ray
that looks like this.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:14.836
That cannot happen-- forbidden.

01:05:18.724 --> 01:05:26.440
A ray can have a continuous
but, perhaps, not differentiable

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.410
band like this.

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:28.700
So that's allowed.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.150
And it can also have a
smooth, continuous path.

01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:33.190
That's also allowed.

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.970
OK, that is, obviously,
why it is forbidden.

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:39.190
It is kind of strange to
imagine the photon disappearing

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.650
and appearing again
someplace else.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:48.290
The others we will
see later in action.

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:53.670
And from our experience,
rays are straight lines.

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:55.910
And why do we say that,
from our experience?

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.200
Where have you seen
rays in everyday life?

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.820
Button.

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.532
AUDIENCE: Lasers.

01:06:03.532 --> 01:06:04.990
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Lasers is one.

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:08.460
But usually, if you have the
beam coming out of a laser,

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.260
it looks kind of
like a straight line.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:15.800
Another example, perhaps,
from even more everyday life.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.730
AUDIENCE: Shadows.

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:18.522
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Shadows, that's right.

01:06:18.522 --> 01:06:20.240
If you look at
shadows, the light

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.070
appears to come out
straight out of the shadows.

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:26.105
So it's a little bit
strange that I drew a ray

01:06:26.105 --> 01:06:28.340
as a curved trajectory.

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:31.250
We will see a bit later, maybe
even today if we don't run out

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:36.590
of time, that light rays can
actually follow curved paths

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:38.390
under certain conditions.

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:41.810
But what is for sure, that in
free space or uniform space

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:42.940
like air--

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.990
we observe shadows in air.

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:51.810
So air is pretty much
uniform, and for that reason,

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:53.950
rays propagate in
straight lines.

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:56.550
By the way, you don't have
to go too far to see examples

01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:59.280
of curved ray propagation.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.470
The best example is flicker.

01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:04.680
If you go up in the
mountains at night

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.753
and you look down at
the city beneath--

01:07:06.753 --> 01:07:08.420
I don't think you can
do that in Boston.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.210
We don't have any
mountains high enough.

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:13.140
But in Los Angeles, for
example, it's very pronounced.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.020
If you go to the Hollywood Hills
and look down, you see flicker.

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.380
The lights in the city,
they are not steady.

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.940
They kind of flicker.

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:25.010
So the result of that is
because the atmosphere,

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:26.770
it is not an exactly
uniform medium.

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:31.250
You have temperature changes,
air currents, and so on.

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:35.080
And because of that, the
rays between the city lights

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:38.590
and your eye, the rays
follow a sort of curved path.

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.800
Very slightly curved, but
because they propagate

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.600
a long distance, it is enough
to result in this flicker

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.340
phenomenon.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.270
OK, so from that--

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:50.060
it is not quite obvious
as in the shadow--

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:54.010
but from that, we have kind
of experienced, all of us,

01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:57.125
that the rays might
actually not propagate along

01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:58.170
a straight path.

01:07:58.170 --> 01:08:00.020
And in a second,
I will define when

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:02.450
that happens-- when
a ray can propagate

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:06.650
in a curved trajectory.

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:11.770
Before I do that, I already
implied that the reason

01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:14.420
rays might do strange
things, like deviate

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.109
from the straight and narrow--

01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:18.710
I'm sorry, might deviate
from the straight path--

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.950
is because of interaction
with matter, right?

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:26.120
It is the non-uniformity in
air, in my earlier example,

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.670
that caused the rays to bend.

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:33.930
So then, the next topic is
a very simple description

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.240
of how light
interacts with matter.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.180
And for now, I will
say it is a fairy

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.550
tale, because we don't know
enough electromagnetics yet.

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:44.670
I will come back to this
topic after we define light

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:47.010
as an electromagnetic wave.

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:50.490
I will come back to this topic
and tell you more rigorously

01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:52.610
how light interacts with matter.

01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:54.420
For now, very briefly,
I will tell you

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:58.430
that there is three
types of interaction

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:00.410
that we'll discuss
in this class--

01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:03.470
absorption, refraction,
and scattering.

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:06.050
So today, I will define
absorption and refraction

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:10.600
in very simple
phenomenological terms.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.939
Anybody knows what it
means, "phenomenological"?

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:16.729
I am Greek, so I have a
benefit of the language.

01:09:22.410 --> 01:09:25.529
"Phenomenological" means
based on observation.

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:28.649
It means we define
this phenomenon

01:09:28.649 --> 01:09:30.569
based on what we
observe, but we don't

01:09:30.569 --> 01:09:34.470
try to dig any deeper
into the basic principles

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.149
behind this phenomenon.

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:38.290
You will see in a
second what I mean.

01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:41.779
Very well, we'll define
absorption and refraction.

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:43.849
And what I want to
emphasize, also,

01:09:43.849 --> 01:09:46.430
is that this is not the only
three types of interactions.

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:49.183
Light can do a lot
of other things.

01:09:49.183 --> 01:09:50.600
There's fluorescence,
that you are

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.660
familiar if you go to nightclubs
where they use ultraviolet,

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:54.260
right?

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:55.700
People look kind of funny.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.220
That is fluorescence.

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.420
There is non-linear phenomena.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.290
There's ionization
that can happen.

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:05.360
So a lot of different
things that can happen,

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.290
but I will not cover
them in this class.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:10.610
So as I say, they're outside
the scope of our interest here.

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:18.140
Going on with this, let me
define absorption first.

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:23.010
So from experience,
we know that anything

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:26.700
that travels through a
medium suffers losses.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.140
Many of your
mechanical engineers,

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:33.210
you know that if you have
a mechanical disturbance

01:10:33.210 --> 01:10:37.140
like sound propagating down
the medium, at the exit,

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.543
you see less of the
energy that you put in.

01:10:39.543 --> 01:10:41.085
Some of you are
electrical engineers.

01:10:41.085 --> 01:10:44.310
You know that if you run
current through a device,

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.230
typically, at the
exit of the device,

01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:49.990
you see less current or
less electrical energy.

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:52.630
Typically, you see a
voltage drop than the energy

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:54.260
that you put in.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:57.270
So why does this happen?

01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:58.670
Well, because of--

01:10:58.670 --> 01:10:59.170
Why?

01:10:59.170 --> 01:10:59.962
Why does it happen?

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:08.430
Yes.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.761
[LAUGHS]

01:11:14.761 --> 01:11:16.222
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:16.222 --> 01:11:17.650
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:19.770
It is conversion of
energy to heat, right?

01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:22.450
And that generally is
undesirable unless--

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:24.900
anyway, we seldom heat
ourselves with-- well,

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.810
unless it's the sunlight
on a day like this,

01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:29.080
we appreciate the heating.

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.980
But in Singapore, generally, we
don't appreciate the heating,

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:36.160
because the sunlight is
too intense, typically,

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.702
to tolerate.

01:11:38.702 --> 01:11:40.160
But yeah, the fact
of the matter is

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.090
that there is ohmic
losses, or dissipation,

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:48.680
like you very correctly said,
that cause a decrease in power.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:54.500
So the phenomenological law
that describes this effect

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.430
is exponential in the length
of propagation in matter.

01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:00.800
So by "phenomenological,"
what I mean

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.370
is that I throw this
equation at you,

01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:05.870
but I haven't told you why, OK?

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:07.010
I will tell you why later.

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:09.710
When we do electromagnetics,
I will justify

01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:11.570
why this law comes about.

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:13.700
And strangely enough,
it is called Beer's Law.

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.050
No, it's not pronounced "beer."

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:16.400
It's pronounced "bear."

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.470
This fellow was German.

01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:22.050
But anyway-- and light does
get absorbed by beer, actually.

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:25.680
And strangely enough, I did
see a paper at a conference

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.070
once where someone was measuring
the optical properties of beer.

01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:31.340
And I'm not kidding, actually.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.960
They had their project
funded by I don't know whom,

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.998
to shoot laser beams through
big containers of beer.

01:12:37.998 --> 01:12:40.290
And then I don't know exactly
what they were measuring,

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:42.720
but I thought it was a very
cleverly conceived project.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.180
Because after you finish the
experiment, what do you do?

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.660
You drink the beer, right?

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:47.160
OK.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:55.490
So I said that the output
energy decays exponentially

01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:57.620
as a function of the
length of the medium.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.570
The coefficient that
goes in the exponent

01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:02.090
is, again, very highly
dependent on the material

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:03.590
that the light propagates.

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:06.380
Conductors-- like
metals-- they tend

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.800
to have very high dissipation.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.390
If you might propagate a few
microns inside the metal,

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:12.770
the light is all lost.

01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:14.810
It is all converted to heat.

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:17.732
So on the other hand,
the electrics like glass,

01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:19.190
they can have very
low dissipation.

01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:23.780
In fact, some materials,
they use some special glasses

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:27.860
in optical fibers that
they usually transmit light

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.552
over very long distances.

01:13:29.552 --> 01:13:31.010
In these occasions,
the dissipation

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:34.860
is in the order of a fraction
of a dB per kilometer.

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.460
So it is I don't know how many
orders of magnitude there,

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:41.540
around eight or nine orders of
magnitude in the dissipation

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.890
coefficient.

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:45.020
And again, that
depends on the way

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.760
light interacts with matter.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.480
I will say a little bit
more about that later.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.645
But for now, again,
take me to my word.

01:13:53.645 --> 01:13:55.520
Never take anybody to
their word, by the way.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.705
But I think for
reasons of organizing

01:13:58.705 --> 01:14:00.080
the presentation
of the material,

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:05.090
sometimes I will ask you to
take my word for granted.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:07.190
And usually, when I
ask you to do that,

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:11.140
I will come back and justify
myself perhaps a few lectures

01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.600
later, or something like that.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.960
OK, and the other thing
I want to emphasize

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:20.740
is that dissipation or
absorption depends strongly

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:21.910
on the wavelength.

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:24.490
And that, again, goes back to
what we were saying before.

01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:27.430
Different wavelengths
carry different energy,

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:29.110
and different energies
of the photons,

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:31.530
they will interact with the
matter in different ways.

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:33.280
They might [INAUDIBLE]
due to oscillation.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.850
They might set it into
dipole polarization.

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:40.620
They might set matter, they
might ionize it-- whatever.

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.490
So depending on who happens,
you get different behavior.

01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:46.790
So this is the atmosphere.

01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:49.140
The percent of transmission--
not exactly the alpha

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:54.210
coefficient, but a transmission,
percent transmission throughout

01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:55.380
a nominal length--

01:14:55.380 --> 01:15:01.030
I believe it is in the
order of over a few meters--

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:03.020
as a function of wavelength.

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.900
So we can see that
it varies quite a bit

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.180
even within the visible range.

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.850
The atmosphere is not
completely transparent.

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:12.340
It is a little bit
less transparent

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:17.185
at blue wavelengths.

01:15:17.185 --> 01:15:20.830
It becomes, then,
almost transparent

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.530
at the longer wavelengths.

01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:26.025
And then-- this
is infrared now--

01:15:26.025 --> 01:15:27.400
in the infrared,
you see you have

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.735
some very strong absorption.

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:32.360
The transmission
coefficient goes down.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.030
That means strong
absorption here.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.680
That actually has to do
with molecular resonances.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:40.270
And you can think of molecules
as little mass spring damper

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:41.200
systems.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.790
And the photon comes
in and kicks them

01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:44.868
so it sets them
into oscillation.

01:15:44.868 --> 01:15:46.660
When that happens, the
energy of the photon

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:50.080
gets transformed resonantly
into the molecule,

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.530
and then you get loss.

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:54.760
So in this case, it is a
little bit more complicated

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.940
than heating, than
simple heating.

01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.680
But the net effect
is still the same.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.715
You still get heating from
the motion of these molecules.

01:16:02.715 --> 01:16:04.090
But anyway, that's
the reason why

01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:08.140
you get these strong
absorption maxima over here.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.190
What I really wanted to
get to today so that we

01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:17.110
can progress with
geometrical optics

01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:20.870
is the phenomenon of refraction.

01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:23.880
So refraction, is-- is
refers to, actually,

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.440
a rather strange
thing that, again, I

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.470
will ask you to take for
granted until we talk

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:30.910
in detail about polarization.

01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:34.200
And that is the fact
that the speed of light

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.500
changes when light
enters the material.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.110
In this case, we're talking
primarily about dielectrics,

01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:41.957
but it's also true for metals.

01:16:41.957 --> 01:16:44.290
But of course, in metals, the
light doesn't go very far.

01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:47.830
So OK, the speed changes,
but it doesn't go very far.

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:51.180
In dielectrics, the
light can go quite far,

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.690
but its speed is different.

01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:57.210
And again, phenomenologically--
without describing the physical

01:16:57.210 --> 01:16:59.710
origins of why--

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:02.260
the speed is, of
course, reduced,

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.150
and it's used by
a constant that is

01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:07.540
known as index of refraction,
or refractive index.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:13.900
And most books use the
symbol n to denote it.

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:17.650
And the value of
n can value a lot.

01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:21.400
In a vacuum, n equals exactly 1.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.870
So the speed of light in
vacuum equals exactly c.

01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:28.600
In air, it is close to 1,
within two significant digits.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.260
It's maybe 1.005 or
something like that.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.790
And it depends also on the
temperature, the pressure,

01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:38.700
a number of different
properties over the air,

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.970
as we'll see again later.

01:17:41.970 --> 01:17:44.220
And then, typical
dielectrics that we see

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.750
are water, of course.

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:48.840
So then, why is it
the water interesting?

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.120
Well, because-- well, water.

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.110
But also because our bodies
are composed mostly of water.

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:57.900
Our tissue is approximately
70% or 75% water.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:00.720
So light index of
refraction in a body

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.050
is also equal to the
same quantity, 1.3.

01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:07.140
Actually, this would
be 1.33, if you really

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.750
want to be more accurate.

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.640
And glass-- so glass
is used in pretty much

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.880
every optical instrument
for visible wavelengths.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.470
So in glass, the
index of refraction

01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:21.390
is approximately 1.5.

01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:24.810
OK what does this mean now,
the speed of light changes?

01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:28.490
Another way to say it is that
the wavelength of the light

01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:29.320
changes.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:32.750
And this is actually
a more proper way

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:35.030
to think of the phenomenon.

01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:37.310
When we'll do
electromagnetics, we'll

01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:40.850
see that the change
in speed is actually

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:44.050
derived from that observation.

01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:49.940
And the way the wavelength
changes is it becomes shorter.

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:53.240
So if you have a light happily
propagating in free space,

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.710
and then, all of
a sudden, there's

01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:58.850
an abrupt interface and
light enters a dielectric,

01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:01.048
the wavelengths becomes shorter.

01:19:01.048 --> 01:19:02.090
Now, what does that mean?

01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:05.680
Does this mean that, for
example, if I have red light,

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:12.050
and the red light goes into
glass, the light becomes green?

01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:14.980
That's actually not
what we observe, right?

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:21.040
if you observe, many
of you have seen,

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.140
if you put a yellow
pencil in glass,

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.310
the pencil remains yellow.

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:27.180
It does not turn blue, right?

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.650
So what is a possible-- does
anybody know the explanation?

01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:32.315
Yeah.

01:19:32.315 --> 01:19:33.940
AUDIENCE: The frequency
stays the same.

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.835
So if you see the
frequency as it comes out,

01:19:36.835 --> 01:19:39.210
it's just going to be affecting
pretty much [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:39.210 --> 01:19:40.627
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:45.940
So very correctly, he said
that the frequency of the light

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:47.350
remains the same.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:50.320
Anybody want to guess why
the frequency of the light

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.600
might remain the same but
the wavelength can change?

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:04.307
AUDIENCE: The speed changes.

01:20:04.307 --> 01:20:05.723
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

01:20:05.723 --> 01:20:06.588
The speed, yes.

01:20:10.046 --> 01:20:10.750
That's right.

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:12.840
So both of you are right.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.810
So first of all, they can
change simultaneously,

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:19.440
the wavelength and the speed,
because of this equation.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.950
We said that the
speed of light--

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:26.720
I mean the speed of light
in vacuum, or in general--

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.410
well, in vacuum, it is
related to the frequency

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.900
of the wavelength by
this equation over here.

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:37.860
Well, you can then divide the
two sides of the equation by n,

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:39.787
and the question
remains the same.

01:20:39.787 --> 01:20:40.995
But that's not very physical.

01:20:40.995 --> 01:20:42.352
I did a mathematical trick.

01:20:42.352 --> 01:20:43.560
What the hell does that mean?

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.020
I divided both sides by n.

01:20:48.212 --> 01:20:50.420
That doesn't have to be
correct, and this is, indeed,

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:54.910
the dispersion relation in
a dielectrical material.

01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:57.820
But you don't really know,
which one should you divide?

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.770
Should you divide
the wavelength by n,

01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:02.200
or should you divide
the frequency by n?

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.840
Or maybe divide both
by square root n?

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.530
All of these are possibilities.

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:10.660
So the physical argument
that allows you to decide

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.410
whether to divide is what--

01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:13.600
I'm sorry, your name?

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.020
AUDIENCE: Uh, Liz.

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:14.950
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
What Alice--

01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:15.648
Alice, right?

01:21:15.648 --> 01:21:16.440
AUDIENCE: Just Liz.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.940
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Liz, I'm sorry.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.740
So the physical argument
is what Liz just said,

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:26.950
which is that the energy of
the photon cannot change.

01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:29.650
Because the photon-- well,
I haven't said it yet,

01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:34.110
but the photon is a fundamental
quantum mechanical particle.

01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:35.920
It cannot be divided--

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.310
well, it can be divided
in some special cases.

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:43.120
But in the approximation
that we deal with here,

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.860
the photon must
maintain its energy.

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.860
So therefore, the
frequency of the photon

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.640
must remain the same.

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:53.890
New, the temporal
frequency is conserved.

01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:56.890
So if the wavelength changes
because light entered

01:21:56.890 --> 01:21:59.290
into matter, then
the velocity must

01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:04.278
change to compensate in the
dispersion relationship.

01:22:04.278 --> 01:22:08.590
OK, in our context
here, the only thing

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:13.617
that can happen to the
photon is it can disappear.

01:22:13.617 --> 01:22:14.950
And it doesn't really disappear.

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:16.840
It gets converted
to heat, right?

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.270
So when the light
hits the material,

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:22.980
it actually heats the
material in discrete quanta.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:27.300
Some of the photons that
come from the light source,

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:31.620
discrete quantities
that are equal to--

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.810
you cannot see it over
there because I erased it.

01:22:33.810 --> 01:22:36.210
But discrete quantities
of approximately 10

01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:40.560
to the minus 19 joules,
one of them at a time

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.800
can be converted to heat
and heat the material.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.330
But you cannot get 60% of the
photon energy to go to heat

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.200
the material.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.330
That's not the correct
way to think about it.

01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:54.540
If 60% of the energy goes
into heating the material,

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:57.840
it means that 60% of
individual photons

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.580
died and gave up their energy to
the molecules of the material.

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.690
If you have a single photon
arriving into a material,

01:23:05.690 --> 01:23:08.690
it will either survive
and go through impact,

01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:10.820
or it will die and
be converted to heat.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.980
You cannot have 60% of an
individual photon heating

01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:15.280
the material.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.220
OK, so because of this
line of reasoning,

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.845
that really requires
quantum mechanics.

01:23:18.845 --> 01:23:22.160
So I cannot really justify
it very well without spending

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.710
a semester of quantum mechanics.

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:25.640
But because of this
line of reasoning,

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.460
the energy of the
photon is invalid.

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:31.490
Therefore, nu is invariant.

01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:34.540
So believe it or not, I have
watched someone at a conference

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:37.473
stand up and say, well, doesn't
the light really become green?

01:23:37.473 --> 01:23:38.890
And that was an
optics conference,

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:40.550
so it was very embarrassing.

01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:42.850
But it's very
useful to remember.

01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:50.120
No, light does not become
green when it enters glass.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.875
And in any case, your
eyes respond to the energy

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:53.750
of the photon, right?

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:57.950
Because-- well, I haven't said
how your eyes perceive color

01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:59.480
yet, but they respond
to the energy.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.605
So you still perceive it
as red, because the energy

01:24:01.605 --> 01:24:06.570
of the photon is still red.

01:24:06.570 --> 01:24:11.030
OK, so having said
that now, having

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:13.910
said that the
index of refraction

01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:17.060
is a property of the material,
I can conceive of materials

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:21.207
where the index of refraction
is a function of position.

01:24:21.207 --> 01:24:22.290
And if that was the case--

01:24:26.157 --> 01:24:27.615
the bad thing about
any measures is

01:24:27.615 --> 01:24:29.720
you have to wait
for them to finish.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.950
OK, so you can
conceive materials

01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:34.140
where the index of
refraction is variable.

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.780
So the example I gave
before is the air, where,

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:40.480
because of temperature,
pressure, and so on,

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.830
the index changes.

01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:43.540
So if the index is
functional position,

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.805
you can define a quantity that
is called the optical path

01:24:46.805 --> 01:24:47.305
length.

01:24:47.305 --> 01:24:50.430
So if you follow the
trajectory of the ray--

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:53.580
so here is the ray, and
that is its trajectory--

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:59.650
you can integrate the
index of refraction

01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:03.190
in small, individual segments
as the light propagates

01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:06.450
along the ray.

01:25:06.450 --> 01:25:09.210
So the basic
principle that I would

01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:12.810
like you to carry with you
when you leave this class today

01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:16.140
is that the basic
law that covers

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:20.780
light propagation in
the ray description

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.950
is that this quantity,
the optical path,

01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:23.850
must be preserved--

01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:25.963
I'm sorry, it must be minimized.

01:25:25.963 --> 01:25:27.380
Of course, it has
to be preserved.

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.475
It also has to be minimized.

01:25:29.475 --> 01:25:31.350
So if you have different
paths-- for example,

01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:35.480
if you compare the path gamma
and the path gamma prime--

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:40.510
the light will take the path
where this quantity is minimal,

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:41.415
OK?

01:25:41.415 --> 01:25:43.040
Now, that sounds very
abstract, I know,

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.650
but I will make it more
specific with examples.

01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:47.990
For those of you who are
mechanical engineers-- or, more

01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:50.030
likely, applied
mechanicians-- this

01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:51.710
is reminiscent of
another principle

01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:55.010
that you may have learned in
your Lagrangian mechanics.

01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:58.790
You can make the same,
the exact same arguments

01:25:58.790 --> 01:26:02.510
about particles moving
in a gravitational field.

01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:04.670
Particles moving in--
that's the reason

01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:07.660
why stars rotate
around the sun, why

01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:09.110
they have elliptical
trajectories,

01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:11.140
and so on, and so forth--
is because they also

01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:16.200
obey a minimum path principle.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:21.320
And well, let's see
it in action here.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.590
So we apply this
principle-- we'll

01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:25.600
apply it in several
occasions during the class,

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.290
but today, I would like
to apply to discover

01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:31.570
what happens to
light when it arrives

01:26:31.570 --> 01:26:34.490
at an interface
between two dialectics.

01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:38.058
So on the left, you have
one dielectric-- say air--

01:26:38.058 --> 01:26:39.850
and on the right-hand
side of an interface,

01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:42.705
you have another
dielectric-- say glass.

01:26:42.705 --> 01:26:44.080
So what will happen
to the light?

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.180
Well, two things will happen.

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.250
Some fraction of the
light energy-- that is,

01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:52.060
some fraction of
individual photons--

01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.080
will be reflected.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:59.440
And some other fraction of the
light will enter the interface,

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:02.080
but it might enter
at an angle that

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.240
is different than
the angle of arrival.

01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:12.120
That portion of light that
goes in, we call it refracted.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.370
So this is the refracted
portion of the light.

01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:16.710
It's a little bit confusing,
because the two terms

01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:19.020
are the same except
for two letters.

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.690
So I hope you can sort of
recapture the difference.

01:27:21.690 --> 01:27:26.010
One is reflected, and
the other is refracted.

01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:28.750
So the question is, what is
the direction that these rays

01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:31.040
propagate at the interface?

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.810
So we will invoke the minimal
path principle for that.

01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:36.750
So consider, first, reflection.

01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:38.220
And what I'm about
to say applies

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.600
to the electric interface just
as well as a mirror, a metal

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:45.080
or metallic mirror.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.910
So the minimum
path principle says

01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:49.850
that the light must be
reflected symmetrically.

01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:54.200
So the reflected ray
makes the same angle

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.078
with the normal as the
incident ray, because that's

01:27:57.078 --> 01:27:58.120
the minimum path, really.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.140
If you force the light to
go to a different path--

01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.308
for example, this way--

01:28:06.308 --> 01:28:08.850
then you can see very easily,
it is a very simple calculation

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:16.192
to show that P, O, tilde p-prime
is longer than P, O, P, OK?

01:28:16.192 --> 01:28:18.150
I will let you think
about that on your selves.

01:28:18.150 --> 01:28:21.390
You can very easily convince
yourselves that this is true.

01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:25.170
And therefore, the light must
follow the symmetric path.

01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:26.850
So this is rule number one.

01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:29.660
Let me skip the next slide.

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:32.980
I'll skip a little bit, and then
I'll come back to this later.

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.010
But I want to first
say something else.

01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:47.120
OK.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.150
When we think about the law of--

01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:52.070
let's say we think about
the refracted light.

01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:54.220
The [INAUDIBLE] is the medium.

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:56.680
OK, so the first thing
we need to do in order

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.938
to complete this calculation
is to define two points

01:28:59.938 --> 01:29:00.480
from the ray.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.550
So let's say you have
point p on the incident ray

01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:06.460
and then point p-prime
on the refracted ray.

01:29:09.250 --> 01:29:12.560
So let's compute this
quantity of the optical path.

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.910
So the optical part
equals the index

01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:18.460
of refraction on
the leg on the left,

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:21.790
times the length
of the day from p

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:25.525
to the interface, and then
the index of refraction

01:29:25.525 --> 01:29:28.270
in n prime on the
right-hand side,

01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:32.430
times the length of the ray
from the interface to p prime.

01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:35.280
So this, I will repeat
what I have on the slide.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.072
I will repeat it
on the blackboard.

01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:45.250
So you have n times
the hypotenuse.

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:47.805
So my notation here is
x for this distance,

01:29:47.805 --> 01:29:49.980
z for this distance.

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:58.350
So that's the
hypotenuse plus n prime,

01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:01.600
times the other hypotenuse.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.340
So this other hypotenuse, if
I call h the vertical distance

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.160
between the two
points, simple geometry

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.300
solves that this
other hypotenuse

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.660
is something like that.

01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:27.570
OK, so the question here--

01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:28.860
how do I pose the question?

01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:29.960
What is the unknown here?

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:42.930
What have I left unspecified?

01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:45.170
Let me start with what I
have already specified.

01:30:45.170 --> 01:30:47.810
I specified theta, the
angle of incidence.

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:51.060
I specified the two
points, p and p prime.

01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:55.225
And I specified the
vertical distance h.

01:30:55.225 --> 01:30:56.850
And also, I should
say that the z prime

01:30:56.850 --> 01:31:01.750
is also specified, because z and
z prime are specified because,

01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:04.560
OK, I have specified the
coordinates of p and p prime.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.130
What is left?

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:14.178
theta prime, or another quantity
that is also left unspecified?

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:21.150
x and x prime, right?

01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:23.120
Because the ray
might go like this.

01:31:27.730 --> 01:31:30.910
All we know is that
the line starts at p

01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:32.740
and ends at p prime.

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:33.880
It can go like this.

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.200
It can go like this.

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.420
It can go like this.

01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:37.990
It can go like this, right?

01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:39.830
Which is the case?

01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:41.860
OK, so therefore,
each one of those

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:43.900
has a different value of x.

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:46.850
So how do we find x?

01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:52.520
Well, Fermat says that light
must minimize this quantity.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.120
The quantity that I
wrote on the blackboard

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:59.540
and on the slide, Fermat says
that it has to be minimized.

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:03.320
And OPL, by the way, stands
for Optical Path Length.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.070
So to minimize it,
I have to compute

01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:10.400
the derivative of this quantity
with respect to my unknown.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.813
I manage to have only one
unknown of this quantity.

01:32:13.813 --> 01:32:15.980
To find this unknown, I'd
better take the derivative

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:17.190
and set it to 0.

01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:22.510
So if I take the derivative,
I will get n times--

01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:23.590
what is the derivative?

01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:24.090
Someone?

01:32:29.378 --> 01:32:31.170
I guess I've had more
coffee than everyone,

01:32:31.170 --> 01:32:32.825
so I can still do
the derivative.

01:32:32.825 --> 01:32:35.960
So it is nx divided
by the square root,

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:42.600
minus n prime h minus x, divided
by the other square root, OK?

01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:47.420
OK, give me, now, a
simple observation that

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:48.670
solves the problem right away.

01:32:57.850 --> 01:32:58.880
That's right.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:07.240
This quantity, x
over the hypotenuse,

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.480
is the sign of this angle.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.110
This angle is the same
as this angle, right?

01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:15.018
Therefore, this
quantity is its sine.

01:33:15.018 --> 01:33:16.310
And the same for the other one.

01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:23.000
The other quantity over here
is the sine of theta prime.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.770
So if you substitute these
quantities into the derivation,

01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:32.490
then you find this
relationship over here.

01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:38.770
n times sine theta must equal
n prime times sine theta prime.

01:33:38.770 --> 01:33:42.600
And this is the law of
refraction, also known

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:43.380
as Snell's Law.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.560
So officially, I think,
we're out of time.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.940
But I can take a
couple of very few--

01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.720
I should say very
quick questions,

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.148
about that or about
anything else.

01:34:02.148 --> 01:34:04.320
Yes?

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.880
AUDIENCE: So how is it that
you can assume p and p prime,

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.990
without knowing
these other things?

01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:13.365
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
OK, so I was

01:34:13.365 --> 01:34:15.443
hoping that you would ask that.

01:34:15.443 --> 01:34:16.610
That's a very good question.

01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:19.080
So the way this
problem is solved

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:26.310
is as follows I take for granted
that there is a light ray that

01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:28.610
goes between p and p prime.

01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:30.110
The reason I can
take it for granted

01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:32.340
is another very basic
principle that says

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:35.040
that if I have a light source--

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:40.430
say it's p-- then
light propagates

01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:43.460
in spherical bundles.

01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:52.130
So I will actually have many,
many rays coming from p.

01:34:52.130 --> 01:34:57.090
And if I have another point,
any point out here, p prime,

01:34:57.090 --> 01:35:03.730
I will also have many,
many rays arriving here

01:35:03.730 --> 01:35:05.720
from the left-hand side.

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.420
One of these rays
has come from p.

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:14.280
So the question is, how
can you connect these rays?

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.450
Well, the principle that
allows you to connect them

01:35:18.450 --> 01:35:21.180
is the minimum path principle.

01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.860
The problem can
become impossible.

01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:25.680
I will show you examples
later where, in fact, you

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:29.723
might have a case where
no rays reach p prime.

01:35:29.723 --> 01:35:30.640
You can see that here.

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.970
If I play with the numbers
and make one of these--

01:35:32.970 --> 01:35:35.940
if I play with the numbers
so that one of the sines

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:39.320
becomes bigger than 1, then
the problem becomes impossible,

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:39.820
right?

01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:42.210
So what it means is that
light never makes it there.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:48.940
So this way of thinking
is very typical

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:53.680
when we deal with minimization
principles like Fermat

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.800
and Lagrangian
principles in mechanics.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.830
We assume that our
particle, or our system,

01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:03.270
or whatever has followed
a trajectory that

01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:06.880
connects an initial point in
the space with the final point

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.100
in the space.

01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:10.480
And then we try to find a
trajectory that minimizes

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:13.450
the part between the two points,
whether it is optical path

01:36:13.450 --> 01:36:17.800
length, or Lagrangian
in mechanics,

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:20.380
or a lot of other
different contexts

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:22.660
where the same thinking applied.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.057
Any other questions?

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.250
OK, so I will see you--

01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:39.100
I will see you all in
Singapore next week,

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:43.500
and I will see you all
on video next week.

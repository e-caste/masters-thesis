00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:16.440
MICHALE FEE: So
today, we're going

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.780
to introduce a new
topic, which is related

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.850
to the idea of
fine-tuning curves,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.650
and that is the notion
of receptive fields.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.350
So most of you
have probably been,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.710
at least those of you who've
taken 9.01 or 9.00 maybe,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.630
have been exposed to the idea
of what a receptive field is.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.740
The idea is basically
that in sensory systems

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.160
neurons receive input from
the sensory periphery,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.880
and neurons generally have
some kind of sensory stimulus

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.700
that causes them to spike.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.910
And so one of the
classic examples

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.360
of how to find receptive
fields comes from the work

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
of Huble and Wiesel.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.150
So I'll show you
some movies made

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.720
from early experiments
of Huble-Wiesel

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.620
where they are recording in
the visual cortex of the cat.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.140
So they place a
fine metal electrode

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.050
into a primary visual
cortex, and they present.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.570
So then they anesthetize the
cat so the cat can't move.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.220
They open the eye,
and the cat's now

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.340
looking at a screen that
looks like this, where

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.560
they play a visual stimulus.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.600
And they actually did this with
essentially a slide projector

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.280
that they could
put a card in front

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.800
of that had a little
hole in it, for example,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.852
that allowed a spot of light
to project onto the screen.

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:46.560
And then they can move
that spot of light

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.740
around while they record
from neurons in visual cortex

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.590
and present different visual
stimuli to the retina.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.780
So here's what one of
those movies looks like.

00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:03.072
So you're hearing
the actual potential

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:04.690
of a neuron visual cortex.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.010
So you can see the
neuron generates

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.230
lots of spikes when you
turn a spot of light

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.384
on a particular part
of the visual field.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.910
So they will basically play
around with spots of light

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.240
or bars of light and see where
the neuron spikes a light,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.165
and then they would
draw on the screen--

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.885
I think they're going to
draw in a moment here--

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.250
what they would call the
receptive field of the neuron.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.590
So you can see that this neuron
responds with high firing rate

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.600
when you turn on a stimulus
in that small region there.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:22.200
Notice that the cell also
responds when you turn off

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.480
a stimulus that is
right in the area

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.770
surrounding that
small receptor field.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.670
So the neuron has parts of
its receptive field that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.610
respond with increased
firing when you apply light,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.890
and they also have parts
of the receptive field that

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.692
respond with higher firing
rate when you remove light.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.840
That was actually a
cell, I should have said,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.860
that's in the thalamus that
projects to visual cortex.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.550
So that was a thalamic neuron.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.030
Here's what a neuron in
cortex might look like.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.940
So they started recording
in the thalamus.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.079
They saw that those neurons
responded to spots of light

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.612
in small parts of
the visual field.

00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:24.320
They were actually
recording from neurons

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.865
in the visual cortex.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.490
They got kind of--
they couldn't really

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.115
figure out what the
neurons were doing,

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:31.660
and they pulled the slide
out of the projector, which

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.420
made an edge of light moving
across the visual field.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.880
And the neuron they were
recording from at that moment

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.660
responded robustly when
they pulled the slide out.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.310
And they realized,
oh, maybe it's

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.070
an edge that the neuron
is responding to.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.780
And so then they started doing
experiments with bars of light.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.760
Here's an example.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.010
So you can see the neuron
responds when you turn

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.030
a light on in this area here.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.460
But is responds when you turn
light off in this area here.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.250
And so you can see
they're marking

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.490
a symbol for positive responses,
positive responses to light

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.190
on here, and negative
responses or increased firing

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.450
when you turn the light off.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.860
So there's different
parts of the receptive

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.700
field that have positive
and negative components.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.640
But you can see that
the general picture here

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.370
is that the process of
finding receptive fields

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.200
at this early stage
was kind of random.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.050
You just tried different
things and hoped

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.220
to make the neurons spike.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.150
And we're going to come
back to this idea of finding

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.900
receptive fields by
trying random things,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.340
but in a more systematic way,
at the end of the lecture today.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.170
So here's what we're
going to be talking about.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.620
So you can see that
Hubel and Wiesel were

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.340
able to describe that
receptive field by finding

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.040
positive and negative
parts and writing symbols

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.720
down on a screen.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.840
We're going to take a
more mathematical approach

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.190
and think about what that means
in a quantitative model of how

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.860
neurons respond to stimuli.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.890
And the basic model that
we'll be talking about

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.270
is called an LN model,
linear/nonlinear model.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.760
And we're going to
describe neural responses

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.110
as a linear filter that acts on
the sensory stimulus followed

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.500
by a nonlinear function that
just says neurons can only

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.950
fire at positive rates.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.360
So we're going to have our
neurons spike when that filter

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.190
output is positive, but not when
the filter output is negative.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.630
And we're going to describe
spatial receptive fields

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.490
as a correlation
of the receptive

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.668
field with the stimulus.

00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:47.460
And we're also going
to talk about the idea

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.700
of temporal receptive
fields, which

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.850
will be a convolution
of a temporal receptive

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.190
field with the stimulus.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.520
So the firing rate
will be a convolution

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.580
of a receptive field with
the temporal structure

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.600
of the stimulus.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.120
We're going to
then turn to the--

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.130
combine these things
into the concept

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.510
of a spatial temporal receptive
field that simultaneously

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.300
describes the
spatial sensitivity

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.100
and the temporal sensitivity
of a neuron, as an STRF,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.090
as it's called.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.270
And we'll talk about the
concept of separability.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.170
And finally, we're going
to talk about the idea

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.950
of using random noise
to try to drive neurons,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.440
to drive activity in
neurons, and using what's

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:42.050
called a spike-triggered average
to extract the stimulus that

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.790
makes a neuron spike.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.980
And we're going to
use that to compute--

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.020
we're going to see how
to use that to compute

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.550
a spatial temporal receptive
field in the visual system

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.330
or a spectral temporal receptive
field in the auditory system.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.640
So let's start with this.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.520
What are spatial and
temporal receptive fields?

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:13.600
So we just saw how you can think
of a region of the visual space

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.740
that makes a neuron spike when
you turn light on or makes

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.470
a neuron spike when
you turn light off.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.150
And at the simplest
level, you can

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.070
think of that in
the visual system

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.990
as just a part of
the visual field

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.390
that a neuron will respond to.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.140
So if you flash of light over
here, the neuron might respond.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.330
If you flash of light over
here, it won't respond.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.760
So there's this region
of the visual field where

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.050
neurons respond, but it's
more than just a region.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:51.590
There's actually a pattern of
features within that area that

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.930
will make a neuron
spike, and other patterns

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.280
will keep the
neuron from spiking.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.290
And so we can think of a neuron
as having some spatial filter

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.000
that has positive
parts, and I'll

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.860
use green throughout
my lecture today

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.930
for positive parts
of a receptive

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.170
field, and negative parts.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.960
And this is a
classic organization

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.300
of receptive fields,
let's say, in the retina

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:23.030
or in the thalamus, where you
have an excitatory central part

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.576
of a receptive field and
an inhibitory surround

00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:28.880
of the receptive field.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.640
So we can think of
this as a filter that

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.070
acts on the sensory input.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:39.140
And the better the stimulus
overlaps with that filter,

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.550
the more the neuron will spike.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.700
So let's formalize this a
little bit into a model.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.630
So let's say we have
some visual stimulus that

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.380
is an intensity as a
function of position x and y.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.870
We have sum filter, G,
that filters that stimulus.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.950
So we put the stimulus
into this filter.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.720
This filter, in this case,
just looks like, in this case,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.350
an excitatory surround
in an inhibitory center.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.770
That filter has an
output, L, which

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.190
is the response of the filter.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.990
Then we have some nonlinearity.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.370
So we take the response
of the filter, L,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.970
we add it to some
spontaneous firing rate,

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:33.900
and we take the positive
part of that sum

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.790
and call that our firing rate.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.940
So that would be a typical
output nonlinearity.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.910
It's called "a
threshold nonlinearity,"

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.210
where if the sum of
the filter output

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.150
and the spontaneous firing
rate is greater than 0,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.790
then that corresponds to the
firing rate of the neuron.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:58.130
So in this case, you can see
that as a function of L--

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.550
I should have
labeled that axis L--

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.140
as a function of
L, when L is 0, you

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.360
can see the neuron has
some spontaneous firing

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.740
rate, R naught.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.930
And if L is positive,
the rate goes up.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.380
If L is negative, the rate goes
down until the rate hits 0.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:18.380
And then once the neuron stops
firing, it can't go negative.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.040
So the neuron firing
rate stays at 0.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:29.210
And then once you have this
firing rate of the neuron, what

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.210
is it that actually determines
whether the neuron will spike?

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.580
So in most models
like this, there

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.160
is a probabilistic
spike generator

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.930
that is a function of the
rate output of this nonlinear

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.680
output.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.070
It's basically a random process
that generates spikes at a rate

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.600
corresponding to this R.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.930
And in the next
lecture, we're going

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.790
to come back and talk a lot more
about what spike trains look

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.130
like, how to characterize
their randomness,

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.310
and what different
kinds of random

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.760
processes you actually
see in neurons.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.700
A very common one is
the Poisson process,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.980
where there's an equal
probability per unit

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.520
time of a neuron
generating a spike,

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.510
and that probability is
controlled by the firing rate.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.897
We'll come back to that
and discuss it more.

00:12:19.897 --> 00:12:20.480
Any questions?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.147
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:21.147 --> 00:12:23.980
AUDIENCE: Is something
biologically [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.080
something like if the overlap
[INAUDIBLE] it's just it's

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.350
more excitatory?

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.100
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.680
So we're going to
come back in, I think,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.240
a couple lectures
where we're going

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.660
to talk about exactly how you
would build a filter like this

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.070
in a simple feed
forward network.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.900
So at the simplest
level, you can just

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.630
imagine you have a
sensory periphery that

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.160
has neurons in it that
detect, let's say,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.020
light at different positions.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.950
Those neurons send axons
that then impinge on,

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.590
let's say, the neuron that
we're modeling right here.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.170
And the pattern of
those projections,

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.140
both excitatory and inhibitory
projections from the periphery,

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.270
would give you
this linear filter.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.930
And then this nonlinearity would
be a property of this neuron

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.060
that we're modeling.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:11.700
Yes, Jasmine?

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.880
MICHALE FEE: Great, exactly.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.430
So it's going to
turn out that we're

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.490
going to treat this
as a linear filter.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.880
The output of this
filter will be calculated

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:33.090
for a spatial receptive field as
the correlation of this filter

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.500
with the stimulus.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.760
But in the time domain, when we
calculate a temporal receptive

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.453
field, we're going
to use a convolution.

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:42.870
And we'll get to
that in a minute.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.100
That's the very next thing.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.407
Great question.

00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:45.990
Anything else?

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.080
So that's called a LN model.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.110
I should have put
that on the slide--

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.390
linear/nonlinear model.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.590
So let's describe
that mathematically.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.780
So let's say we have a
two-dimensional receptive

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.590
field.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.590
We're going to call
that G of x and y.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.710
So remember, we had intensity
as a function of x and y.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.310
There's our stimulus input.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.170
And we're going to ask, how
well does that stimulus overlap

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.430
with this receptive field?

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.900
And we're going to describe the
receptive field as a function

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.830
on this space, x and y.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.250
And our linear
model is going to be

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:40.950
how well the stimulus
matches or overlaps

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.720
with the receptive field.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.960
And we do that just by
multiplying the receptive

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.910
field times the stimulus and
integrating over x and y.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.480
x and y, just think of it
as a position on the retina.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.600
So let's look at this
in one dimension.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.700
So remember, this
was a receptive

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.520
field that has a
positive central region

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.960
and an inhibitory surround.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.730
So if we just take
a slice through that

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.390
and plot G as a
function of x, you

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:16.170
can see that there is a positive
central lobe and inhibitory

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.800
surround, inhibitory side load.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.190
That's a very, very common
receptive field early

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.650
in the visual
system, in the retina

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.800
and in the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.000
So in one dimension, we just
take this receptive field, G,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.820
multiply it by the
stimulus pattern,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.920
and integrate over position.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.580
That is L. That's the
output of the linear filter.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.700
We're going to add that to
a spontaneous firing rate,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.340
and that gives us the
firing rate of our neuron.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.420
And you can see
that that's like--

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.900
that this product,
an integral over x,

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.800
is just like a correlation--

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:05.450
G of I times intensity
of I summed over I.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.440
So let's walk through
what that looks like.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.880
So here's G of x,
the receptive field.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.060
Let's say that's our
intensity profile.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.540
So we're going to have a
bright spot of light surrounded

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.750
by a darker side lobe.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.880
So the way to think
about this is,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.700
in visual neuroscience
experiments, usually

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.610
the background is kind of gray.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:34.140
And you'll have bright spots,
like here, and dark spots,

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.000
like there.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.010
And the rest will just be gray.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.420
So that's how you get positive
and negative intensities here,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:48.150
because they're relative to
some kind of gray background.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.792
And so now we can just
multiply those two together.

00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:53.000
And you can see that when
you multiply positive times

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.010
positive, you get positive.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.490
And when you multiply
negative times negative,

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.490
you get positive.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.590
And when you integrate
over position x,

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.670
you get a big number.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.930
You get some positive number.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.480
So that neuron,
that stimulus, would

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.730
make this a neuron
with this receptive

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.310
field likely to spike.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.650
Let's consider this case.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.829
Now, instead of a small
spot of light centered

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:28.580
over the excitatory lobe
of the receptive field,

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:34.330
you have a broad
spot of light that

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.540
covers both the excitatory
and inhibitory lobes

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.560
of the receptive field.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.518
What's going to happen?

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.040
Yeah?

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.210
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.900
You're going to get a positive
times of positive here,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.860
and a negative times a positive.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.790
And so you're going to
get negative contribution

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.060
from the side lobes,
and those things

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:03.370
can exactly cancel out when
you integrate over position.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.880
And so you can get a
very small response.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.900
If you have--

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.700
I'm not going to go
through this example,

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.720
but it's pretty obvious.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.960
If you were to have
light here, and then dark

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.300
here, and then light
there, you would

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.580
have only these negative
side lobes activated.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.760
You would have no contribution
from this excitatory lobe,

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.995
and the integral would
actually be negative.

00:18:28.995 --> 00:18:31.120
And so the firing rate of
the neuron would go down.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.900
Do you remember seeing
those different points

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.210
in that first
movie where you saw

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.700
the donut of light turning on?

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.080
The neuron kind of shuts off
when you turn that light on.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.793
Yes?

00:18:49.793 --> 00:18:51.960
AUDIENCE: So I'm
just curious what

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.420
we're signing up 0 [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.170
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.460
So 0 is just this
gray background.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.900
It's some intermediate
level of light intensity--

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.990
pretty straightforward.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.830
So that's a spatial
receptive field right there.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.620
We refer to this correlation
process, this linear filter

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.320
as linear, because you
can see that if you

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.400
put in half the light
intensity, let's say,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.420
you get half the product.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.730
And when you integrate, you
get half the neural response.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.050
If you take the stimulus and you
cut it in half so that you only

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.760
apply light and dark to
half the receptive field,

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.810
then you'll also get half
the response of the neuron.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.180
Because this will contribute
to the integral and this

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.270
won't, and so you'll
get a neural response

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.300
that's half as big.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.510
So in this model, the
response varies linearly

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.610
with this overlap of
the receptive field

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.250
and the intensity.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.670
So that's where the
term linear comes from.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.140
Any question about that?

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.650
Correlation is a
linear operation.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.740
So the next thing we're
going to talk about

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.760
is temporal receptive field.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.570
So we just talked about
spatial receptive fields.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:25.400
Neurons are also very sensitive
to how things vary in time.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.220
So we're going to
take the same concept.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.150
Instead of a stimulus that's
a function of position

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.890
on the retina, let's
say, we're going

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.890
to take a stimulus that's
a function of time.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.360
And we're going to operate
on that temporal stimulus

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.300
with a filter that [INAUDIBLE]
a temporal sensitivity.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.220
We're going to get the
output of that filter,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.960
add it to a spontaneous
firing rate,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.460
and we're going to get a
time-dependent firing rate.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.607
So let me just show you
what this looks like.

00:20:56.607 --> 00:20:58.440
So let's say that you
have a stimulus that's

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.680
fluctuating in time.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.950
So imagine that you
have a neuron that

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:05.820
has a spatial receptive
field that's just a blob,

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.210
and you shine just
a positive bump.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.120
And you shine light on it, and
the intensity of that light

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.130
varies.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.440
And this is the
intensity that you

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.310
apply to that spatial receptive
field as a function of time.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:27.390
And again, 0 is some kind
of average gray level.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:32.040
And so you can go dark,
dark, or bright around that.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:38.910
So now, neurons generally
have receptive fields in time,

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.120
and this is what a typical
receptive field might

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.520
look like, a temporal receptive
field might look like,

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.310
for a neuron.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.990
Neurons are often
particularly driven

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:55.520
by stimuli that go dark
briefly and then go

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.630
bright very suddenly, and
that causes a neuron to spike.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:06.820
So we can imagine that
temporal receptive field,

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.150
and sliding it
across the stimulus,

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.960
and measuring the overlap of
that temporal receptive field

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.506
with the stimulus at each time.

00:22:18.506 --> 00:22:20.800
Does that makes sense?

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.640
And so you can see
that most of the time

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.920
that negative bump
and positive bump

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.310
are just going to be
overlapping with just

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.450
lots of random wiggles.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.430
But let's say that
the stimulus has

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.190
a negative part and
then a positive part,

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.730
dark, then bright.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.150
You can see that at
this point that filter

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.890
will have a strong
overlap with the stimulus.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.390
Why?

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.630
Because the negative overlaps
with the negative, and that

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.240
product is positive.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.430
Positive overlaps with positive,
that product is positive.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:23:04.090
And so when you integrate
over time you get peak.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:04.970
Does that make sense?

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:09.580
This is, what I'm plotting here,
is the product of these two

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.140
functions at each
different time step

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.310
as I slide this
temporal receptive

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.290
field over the stimulus.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.218
Does that make sense?

00:23:22.218 --> 00:23:23.260
Any questions about that?

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.790
I'm going to go through that.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.980
We're going to work on
that idea little bit more,

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.206
but if you have any
questions, now's a good time.

00:23:31.206 --> 00:23:40.243
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:40.243 --> 00:23:41.660
MICHALE FEE: So
you're asking, why

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.650
is it correlation in
the spatial domain?

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.740
Because-- well, let me
answer that question

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.030
after we define what
this is mathematically.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.570
So what is this mathematically?

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.570
AUDIENCE: A convolution.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.903
MICHALE FEE: It's a convolution.

00:23:56.903 --> 00:23:58.710
It's exactly what we talked--

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:03.530
it's a lot like what we talked
about when we talked synapses.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.560
In that case, we had
some delta functions here

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.110
corresponding to
spikes coming in,

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.310
and the synaptic response was
like some decaying exponential.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:18.380
And we slid that
over the stimulus.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:23.340
In this case, we have this
fluctuating sensory input,

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:29.240
this light intensity, and we're
sliding that linear response

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.810
of the neuron over and
measuring the overlap

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.930
as a function of position,
and that's a convolution.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.420
Mathematically,
what we're doing is

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.190
we're taking this linear
kernel, this linear filter,

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:54.260
sliding it over the stimulus,
using this variable t,

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.310
and we're integrating
over this variable tau.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:03.480
So we have a kernel, D,
multiplied by the stimulus

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.250
at different times shifts.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.650
We integrate over
tau, and that's

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:12.860
the output of our
temporal receptive field.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:18.860
That's the linear output
of our receptive field.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.050
And we add that to
spontaneous firing right,

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.478
and that gives us a
time-dependent firing

00:25:23.478 --> 00:25:24.270
rate of the neuron.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:24.770
Yes?

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:29.743
AUDIENCE: So is tau how
much we [INAUDIBLE]??

00:25:29.743 --> 00:25:30.910
MICHALE FEE: Great question.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:44.060
t is the location of this kernel
as we're sliding it along.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.910
Tau is the variable that
we're integrating over

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.470
after we multiply them.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.440
Does that make sense?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.110
So we're going to pick a
t, place the kernel down

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.065
at that time, multiply this.

00:25:58.065 --> 00:26:03.510
And remember, this is 0
everywhere outside of here.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.690
And so we're going to multiply
the stimulus by this kernel.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.080
It's going to be-- that product
is going to be 0 everywhere

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.083
except right in here.

00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:12.750
You're going to get
a positive bump when

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.150
you multiply these two,
a positive bump when

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:16.920
you multiply those two.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:22.420
And the integral over tau gives
us this positive peak here.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.970
If we picked a
slightly different t

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.850
so that this thing was lined up
with this positive peak here,

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:32.707
then you'd see that you'd
have positive times negative.

00:26:32.707 --> 00:26:33.790
That gives you a negative.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.710
When you integrate over
tau, that gives you

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.560
this negative peak here.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.640
Does that makes sense?

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.410
So let's just go
back to the math.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.130
So you can see that we're
integrating over tau,

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:50.290
but we're sliding the
relative position of D and S

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.280
with this variable t.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:52.780
Yes?

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.162
AUDIENCE: Is that
the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:55.162 --> 00:26:55.870
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.593
S is the stimulus.

00:26:57.593 --> 00:26:58.135
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:26:58.135 --> 00:26:59.500
And D is the kernel?

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.538
MICHALE FEE: D is
the linear kernel.

00:27:02.538 --> 00:27:03.038
Yes?

00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:06.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:10.970
MICHALE FEE: So nature chooses
the shape of the kernel for us.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:15.380
So that is the receptive
field of neurons.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.110
Now, I just made this
up to demonstrate

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.520
what this process looks like.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.870
But in real life, this is
the property of a neuron,

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.030
and we're going
to figure out how

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:33.190
to extract this property
from neurons using

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.290
a technique called
spike-triggered average, which

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.030
we'll get to later.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.640
But for now, what
I'm trying to convey

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:44.050
is, if we knew this temporal
receptive field of a neuron,

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:47.230
then we could predict the
firing rate of the neuron

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:50.050
to a time varying stimulus.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.560
That was a very
important question.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.520
Does everyone understand that?

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.240
Because it's one of those
cases where once you see it

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.040
it's pretty obvious,
but sometimes I

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.100
don't explain it well enough.

00:28:06.584 --> 00:28:07.084
Yes?

00:28:07.084 --> 00:28:12.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.840
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.380
So I've already flipped it,
and sometimes you'll see.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.490
So this is all going
this way-- positive tau.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.710
I've flipped it for you already.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.960
Sometimes you'll see it
plotted the other way with tau

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.100
going positive to
the right, but I've

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.450
plotted it this way already.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:41.850
Any questions?

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.990
Oh, and so that was actually
the very next question.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.630
You might normally--
you might sometimes

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.410
see temporal receptive
fields plotted

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.050
this way with positive
tau going to the right.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.340
And kind of meant--

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.310
I always just flip it back over.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.760
Because in this view, you see
that what the neuron responds

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:12.130
to is dark followed by
light, and then right there

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:18.010
is when you have a peak
spiking probability.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.870
Peak firing rate
happens right here.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:22.370
Yes?

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.228
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:25.228 --> 00:29:27.020
MICHALE FEE: So we're
going to get to that.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.680
But typically, neurons
in the retina--

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.320
I'll show you an
example in the retina.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.080
A typical time scale here might
be tens to 100 milliseconds,

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.460
so pretty fast.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.710
So that's called
the temporal kernel

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.360
or the temporal receptive field.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.410
And again, it's
linear in the sense

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:04.120
that if you, for example, had
a stimulus intensity that just

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.380
had this positive bump without
the negative bump, then

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.820
the response would be lower
just by the ratio of areas.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.390
So if you got rid of this
big negative bump here,

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:19.150
then the response would be,
I don't know, a third as big.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.980
It would be linear in the area.

00:30:27.632 --> 00:30:28.760
Let's push on.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.160
So now, let's extend this.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.920
So we've been talking about
spatial receptive fields

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.590
and temporal receptive fields.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.770
But in reality, you can
combine those things together

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.490
into a single concept, called
a "spatial temporal receptive

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:52.780
field," and that's usually
referred to as an STRF.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.200
If you're working in the
auditory system, STRF,

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.570
it's the same
acronym, but it just

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.550
means spectral temporal
receptive field,

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.220
because it's sensitive
to the spectral content

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.650
of the sounds, not
the spatial structure

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.100
of the visual stimulus.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.570
So in general, when you
have a visual stimulus,

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:17.680
it actually depends on
x- and y-coordinates

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.830
in the retina and time.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:24.490
So just I of x and y, which
would be like a still image

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.320
presented to you.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.190
I of x, y, and t is--

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.840
any movie can be
written like that.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:37.720
Your favorite movie is just some
function of I of x, y, and t.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:44.840
And so we're going to now
present to our retina,

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.760
and we're going to simplify
this by considering

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.920
just one spatial dimension.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.080
So we're going to take
your favorite movie

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.720
and just collapse
it into intensity

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.413
as a function of position.

00:31:58.413 --> 00:32:00.080
It's probably not
nearly as interesting,

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.970
but it's much easier to analyze.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.750
So we're going to
write the firing rate

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:08.300
as a function of time
as a spontaneous firing

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:14.570
rate plus a filter, D, which
is a spatial temporal receptive

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:18.200
field acting on that intensity.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.900
And you can see that we're
doing stuff in here that

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:26.190
looks like a convolution
integrating over tau,

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.770
and we're also doing stuff that
looks like a correlation when

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.225
we integrate over x.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:37.990
So there's the convolution
integrating over tau.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.410
What I've done is I've
pulled out the D tau,

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.640
because we can consider--

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.980
I've just written this as
two separate integrals.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.250
So we have an integral over tau
that looks like a convolution.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.502
And we have an integral over x
that looks like a correlation.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.630
So what is separability mean?

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:07.320
So separability is
just a particularly--

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.810
if a receptive
field is separable,

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:15.030
it means that you can write
down a spatial receptive field

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.600
and a temporal receptive
field separately.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.690
And that looks like this.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.700
So I imagine that if you have
a spatial temporal receptive

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:29.760
field, D, that's a function
of position and time.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.170
But you can see
that you can just

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:35.550
write it as a product
of the spatial part

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.890
and the temporal part.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.370
So here, you have a
temporal receptive field

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:44.250
that looks like this, a positive
lobe here and a negative lobe

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:48.240
there, a spatial receptive
field that looks like this, just

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.650
a positive lobe.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.990
And if you multiply
this function

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.560
of x by this function
of t, you can

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.470
see that you get a
function of x and t

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:05.760
that looks like this,
where at any position

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.380
the function of time just
looks like this-- scaled.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.900
And at any time, the
spatial receptive field

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.960
just looks like this.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.239
Does that make sense?

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.130
Other receptive fields
are not separable.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.610
You can see that you
can't write this receptive

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:28.320
field as a product of a
temporal receptive field

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.318
and a spatial receptive field.

00:34:31.318 --> 00:34:32.429
Does that make sense?

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.860
Is that clear why that is?

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:41.449
So basically, you can see
that if you take a slice here

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:44.900
at a particular
position, you can

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.320
see that the
temporal pattern here

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.350
looks very different than
the temporal pattern here.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:54.870
And so you can't
write this simply

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.350
as a product of a spatial and
a temporal receptive field--

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:02.030
separable, inseparable.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.130
So let's take a look at
what happens when you have

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.290
a separable receptive field.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:07.940
Things kind of
become very simple.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.360
We can now write our spatial
temporal receptive field

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.500
as a spatial
receptive field, which

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.630
is a function of position,
times a temporal receptive field

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.190
that's a function of time.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.540
And when you put that into
this integral, what you find

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.710
is that you can pull that
spatial part of the receptive

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:32.050
field out of the
temporal integral.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.800
So basically, the way
you think about this

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.420
is that you find the correlation
of the spatial receptive field

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.070
with the stimulus,
and that gives you

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.250
a time-dependent stimulus,
a stimulus that's

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.110
just a function of time.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:48.650
Then you can convolve the
temporal receptive field

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.080
with that
time-dependent stimulus.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:57.620
So you can really just treat
it as two separate processes,

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.510
which can be kind
of convenient just

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.030
for thinking about
how a neuron will

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.060
respond to different stimuli.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:16.430
So let's just think about,
develop some intuition about,

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.790
how neurons with a
particular receptive field

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:22.660
will respond to a
particular stimulus.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.355
So here's what I've done.

00:36:24.355 --> 00:36:31.720
I've taken a spatial temporal
receptive field here.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.060
This is a function
of position and time,

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.210
and we're going to figure
out how that neuron responds

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.040
to this stimulus.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.150
So this stimulus is also a
function of space and time.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.940
It's one-dimensional in space.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.810
So what does this look like?

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:56.480
This looks like a bar of light
that extends from position 2,

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.440
let's say, 2 millimeters to
4 millimeters on our screen.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.220
And it turns on at
time point 1, stays on,

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.660
and turns off at time point 6.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.136
Let's say 1 second to 6 seconds.

00:37:12.136 --> 00:37:14.060
Does that make sense?

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:19.690
So just imagine we have
a 1D screen, just a bar,

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:26.930
and we turn on light that's
a bar between 2 and 4.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:28.490
So we turn on a bar of light.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:32.250
We turn it on at time 1, and
we turn it off at time 6.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.340
It's just a very simple case.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.010
We flash of light on at
a particular position,

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.660
and then we turn it off.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.130
So let's see how
this neuron responds.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.520
So what we're going to do
is we're going to slide--

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.480
remember, in the 1D case where
we had the temporal receptive

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.802
field, we just slid it
across the stimulus.

00:37:52.802 --> 00:37:54.510
So we're going to do
the same thing here.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:58.570
We're going to take that spatial
temporal receptive field,

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.020
and we're going to slide
it across the stimulus.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.090
And we're going to
integrate, we're

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:08.670
going to take the product,
and we're going to integrate.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.860
And the integral plus
the spontaneous rate

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.790
is going to be the firing
rate of our neuron.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.890
So what is the
integral right there?

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.380
The product is--

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.082
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:38:24.082 --> 00:38:24.790
MICHALE FEE: --0.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.610
where? integrate, it's 0.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.310
So we're going to add a
spontaneous firing rate, which

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.130
will be right there.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.870
So that will be our firing rate.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.460
Now, let's slide the
stimulus a little further.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.785
That means that this
time we're asking,

00:38:38.785 --> 00:38:40.410
what is the firing
rate of that neuron?

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.306
So what is it
going to look like?

00:38:42.306 --> 00:38:43.560
AUDIENCE: Go up a bit.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.910
MICHALE FEE: It's going
to go up a little bit,

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.430
because we have a positive
part of the receptive field.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.730
Green is positive in
our pictures here.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.680
It's going to overlap
with this bar of light,

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.850
because that neuron is sensitive
to light between, let's say,

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:02.560
1 and 4, positions 1
and 4 on the screen.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.870
And so the light is falling
within the positive part

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.390
of that receptive field,
and so the neuron's

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:14.260
going to increase
its firing rate.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.140
So now what's going to happen?

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.263
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:19.263 --> 00:39:20.680
MICHALE FEE: It's
going to cancel.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:24.100
You're going to get a positive
contribution to the firing rate

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.320
here--

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.400
whoops-- and a negative
contribution here.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.790
And those two are
going to add up.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.430
You're going to multiply
that times that.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.360
That gives you a plus.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.040
That times that
gives you-- sorry.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.820
That times the light that's
shining on it is negative.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.990
Add those up, and
it's going to cancel.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:44.325
And the firing rate's going
to go back to baseline.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:53.340
Now, the light in
this receptive field,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.060
we're continuing to slide it
in time over our stimulus.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.222
What happens here?

00:39:58.222 --> 00:39:59.870
AUDIENCE: Same thing.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.700
MICHALE FEE: Same, good.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.320
How about here?

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.247
It's going to go--

00:40:08.247 --> 00:40:08.997
AUDIENCE: Down.

00:40:08.997 --> 00:40:09.830
MICHALE FEE: --down.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:11.660
It's going to dip
down, that's right.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.242
And then?

00:40:13.242 --> 00:40:17.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.460
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.550
By 0, you mean the
spontaneous firing.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:24.646
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:24.646 --> 00:40:26.280
Cool.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:26.780
Yes?

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the rate
of response because the slope

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:32.890
of the line [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:37.840
MICHALE FEE: So you should
think about this thing sliding

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.300
over the stimulus in real time.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.060
So if these are
units of seconds,

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:47.410
then this thing is sliding
across the stimulus

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.100
at 1 second per
second sliding across.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.070
And so that is firing
rate as a function

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.380
of time in those units.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.825
Does that make sense?

00:40:58.825 --> 00:40:59.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.800
But why [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:05.137 --> 00:41:05.970
MICHALE FEE: Oh, OK.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:09.270
Like why doesn't
this go up to here?

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.402
So what's the answer to that?

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:13.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.290
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.910
So how would I
make that steeper?

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.410
How would I make
that go up to here?

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the light.

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:24.360
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.550
AUDIENCE: You'd
turn the light up.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.110
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, you'd turn
the light up, that's right.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.610
This is the receptive
field of a neuron,

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.940
so we generally
can't control that.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.760
So if we wanted to make
this neuron respond more,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.271
we'd turn the light up
to a higher intensity.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.001
Any other questions?

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:51.600
So neurons often have more
complex receptive fields.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.910
So here's an example.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.870
What is this going to do as we
slide this across the stimulus?

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:01.590
What's that?

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.410
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:05.240
It's not going to--

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.948
the neuron isn't going
to respond at all.

00:42:06.948 --> 00:42:14.540
Because as soon as it overlaps,
it has a positive contribution.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.840
The light activates these
lobes of the receptive field,

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.460
but inhibits these lobes
of the receptive field.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:24.543
And the net result is that when
you integrate over the product,

00:42:24.543 --> 00:42:25.460
you're going to get 0.

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:30.370
Does anyone have any idea
what kind of stimulus

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.810
might make this neuron respond?

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.748
This is a very special
kind of receptive field.

00:42:39.748 --> 00:42:40.415
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:42.650
AUDIENCE: The light
goes from [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:43.400
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.156
What is that called?

00:42:45.156 --> 00:42:46.440
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.750
MICHALE FEE: It's called
a stimulus that moves.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:50.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.580
MICHALE FEE: Moves--
a moving stimulus.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.090
Good.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.690
So that's a receptive field that
response to a moving stimulus.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.807
So let's take a look at that.

00:42:59.807 --> 00:43:00.390
So here we go.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.390
Anybody want to take a guess
at what this stimulus will

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:07.560
do to this neuron?

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.270
Can you visualize
sliding it across?

00:43:13.406 --> 00:43:17.945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:17.945 --> 00:43:19.070
MICHALE FEE: And then what?

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:19.945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:19.945 --> 00:43:20.700
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.970
You can see that this--

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:27.080
so let's describe
what this [AUDIO OUT]..

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:33.450
So we've turned a bar of
light on here between 0 and 2,

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:39.460
and then we slide it up over
the course of a few seconds.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.540
So we've turned a spot of light
on, and then we move it up--

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.420
off.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.670
So it's a spot of light that
turns on, moves, and then

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.880
disappears.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.290
So let's walk through it.

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:55.720
So there's a little
bit of overlap

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.120
there, so the
neuron's firing rate

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.460
is going to start going up.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.940
But then as it goes
further, this light

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.850
is now activating
those inhibitory lobes,

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:14.510
which is going to have
a negative contribution.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.100
So when you take
the product, you're

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:23.430
going to get lots of negatives
there, very little contribution

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.950
from the positive lobes,
and so the firing rate's

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:26.980
going to go down.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.240
And what happens
is it goes down,

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.150
and once the firing rate hits 0,
it can't go any more negative.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:38.150
So the firing rate is
just going to sit at 0

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:43.200
until this stimulus moves
out of the temporal receptor

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.390
of this neuron.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:46.567
And then what?

00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:47.418
AUDIENCE: Back up.

00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:48.960
MICHALE FEE: It's
going to go back up

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.110
to the spontaneous rate.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:57.970
So what kind of stimulus
will activate this neuron?

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:06.470
A stimulus that
moves from top down.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.910
So let's take a look at that.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.940
So here's our stimulus.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.730
You see that it's going to
just hit that inhibitory lobe,

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:16.870
go down a little bit.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:22.240
And then the excitatory
lobes of the receptive field

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.760
are going to overlap
with the stimulus.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.720
You're going to get
a big positive peak,

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.860
and then the stimulus will move
out of the receptive field,

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.410
and the firing rate will
go back down to baseline.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:53.420
Any questions about that?

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:57.520
So that's very common,
in both the visual system

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.040
and in the auditory
system, to have

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.340
neurons that are responsive
to moving stimuli.

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:07.020
What does moving stimulus
mean in the auditory system?

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.160
AUDIENCE: Changing pitch.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.618
MICHALE FEE: Right,
changing pitch.

00:46:09.618 --> 00:46:11.220
So [WHISTLE], like that.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.680
That activated a
gazillion neurons

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.450
in your brain that are sensitive
to upward-going pitches

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.540
that you have
structure like this.

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.440
Isn't that crazy?

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:22.940
[WHISTLE]

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.815
I can control all the
neurons in your brain--

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:25.380
[WHISTLE]

00:46:26.838 --> 00:46:29.910
[LAUGHS]

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:33.960
--at least the ones that
respond to whistles.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.960
So now that we've
seen mathematically

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:43.700
how to think about what
a receptive field is

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:49.750
and how it interacts
with a sensory stimulus,

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:52.170
how do you actually
discover what the receptive

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.500
field of a neuron is?

00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:01.030
That turns out to actually be
a very challenging problem.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:04.350
So in very early
parts of the visual

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:08.010
and the auditory system, like
in the retina and the LGN,

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:12.630
and as far as, let's
say, V1 in visual cortex,

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.570
it's been possible to find
receptive fields of neurons

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:21.420
by basically just randomly
flashing bars and dots of light

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:26.435
and just hoping to get lucky
and find what the response is.

00:47:26.435 --> 00:47:30.570
It turns out that that's
generally a very--

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.080
it can be a very
time-consuming process.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.040
And so people have
worked out ways

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.560
of discovering the
receptive fields of neurons

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.265
in a much more systematic way.

00:47:39.265 --> 00:47:41.640
And that's what we're going
to talk about next-- the idea

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.328
of a spike-triggered average.

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:45.120
So here's the idea.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:51.410
We're going to take a stimulus,
and we're going to basically--

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:54.140
we're basically just
going to make noise,

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.410
just a very noisy stimulus.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:00.950
So we're going to take, let's
say, an intensity, a light,

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.145
a spot of light, and we're
going to fluctuate the intensity

00:48:04.145 --> 00:48:06.620
of that light very rapidly.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:10.050
And we're going to do that
basically with a computer.

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:12.910
We just take a computer, make
a random number generator,

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:17.240
hook that up to, let's
say, a light source

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.570
that we can control the
brightness of with a voltage.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.790
And then have the
computer generate--

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:25.550
put out that random
number sequence,

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:30.005
control the light level,
and then play that to our,

00:48:30.005 --> 00:48:32.663
let's say, our visual neuron.

00:48:32.663 --> 00:48:34.080
And that neuron
is going to spike.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:43.530
And now, what we can do is
take the times of those spikes

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.840
and go back figure
out basically what

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.910
made the neuron fire post-hoc.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.630
So if we do that here, you can
basically take the spike times.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:57.290
Now, you know that whatever
made the neuron spike happened

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:59.120
before the spike.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.310
It didn't happen
after the spike.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.650
So you can basically
ignore whatever

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:07.730
happened after the spike and
just consider the stimulus that

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:09.770
came in prior to the spike.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:13.910
So we're just going to take a
little block of the stimulus

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:15.590
prior to the spike,
and we're going

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:18.110
to do that for every spike
that the neuron generates,

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.710
and we're going to pile those
up and take an average--

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.260
spike-triggered.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.250
That's it.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.730
And that is going to be--

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:37.850
what's really cool is
that you can show that

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:41.990
under some conditions that
spike-triggered average is

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:46.550
actually just the receptive
field of the neuron.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:48.920
It's the linear receptive
field of the neuron.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.720
So let's think-- and you can
write that down as follows.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.930
We're going to add a stimulus.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.930
We're going to write down the
times at which all these spikes

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:12.440
occur, t sub i, or the
times in the stimulus

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.150
at which the spikes occur.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:22.290
We're going to take the stimulus
at those times minus some tau,

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:26.230
and we're going to average them
over all the spikes, all the n

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.580
spikes, that we've measured.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:36.610
And that K of tau is going to
be the spike-triggered average,

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:42.120
and in many cases, it's
actually the linear kernel.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.300
Now, let's think for a moment
about what the conditions are.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.100
What kind of
stimulus do you have

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:51.630
to use in order to get the
spike-triggered average

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:55.560
to actually be the linear kernel
of the neuron, that receptive

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.740
field of the neuron?

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:59.160
Any guesses?

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.320
Let me give you a hint.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.840
What happens if I
take a stimulus that

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.660
varies very slowly?

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.790
So instead of having
these wiggles,

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.280
it just goes like this.

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.700
It has very slow,
random wiggles.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:18.380
Will that be a good stimulus for
extracting the receptive field?

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:18.930
Why is that?

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:21.950
Yes?

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:34.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:35.390
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:41.060
So I think what you're saying
is that that stimulus is very

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.450
slow, and it doesn't
actually have

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:50.270
the fast fluctuations in it
that makes the neuron spike.

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:55.250
If the stimulus varies
very slowly, then it--

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:57.780
see, this neuron likes to
have this very fast wiggle,

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.950
this negative followed
by a positive.

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:05.090
But if the stimulus you
put in just varies slowly,

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:07.070
then that stimulus
doesn't actually

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:11.250
have the kind of signal that's
needed to activate this neuron.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:11.750
Yes?

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.738
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the stimulus [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:13.738 --> 00:52:16.590
smaller than tau?

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:20.850
MICHALE FEE: Well, tau is just
the variable that describes

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:25.140
the temporal receptive field.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:28.620
But I think what you're saying
is that the stimulus varies

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.530
more slowly than the
temporal structure

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:34.740
in the receptive field, in
the temporal receptive field.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.390
That's right.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:40.990
Tau is just this variable that
we define the receptive field

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.490
on.

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.450
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.075
AUDIENCE: So when we
add up an average,

00:52:44.075 --> 00:52:47.495
are we actually adding
up from everything

00:52:47.495 --> 00:52:50.370
before the spike,
everything before the spike?

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:51.780
MICHALE FEE: So great question.

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:55.965
So how far back do you think
you would need to average?

00:52:55.965 --> 00:52:59.118
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:59.118 --> 00:52:59.910
MICHALE FEE: Maybe.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:02.880
I mean, in principle, you
could have spikes happening

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.510
very fast, and you
could have signal

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.940
that affects the response
of a neuron from even

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.380
before the last spike.

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.980
But in general, what
do you think the answer

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.810
to that question is?

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.170
Brainstorm some more ideas.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.700
So let's say that you were
recording in the retina,

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:28.800
and you knew that neurons tend
to respond to visual stimuli

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.290
only for--

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.890
that temporal receptive
fields in the retina

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:38.410
never extend back more
than 100 milliseconds.

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:41.770
Then how would you
choose that window?

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:44.290
You would just choose this
window to be 100 milliseconds,

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:45.570
and that would be it.

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:47.610
If you're recording
in a brain area

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:50.370
that you really have
no idea, then you

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:52.180
have to actually try
different things.

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.882
So you can try a window that
goes back 100 milliseconds.

00:53:55.882 --> 00:53:57.840
And if when you do the
spike-triggered average,

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.858
it hasn't gone to 0 yet, then
you need to take more window.

00:54:02.858 --> 00:54:03.900
So you can figure it out.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.390
You can create a short
window, and it only

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:08.730
takes-- like you change one
number in your Matlab code,

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:11.670
and hit Run again,
and do it again.

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:14.060
It's pretty simple.

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.170
Yes?

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:19.202
AUDIENCE: So when you've
got like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:19.202 --> 00:54:19.910
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:23.000
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
that depend [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:33.490
what kind of filter [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:35.600
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.650
So you're saying that the
stimulus that you choose

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:43.260
actually depends on the kinds
of filters that the neurons are,

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.320
right?

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.054
Actually, the right
answer, it depends.

00:54:48.054 --> 00:54:49.137
AUDIENCE: And so we have--

00:54:49.137 --> 00:54:51.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.500
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.550
So generally, the statement
is that the stimulus you use

00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:01.240
has to have fluctuations
in it that are faster

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.220
than the fluctuations
in the kernel

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:06.060
that you're trying to measure.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:10.710
And so most people choose
what's called a "white noise

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:12.390
stimulus."

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:15.360
And white noise stimulus
comes from the idea

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.350
that when you take
the spectrum--

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:22.630
and we're going to get
into spectra next week.

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:25.170
But when you look at the
spectrum of the stimulus,

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:26.940
and you take the
Fourier transform of it

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.560
and look at how much power there
is as a function of frequency,

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.780
the spectrum is flat.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:41.110
And just like in colors, white
light has a flat spectrum.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:47.330
And so the term evolved to a
noise that has a flat spectrum

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:48.890
white noise.

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:52.400
And that's what people
generally refer to when they

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.990
do spike-triggered averages.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:58.610
They use noise that
has a flat spectrum.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:02.210
And so you'll often
refer to people

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:05.360
saying that they've used a
white noise stimulus to extract

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.970
a spike-triggered average.

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:18.260
Now, of course, you
can't ever make a noise

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.990
that truly has a flat spectrum.

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:23.960
You have to-- you
can only make things

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.720
fluctuate as fast as your
experimental setup can

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.620
make them fluctuate.

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.020
So things eventually fall off.

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.140
Fortunately, neurons tend to
have receptive fields that

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:36.620
only have fluctuations
that are on the scale of 10

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:41.287
milliseconds, or maybe a
millisecond in extreme cases.

00:56:41.287 --> 00:56:43.912
Maybe in the auditory system you
might get a little fluctuation

00:56:43.912 --> 00:56:46.190
for a millisecond, and
that's generally pretty

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:48.140
slow for an experimental setup.

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.240
So you choose a
white noise stimulus,

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.240
where white noise means
it's got fluctuations

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.760
faster than the
fastest fluctuations

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:08.710
in the temporal receptive field,
and that for real neurons tends

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:12.250
to be, even in
early sensory areas,

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.880
tends to be on the scale of
millisecond fluctuations.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:22.470
And in higher brain
areas, they would

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:24.420
have even slower fluctuations.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.790
Now, let me just say one word
about spike-triggered average.

00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:31.090
It works really well
in lower sensor areas.

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:35.950
But once you get up out
of primary sensory areas,

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:37.990
this method doesn't
work any more.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:42.220
Neurons don't actually have
simple receptive fields.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:49.480
And this method starts not
working so well outside

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.450
of primary sensory areas.

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:57.990
But before I get too much
into the limitations of this,

00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:00.120
let me just show you
some examples where it

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.500
works really beautifully well.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:07.440
So this is--

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.770
I'll show you some slides that
I got from Marcus Meister, who

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:11.460
studies--

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.320
he's at Caltech.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.000
He used to be at Harvard,
and he studies the retina.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.410
And so he developed this setup
for extracting receptive fields

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.887
of retinal neurons.

00:58:20.887 --> 00:58:21.720
And here's the idea.

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.810
So here's a piece of retina,
thats a representation

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:27.613
of the circuitry in the cells
within a piece of retina.

00:58:27.613 --> 00:58:29.280
You extract the retina,
and you place it

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:34.380
on a dish, a special dish,
that has electrodes embedded,

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.720
metal electrodes
embedded, in the glass,

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.730
sort of on the
surface of the glass.

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:39.990
You take the retina out.

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:42.430
You press it down
onto the glass.

00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:46.050
So now the electrodes are
sensing the spiking activity

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:50.940
of these neurons down here
in the retinal ganglion cell

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:51.990
layer.

00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:54.450
These are the
photoreceptors up here.

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:58.440
And then what he does is he
has a computer monitor that's

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.400
generating random patterns
of visual stimuli,

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.560
and you project that
using a lens down

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.600
onto the photoreceptors
of the retina.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.450
And those neurons now
make lots of spikes,

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:16.920
and you can extract those spikes
using the methods that you

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.480
saw in the video from Tuesday.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.730
So here's what those
signals look like.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.880
This just shows the signal
on four different electrodes

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.350
that happen to be
right near each other,

00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:33.450
like four adjacent electrodes
on this electrode array.

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:37.260
And you can see that you
get spike wave forms on all

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:39.820
these different electrodes.

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:44.250
You can see that you get--

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:47.790
that you see what looks like
lots of cells on these four

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:48.720
electrodes.

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.310
One really interesting
thing to note

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:52.920
is that these electrodes are
actually placed close enough

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.980
together that multiple
electrodes detect

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.980
the spike signal
from a single cell.

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.085
So you can see right
here, here's a spike.

01:00:02.085 --> 01:00:05.740
It exactly lines up with the
spike on this other electrode.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.950
So here is a spike on one
electrode that lines up

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.625
with a spike on
another electrode.

01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:11.250
You can see there's
a little blip there

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:12.480
and a little blip there.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.100
All of those spikes are
actually from a single cell

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.230
whose electrical
activity is picked up

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:22.520
on four adjacent electrodes.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.020
David?

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.820
AUDIENCE: Is this the raw data?

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:25.570
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:28.888
This is the raw voltage data
coming out of those electrodes.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.060
And you can see here's at a
different cell right here.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.430
You can see that this cell has
a peak of voltage fluctuation

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:40.810
on electrode two.

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:43.120
You see a little blip there,
and a little blip there,

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.080
and nothing there.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.910
And here is yet
another cell that

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:52.210
has a big peak on electrode
three, essentially nothing,

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:54.460
maybe a small bump there.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:02.630
So you can actually extract
many different cells

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:04.490
looking at the patterns
of activity that

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:06.950
appear on nearby electrodes.

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:10.100
And it turns out that this
multi-electrode array system

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:14.210
is actually very
powerful for extracting

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:17.210
many different
cells, the spiking

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.680
activity of many
different cells,

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.530
out of a piece of tissue.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.330
So what you can do is you put
this through what's called

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:30.900
a "spike-sorting algorithm,"
which uses these different

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.600
spike wave forms on these
different electrodes to pull

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.640
out a spike train.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.760
And the spike train is now
going to be a delta function

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.560
for each different
neuron that you've

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.130
identified in this data set.

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:47.778
So even though
different neurons appear

01:01:47.778 --> 01:01:49.320
on these different
electrodes, you're

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.630
eventually going to extract
this now so that you

01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:54.750
have a spike train
for one neuron,

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.630
a spike train for
another neuron,

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.720
a spike train for a
third neuron, and so on.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.940
And then you can
plot the firing rate

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.600
of those different neurons.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.890
This is actually a histogram,
a peristimulus histogram,

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:15.260
of the activity of a
bunch of different neurons

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:22.900
to a movie being played to this
piece of retina in the dish.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:27.602
And that's just literally a
movie from a forest with trees

01:02:27.602 --> 01:02:28.810
swaying around in the breeze.

01:02:33.403 --> 01:02:35.070
So you have all these
different neurons.

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:40.920
And you can see that each neuron
responds to a different feature

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.480
of that movie.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.900
And that's because each neuron
has a receptive field that's

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.820
in a slightly
different location,

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:52.020
has a slightly different spatial
and temporal receptive field,

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.010
that it allows it to pick
out different features

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:58.530
of the visual stimulus.

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:02.460
And there are about a million
of these neurons that project

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.480
on the back of the retina.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.110
Actually, I should be careful.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:12.868
It's actually the-- it's
the back of the retina.

01:03:12.868 --> 01:03:14.910
Because the light goes
through the ganglion cells

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:17.215
through the photo receptors,
which are actually--

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:21.650
sorry.

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:24.870
Photoreceptors are actually
on the backside of the retina.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.700
Ganglion cells are on
the front, and light

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.660
goes through the ganglion cells
to get to the photoreceptors.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.790
And there are million of
those retinal ganglion

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:35.010
cells that then project
up through the optic nerve

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:36.585
to the thalamus.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.810
So how do we figure out
what each of those neurons

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:48.160
is actually responding
to in this movie?

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.950
So what we can do is--

01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:56.100
you could imagine doing
a spike-triggered average

01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.800
of these neurons
to the movie that's

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.690
playing the trees
swaying in the breeze.

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:06.090
But why would you
not want to do that?

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:07.400
Why would that be a bad idea?

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:15.150
What is it that
we just decided is

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:20.480
the best kind of stimulus to
use to extract receptive fields?

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.260
This is a highly
structured stimulus

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:34.310
that's got particular
patterns in the stimulus

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:37.290
and both in space and in time.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.290
So it's really not
an optimal stimulus

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.780
for finding the receptive
fields in neurons.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.740
What we want to do is to
make a very noisy stimulus

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.800
that we can play, and
that's what they did.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.370
So then they make
this, what they

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:55.850
call in the visual system,
a "random flicker stimulus."

01:04:55.850 --> 01:05:00.140
So it's basically a movie
where you randomly choose that

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:06.530
the pixel values, both in R, G,
and B-- red, blue, and green--

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:09.127
for each stimulus
at each time step.

01:05:09.127 --> 01:05:10.460
And here's what that looks like.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:20.250
So now, you play that
movie to the retina,

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.810
and you record the spike trains.

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.470
So there's the neurons spiking.

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:26.670
And now what you do is you--

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:29.490
because this is now a
two-dimensional stimulus, what

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:34.650
you do is you have to collect
the samples of the movie

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:40.262
at a bunch of time steps
prior to the neurons spiking.

01:05:40.262 --> 01:05:42.690
Does that make sense?

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:45.960
Now, you do that for
each spike that occurs.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.210
And now, you average
those all together

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:51.270
to produce a little
movie of what

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:55.920
happened on average before
each spike of the neuron.

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:01.038
And here's what that looks like.

01:06:01.038 --> 01:06:02.580
So this is for two
different neurons.

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:12.420
So what is that?

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.970
So this is time across the top.

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:19.680
So it starts at
minus half a second.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:25.540
So what did that look like?

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.680
What was it that made
that neurons spike?

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:32.910
What was it that happened right
before that neuron spiked?

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:43.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:44.390
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, a dark spot.

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:49.990
So that neuron was excited
by a spot of light,

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:55.170
sorry, by a stimulus that
looked like a darkness right

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:59.120
in that location right there.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.640
So that neuron is essentially
being inhibited by light

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.600
at that location.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.090
And when the light at
that location goes away,

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:13.997
boom, the neuron is released
from inhibition and spikes.

01:07:13.997 --> 01:07:14.830
Here's another cell.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.150
So that neuron responded
to a spot of light

01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:27.340
right there in that location.

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:30.970
And that's because that
neuron gets excitatory input

01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:37.540
from bipolar cells
that are located

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:41.263
in the retina at that location.

01:07:41.263 --> 01:07:42.930
And those bipolar
cells respond to input

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:45.930
from the photoreceptors
at that location.

01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:47.610
That's called an on cell.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.900
That's called an off cell.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.610
So there are many different
kinds of neurons in the retina.

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.490
There's something like--

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.220
I forget the latest count--

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:02.710
40 or 50 different types of
retinal ganglion cells that

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:08.410
have very specific
responses to visual stimuli.

01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:11.140
So now let's break that down
into a spatial and temporal

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:12.290
receptive field.

01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:15.280
Most-- I probably
shouldn't say most--

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:19.689
but many retinal ganglion cells
are separable in the sense

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:22.180
that they have a
spatial receptive field

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.100
and a temporal receptive
field that are just

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.220
a product of each other.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:30.200
The STRF is a product of a
spatial and temporal component.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.210
So here you can see
as a function of time

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.560
before the spike.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.760
So this is the stimulus
at the time of the spike.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.050
This neuron responds
with a spike

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:46.029
to a spot of light that happened
about 150 milliseconds earlier.

01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:53.520
And here's what that stimulus
looked like as a function

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:57.450
of space on the retina.

01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:59.609
So that's the spatial
receptive field.

01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:02.850
Sorry, that's the spatial
temporal receptive field--

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:06.100
a spatial stimulus as
a function of time.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:10.170
You can write that as a product
of a spatial receptive field

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:11.700
and a temporal receptive field.

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:19.112
So here's what the
spatial receptive field

01:09:19.112 --> 01:09:21.279
looks like, and here's the
temporal receptive field.

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:23.950
You can see that this neuron,
just like the example that we

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:26.569
talked about
earlier, this neuron

01:09:26.569 --> 01:09:33.910
likes to respond when there's a
darkening in the central area,

01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:36.290
followed by a bright spot.

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:47.620
You can see that little bit
of darkening right here.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:50.890
So the response when this
goes dark and then bright.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.520
So that's the visual system.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.910
Let's take a look at auditory
- you use this same method

01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:06.250
for finding receptive fields
in the auditory system.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.190
So we're going to talk briefly.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:14.530
We're going to come back
to spectral analysis

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:18.910
and spectral processing
of signals in a couple

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:20.920
lectures, but let
me just introduce

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.780
some of the basic ideas.

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:24.670
So we're going to
talk about the idea

01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:28.600
of a spectral
representation of a sound.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.371
So this is a
microphone signal of--

01:10:32.371 --> 01:10:35.080
let me see if you can
guess what it is--

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.630
of a creature.

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:41.060
There are parts of this stimulus
that have high frequency.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.910
So this is a microphone signal.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:47.290
It fluctuates due to
fluctuations in air pressure

01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:48.790
when you hear something.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:52.000
Parts of that signal have
high-frequency fluctuations.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.970
Parts of that signal have
low-frequency fluctuations.

01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:57.770
You can compute a
Fourier transform--

01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:00.520
which we'll talk
about more later--

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.750
as a function of time
stimulus and see what

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:07.500
the spectral components are.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.120
So this is a spectrogram of the
sound that I just-- right now.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.190
But you can see frequency
as a function of time,

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.110
and the intensity, or in this
case the darkness on the plot,

01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:20.470
shows you how much
energy there is

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:23.390
at a particular frequency
at a particular time,

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:25.830
so frequency as a
function of time.

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:30.200
And now, neurons respond
to stimuli like this.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.010
It's a canary song.

01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:38.630
And neurons respond
to different sounds.

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:42.890
And so you can discover
what sounds activate neurons

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:44.300
by doing the same trick.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.260
So I'll show you.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:50.000
This is from a paper from
Michael Merzenich's lab.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.310
This was worked on by
Christophe deCharms

01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:55.560
who was a post-doc
in the Merzenich lab.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.720
And basically, what
you can do is--

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.220
OK.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:01.460
So this is for calculating
a visual receptive field.

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:04.310
For calculating an auditory
receptive field, what

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:08.570
you can do is you can
basically play noisy stimuli

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:10.580
in auditory space.

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:15.230
So what you can do is present
random patterns of tones.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:20.265
So this is frequency,
and this is time.

01:12:20.265 --> 01:12:21.640
And so what you
can do is you can

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:27.850
make a little chords of
tone, tone, tone that last,

01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:30.080
let's say, 20 milliseconds.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.160
And then you make a different
random combination of tones,

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.650
and then a different random
combination of tones.

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:41.880
And this sounds like a very
scrambled, noisy stimulus.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.760
And you play this to the
animal while you're recording

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.040
a neuron in auditory cortex.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.800
The neuron spikes.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.810
And then what you can do is
just do exactly the same trick.

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.700
You can look at
the stimulus that

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:02.590
occurred before each spike,
pile up those columns.

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:06.730
There's a little
spectrum temporal pattern

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:09.610
of stimuli that the bird--

01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:12.460
in this case, a
monkey heard right

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.990
before that neuron spiked.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:15.270
And you can do the same thing.

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:19.150
You can take that little
snapshot of that sound

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:22.992
and average them together.

01:13:22.992 --> 01:13:24.700
And here are the kinds
of things you see.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:28.090
So that's a spectro-temporal
receptive field.

01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:29.950
You can see I plotted it.

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:33.340
It's plotted in a way that
this is the stimulus that

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:35.800
occurs with the spike.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.510
So this is like the D
plotted already flipped.

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:45.430
And you can see that--
how would you describe

01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:49.653
what this neuron responds to?

01:13:49.653 --> 01:13:50.820
How would you describe that?

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.910
So this is frequently.

01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:58.990
Sorry, this is
frequency in kilohertz.

01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:02.490
And that's time in milliseconds.

01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:05.914
So what do you think
this neuron responds to?

01:14:05.914 --> 01:14:08.218
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:08.218 --> 01:14:09.260
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.908
AUDIENCE: It
responds [INAUDIBLE]..

01:14:10.908 --> 01:14:12.850
MICHALE FEE: It responds
maximally, actually,

01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:17.680
to a very short
tone at 4 kilohertz.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.970
You see how it kind of
has some inhibition there?

01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:22.300
See how it's kind of
darker right there?

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.930
So this neuron actually
will respond better

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:28.350
to a tone that only lasts
20 milliseconds than it will

01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:32.380
to a tone that
lasts a long time.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:36.220
So this is a neuron that
responds to a short tone pulse.

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.140
What happens if
we play a stimulus

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.650
to this neuron that's broad?

01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:44.170
That instead of just
being a tone, [WHISTLE],,

01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:45.460
is broad, like [STATIC]?

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:54.210
The noise that's
at 4 kilohertz here

01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:56.310
will tend to excite the
neuron, but the noise

01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:58.770
that's over here at 5
kilohertz or 3 kilohertz

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:00.640
will tend to inhibit the neuron.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.080
So the best response,
the best stimulus

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.170
to make this neuron
respond, is a pure tone

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:12.440
at 4 kilohertz that lasts
about 20-ish milliseconds.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.380
How about this?

01:15:17.307 --> 01:15:19.140
Let's take a look at
this neuron right here.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.180
What about that neuron?

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:23.580
What does that neuron
want to respond to?

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.810
What does it like to hear?

01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:28.318
I'm anthropomorphizing
shamelessly.

01:15:28.318 --> 01:15:29.610
You're not supposed to do that.

01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:36.102
What kind of stimulus
drives this neuron?

01:15:36.102 --> 01:15:37.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:40.900
MICHALE FEE: Good, a
downward sweep, tone sweep,

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:45.840
that goes from about 4
kilohertz to 3 kilohertz.

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.706
In how long?

01:15:47.706 --> 01:15:49.020
AUDIENCE: 100 [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:53.140
MICHALE FEE: In about 100
milliseconds, that's right.

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.860
Maybe 50 would do,
[WHISTLE],, like that.

01:16:01.072 --> 01:16:02.065
How about this?

01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:06.820
It's kind of messy, right?

01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.410
So you can see that neurons
have receptive fields that

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:14.310
can be very complex in
space, or in this case,

01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:17.070
in frequency and time.

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:21.843
They are very selective
to particular patterns

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:22.510
in the stimulus.

01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:31.550
So we talked about a
mathematical version

01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:34.880
of receptive fields,
which are essentially

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.250
describing patterns
of sensory inputs

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:38.970
that make a neuron spike.

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:42.000
And we've talked about a
very specific model, called

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.300
a linear/nonlinear
model, that describes

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:48.230
how neurons respond to stimuli
or become selective to stimuli.

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:51.300
We've talked about a spatial
receptive field, described

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.560
the response of a
neuron as a correlation

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.990
between the spatial receptive
field and the stimulus.

01:16:56.990 --> 01:17:00.900
Temporal receptive fields,
where we've used convolution

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:04.370
to predict the response of
a neuron to a temporal--

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.900
to a stimulus.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.910
We've talked about
the idea of a spatio-

01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:11.210
or spectro-temporal
receptive field,

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.840
and we've talked about how to
use a spike-triggered average

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:22.410
to extract the spectro-temporal
or spatio-temporal receptive

01:17:22.410 --> 01:17:27.240
field of a neuron using white
noise or random stimuli.

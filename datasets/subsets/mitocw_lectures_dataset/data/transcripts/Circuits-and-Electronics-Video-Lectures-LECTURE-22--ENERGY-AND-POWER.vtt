00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning.
OK.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The topic for today is Energy
and Power.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Most of the time this semester,
up to now at least,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we focused a lot on speed.
We have been truly speed freaks

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
looking at how fast can we
switch the signal,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
what does a time domain
waveform look like?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We also looked at frequency
responses of circuits.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This week we will spend on
something a little bit

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
different, and that relates to
energy and power.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Energy and power is gaining a
lot more importance in certainly

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
this decade, and will do so in
the future.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And I am going to work out a
little example towards the end

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of the lecture.
And there you will see that if

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you do things naively,
your handheld devices,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
your cell phone,
laptops and so on will just up

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and explode.
You have got to be a little bit

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
careful in terms of how to
manage energy and power.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Before I get into that,
I just want to wrap up with a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
quick review of what we covered
last week.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We ended last week by looking
at positive feedback in analog

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
circuits using an op amp.
And, in particular,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we built an oscillator.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We built an oscillator that
allowed us to charge a

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
capacitor.
And when the voltage across the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
capacitor equaled that at the
minus terminal it would flip and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
keep doing so.
And at the output you would get

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a waveform that looked like
this.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You would get a square wave
output.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Now, throughout the course we
have talked about getting square

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
wave inputs.
And this is one example of how

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you can actually produce a
square wave pretty much from

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
first principles using a
capacitor, resistors and an op

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
amp.
Now, I just wanted to wrap up

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
this little item here by talking
about one application of an

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
oscillator.
And this application of the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
oscillator really nicely closed
the loop on the body of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
knowledge relating to digital
circuits that we have covered in

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
this course.
What I want to talk about

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
briefly is a small digital
system with a sender and a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
receiver.
And the sender is sending a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
signal, the receiver receives a
signal, and in this course we

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
have talked about senders
sending a sequence of ones and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
zeros.
Say, for example,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the sender wants to send some
sort of a signal like this.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We have seen that this is quite
a legitimate signal.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We get some kind of oscillatory
behavior because of the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
inductance and capacitance
associated with the wire.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And what you have done is that
you pretty much believed me when

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I said that this really
corresponds to a one,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
one, zero.
The sender wants to send a one,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
one, zero signal to the
receiver, and the receiver gets

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
it.
So this is a one,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
this is a one,
this is a zero.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But if I am a receiver,
I am going to look at the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
square wave.
There is no such thing as

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
sending a one on a wire.
You cannot send a one on a

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
wire.
You send a voltage signal or a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
current signal on a wire.
So, the receiver receives a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
voltage signal.
It is going to be zero for some

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
time and then maybe 5 volts or 3
volts or whatever is your high

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and then zero again.
How does my receiver know it's

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
a one, one, zero?
Why can't it be a one,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
one, one, one,
zero, zero, zero?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It doesn't know.
How does the receiver know it's

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
a one, one, zero sequence and
not 50 ones followed by 40

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
zeros?
It doesn't know.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
What we need is --
For senders to be able to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
communicate with receivers,
we need some kind of agreed

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
upon time when receivers sample
the signal coming in and decide

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
whether it's a one or a zero.
They both have to agree on

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
certain time bases when to look
at the input.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
One way to deal with this is I
can have a clock,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
a square wave signal that we
call a clock in digital systems

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and ship it to the other side in
the following manner.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This clock signal can be
applied to this sender and to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
this receiver.
For more details on this,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
let me recommend Page 735 of
the course notes that talks

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
about a detailed example of the
use of a clock in a digital

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
system.
What I can do is create a clock

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that looks like the square wave.
The clock provides a notion of

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
time to the circuit.
And I have some kind of a clock

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
signal generator.
And I connect that to the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
sender and connect that to the
receiver.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And now both the receiver and
the sender have a notion of

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
time.
And what I can do is I can tell

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
my receiver, the sender and the
receiver can have an agreement

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
between them that says that look
at the signal at your input when

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
on the rising edge of the clock.
Whenever the clock rises,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
when you see a rising edge look
at the value in the wire and

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that's the value I sent.
By doing so,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
what I can do is that the
receiver can look at the signal.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
At this rising edge it sees a
zero, this is vOH,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
looks up here,
sees a one here,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
sees a one here and sees a
zero.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So, it correctly sampled one,
one, zero at the receiving end.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And the sender can send the
same sequence here once we have

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
this time base.
This little brief foray

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
circuits was simply to give you
an application of a circuit that

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
can produce a square wave.
I can create a clock with a

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
time base.
Also, interestingly much more

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
fundamental is we looked at
various abstractions throughout

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the course.
We talked about discretizing

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
space by looking at lumped
signals.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
What I also want to point out
is that a clock can be viewed as

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
another fundamental abstraction
in the digital domain where what

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I am doing is discretizing time.
What I am saying is that,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
look, in the digital domain we
have already discretized value

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
into zeros and ones,
but we still had continuous

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
time until now.
And what you do in digital

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
systems is to say that look,
let's digitize everything,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
or rather discretize
everything.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And let's discretize time as
well into these points that

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
happen on the rising edge of the
clock which means that the

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
circuit has meaning,
signals have meaning only when

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
the clock is rising.
That tends to discretize time

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
which means that I really don't
care what happens to signals in

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
this time, as long as on the
rising edge of the clock I get

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the right value.
This concept is called

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
discretizing time.
And a clock lets you do that.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Remember that in digital
systems, which you will learn

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
about in 004 I am really
discretizing two things,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
discretizing values into zeros
and ones, and at the same time

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
also discretizing time into a
time when I sample things and a

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
time when I ignore values on the
wires.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I think you will get to clocks
in 6.004 after about a month,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
so initially you would just be
focusing on the statics of the

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
system without worrying about
any dynamic clock introduced in

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
the circuit.
OK, that's just a brief little

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
interlude.
With that let me get into

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
today's topic of energy and
power.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Why is this important?
The reason this is important is

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that what really determines the
size of your handheld?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You may think oh,
gee, electronics in the

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
handheld.
Some of you may think,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
oh, the antenna in the
handheld.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
No.
What really,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
really determines the size and
weight of your handheld devices,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
your PDAs, your cell phones,
your laptops and so on is by

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and large the battery.
On Page 2 I have a little

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
cartoon that shows you that if
we did not have you learn about

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
energy and power,
that's what we would all be

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
doing in order to use cell
phones.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Not surprisingly the very first
wireless phones ended up in

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
automobiles because you had a
big battery.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And so you had these wireless
phones only in cars.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Because of a huge amount of
research based on the knowledge,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
the technologies I am going to
talk about in today's lecture

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and Thursday's lecture,
you will see very simple and

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
elegant ways of reducing the
amount of battery you need to be

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
able to get some kind of
function out of analog or

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
digital devices.
I also want you to take a look

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
at Page 2 of the handout that I
have given you here,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
handout 63.
This handout talks about the

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
absolute latest in digital
fabrication technology out

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
there.
This is not a paid commercial

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
for IBM.
IBM has a technology called

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
CU08.
It is called Blue Logic.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It is called the Copper 08
Process.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And in this process,
if you look down on Page 1,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
for example,
IBM claims that it can build up

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
to 72 million gates in a single
chip.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
With this technology they are
able to build 70 to 80 million

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
gates where a gate is,
unless otherwise mentioned,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
pretty much defined as a two
input NAND gate equivalent.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So, your inverter,
your NAND gate and so on count

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
as a gate.
And they can build close to 80

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
million of these little suckers
on a single chip.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Just imagine that.
And the biggest chip they can

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
build is on the order of 18 to
19 millimeters on a side,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
roughly two centimeters on a
side.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
On a chip that's about one
square inch.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
You can put down 80 million
gates.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
What is more important for
today is what is on Page 2,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
actually.
I have circled two things on

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Page 2.
One thing that I have circled

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
is power supply range in the 0.7
to 1.3 volts.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Notice that that voltage,
the power supply voltage for

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
these chips is significantly
lower than the 5 volts that we

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
have been normally talking about
in this course.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
When in doubt our problems have
used 5 volts.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
But notice that in this
technology they're talking about

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
using voltages for the power
supply VS in the range of 0.7 to

00:00:01.300 --> 00:11:49.000
Why is it so much lower?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Well, you will find out.
The second thing I've circled

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
is something called power
dissipation.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And you say power dissipation
is said to be 0.006 microwatts

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
per megahertz per gate.
It says power dissipation is 6

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
nanowatts per megahertz per
gate.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
What that says is that each
gate off your circuit will

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
dissipate this much power at a 1
megahertz frequency.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And the implication of that is
that you should be able to

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
convert that single number to
the power dissipation in any

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
chip that you might build
depending on the number of gates

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
that you have,
the frequency you run the

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
circuit at, the voltage that you
use and so on and so forth.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
By the end of today's lecture
you will be able to take this

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
number and correlate that into
the power dissipation of any

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
chip that you might want to
build with this.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
That just serves as the
motivation that by the end of

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
this lecture you will understand
how to very quickly in five

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
seconds or less,
boom, given a chip,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
oh, yeah, that should consume
about 30 watts of power.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And what you will also do,
based on some examples here,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
estimate the power of not the
Pentium IV but a chip following

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the Pentium VI,
let's call it the Pentium V

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
would consume if it ran at 1
gigahertz.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
We will come up with some
absolutely shocking numbers

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
based on what you have learned.
With that kind of motivation

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
let me get into talking about
some theory and get into the

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
foundations of energy and power.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Let's go to Page 3.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
To drive the theoretical
discussion, I would like to

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
focus on the energy dissipated
in a MOSFET gate.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And fundamentally we will talk
about looking at energy and

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
power in circuits containing
switches, resistors and

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
capacitors.
The MOSFET gate is simply an

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
illustrative example to drive
the theory.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
But fundamentally what I am
going to show you,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
or lead you through today,
I will tell you how to compute

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
the power and energy when you
have capacitors,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
resistors, voltage sources and
switches in your circuit.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We will look at a circuit that
looks like this.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Your vanilla inverter circuit.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
My inverter.
I apply some vIN signal here.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
It could be a square wave.
It could be some sequence of

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
ones and zeros.
And this is an inverter that we

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
all know and love.
And this guy here is,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
stuck in a capacitor here.
And this capacitor is meant to

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
model the input gate capacitance
of whatever this inverter drives

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
plus any capacitance of the wire
leading up to that gate and so

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
on.
It is just a lumped capacitor

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
that I have stuck on there.
I am interested in determining

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
a few things.
One is what we call the standby

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
power.
You will see all these terms

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
being used in cell phones and so
on.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
In your cell phone,
your cell phone manufacturer

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
gives you two numbers.
Of course both are over

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
exaggerations,
but they give you two numbers

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
nonetheless.
One number is the number of

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
days that the cell phone battery
will last when in standby mode,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
right?
That's exactly where standby

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
comes from.
In standby mode,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
how much power does your cell
phone or how long will the

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
battery last,
that's the standby power.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And the second thing is what we
call active use power.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Active use is when you are
making a phone call and so on,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
what is the power consumed?
And there again your

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
manufacturer of your cell phone
will give you a much smaller

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
number for the active use power
of your cell phone.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
What I am going to do is assume
for discussion that the inverter

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000
is driven by a square wave
signal of the following sort.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
This is vIN.
And I am going to drive this

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
with a signal of this sort.
The period applied at the

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
input, so I am switching the
inverter on and off,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
on and off, on and off.
And T1 seconds for the high,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
T2 seconds for the low.
This is the inverter,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
this is the input signal,
and we'll keep coming back to

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
that again and again.
Rather than directly taking

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
this circuit and analyzing its
power, I would like to do things

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
in a slightly roundabout manner.
What I would like to do is show

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
you some very simple circuits
and analyze their standby and

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
active powers.
And then show you that this

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
circuit simply is a combination
of some of the simple things

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
that you have seen.
Example 1.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I would like to take a simple
circuit that looks like this.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
A voltage source V applied
across a resistor R,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
some current I.
And if I apply a voltage across

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
this resistor,
that voltage would simply

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
appear across the resistor.
And the power is simply given

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
by VI which is simply V squared
divided by R.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
This is 6.002 101 in the very
first chapter.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
That is the power that is
dissipated by this resistor,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
simply V squared divided by R.
That's the power dissipated by

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
the resistor.
Where does that power come

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
from?
The voltage source supplies the

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
power.
So, this guy here supplies this

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
power and this guy here
dissipates it.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
What is the energy that I
dissipate in T time?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Remember, power is the rate of
energy dissipation.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And so energy is simply power
multiplied by time.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
For a circuit like this,
energy dissipated in time T is

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
simply VIT.
For our gate remember we have

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
two situations.
We have VS, we have RL we have

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
RON, vO and vIN.
So, vIN is high.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
If vIN is high with respect to
ground then RON,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
the switch is on,
and this is the circuit that I

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
see.
In this situation the power

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:30.000
consumed is simply V squared
divided by the resistance here.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
It is simply VS squared divided
by RL plus RON.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Let me mark that with an
asterisk.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I will refer to this later.
Similarly, when vIN is low the

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
MOSFET is off.
And the power is simply zero.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
I have no current flowing down
and the power is zero.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Absolutely basic stuff.
Absolutely basic.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
So, the power,
when I have the MOSFET on,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
for the kind of inverters you
have seen so far,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
this is the power consumed by
the inverter.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And this asterisk here is
simply to say hold that thought,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
we will get back to it a little
later.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Let me work out a second
example.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000
In this second example,
I would like to consider the

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
following circuit,
a voltage source VS with a

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000
strange arrangement of switches,
S1 with a resistance R1,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:02.000
a capacitor C in this manner,
a switch S2 and a resistor R2.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
For now don't worry about how
the circuit comes about.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Just assume that I have drawn
the circuit for you.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
And what I want to do is
compute the power under certain

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
conditions.
Notice that if this is off and

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
this is off, there is no current
flowing either in this loop or

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
this loop, and the power
dissipated by the circuit is

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
zero.
But there are some arrangement

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
of switches for which I do
consume power.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And so let me show you that
arrangement of switches.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And what I am going to do is
assume that the switches open

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
and close with the following
periodic cycles.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Let's assume that when this is
high S1 is closed and S2 is

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
open, and when this is low
assume that S1 is open,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
S2 is closed.
And let's assume this is T,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
this is T1, this is T2.
That sequence should be

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
reminiscent of this input that I
am feeding to this inverter.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
All I am telling you here is
that I am giving you the

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
circuit.
I want to compute the power

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
consumption of the circuit.
And what I am telling you is

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
that with the frequency,
with a time period of capital

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
T, for the first T1 seconds this
switch is closed and that is

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
open.
So, this circuit applies.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000
In the second half of the clock
this switch is open so this

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
circuit applies.
And what I am interested in

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
finding out is what is the
energy dissipated in each cycle

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
of time capital T?
And I also want to find out the

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
average power.
Just spend about five seconds

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
just staring at this and kind of
intuit what is going on here.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I start by putting a voltage
source here and I close the

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
switch.
That is open.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Start by closing this,
what happens?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
When I close the switch VS is
going to charge up this

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
capacitor.
I get current flowing through

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
my resistor, so I am going to be
charging up this capacitor here.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Then let's say I allow T1 to be
as large as possible,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
and so this capacitor is going
to be charged up to all of VS.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
After a long time this guy gets
to be VS in the capacitor.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And as it is charging up I have
current flow through the

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
resistor, so it is sitting there
dissipating power.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Notice that this sucker does
not dissipate energy.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
It simply stores energy.
So, the energy supplied by the

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
voltage source comes in,
some of it gets stored in the

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
capacitor and some of it is
being dissipated by the

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
resistor.
That gets me to the end of T1.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
At the end of T2 I open the
switch and close this switch.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
When I close the switch I have
some energy on the capacitor,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
and the voltage across the
capacitor begins to drive a

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
current through this resistor
R2.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And now the capacitor supplies
its stored energy,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
and its stored energy then
begins to dissipate through

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
resistor R2.
And if T2 is very long then all

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
the charge in the capacitor
drains out.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And the voltage in the
capacitor at the end will be

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
zero.
So, that is just sort of a high

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
level description of what goes
on.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Now let's go ahead and compute
from first principles the

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
energetics of this little
circuit.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Let's look at the entire period
capital T, and as a first step

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
look at T1.
When T1 is in place S1 is

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
closed and S2 is open.
Accordingly,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
the circuit that applies looks
like this.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I have VS, S1 is closed,
so that is closed,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.000
and I have this resistance R1,
I have this capacitance C,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
some voltage VC across the
capacitor.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
You can go ahead and assume
that VC of zero is zero.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000
That I start off my life with
no voltage across the capacitor.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
First of all,
let me plot the waveforms and

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
write the expressions down and
then compute the energy supplied

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
by the voltage source and then
look at where the energy goes.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
You all know,
or should know by now,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
if I plot VC as a function of
time, remember,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
this is really easy to do.
VC as a function of time goes

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
like this.
At time T equal to zero I am

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
telling you that the capacitor
voltage is zero.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
I am telling you that.
So, it is at zero.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
And then the capacitor charges
up until it reaches VS.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
I also know that after a long
time this will be VS,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
after a long time that will be
VS, and between those two I have

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
a rising function that looks
like this.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
I can similarly plot the
current for you.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
At time T equal to zero
instantaneously the capacitor

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
looks like a short,
and so the current that I start

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
off with is going to be VS
divided by R1.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
The voltage across the
capacitor is zero.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
All the voltage falls across
the resistor R1.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
So, VS divided by R1 is the
initial instantaneous current.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And after a long time,
because VC reaches VS,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
the current is going to be
zero.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And between those two points I
get an exponential decay.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
I could very quickly write down
the expression for the current.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000
And that is simply the initial
value VS divided by R1 times the

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
exponential decay minus T
divided by the time constant for

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
the circuit R1C.
You have seen this stuff

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
before.
Here comes the part that we

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
care about for now.
Let's find out what is the

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
total energy provided by the
source.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
When dealing with energy
computations you have to be

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
incredibly careful of these
words here, supply,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
provided versus dissipated.
Dissipated implies that the

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
resistor is burning energy.
Provided means that the source

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
is supplying that energy.
So, energy provided by source

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
during T1.
Let's go ahead and compute that

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
very quickly.
The energy supplied by the

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
source is simply the voltage
across the source multiplied by

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
the current being supplied by
the source.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
This is i.
Remember, by associated

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
variables convention,
if I have a voltage across some

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
element and the current into the
element is positive then that

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
element dissipates power.
If the voltage here is,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
say, 1 volt and it is supplying
current, if the i is out in the

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
other direction then it is
supplying power.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
In this case,
the current i is going to be on

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
the outside, heading outside.
The total energy is going to be

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
the instantaneous power
integrated over time,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
and that is simply VS.
Remember, the instantaneous

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
power is VS times the current i,
so the instantaneous power is

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
simply VS times i,
that is the instantaneous

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
power.
To get the energy provided by

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
source and some time,
I have to integrate that

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
instantaneous power over the
period of interest T1.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
That gives me the energy
supplied by the source during

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
T1.
And let me go ahead and

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
substitute for i with this
expression here.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000
It is VS times i,
and i is VS divided by R1 times

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
this expression here.
That gives me

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000
(VS^2/R1)e^(-t/R1C) dt.
Let me carry out the

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
integration there.
I get -1/RC,

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:35.000
so I get this outside.
And I also get to write down,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
oops, let me do that a little
bit more carefully.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
VS^2/R1 simply comes out and I
get a -R1C in the numerator.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000
If I differentiate it then I
get R1C in the denominator.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
I have an integral that comes
up here.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
And then I write down e^-t/R1C,
zero and T1.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
So, this R1 and this R1 cancel
out.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000
And I end up getting something
that looks like this.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
I get CVS^2.
And so there is a minus sign

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
out here, so at zero this thing
goes to a one,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
so I get a one.
And because of minus sign I get

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
e to the -T1/R1C.
All I have done here is simply

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
go through the math to do this
integration here.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
What I am also going to do is
assume that if T1,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
if the time that the switch is
closed is much,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
much bigger than the time
constant of the circuit,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
T1 is much, much greater than
R1C, if this is much,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
much greater than R1C then this
term goes to zero.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
And this becomes more or less
equal to CVS^2.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
What do we have here?
What we have here is that if I

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
let the switch stay closed for a
long time and S to be open then

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.000
the voltage source is going to
supply some amount of energy.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
That energy will equal CVS^2.
The voltage across the

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
capacitor will be VS and all
that energy would have been

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
supplied by this guy.
Let me pose the following

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
conundrum here.
If the voltage across the

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
capacitor is VS,
because we know the energy

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
stored in the capacitor is half
CV^2.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
So, the energy in the capacitor
is half CVS^2.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
At the end of the day,
since the voltage across the

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
capacitor is VS,
ΩCV@2 is the energy stored

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
here.
But we know,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
from this calculation,
the source has supplied CVS^2.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Source has supplied twice that
energy.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
This guy has supplied twice
that energy and only half of

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
that is stored here.
Who ate up the other half?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
The resistor,
exactly.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
The resistor has walloped half
the energy.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Let me just show it to you.
It dissipated ΩCVS^2.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
It's pretty interesting.
It's a pretty simple result.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
If T1 is very large compared to
time constant then half the

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
energy is in the capacitor and
half of it has been burned by

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
R1.
This energy has not been

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
burned.
It is simply stored.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
It is stored by the capacitor.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And if you do simple energy
conservation arithmetic here,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
the energy dissipated in the
resistor plus that stored in the

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
capacitor equals the energy
supplied by the source.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
All right.
Let's go to T2 now.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
At T2, S2 is closed and S1 is
open.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Let's look at the second part
of the cycle when S1 is open and

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
S2 is closed.
And what is going to happen now

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000
is the left-hand part of the
circuit can be ignored and I can

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
focus on this part.
So, S2 is closed.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
This is RC, my capacitor,
this is vC.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
This is the circuit of
interest.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
What is the initial condition
on this?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
What is the value of vC
initially?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Start off, because remember,
I allowed this capacity to

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
charge up fully,
and so initially I have VS on

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
the capacitor.
And so the energy on the

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
capacitor initially is ΩCVS^2.
That is the energy on the

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
capacitor.
This time around I won't go

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
through an integration process
like that, but you can if you

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
like, and do it in a much
similar manner to say that now

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
let's suppose that T2 is much
greater than this time constant.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
If T2 is much greater than R2C,
this time constant.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
If that time is much greater
than this entire,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.000
the initial voltage VS drives a
current through the resistor,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
and after some amount of time
the voltage across the capacitor

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000
goes to zero and all the energy
in the capacitor gets dissipated

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
in R.
So, if T2 is much greater than

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
R2C then energy dissipated in R2
is simply ΩCVS^2.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Notice that the energy
dissipated in R1,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
in the first half cycle is
ΩCVS^2 and the second half cycle

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
during T2, if T2 is large
enough, all this energy gets

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
dissipated in this resistor R2.
And I have that expression

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
here.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000
So let me just say that this is
E1 and let me say that this is

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
E2.
So, E1 is dissipated in the

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000
resistor and E2 is dissipated in
R2 in the second half cycle.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
A couple of interesting things
to note at this point.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
One is that E1 and E2 are
independent of R.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
If the time constant is small
enough compared to the time that

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I charge the capacitor then half
the energy gets lots in the

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
resistor, and that is simply
ΩCVS^2.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
And if I let this discharge
completely it doesn't matter

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
what resistor I am discharging
it through.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
That's the intuition.
If I have certain energy here

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
and I let it discharge
completely it doesn't matter

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
what this resistor is.
Small or large,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
it doesn't matter.
All this energy gets dissipated

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
there.
The rate at which the energy

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
gets dissipated will change
depending on R2.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
If R2 is very small then I get
a burst of power initially and

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
then a rapid decay after that,
but if R2 is very large then I

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
have a much slower release of
energy.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
But suffice it to say that the
energy dissipated,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
the total energy in T2 is
simply ΩCVS^2.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
All right.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Let's put T1 and T2 together
and look at the total energy

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
dissipated --

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Total energy dissipated.
E is simply E1 plus E2.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Dissipated in each cycle.
Assuming T1 and T2 are much

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
larger than the respective time
constants.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And I know that this is ΩCVS^2,
ΩCVS^2, so this is simply

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
CVS^2.
If I have an arrangement of

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
switches and capacitors like
that, I charge the capacitor,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
discharge the capacitor,
charge the capacitor,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
discharge the capacitor.
What it is saying is that in a

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
charge/discharge cycle I am
using up CVS^2 of energy.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
ΩCVS^2 when I charge it up and
ΩCVS^2 when I discharge it.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
That is what I get.
Let's compute the average power

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:54.000
dissipated, P average in a cycle
is simply E/T where T is the

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
period of the square wave
sequence that I have shown you

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
out there.
This is simply CVS^2 divided by

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
T.
If the period of the square

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
wave is capital T,
I can express that as a

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
frequency.
Let's say for example the

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000
period of the square wave is T,
so let's say the frequency of

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:33.000
the square wave is simply 1/T.
I can also express this as

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
C(VS^2)f.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.000
What does this say?
Let me mark that as a thing to

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
remember, the second thing to
remember.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.000
One was the power that was the
static power.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
And second is this power
relating to this frequency f and

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
the charging and discharging of
the capacitor in that little

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
circuit shown up there.
So, this average power is

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
CVS^2f.
What this is saying is that if

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
f is high, if I have high
frequency of charging and

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
discharging the capacitor then I
am charging and discharging much

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
more frequently so I am going to
consume more power.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Notice that at any given time
there is no direct connection

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
between the power supply and the
ground.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
What I am doing is my capacitor
is an intermediary.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
I am dumping some charge in the
capacitor and the capacitor is

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
dumping the charge into ground.
It behaves like a switch to

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
capacitor.
And what it is doing is it is

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
being charged and discharged at
frequency f.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
So, it makes sense that the
amount of average current that I

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
am pumping through relates to
the frequency at which I am

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
charging and discharging the
capacitor.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
And similarly the average power
also relates to the value of the

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
capacitor.
If C is larger I dissipate more

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
energy.
And the same way with the

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
voltage.
If the voltage is higher then

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
the power in that period,
or the average power relates to

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
CVS^2.
Spend a few seconds staring at

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
the two expressions.
This power here relating to

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
just this connection between the
power supply and ground and that

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
power out there relating to
charging and discharging

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
capacitors.
Let's get back to our inverter

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
right now.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
This is our inverter circuit.
Let us say that I drive the

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
input with the waveform shown
here.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Well, I go back to the same
situation as here.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
I drive the input with a square
wave, with T1 and T2 as the high

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
time and the low time.
The equivalent circuit for this

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
is not exactly what we saw
there.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
The equivalent circuit for this
would look like this.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000
I have a VS.
And the VS supply is connected

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
through RL, VS connected through
RL to a capacitor C.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000
This is my voltage vO.
So, VS is always connected to

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:55.000
ground through this resistor and
capacitor in this manner.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000
And then I have a resistor here
RON corresponding to that

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:09.000
MOSFET.
And there I am switching it on

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000
and off in a way that it is on
during T1 and off during T2.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000
So, the situation here is a bit
different from that simple

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:33.000
situation I computed there.
Much like I computed the power

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
dissipation in that circuit,
I can go ahead and compute the

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
total power dissipated in this
circuit.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
I won't do it here.
The algebra tends to be a big

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
more grubbier than what I have
been through.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And suffice it to say that you
can show that the average power

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
is given by
(VS^2)/(2(RL+RON))+(CVS^2)f

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
(RL^2)/(RL+RON)^2.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
OK?
And for details I suggest that

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
you look at section 12.3 of the
course notes.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Section 12.3 goes through the
algebra to compute the total

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
power dissipated by this
specific circuit,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
and here is the expression we
get.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And let's take the specific
situation where RL is much

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
greater than RON.
If RL is much greater than RON

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
then I can ignore this RON here.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And I get this.
And out here,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
if I ignore RON,
then RL and RL will cancel out

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
and I get CVS^2f.
If I ignore RON compared to RL

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
this is the expression I get.
Now you can see why I went

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000
through those two examples.
This is exactly the power

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
consumed by the connection
between power supply and ground.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
And this CVS^2f is the power
consumed in charging and

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
discharging the capacitor.
If you look at the circuit here

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
it is consuming two kinds of
power.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
One kind of power is due to the
current flowing directly from VS

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
through RL and RON to ground.
Oh, this also assumes,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
by the way, that T1 is equal to
T2.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
So, in this circuit there are
two kinds of power.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
One is the power when the
switch is on and I have a

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
current flowing from VS to RL to
ground.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Notice I get an extra factor of
two in the denominator here.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
And that two comes about
because the connection to ground

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
only happens half the time.
It's half that power out there

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
because I am connected to ground
only when the switch is on.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
And that happens only half the
time, and so therefore I get the

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
VS^2/2RL.
And then CVS^2f is simply the

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
power that I consumed because I
am charging and discharging the

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
capacitor C.
Notice that in this inverter

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
circuit there are two kinds of
power.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
One is called the standby power
which is static power being

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
consumed by the circuit,
and the second power is the

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
dynamic power because the
circuit is switching up and

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
down.
This relates to star and this

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
relates to the double star.
And to demonstrate that,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
I have a little demonstration
here that has an inverter.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
And I am going to up the
frequency of the square way of

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
driving the inverter.
I am going to show you a few

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
numbers so hang on for two
minutes after this demo.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
I will give you some numbers,
but I want you to go ahead and

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
compute the numbers based on
what we have seen here.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
And you will get suitably
impressed, I promise you.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
This is the input fed to the
inverter.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
This is the output of the
inverter.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Notice that the output of the
inverter reflects some sort of

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
an RC time constant because of
the output driving the

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
capacitor, and the same way
here.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
I start off by showing you that
on the left-hand side I am

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
simply measuring the power being
consumed by the circuit.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Notice that the power being
consumed is expressed by the

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
needle being at this point here.
This is a very low frequency so

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000
this is almost all standby power
consumed by the inverter.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
The inverter is on half the
time, and when it is on it is

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
consuming power.
What I am going to now is

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
increase the frequency.
As I increase the frequency

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
driving the inverter what should
happen to this needle?

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
As I increase the frequency
there that waveform should

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
become closer and closer
together.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
And what should happen to the
needle?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
That should begin to go up.
If I increase the frequency it

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
should consume more and more
power and the needle should

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
start going up.
So, let me do that for you.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
In terms of numbers there it is
on top of the four on the scale

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
in the middle.
I am going to increase the

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000
frequency very slowly.
Unfortunately,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
the sampling scope messes up
the waveform.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Ignore the waveform for now.
Just look at the meter as I

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
increase the frequency.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Notice that I have increased
the frequency by about a factor

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
of 2 or 3.
And notice here that this meter

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
has moved.
The needle has moved to the

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
right.
And I can keep doing that and

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
the needle keeps moving to the
right as I am consuming more and

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000
more power because I'm driving
the inverter faster and faster

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
and faster.
That should convince you that

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000
there is a standby power and
there is some power component

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
related to frequency.
This relates to your standby

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000
power in your cell phone.
This relates to active use.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Let me show you some numbers,
and you can plug those numbers

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
in yourself and see how much
power this converter is going to

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
consume and see if it makes
sense.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Assume that I have a chip with
10^8 gates.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
F is 1 gigahertz.
That is 10^9.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Assume C is 0.1 femtofarads
which is 10^-16 farads.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Assume VS is 5 volts.
Assume RL is 10 kilo ohms.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Use these numbers.
Plug these numbers in here and

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:16.000
get a sense if our modern-day
circuitry used that inverter,

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:26.000
what would be the power
consumed by a chip that contains

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:35.000
10^8 of these gates?
You will find out that you may

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:45.000
have to use a nuclear power
reactor to actually drive that

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000
chip, but go check it out for
yourselves.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:03.000
In the next lecture we will see
then how do our cell phones

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:11.000
work, how does life go on
despite this horrendous

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
calculation here.

JOHN ESSIGMANN: Let's
go now to storyboard 36,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.590
starting with panel A,
Regulation of Metabolism.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.490
So far in 5.07, we have
looked at metabolic pathways

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.060
from the perspective of the cell
in organelles within the cell.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.010
Using physiological
scenarios, I've

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.530
tried to show you how
pathways within the cell

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.470
respond to a change in the
environment, for example,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.870
by running away from a
stressor, such as a dog

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.100
or dealing with the problems
of starvation or diabetes.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.960
We have looked a
little bit at the ways

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.310
that individual steps and
pathways are regulated.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.660
We have not, however,
looked at the ways

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
that individual pathways
and individual organs

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.300
coordinate their respective
activities in order

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.106
to accommodate the needs
of the entire organism.

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:11.110
Coordinated pathway networking
is the focus of this lecture.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.780
Let's turn to panel B.
I'm going to start out

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.480
by talking a little bit
about the seven pathways

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.000
that we have studied
in detail in 5.07

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.710
and look at how
they're regulated.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.990
As I've said before,
typically pathways

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.960
are regulated at their
rate-determining steps, that

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.780
is, the step at which
you'll find an enzyme that

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.390
has a large free-energy
change associated

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.100
with the conversion of
substrates to products.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.860
In the first pathway
we studied, glycolysis,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.680
there are three irreversible
steps, specifically

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.920
the glucokinase/hexokinase
step; secondly,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.450
the phosphofructokinase-1 step;
and thirdly, the last step,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.650
pyruvate kinase.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.980
These are all sites
of pathway regulation.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.100
Our second pathway, the
tricarboxylic acid cycle,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.550
or Krebs cycle, was regulated
at every step at which NADH

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.990
is produced, that is,
citrate dehydrogenase,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.970
alpha-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.160
and malate dehydrogenase.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.310
While pyruvate dehydrogenase
is not formally

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.890
part of the TCA cycle,
I'll point out here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.430
that it is also
regulated by NADH.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.060
In all four cases,
NADH feedback inhibits

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.860
the enzymes that produce it.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.980
Under conditions of
excessive TCA cycle activity,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.550
you'll find that NADH
levels will drop,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.770
and accordingly NAD+
levels will increase.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.200
The reduction in
NADH will result

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.240
in activation of the pathway.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.880
In other words, the
disappearance of NADH

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.040
results in the uninhibition
of the pathway.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.240
Our third pathway,
gluconeogenesis,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.360
is regulated at the
pyruvate carboxylase step

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.240
at the fructose
1,6-bisphosphatase step

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.510
and at the glycogen
synthase/glycogen phosphorylase

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.620
steps.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.350
We're going to be looking at
this pathway in some detail

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.260
in a little while.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.410
Our fourth pathway,
fatty acid catabolism,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.460
is regulated at the CAT, or
Carnitine Acyltransferase step,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.900
which is inhibited by malonyl
coenzyme A. Malonyl CoA

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.890
is one of the key precursors
for fatty acid biosynthesis.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.930
It makes sense that
the concentration

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.120
of malonyl coenzyme
A, if high, would

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.980
inhibit the uptake
of fatty acids

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.720
into the mitochondrial matrix.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.220
Keep in mind that uptake into
the matrix is the job of CAT1.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.510
Shutting down CAT1 by the high
concentration of malonyl CoA

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.050
prevents entry of fatty acids
into the mitochondrial matrix,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.960
where they otherwise would be
subjected to beta-oxidation.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.020
By turning off CAT1,
malonyl coenzyme A

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.470
prevents the futile cycle
of simultaneous fatty acid

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.380
degradation and biosynthesis.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.620
The fifth pathway is
fatty acid biosynthesis.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.550
Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase,
or ACC, is the enzyme

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.330
that makes malonyl coenzyme
A out of its precursor,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.040
acetyl coenzyme A. This enzyme,
ACC, is activated by insulin.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.950
As we've seen before,
insulin detects the fed state

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.180
in the organism.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.390
Hence, following a meal,
insulin levels rise,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.640
and that's the signal that
tells the cells of the body

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.970
to take up nutrients.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.329
That's just one example.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.390
After a meal, glucose levels
will rise in the blood.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.900
Insulin will be released
and drive the glucose

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.380
into the cell.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.260
The cell will then
activate pathways

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.590
by which the glucose is
converted to acetyl-CoA.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.250
Then the acetyl-CoA will be
converted into fatty acids,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.680
and then ultimately,
into triacylglycerides

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.040
for energy storage.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.600
Our sixth regulated pathway is
the pentose phosphate pathway.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.730
Glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.070
is the first step
in the pathway.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.950
And as we often see, an
early or committed step

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.170
is where regulation happens.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.150
One of the products of
the pentose phosphate

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.090
pathway is NADPH.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.840
If the cell has
used a lot of NADPH,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.260
for example for biosynthesis,
its levels will drop.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.900
Coordinately, there will
be an increase in NADP+.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.540
In the case of glucose
6-phosphate dehydrogenase,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.070
we find that NADP+, which is the
product of excessive reductive

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.680
biosynthesis, as well
as other activities,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.320
such as combating
oxidative stress,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.710
activates the dehydrogenase in
order to enable the synthesis

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.540
of additional NADPH in order
to sustain biosynthesis.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.390
The last pathway, the
seventh, is electron transport

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.400
and oxidative phosphorylation.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.420
This is our most robust pathway
for the production of ATP.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.920
When there's a lot
of demand for ATP,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.160
ADP levels will
rise in the cell.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.640
And it's ultimately
the level of ADP

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.440
that regulates
electron transport

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.330
in oxidative phosphorylation.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.680
More about that
in a few minutes.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.670
Let's now look at panel
C. Organs communicate

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.220
with one another by the
nervous system, of course,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.190
but also by hormones,
small molecules that

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.320
are secreted by
one organ that will

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.480
have an effect at
one or more organs

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.640
distal to the first organ.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.710
Changes in our
environment are detected

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.460
by the brain with input
from our sensory organs.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.660
Our internal organs, such as
the liver, pancreas, kidneys,

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.330
adrenal glands, and muscles
will detect signals,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.870
either independently of the
brain or after an instruction

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.150
set is received from the brain.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.510
The resulting signal network
will allow the entire organism

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.150
to be able to adapt to
the new environment,

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.510
be it one of stress, for
example, being chased by a dog,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.430
or one of, for example, hunger.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.470
We'll talk later about
the adrenal glands, which

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.480
are going to respond
to signals that

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.330
come in from sensory organs
that tell our muscles to start

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.880
running and to tell the
liver to start to provide

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.190
the muscles with the
glucose they need in order

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.630
to sustain running.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.550
Later we'll be
looking in some detail

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.760
at the adrenal-produced hormone
epinephrine, also called

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.900
adrenaline.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.350
Adrenaline will have a profound
impact, both in the muscles

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.420
and in the liver, to
allow these organs

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.880
to do their respective jobs.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.150
The pancreas is a
very important organ

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.650
in that it provides
exocrine functions that

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.320
help with digestion
and endocrine

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.020
functions that enable us
to regulate or balance

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.070
fuel metabolism.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.170
The alpha cells of the
pancreas produce glucagon.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.200
The alpha cells sense hunger.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.580
They secrete glucagon
into the blood,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.530
which travels to organs that
represent our fuel depots.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.170
And fuel from those depots,
for example, fatty acids

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.000
and glucose, will
then be supplied

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.230
to other tissues of the body
that are in need of nutrition.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.420
The beta cells of
the pancreas sense

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.020
what we call the fed state,
and they produce insulin.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.390
Insulin instructs
the various organs

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.670
of the body to take up
fuel in the wake of us

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.060
having eaten a meal.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.920
Now let's look at
panel D. There are

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.150
three general paradigms by
which pathways are regulated.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.760
The three hormones that I've
just mentioned typically

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.120
will cause the activation of a
kinase that will phosphorylate

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.240
a target protein, resulting in
either increased or decreased

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.130
activity of that protein.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.760
We call this hormonal or, more
properly, covalent control,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.060
because there will be a covalent
modification of a protein that

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.240
will be responsible
for pathway regulation.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.630
The second major paradigm by
which pathways are controlled

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.760
is allosteric regulation.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.190
Earlier in 5.07,
JoAnne Stubbe showed us

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.110
how hemoglobin,
the molecule that

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.480
carries oxygen in the
blood, is controlled

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.090
by bisphosphoglycerate
and protons, which

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.400
act as allosteric effectors.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.919
Similarly, other small
molecule effectors

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.320
will control the major
pathways of metabolism.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.620
We're going to be looking
at phosphofructokinase-1

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.810
as our prime example.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.580
The third strategy
of regulation is

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.770
what I call "acceptor control."

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.470
This is the way that electron
transport and oxidative

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.480
phosphorylation are regulated.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.870
To the right side of panel D
is an abbreviated metabolic

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.020
pathway that I'm going to use
to describe each of these three

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.950
paradigms.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.380
At the upper left is
a box that contains

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.440
glycogen synthase and
glycogen phosphorylase.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.590
Earlier in 5.07, I told
you how phosphorylation

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.080
of a specific C-ring
residue on glycogen

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.140
phosphorylase results
in a dramatic increase

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.390
in the activity of that enzyme.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.360
A little later, we'll see that
covalent modification, again,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.170
by serine phosphorylation of
glycogen synthase, results

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.260
in a decrease in
activity of that enzyme.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.450
Hence, covalent modification
of these two proteins

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.130
enables, in one case,
activation of the enzyme

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.080
and, in the other case,
inhibition of the enzyme.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.750
This reciprocal control
prevents futile cycling.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.030
Now let's look at
the box in the center

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.430
of this abbreviated
metabolic pathway.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.210
The glycolytic enzyme,
PFK-1, Phosphofructokinase-1,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.040
converts fructose 6-phosphate
to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.370
We're going to see that a small
molecule derivative of fructose

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.320
6-phosphate, specifically
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.400
will act as a powerful
allosteric stimulator of PFK-1.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.480
I'll also point out that
AMP, Adenosine Monophosphate,

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.660
will also stimulate this enzyme.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.540
I'll also point out here
that PFK-1 is a tetramer.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.870
Oftentimes, as JoAnne taught
us, proteins that are multimers

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.010
are the ones that are subject
to allosteric regulation.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.220
Our third paradigm of
regulation is accepter control,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.160
shown in the box at
the bottom of panel D.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.070
During periods of intense
physical activity,

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.190
ATP is consumed and
converted to ADP,

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.670
and NADH is converted to NAD+.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.790
Rising levels of ADP in
the mitochondrial matrix

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.770
activate the
proton-translocating ATP

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.380
synathase.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.000
As more protons flow through
the synthase, more ATP is made.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.750
They call this accepter control,
because the regulatory molecule

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.330
is ADP, which is the,
quote unquote, "acceptor

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.630
of phosphate" in the
synthesis of ATP.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.670
Because we covered
accepter control

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.490
in some detail in the
lecture on electron transport

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.530
and oxidative
phosphorylation, I'm

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.900
going to leave
that topic for now

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.410
and focus on covalent control
and allosteric control.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.500
Let's turn now to
storyboard 37, starting

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.390
with panel A. With regard to the
paradigm of covalent control,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.120
I'm going to focus on the
pair of enzymes, glycogen

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.010
synthase and glycogen
phosphorylase,

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.980
which reciprocally
regulate glycogen synthesis

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.050
and glycogenolysis.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.700
Let's consider a
scenario in which

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.380
there's some kind of stressor.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.540
The muscles have to
be activated in order

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.450
to be able to deal
with the stress,

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.340
and the liver has to be able
to provide the resources

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.220
to the muscles that will
allow the muscles to continue

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.880
intense physical activity.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.470
Now let's look at panel
B. In our scenario,

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.270
you've just seen
something frightening.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.520
Your brain then sends
an electrical signal

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.680
to the adrenal
glands, which then

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.980
send a chemical signal,
specifically adrenaline,

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.020
to the liver and to the muscles.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.570
At the top part of
this response scenario,

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.610
both the liver and
muscles are going

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.610
to be responding in
a very similar way.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.790
However, at the bottom part
of the response scenario,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.830
the liver and muscles are
going to be activating

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.530
very different pathways.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.570
Specifically, we're going to
see that muscles will strongly

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.170
activate glycolytic
pathways in order

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.220
to enable the production of ATP
to keep the muscles running.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.580
The liver, by contrast, is going
to be activating pathways that

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.670
are more like those of
gluconeogenesis, that is,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.820
spilling out fuel from
the liver to provide

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.370
the muscles with the
energy-rich resources

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.040
that it needs to keep us
running away from our stressor.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.310
Adrenaline, or epinephrine,
travels from the adrenal

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.900
glands through the blood.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.940
It takes only a second or
two for this to happen.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.120
It's received by the
liver and the muscles

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.090
at the beta-adrenergic receptor.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.120
The blood concentration of
epinephrine is very low,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.700
something of the order
of 10 to the minus 10

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.900
molar at this point.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.060
There's going to be a
very substantial signal

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.980
amplification as we move ahead.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.770
Keep in mind for later
that the initial triggering

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.950
signal is in the 10 to
the minus 10 molar range.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.440
The arrival of epinephrine
at the receptor

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.710
results in structural changes
in the transmembrane domain

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.990
of the beta-adrenergic receptor.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.510
The signal is received
by a heterotrimeric G

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.720
protein, shown as the circle
with alpha, beta, and gamma

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.010
subunits.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.500
This G protein, in
its inactive state,

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:41.280
has a bound molecule of GDP,
that is, guanosine diphosphate.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.300
Upon receipt of the signal from
the beta-adrenergic receptor,

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.090
the heterotrimeric G protein
ejects the beta and gamma

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:53.400
subunits, and the GDP molecule,
which is non-covalently bound,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.840
is released.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.150
The GDP is replaced by a
GTP, guanosine triphosphate.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.430
This replacement
results in the formation

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.770
of the alpha subunit with
a non-covalently bound GTP.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.400
This is the active
form of the enzyme.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.180
It translocates along the
inner surface of the membrane

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.810
until it encounters
AC, or adenyl cyclase.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:23.060
The GTP-bound G protein
activates adenyl cyclase.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.820
The activated AC
dynamically starts

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.930
converting ATP, which is
very abundant in the cell,

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.560
into cyclic AMP.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.380
We call cyclic AMP
the second messenger.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.660
In our scenario,
the first messenger

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.790
is epinephrine,
which interacted with

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.920
the beta-adrenergic receptor.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.590
The second messenger
is cyclic AMP,

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.160
which is produced by the
activation of adenyl cyclase,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.870
which is asymmetrically
associated

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.550
with the inner surface
of the cell's membrane.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.720
Let's turn now to panel C.
In the upper left of panel C,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.290
you'll see a box.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.530
This box depicts the
chemical mechanism

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.590
leading to the
production of cyclic AMP.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.960
Let's now look at the
main part of the panel.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.640
In a very short period
of time, a matter

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.120
of seconds, the concentration
of cyclic AMP within the cell

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.230
goes from about 1 micromolar
up to about 5 micromolar.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.560
So the presence of epinephrine
at the 10 to the minus 10

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.840
molar concentration
outside the cell

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.930
results in a perturbation
of cyclic AMP concentrations

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.920
inside the cell, bringing cyclic
AMP concentration to about 10

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.660
to the minus 6 molar.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.580
This is a very
substantial increase

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.180
in signal, which an
engineer would call gain.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.060
The increasing cyclic
AMP concentration

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.780
is going to activate
a kinase cascade.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.905
And the initial kinase
that's going to be activated

00:15:42.905 --> 00:15:45.990
is called Protein
Kinase A, or PKA,

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.590
which is represented
symbolically as a C

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.470
with a circle around
it in my drawing.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.230
In its inactive state,
protein kinase A

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.890
is in a complex involving
two molecules of itself

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.830
and two molecules of a
regulatory protein, which

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.860
I've indicated as an R in
the middle of a circle.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.440
Cyclic AMP forms a
tight complex with R.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.190
This basically causes
R to dissociate

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.040
from the active
subunit C, that is,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.800
the catalytic portion
of protein kinase

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.425
A. The catalytic portion
of protein kinase A

00:16:18.425 --> 00:16:21.470
is now free to act as a
kinase to phosphorylate

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.720
the next kinase in
the cascade, which

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.950
is called SPK, or Synthase
Phosphorylase Kinase.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.440
A serine residue on
SPK is phosphorylated,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.860
and that event converts this
kinase into its active form.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.320
I'll also point out that
one of the subunits,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.240
the delta subunit of SPK, is
the calcium-binding protein

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.880
calmodulin, which gives a
second level of regulation

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.080
to this enzyme.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.270
Specifically, this
enzyme is regulated

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.880
not only by the
concentration of cyclic AMP,

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.450
but also by the levels of
calcium within the cell.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.020
The activated SPK, or
synthase phosphorylase kinase,

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.770
is now going to phosphorylate
two other proteins, glycogen

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.150
phosphorylase and
glycogen synthase.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.640
As I mentioned earlier,
phosphorylation of glycogen

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.510
phosphorylase results in the
enzyme becoming more active.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.050
That is, it starts breaking
down glycogen by phosphorolysis

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.480
to produce glucose
1-phosphate, which

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.359
will then be available for
further metabolic processing.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.390
In the muscle,
glucose 1-phosphate

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.700
will be converted by
phosphoglucomutase

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.180
into glucose 6-phosphate,
which will then be a substrate

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.360
to initiate glycolysis, with
the ultimate generation of lots

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.940
of ATP for the muscle.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.610
In the liver,
phosphoglucomutase will

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.820
convert glucose 1-phosphate
into glucose 6-phosphate,

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.400
but in this case,
gluconeogenesis

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.260
will be activated.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.200
Glucose 6-phosphatase
will remove the phosphate

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.870
from glucose 6-phosphate,
converting it to glucose.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.590
The glucose will then be
secreted from the liver,

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.420
go out into the
blood, and then go

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.230
to the muscle to help the
muscle carry out glycolysis.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.650
Now let's look at the
other target of SPK,

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.350
synthase phosphorylase
kinase, specifically,

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.450
glycogen synthase.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.900
In this case, glycogen synthase
phosphorylation results

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.680
in a less active protein,
and hence, glycogen synthesis

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.880
will cease.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.880
This makes sense, because
a cell under stress

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.300
would not want to be making
glycogen. It wants to be using

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.410
energy and not storing fuel.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.680
Let's step back and look at
the big picture at this point.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.930
The interaction of
a hormone resulted

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.820
in the covalent
modification of proteins.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.240
One of those
phosphorylated proteins,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.000
glycogen phosphorylase,
triggered glycogen breakdown.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.680
Phosphorylation of a second
protein, glycogen synthase,

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.460
turned it off.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.620
Turning off glycogen
synthase helped

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.430
us avoid the otherwise
futile simultaneous synthesis

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.760
and breakdown of glycogen.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.560
So overall, this is an
example of a hormone causing

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.860
covalent modification of
proteins in such a way

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.290
that it altered the
activity of those proteins

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.120
in a manner that
made sense given

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.340
the physiological
challenges to the organism.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.720
Next, let's turn
to storyboard 38,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.520
panel A. Our next
regulatory paradigm

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.530
will be the use of
allosteric effectors

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.940
to regulate a pathway.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.600
As before, I'm going to use
the physiological scenario

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.632
of stress.

00:19:23.632 --> 00:19:25.090
But in this case,
I'm going to show

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.800
how stress will
cause the production

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.500
of small-molecule
allosteric effectors

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.140
that will activate
glycolysis in the muscle

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.730
and activate gluconeogenesis
in the liver.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.170
Our focal point is going to be
PFK-1, phosphofructokinase-1,

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.940
of glycolysis.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.520
Of central importance is
going to be a small molecule,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.870
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, which
we'll see is going to be a very

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.310
powerful allosteric
stimulant of PFK-1.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.210
Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
is made by the enzyme PFK-2,

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.870
phosphofructokinase-2.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.440
Let's start out by
looking at the very

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.370
short biochemical pathway shown
in panel A. We see glucose

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.860
converted by hexokinase
or glucokinase

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.830
to glucose 6-phosphate
and then some equilibrium

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.000
steps up until we get
fructose 6-phosphate.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.550
Ordinarily, we think
of fructose 6-phosphate

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.960
as continuing in the
glycolytic pathway,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.560
but let's not think of
it that way right now.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.810
The chemical structure
of fructose 6-phosphate

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.220
is shown slightly to the right.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.980
Note that fructose
6-phosphate has

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.160
a phosphate on the
6-hydroxyl group,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.290
and that the 1-hydroxyl
functionality

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.550
has only a hydrogen.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.700
This is the alpha
anomer of fructose,

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.360
as evidenced by the fact that
the hydroxyl group on carbon-2,

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.410
the anomeric position, is down,
or under the furanose ring.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.210
With a little bit
of electron pushing,

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.950
you can change the
stereochemistry

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.400
at the 2-carbon such that the
hydroxyl group would be up,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.740
or in the beta configuration.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.590
In the beta configuration,
the hydroxymethyl group

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.280
of fructose 6-phosphate,
which includes its 1-carbon,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.370
would be down.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.670
The beta and alpha-anomers
of fructose 6-phosphate

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.020
are in equilibrium.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.160
That is, they both
exist at the same time.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.990
The kinase,
phosphofructokinase-2,

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.560
catches the beta anomer
of fructose 6-phosphate

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.530
and phosphorylates it, producing
the molecule at the lower

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.880
right of this panel.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.810
That's the actual structure
of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.220
This is the molecule
that's going

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.350
to serve as the
allosteric effector

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.860
of the glycolysis pathway.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.740
The PFK-2, or
phosphofructokinase-2 enzyme,

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.000
is shown to the left.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.190
It's a complex
enzyme having lots

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.410
of different functionalities.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.410
The hatched circle within
the larger circle at the top

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.270
represents the
phosphofructokinase domain,

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.010
which converts fructose
6-phosphate to fructose

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.550
2,6-bisphosphate.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.690
That is the structure
at the lower right.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:59.470
The hatched domain at the bottom
is the fructose bisphosphatase

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.520
domain.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.500
This is an unusual enzyme.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.700
In the top domain, it acts as
a kinase, in the bottom domain,

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.820
acts as a phosphatase.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.150
PFK-2 has two
hydroxylated amino acids,

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.360
one at about 3 o'clock as
drawn and the other at about 6

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.680
o'clock.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.380
When the hydroxyl
group at the bottom

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.770
is present as a pure,
unmodified hydroxyl group,

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.350
the protein acts as a kinase.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.750
When the 6 o'clock
domain is phosphorylated,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.040
the enzyme acts
as a phosphatase.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.760
Protein kinase A, or PKA,
from the previous storyboard,

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.210
where we talked about
hormonal regulation,

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.230
is the kinase that
phosphorylates

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.720
the hydroxyl group at 6
o'clock on the protein.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.380
As we'll see later, the
hydroxyl group at 3 o'clock

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:51.040
is targeted by a kinase called
AMP kinase in the muscle.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.730
Before we go on, I want you to
look carefully at the structure

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:59.960
of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
at the bottom right of panel A.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.470
Compare that structure with
the structure of fructose

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:07.090
1,6-bisphosphate at
the right in panel B.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.850
If you squint and look
at these two molecules,

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.810
you'll see that they
look remarkably alike.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.640
In both cases, the
phosphate group

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.800
is above the plane of
the furanose sugar.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.890
However, in the case of
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate,

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.250
the phosphate is
on the 2-carbon,

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.190
whereas with fructose
1,6-bisphosphate,

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.650
the phosphate is
on the 1-carbon.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.050
The way these molecules
look will become important

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.040
in a few minutes.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.710
Now let's take a
look at the pathway

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.280
as shown in panel
B. Panel B reflects

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.760
the liver in its normal,
that is, non-stress state.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.410
So this is just the liver
doing everyday liver business.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:50.200
Glucokinase of the liver
is converting glucose

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.210
to glucose 6-phosphate.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:56.770
The alpha anomer of fructose
6-phosphate is produced.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.500
Most of the fructose 6-phosphate
is converted to fructose

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.000
1,6-bisphosphate.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.700
In the liver cell at
this time, there's

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.230
probably some low level of
glycolytic activity going on.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.620
However, because of
natural anomerization,

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.560
some of the
alpha-fructose 6-phosphate

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.680
is converted to its beta-anomer.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.700
Phosphofructokinase-2, or PFK-2,
is shown to the lower left,

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.330
and it's active.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.320
Note that neither of its
hydroxyl groups, at this point,

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.850
are phosphorylated.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.990
And its kinase site will be
converting the beta-fructose

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:37.770
6-phosphate anomer to its
phosphorylated form, that is,

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:42.570
beta-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate,
which has the structure shown

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.810
at the bottom right
of the previous panel.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:50.280
Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is
a positive allosteric effector

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.290
of phosphofructokinase-1.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.690
So it facilitates the
glycolytic pathway

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.020
that is enabling net flux from
left to right in the pathway

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.610
as shown.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.460
In addition to
stimulating glycolysis,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.850
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
strongly inhibits

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.740
gluconeogenesis.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.360
It does this by binding at
the active site of fructose

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.570
1,6-bisphosphatase, the
gluconeogenic enzyme,

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.720
clogging up the active
site, and thus disabling

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.120
the gluconeogenic pathway.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.720
The reason that it's such a good
inhibitor of gluconeogenesis

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.910
stems from an
examination, once again,

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:30.870
of the structures of fructose
2,6-bisphosphate in the bottom

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.820
right of the previous panel and
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate shown

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.520
to the right on this panel.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.820
Keep in mind that
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate,

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.880
while it's the
product in glycolysis,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.320
is the substrate for the
gluconeogenic reaction.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.190
If the active site of the
fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.670
clogged by fructose
2,6-bisphosphate,

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.710
then it's not going to be
able to process the fructose

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.720
1,6-bisphosphate in the
gluconeogenic direction.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.950
Hence, gluconeogenesis
is strongly inhibited.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:12.000
All of the above shows us that
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.920
really important.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.020
It stimulates the
forward direction

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.050
in the liver that is
causing glycolysis to have

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.780
a net flux from left to right.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.200
And in addition, it strongly
inhibits the back reaction,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.630
that is, the reaction in
the gluconeogenic direction.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.350
Turn at this point to panel C.
Now let's ramp up the scenario

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.500
and think about a
situation in which you're

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.720
being chased by a dog.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.930
You want to be able to
generate glucose in the liver

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.270
and then export that
glucose to the muscles

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.260
so that you can run
away from your foe.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.380
This is a situation in which you
would like to have your liver

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.480
stop doing glycolysis.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.570
You want the liver to strongly
turn to gluconeogenesis

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.660
in order to manufacture
glucose for the muscle.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.850
At this point, refer
back to the storyboard

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.900
that dealt with covalent
control, where protein kinase

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.890
A was activated.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.870
Recall the part of
the lecture when

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.000
I talked about covalent
control, and we

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.640
were talking about the
glycogen phosphorylase

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.630
step in the liver.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:18.070
In the liver, we generated
first glucose 1-phosphate

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.500
and then glucose 6-phosphate.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.260
And then the phosphate
was lopped off the glucose

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.340
6-phosphate to produce glucose
that went out into the blood.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.810
In the present
case, we're looking

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:33.100
at a step that's further down
in the gluconeogenesis pathway.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.100
Specifically, we want
to activate the fructose

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.900
1,6-bisphosphatase in order
to push even more carbohydrate

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.530
toward the production
of glucose.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:48.650
So in panel C, we see stress
inducing the cyclic AMP cascade

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:52.460
that results in activation of
protein kinase A. And protein

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.410
kinase A is going
to phosphorylate

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.280
the southernmost, that is, 6
o'clock domain, on the PFK-2,

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.230
or phosphofructokinase-2
protein.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.960
As I indicated earlier,
phosphorylation

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.840
of the 6 o'clock domain
results in conversion

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.940
of phosphofructokinase-2 from
a kinase into a phosphatase.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.770
The phosphatase produced from
PFK-2 will act upon the pool

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.610
of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and
convert that pool to fructose

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.990
6-phosphate.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.810
That is, the 2-phosphate will
be lopped off of the fructose

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.930
2,6-bisphosphate molecule.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.490
By doing this
biochemistry in the liver,

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.630
we've done two things.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.550
First, we destroyed the
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate pool.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.650
Hence, this molecule
is no longer

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:42.750
available to act as an
allosteric stimulator of PFK-1.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.460
Secondly, removing fructose
2,6-bisphosphate from the pool

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.910
has resulted in removal of
the active-site inhibitor

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.910
of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.250
This enzyme, therefore,
becomes active

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.190
and is able to push
the net flux of carbon

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.850
from right to left in the
direction of gluconeogenesis,

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:08.410
producing glucose that will
then spill out into the blood.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.780
Please turn now to
panel D. We just

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.554
saw that the liver,
post-stress, produces glucose.

00:29:14.554 --> 00:29:16.720
Now we're going to take a
look at the muscle, which,

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.080
of course, is going to
be using that glucose.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.720
In response to the
stress state, the muscle

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.950
is going to activate
an enzyme called

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.670
the AMP-dependent
protein kinase,

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.900
or AMP kinase,
also known as AMPK.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.350
AMPK activates metabolic
pathways that generate ATP.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.890
The 3 o'clock phosphorylated
PFK-2 proves to be

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.340
an exceptionally competent
enzyme for converting fructose

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.030
6-phosphate into fructose
2,6-bisphosphate.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.430
This increases further the
concentration of fructose

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:53.470
2,6-bisphosphate in the
muscle cytoplasmic pool.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.130
And keep in mind that fructose
2,6-bisphosphate itself is

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:01.150
a powerful allosteric stimulator
of glycolysis by its effect

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.930
on PFK-1.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.670
So in the muscle cell, we're
able to achieve extraordinarily

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.940
high concentrations of
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate,

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.610
thus favoring glycolysis.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.550
Let's turn now to storyboard 39.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.380
Let's start with
panel A. The way

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.680
that AMP kinase stimulates
glycolysis in the muscle

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.190
post-stress is illustrated
in this abbreviated metabolic

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.540
pathway.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.700
Starting at the lower
left, the stressor

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.430
has created the
cyclic AMP cascade

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.780
that activates AMP kinase.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:38.050
AMP kinase phosphorylates the
3 o'clock domain on PFK-2,

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.270
converting it to its
phosphorylated derivative that

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:45.730
shows powerful kinase activity
to convert fructose 6-phosphate

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.490
into fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:53.350
This enhanced pool of fructose
2,6-bisphosphate will now act

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:57.970
as a powerful allosteric
stimulator of PFK-1 to favor

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.740
glycolysis.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.490
I want to point out that muscles
do not do gluconeogenesis.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.160
Only the liver and renal
cortex do this pathway.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.680
So muscles do not have
fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase,

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.970
the gluconeogenic enzyme.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.490
Accordingly, in
muscles we don't have

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.610
to worry about gluconeogenesis
being turned on to some extent

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.970
and thus dampening
the glycolytic effect

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.460
in the muscle that's needed
in order for the muscle

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.940
to generate the ATP
needed to outrun your foe.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.850
On this panel, we
also see that there

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.380
are several other
effectors that influence

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.270
the activity of PFK-1.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.560
One is citrate.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.880
Another is ATP.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.360
Another one is AMP, or
Adenosine Monophosphate.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.930
I want to say a couple of
words about AMP in this regard.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:48.980
Let's look at panel B. AMP is
not as powerful an allosteric

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.660
effector on PFK-1 as is
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.907
But we know a lot
about its activity

00:31:55.907 --> 00:31:57.490
as an allosteric
effector because it's

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.470
been studied quite thoroughly.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.930
PFK-1 is a tetramer,
and its activity

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.720
is regulated by cooperativity.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.690
This graph shows the
activity of PFK-1

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.550
as a function of the
concentration of one

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.700
of its substrates,
fructose 6-phosphate.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.410
When there's no
ATP present, which

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.690
is not a realistic
situation, you

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.090
see the regulatory
pattern following that

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.920
of a rectangular hyperbola.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.690
That's scenario A.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.880
Scenario B shows
what would happen

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.800
to the activity
of the enzyme when

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.200
ATP is present at a
concentration of about

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.170
1 millimolar, which
is quite realistic,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.080
and what you see is
suppressed activity.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.380
When the heterotropic allosteric
effector AMP is added,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.930
you see the curve
shift to the left.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.290
That is, you get enhanced
activity at a given substrate

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:45.520
concentration.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.030
My guess is that fructose
2,6-bisphosphate would push

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:52.010
the curve even
further to the left.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.780
Let's now look at panel C. I
think it's useful to use AMP

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.190
to help us construct a model for
what fructose 2,6-bisphosphate

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:05.720
might be doing as an allosteric
stimulator of the PFK-1 enzyme.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.750
The equilibrium
diagram that I've drawn

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.540
shows the relationship
between the relaxed, that

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.020
is, more active state
of the PFK-1 tetramer,

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:18.160
and the tense, that is, more
inactive state of the enzyme.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.680
When ATP is abundant
within a cell,

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.860
it binds more strongly
to the tense state,

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.700
and hence, ATP
inactivates PFK-1.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.680
This makes sense, because
if ATP is abundant,

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.980
you do not want to
be doing glycolysis

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.400
to make even more ATP.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.540
However, when the
ATP pool of a cell

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.050
is challenged by doing
heavy work or biosynthesis,

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.820
the AMP is going to
bind more tightly

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.450
to the R state of PFK-1.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.980
And that's going to
help convert the enzyme

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.110
into its more active state.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.500
That's a little snapshot of how
a small molecule, in this case,

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.410
AMP or perhaps fructose
2,6-bisphosphate can

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:59.080
dramatically regulate
the activity of an enzyme

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.520
at a specific step
in metabolism.

FRANK SCHILBACH:
Welcome to Lecture 17.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.050
This lecture talks about
state-dependent preferences,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.836
projection and attribution bias.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.400
The plan for today is to talk
about preference changes.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.940
So we're going to look at
different circumstances

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.120
in which people's
preferences, predictably

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.090
and sometimes unpredictably,
change over time.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.900
That is to say, sometimes people
are hungry, tired or in pain,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.690
and their preferences
for certain outcomes

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.150
may be determined by
that underlying state

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.570
of like hunger, for example.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.870
Now, it's pretty clear that
people's preferences change

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.930
according to those states, as
in like when somebody is hungry,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.080
they want different things.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.900
They want to eat
different kinds of things

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.650
than when they're
not hungry and so on.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.590
But people nonetheless
have trouble predicting

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.180
their preference changes.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.950
That is to say, if
somebody is hungry,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.930
they may have a
hard time predicting

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.420
how it feels when they're
not hungry and vice versa.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.570
So notice that this lecture
is sort of a continuation

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.310
or natural continuation
of our lectures on beliefs

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.730
from before.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.910
So before, we looked
at people trying

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.650
to learn about unknown
information around them,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.660
and we looked at
various deviations

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.140
why people are
not able to learn.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.570
Now we're going to look
at people trying to learn

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.440
or failing to learn at times
about their own preferences.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.490
And one particular
case here is what's

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.940
called production bias,
which is people's lack of

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.750
or inadequate ability to
predict their own preferences,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.360
in particular for
different states

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.620
of the world in the future.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.610
I'm going to be more
specific about that,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.610
but mostly, we're going
to talk about projection

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.770
bias and the paper by
Loewenstein et al., which

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.970
is in the readings.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.510
We're going to talk very
briefly about attribution bias.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.480
That's going to be
covered in recitation.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.539
OK, so although not typically
emphasized in economics,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.540
the simple and obvious fact
is that our preferences

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.370
change over time.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.130
There are ways in which
our preferences change.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.630
One is short-term
temporary fluctuations,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.450
and you can call them sort of
state-dependent preferences.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.950
You can call all
of what we're going

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.070
to talk about
state-dependent preferences.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.320
Here, the state is a short-run
physiological or psychological

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.070
state, for example,
hunger, pain or the like,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.960
or a psychological
state such as mood.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.860
We're going to talk about
all of these in more detail.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.450
Second, there are long-run
systematic changes.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.840
These could be due to own
choices such as addiction.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.030
So like if somebody has
been drinking alcohol

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.520
for the last 10
years, their utility

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.070
from drinking alcohol
or not drinking alcohol

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.320
is quite different from somebody
who has not been drinking ever.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.420
The same is true for
smoking and the like.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.580
Or it could be independent
of one's choices,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.350
for example, aging.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.150
So predictably,
people's preferences

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.430
change over time when
they're 20 years old

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.320
versus when they're
eight years old.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.990
Notice that for
addiction, there's

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.440
also some short-run
temporary fluctuation

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.010
such as when people have just
smoked a cigarette versus not.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.990
Their preferences for
an additional cigarette

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.800
might be quite different.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.040
But then there's also
long-run systematic changes,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.930
which is like if
somebody has been

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.320
smoking a lot during the
last 10 years versus not.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.780
So smoking or
addiction in particular

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.170
has both short-term
and long-term

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.200
temporary and systematic
changes in people's preferences.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.460
And then there's adaptation to
changes, which happens often

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.220
for big changes such
as standard of living

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.740
or small changes such
as mug ownership.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.880
What's an example here?

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.240
For example, if people win the
lottery, they become happier.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.480
They become actually a lot
happier very quickly, but then

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.320
that sort of reverts back to
like their previous standard

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.190
of time.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.500
People, a lottery winner
seen like a few days later,

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.380
clearly are happier than people
who have not won the lottery,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.840
but their increase in
happiness decreases over time.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.580
So these are three
different types

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.240
of sets of preference changes.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.170
You're going to mostly
focus in the lecture

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.020
today on, number one,
short-term, temporary

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.520
fluctuations.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.810
Now, what am I
talking about here?

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.520
So one example here is hunger.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.090
Now, studying hunger is
difficult in experiments

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.480
because it's unethical
to starve people.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.430
And you could, of course,
find hungry people

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.690
and give them food.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.270
That's in some sense
what was done once

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.760
in what's called the Minnesota
starvation experiment.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.970
This is an experiment that
was motivated by the fact

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.810
that there was lots of soldiers
in the Second World War

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.560
from the US and Europe
and in many other places,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.440
and these soldiers
had been starved

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.040
from the war for a long time.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.640
And they came back from the
war to come back to the US,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.360
and one simple
question was, well,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.440
when you have people
who have starved,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.370
have not eaten for a long time
or very little for a long time,

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.380
how do you best integrate
them into society,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.620
or how do you best feed them.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.370
Do you feed them very
quickly, like a lot,

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.040
or do you sort of gradually
increase their food take over

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.980
time?

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.860
So then the Army
did some experiments

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.190
with healthy volunteers such
as this guy here on the left.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.390
And people were starved,
literally starved

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.680
by getting very little food
for a while, such that,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.600
I think after a few weeks,
the guy would look like this.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.830
And then the Army would look
at people's behavior over time.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.450
They were mostly interested
in like once you have somebody

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.950
who has not eaten
for quite a while,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.950
once you give them
more food, what's

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.100
happening to their
behavior and what's

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.440
the best way of doing that.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.300
Coincidentally,
they also reported

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.300
what was happening in the
first part of the experiment

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.830
when people were
starved to start with.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.557
And so as expected, people
get extremely focused on food

00:06:16.557 --> 00:06:17.890
when they don't eat for a while.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.807
They get really, really
interested in learning

00:06:19.807 --> 00:06:21.700
about what's going
on with food and when

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.480
they get next food and so on.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.620
But as it happens, it seems to
be that their preferences also

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.600
change in various other ways.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.050
In particular, people
seem to lose interest

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.190
in lots of other activities.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.910
It is reported
decreased alertness,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.980
lack of self-control,
general apathy.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.800
People are just sort of like
almost like a different person

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.660
when they are almost
starved compared

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.020
to when they have eaten a lot.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.210
Here's some testimonies
from these soldiers.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.050
One of them is, the acquisition
of food-related items

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.970
was a reasonable extension
of their heightened

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.720
interest in food.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.050
So as we expect, people get
really interested in food.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.910
Much less reasonable
was the buying

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.110
of old books, unnecessary
secondhand clothes, knickknacks

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.340
and other junk.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.730
Often, after making
such purchases, which

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.550
could be afforded
only with sacrifice,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.870
the man would be puzzled as to
why they had bought such more

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.640
or less useless articles.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.320
So that's essentially
sort of saying

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.660
people got really interested
in certain purchases.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.880
Their preferences towards
those kinds of purchases

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.150
seems to have changed.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.150
They seem to have also
some preference reversal.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.830
They seem to want
to buy some things

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.250
and then wonder afterwards
why they did so,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.870
which all seems to be the
consequence of being really,

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.170
really hungry.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.260
Then came the day when I
lost my will to activity.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.050
I no longer cared to do
anything that required energy,

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.700
and days began to drag.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.295
That seems to be in some
ways like a direct effect

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:50.500
of like having a
low caloric intake,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.410
but really, people's
preferences towards physical

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.950
or any other activity seems to
have changed quite a bit due

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.630
to hunger.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.670
And another one here--

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.060
there's nothing that can
hold my interest for long.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.550
I wait for meal times.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.780
And this is where people's
attention seemed to really

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.620
be lowered quite a bit, to the
extent that you think attention

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.360
affects people's preferences
and decision making

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.400
in various ways.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.980
Again, hunger seems to have
this effect on people's choices.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.900
Now, what's a more sort
of like a real world

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.850
example for you guys?

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.820
Well, that's shopping
on an empty stomach.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.320
There's sort of a classic
study by Nisbett and Kanouse

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.159
from 1969, but there's sort
of other evidence later.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.039
And the folk wisdom is that
shopping on an empty stomach

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:42.380
leads people to buy more, and
perhaps also more junk food.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.063
Now, how do you study this?

00:08:45.063 --> 00:08:46.730
Well, you can think
about different ways

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.990
in which you might do that.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.330
You could sort of
induce people directly

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.448
to eat when they're
hungry versus not,

00:08:54.448 --> 00:08:56.990
and there's various other ways
in which you could think about

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.820
like setting up experiments.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.070
Now, one very
simple way in which

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.300
one could study this
issue is by just randomly

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.540
giving a sample of individuals
entering the supermarket

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.470
a candy bar.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.700
It could be a candy bar.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.380
It could be also a power
bar or just some other food.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.410
And so now, essentially,
what you do then is,

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.570
you take a bunch of
people who go shopping.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.010
And some of them might be
hungry and some might not be.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.410
But then the ones that
are hungry in particular,

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.650
when they eat like a candy
bar or any other food,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.380
they become less hungry.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.880
And so then we have a treatment
tradition that's less hungry

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.630
and a control condition
who is not getting

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.500
any food who is more hungry.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.330
And so then that
allows essentially

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:45.550
to look at variation in
whether people are currently

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.235
hungry while shopping.

00:09:47.235 --> 00:09:48.610
Another thing one
could do is one

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.490
could vary the timing of the
last meal before shopping.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.380
There you worry a little
bit, if that's not

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.250
experimentally induced,
that the people who

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.440
go shopping right after
having a meal versus not

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.500
might be quite different
in various other ways.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.000
But you could, in
principle, also

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.350
experimentally induce that.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.310
And then you can
monitor how much

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.240
and what kind of
food people buy.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.540
So hungry people
tend to buy more.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.440
They just simply buy more food.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.820
They also more tellingly
buy more junk food.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.670
So their preferences really
seem to be different.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.460
To be clear, people tend to buy
more, not just sort of like,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.327
say, I'm going to buy a Power
Bar or, for example, a banana

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.410
because I'm really hungry.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.720
I'm going to bite it right
after I leave the store.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.000
But they buy
significantly more, more

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.480
than can be explained by just
filling your immediate hunger.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.480
And in particular, they also
seem to change the type of food

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.560
that they buy.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.630
In particular, in this
case here, more junk food.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.640
Here is kind of what
this then looks like.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.560
The left guy is full.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.490
He buys lots of lettuce,
diet water, and so on.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.130
The guy on the right is hungry.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.420
He buys all sorts of things,
a lot more as you can see,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.560
and a lot of also
unhealthy food,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.720
including tortilla chips,
cheese, sugar water, and so on.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.485
So next time you go shopping,
you should sort of introspect

00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:13.320
and see what your preferences
towards what you buy

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.160
have been affected.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.680
Now, another thing you
can think about that

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.800
affects your preferences or
underlying state is your sleep.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.390
When you're tired,
the whole world

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.520
seems different in various ways.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.540
One example you can think
about is self-control.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.490
And sleep deprivation
is associated

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.470
with lack of self-control.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.120
There's sort of
this old literature

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.040
that says self-control
is a muscle that

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.570
replenishes overnight.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.720
There's some issues
with this literature.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.410
And there's some experiments
that might not necessarily

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.870
replicate.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.140
But the idea that
lack of self-control

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.680
might be a consequence
of lack of sleep

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.602
seems very plausible
in various ways.

00:11:59.602 --> 00:12:01.310
Notice that there
could also be causality

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.268
in the other direction.

00:12:02.268 --> 00:12:05.660
Lack of self-control might
also be a cause of poor sleep.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.520
Now, there's some
evidence that sleep

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.800
affects people's preferences.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.450
When people are sleep-deprived,
they tend to gain weight.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.900
Tired people engage more in
what's called cyberloafing.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.130
They surf more on the internet.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.500
There's also some evidence
that lack of sleep

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.030
might affect ethical behavior.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.910
People cheat more
when they're tired.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.780
And we have some evidence
in our experiment in India,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.880
which I'm going to show
you in a little bit,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.280
at the end of the semester,
that naps increase savings

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.530
and seem to reduce
people's present bias.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.370
So really this is some
evidence of sleep affecting

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.440
people's time preferences.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.870
Another example is Badger
et al. and addiction.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.470
This is a very small study
with only 13 subjects.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.170
So you might take all of what's
in there with a little bit

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.900
of a grain of salt. But I
think the underlying message

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.210
of the findings are correct.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.460
So what did Badger et al. do?

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.020
They elicited
people's willingness

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.190
to pay for a second dose of
the heroin substitute, BUP.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.530
These are heroin addicts
that are recovering.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.380
And they tend to
have, often, cravings.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.370
And BUP essentially helps
people not to relapse

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.020
and not to take heroin again.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.700
And so, at regular intervals,
they get BUP doses.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.860
Now it will be sort of unethical
to withhold people these doses.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.740
But what the
experiment is doing--

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.272
and it's still ethically,
perhaps, tricky--

00:13:36.272 --> 00:13:38.480
but what they were asking
for is people's willingness

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.580
to pay for a second dose of
BUP, the heroin substitute.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.440
So all individuals
in the experiments

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.450
regularly receive their
single dose of BUP.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:54.110
And then there's also an
additional dose they could get.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.632
And then there was some
variation in the experiment.

00:13:56.632 --> 00:13:57.590
What was the variation?

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.530
There was a variation in
the state of deprivation.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.680
So people were either
asking all the questions

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.730
about our willingness to pay
for a second dose of BUP.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.650
Everybody always
got the first dose.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.360
But then there was some
variation in timing.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.852
For some people, the
more deprived condition,

00:14:16.852 --> 00:14:18.560
people were asked
about their willingness

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.750
to pay for a second
dose two hours

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.570
before the scheduled first dose.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.150
And the less deprived
people were asked right

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.025
after the scheduled first dose.

00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:30.733
Again, everybody's
getting a first dose.

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:32.150
And we're asking
about willingness

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.580
to pay for a second dose.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.560
Some people are asked
about this two hours

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.753
before the scheduled first
dose, when they're really

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.670
sort of deprived and
craving, when they really

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.230
want their first dose.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.710
And others are asked when
they're less deprived, right

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.960
after the scheduled first dose.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.850
Notice that the second dose
is always held constant.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.910
So everybody always
gets the first dose.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.380
And the second dose is held
constant in the future,

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.070
at least in those
kinds of questions.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.360
So really the willingness
to pay should not

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.033
depend on your current state.

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.450
In the future,
you're going to get

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.550
a second dose, which is
once you have already

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.870
gotten the first dose.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.830
So whether you ask me like
two hours before or right

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.980
after your scheduled dose
should have more affect

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.940
on your willingness
to pay in the future

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.970
because that experience
is held fixed.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.420
And you're always
getting the first dose.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.900
Now, they are also asked
[INAUDIBLE],, in addition,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.680
the timing of a
potential second dose.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.170
So sometimes the second dose
was later on the same day

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.880
and sometimes the second dose
was during the next week.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.590
Now, what do Badger et al. find?

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.750
They find that people's
willingness to pay

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.020
varies systematically with
the state and the delay.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.040
What's the state here?

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.050
The state is the
state of deprivation,

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.660
whether people are more
deprived or less deprived.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.100
And then the timing
is essentially

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.040
either about today
versus next week.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.730
Now, the median willingness
to pay for the second dose

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.090
later today is $50
in the satiated state

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.070
and $75 in the deprived state.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.820
And we're going to get back to
this how we think about this,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.140
how we can explain this.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.770
But basically the way we explain
this is that in the deprived

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.770
state, people's
willingness to pay

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.670
is higher because they really,
really want a first dose.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.370
So people's willingness
to pay for the first dose

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.458
is high in the
deprived state and it's

00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:23.750
lower in the satiated state
because they already have--

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.430
people's willingness to
pay for any additional dose

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.090
is high in the deprived state
because they haven't even

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.420
gotten the first dose.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.260
And it's lower in
the satiated state.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.940
But what people seem
to be doing now,

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.070
they seem to have a
hard time imagining

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.900
their utility in the future.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.920
That is to say, in the future,
both people will be satiated.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.835
So what's happening
here is that when

00:16:47.835 --> 00:16:49.210
people are in the
deprived state,

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.810
they really, really want BUP.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.450
And they're willing
to pay more than when

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.530
in the satiated state,
again, for the second dose

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.550
in the future.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.040
Now, there's also some
evidence of willingness

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.560
to pay for the second
dose next week.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.310
And again, people's
willingness to pay--

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.010
and so the previous
one was later today.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.440
Now it's for the next week.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.520
People's willingness to pay
in the deprived state is $60.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.310
In the satiated state, it's $35.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.220
So again, people's
willingness to pay

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.440
is higher in the deprived state.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.569
That is to say, when
in the deprived state,

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.030
really, really, really
people want BUP.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.170
And they cannot really
imagine that in the next week,

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:36.180
when they're satiated, they
will actually want BUP less.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:42.930
To be clear, in both the first,
when the dose is later today

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.480
and when the dose
is next week, it'll

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.520
always be the case that
people have already

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.200
received the first dose.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.090
And then the question
is always about what's

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.980
your willingness to pay
to receive a second dose.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.090
So when they're in the future,
they will always be satiated.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.910
But people in the
deprived state seem

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.450
to be reacting or seem to be
behaving as if, in the future,

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.520
they would also be in
the deprived state.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.950
But of course people will
be in the satiated state.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.100
So people seem to overestimate,
when they're in a deprived

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.030
state, how much they
would like the second dose

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.920
in the satiated
state in the future.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.020
Now, here's another
example by Schelling.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.470
And Schelling is a beautiful
writer in economics.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.410
He's one of the best
writers that economics has.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.490
Granted, there's lots of
bad writing in economics.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.230
But if you want to read
some beautiful writing

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.810
by an economist,
Schelling has a bunch

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.725
of different books that
are really nice to read

00:18:42.725 --> 00:18:45.210
and essays that are
really beautiful.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:51.950
Now in his paper in
1984, he talks briefly

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.690
about a controversial
question, which

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.540
is the use of anesthesia
during childbirth.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.270
And why is that controversial?

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:05.150
Well, anesthesia is
reducing the mother's pain

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.460
during childbirth.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.860
But there's the potential
for some side effects.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.590
And there's also the potential
that people's experience

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.850
is different.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.810
And for both those
reasons, some people

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.650
argue that anesthesia
is not warranted

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.070
and decide not to do that.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.160
Now, in many cases,
people's preferences

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.680
change predictably over time.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.300
First, ex ante, before
the woman gives birth,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.690
many women prefer not
to use anesthesia.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.870
Once they are in
excruciating pain,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.140
they request anesthesia
from their doctor.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.140
And then, if they actually get
the anesthesia from the doctor

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:53.960
ex post, after the child is
born, they regret their choice.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.990
They say, I wish I
hadn't gotten anesthesia.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.410
Now, that pattern
holds even for women

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.110
who have given birth before.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.320
And it leads to a bunch
of ethical dilemmas

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.210
and legal issues.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.660
For example, to which patient is
a physician obligated, the one

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:16.010
asking for anesthesia or the one
who asked that it be withheld?

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.540
The person told the
doctor, I really,

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.630
really do not want anesthesia.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.267
Even if I ask you later, please
do not give me anesthesia.

00:20:24.267 --> 00:20:26.600
But then, of course, the
person that yells at the doctor

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.392
and says, I really,
really want anesthesia.

00:20:28.392 --> 00:20:30.080
Give me anesthesia right now.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.170
And so there's essentially
preference reversals.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.670
People seem to want
different things

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.530
at different points in time.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.960
And the doctor can only make
one of these two people happy.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.240
And so no matter what
the doctor does, either

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.440
if the person gives the person
anesthesia, then person number

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.690
2 in my list here above
is going to be happy,

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.630
but person number 1 and
person number 3 are unhappy.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.030
Or the person withholds
anesthesia and then person

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.050
number 2 is unhappy.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:01.610
So either way, the doctor cannot
satisfy these different selves

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.880
over time.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.790
Now, can the physician
enter a contract

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.240
with a patient ex ante, before?

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.770
Is it possible to have a
legally binding contract here

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.002
when he or she says, I'm not
going to give any anesthesia,

00:21:13.002 --> 00:21:15.680
and you told me so?

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.580
Do we want policies that
make such contracts possible?

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.590
Is that a desirable thing to do?

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.350
Is it a legally
required thing to do?

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.050
Potentially impossible
to require this legally.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.910
I'm not sure.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.490
But the point here
really is that there

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.570
is some misprediction
going on here.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.740
Ex ante, the person says, well,
if I'm in pain, I will be fine.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.450
I'm not going to
need anesthesia.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.825
But then, of course, when the
person is actually in pain,

00:21:43.825 --> 00:21:45.170
the person wants anesthesia.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.490
So essentially people seem to
mispredict their preferences

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.750
when they're in pain.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.880
Then that leads to all
sorts of trouble here.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.890
I really recommend
to read the paper

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.840
by Schelling that's
on the course website

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.200
if you want to sort think
about this a little bit more.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.950
Now, so far, we talked
about that preferences

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.090
change predictably due to
changes in underlying states.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.450
Now, one of those states, it
would be like pain, hunger,

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.260
sleep, and so on.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.770
Now, there's an
additional stylized fact

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.500
just that people make systematic
mistakes at predicting

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.910
preference changes.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.240
So not only is it that your
preferences are different when

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.060
you're tired versus
not, but people are also

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.210
systematically mispredicting
that preference change.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.070
Now, what is projection bias?

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.760
To be clear, it's the fact that
people underappreciate changes

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.940
in their preferences, projecting
their current preferences

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.190
onto future preferences.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.260
So projection bias, to
be clear, is not just

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.960
some random prediction
but a prediction

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.610
with a systematic direction.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.780
So people seem to understand the
direction of preference change

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.460
but not the magnitude.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.710
That is to say, when
people are hungry and think

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.260
about how it's going to
feel when they're not hungry

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.110
anymore, they kind of understand
that eventually they will not

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.375
be hungry and that maybe,
suppose you're really hungry

00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:05.797
and you really
want potato chips,

00:23:05.797 --> 00:23:07.630
you sort of understand
that you don't really

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.528
want that many potato
chips when you're full.

00:23:10.528 --> 00:23:12.070
Nevertheless, when
people are hungry,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.610
they buy 10 bags of potato
chips as if they were hungry

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.530
at least for like
half of their life,

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.200
even though they're going to be
hungry for the next hour or two

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.840
because then they're going to
go home and go eat and so on.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.920
So people seem to
understand the direction

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.010
of people's preferences
but not the magnitude.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:39.050
Now the underappreciation
of the effects

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.110
of hunger on
preferences is perhaps

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:47.460
not the most economically
important part

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.810
of projection bias or the
most important application.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.660
But there two reasons to
consider this evidence.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.970
But one, it's perhaps
the clearest evidence

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.440
of projection bias.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.690
Second, people have
lots of experience

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.640
with changes in their
levels of hunger.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.630
So any misprediction isn't
due to the lack of opportunity

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.630
to learn, really, when you
should have probably learned

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.800
this over time.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.905
For some other instances--

00:24:11.905 --> 00:24:13.280
this is only, for
example, if you

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.140
have lots of physical pain, or
for childbirth, for example,

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:21.050
you might say, well, that
seems to be sometimes

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.760
even "one in a
lifetime" experience,

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.820
where really it's sort of
understandable that people

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.550
mispredict their
preferences when

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.030
they are in excruciating pain.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.650
But that's understandable
because you

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.420
haven't experienced it before.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.800
And even for somebody, a mother
who has given birth to a child

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.092
before, that mother might just
misremember to some degree.

00:24:45.092 --> 00:24:46.550
But when it comes
to hunger, people

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.530
have been hungry so many
times, and full, and so on.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.010
So really you had lots
and lots of opportunities

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.370
to learn what your preferences
are when you're hungry

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.030
versus not.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.920
So really it shouldn't be about
a lack of opportunity to learn.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.300
Now, people buy more
on an empty stomach.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.660
That can be interpreted as a
manifestation of projection

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.260
bias.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.310
Hungry people act as if
their future taste for food

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.730
will reflect the current
hunger at least to some degree,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.260
or more so than
it actually does.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.733
But it's not completely clean
evidence of projection bias,

00:25:18.733 --> 00:25:20.900
because there could be
always other things going on.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.960
For example, if
you're really hungry,

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.195
some things might be
more salient to you.

00:25:26.195 --> 00:25:28.220
And there you might
buy certain things

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.290
more because you pay more
attention, for example,

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.070
to potato chips and really
sort of learn how exciting

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.000
potato chips are and so on.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.020
But let's just go
with hunger for now.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.050
There's lots of other evidence
of projection bias in addition

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.840
to the hunger example.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.670
Now remember the paper that
we discussed on food choices

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:50.710
by Read and van Leeuwen.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.630
This is the paper
where office workers

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.550
are asked to choose
between a healthy snack

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.440
and an unhealthy snack.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.300
Now, so far, we had looked at
this as a piece of evidence

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.340
for present bias.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.650
We were looking at when
people are choosing

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.660
for the present
right now versus when

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.910
they choose for the future.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:14.230
Do people make more
unhealthy choices

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.880
when they choose
for the president?

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.860
That is to say the
stylized fact that we

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:22.700
found was that when people are
choosing snacks for the future,

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.825
they were quite likely
to choose healthy snacks.

00:26:25.825 --> 00:26:30.550
You choose salad for the future
as your snack in the afternoon.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:35.020
And then, you ask again,
right now or today,

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.800
what would you like, people
seem to switch their preferences

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.480
towards unhealthy snacks.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.480
They'd rather have,
like, chocolates.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.460
And so we interpreted
that, at the time,

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.750
as evidence of present bias.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.860
And surely it seems like that
is evidence of present bias.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.830
Now, in addition, now, we're
going to consider variation

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.060
in the timing of those choices.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.330
So some people were asked
when they were hungry,

00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:59.920
late in the afternoon.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.820
Others were asked when they were
satiated or arguably satiated,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.220
immediately after lunch.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.750
And then the snacks were
to be received in one week.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.690
So that's held
constant, the timing.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.890
Otherwise the timing
is held constant.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.130
So we're always going to
look at choices for snacks

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.300
to be received in one week.

00:27:19.135 --> 00:27:21.370
In some of the cases,
the snacks were

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.850
to be received when people were
hungry or likely hungry, late

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.020
in the afternoon.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.250
In some other
cases, the snacks we

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.430
received when people
were satiated,

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.910
immediately after lunch.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.200
OK, so there's like
four cases here.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.640
There's the timing of choice.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.010
Either people are asked if
they're hungry versus not.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.770
And then the timing
of the receipt

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.340
of their snack, which is when
they were hungry versus not.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.250
And the question now is,
are hungry people now

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.760
good or bad at predicting
their preferences when they're

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.836
satiated, and are satiated
people good or bad

00:27:56.836 --> 00:27:59.590
at predicting their preferences
when they're hungry,

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.910
in the different state?

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.300
So we're going to
interpret here--

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.420
so here's a table from Read and
van Leeuwen, table number 1.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.690
It's a bit of a sort
of confusing table

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.310
for no good reason.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.560
Let me just walk you very
quickly through that table.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.640
So the rows are
the current hunger

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.220
and the columns
are future hunger.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.230
So the first row
is when people were

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.220
asked when they were hungry.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.760
So this is late
in the afternoon.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.610
The second row is people were
asked when they were satiated.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.550
That's like right after lunch.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.260
And then the columns are--

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:41.350
again, remember, all of the
choices are for next week.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:45.570
So the first column is choices
for when people were hungry.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.070
That's late in the afternoon.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.220
And the second column is
when people were satiated.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.880
That's right after lunch.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.380
Remember, again, all
choices are for next week,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.150
so for one week in the future.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:02.830
Now, we can interpret, now,
the main diagonal of this table

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.710
as reflecting people's
true preferences.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.530
That is to say, here's
no projection bias.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.280
People are asked, when hungry,
to predict what they wanted

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.860
or to say what they
wanted in the future, when

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.980
they were likely going
to be hungry as well.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:23.350
That is to say, 78% of people
are choosing an unhealthy snack

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:27.070
for the future when
they're hungry-- so

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.100
that's in the late afternoon--
for the future case

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.680
when they're in
the late afternoon.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:40.160
In contrast, only 26% of people
choose the unhealthy snack when

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.610
they're satiated-- that
is right after lunch--

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:50.250
for when the snack will
be delivered in one week,

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.290
right after lunch.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.180
So there's no
projection bias here.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.340
Because essentially this
underlying state, hunger,

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.660
is held constant.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.390
Hungry people predicting
for when they're hungry

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:04.740
or asking what they want when
they're hungry, 78% of people

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.360
think they want unhealthy stuff.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.830
And again, satiated
people, 26% of people

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.690
say they want unhealthy stuff.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:17.130
So 74% of people say they want
the healthy snack, in contrast,

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.960
when they're satiated.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.613
So again, that's
what's written here.

00:30:21.613 --> 00:30:23.530
Late in the afternoon,
when people are hungry,

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.050
78% of people choose
the unhealthy snack

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.300
for the late afternoon
when they will be hungry.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.900
Immediately after lunch, when
they're satiated, 26% of people

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.120
choose the unhealthy
snack for immediately

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.130
after lunch when they
will be satiated.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:43.620
Now, then what we see
here is the entries

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.230
that are off the main diagonal.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.860
Those data fit the pattern
of projection bias.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.070
Now what do I mean by that?

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.090
Let's look first at
people who are hungry

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.130
but expect to be satiated.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.080
That is the first row here.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.900
Current hunger is hungry.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.520
That's essentially people are
asked late in the afternoon.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.030
Or think about this as
being likely hungry.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:10.020
And they're ask about
why what do they

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:16.400
want when they're satiated?

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.560
That is right after lunch.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.140
Now, remember, when people
were satiated, 26% of people

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.870
said they wanted
an unhealthy snack.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.960
Now, when people are
hungry, 42% of people

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.180
say they want an
unhealthy snack.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.650
So that fraction is higher.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:38.210
So that is very much consistent
with projection bias,

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:44.690
the reason being that, when
people are hungry and say what

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.390
they want for themselves
in the hungry state,

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.660
well, 78% of people say they
want the unhealthy snack.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.910
If people did not have
any projection bias,

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:56.060
they really should be
saying 26% if you believe

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.010
that satiated people
know best what they want

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.440
when they will be satiated.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.170
Instead, 42%, a higher
fraction of people,

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:08.350
say they want an unhealthy
snack when predicting

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.950
or when answering while
they're hungry for when

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:14.920
they would be satiated.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.710
So people seem to understand the
direction in which their tastes

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.680
change as they become satiated,
but they underestimate

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.530
the magnitude of this change.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:27.130
Similarly, people who are
currently satiated but expect

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:31.150
to be hungry underestimate
the effect of hunger

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.170
on their preferences
for unhealthy snacks.

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:45.760
Remember, hungry people, when
they choose for next week

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.950
when they will be
hungry, 78% of people

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.800
say they want the
unhealthy snack.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.340
Now, in contrast, when they're
satiated, 56% of people

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.020
choose the unhealthy snack.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.030
So again, that
fraction now deviates

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.300
from the fraction when
people are hungry,

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.210
which is, again, consistent
with people understand

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.240
the direction in which tastes
change as they become hungry,

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.920
but they underestimate the
magnitude of this change.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.430
So satiated people think that
when they're in the future,

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:16.750
hungry, they will behave
at least a little bit

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.180
like as if they were satiated.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.815
And hungry people seem to
think that, when they're

00:33:21.815 --> 00:33:23.440
satiated in the
future, they will still

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.450
behave as if they were hungry.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:29.170
Notice that this
misprediction is partial.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:44.150
So again, both the 42%
is in between the 26%

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:54.240
and the 42% is in between
the 26% and the 78%.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.800
And again, the 56% is
between the 26% and the 78%.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.490
So there's essentially some
partial misprediction going on

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.080
here.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.949
Now, let me show you a number
of other examples of projection

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:09.449
bias.

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:11.616
And then I'm going to write
down a little model that

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:15.060
sort of captures this
information or the information

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.929
that's here.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:19.995
So another example
is catalog orders.

00:34:19.995 --> 00:34:21.570
This is Conlin et al.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.850
Imagine there's a cold evening.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.020
It's really cold outside.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.790
Maybe you were just
outside and so on,

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.790
and then you are
online shopping.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.540
Notice that in Conlin
et al., really, it's

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.239
catalog orders and
not online shopping

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.719
because online shopping didn't
quite exist at the time.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:42.090
But in any case, imagine you
buy, online, a warm jacket.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.830
And again, it's
really cold right now.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:46.139
You really wish you
had a warm jacket.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:50.400
But then, when the
warm jacket arrives,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.909
its 30 degrees warmer
when that happens.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:57.630
Now, that could or could not
be, potentially, a mistake.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:02.190
In particular, if it's
an unusually cold day,

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.852
if people have
projection bias, they

00:35:03.852 --> 00:35:06.060
might sort of think that,
well, right now they really

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.620
need a warm jacket.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.630
And they can't even
imagine that they might not

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.230
need this warm jacket anymore
in a few days from when

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.270
it actually arrives
from the order.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.640
And so the hypothesis
is that projection bias

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.570
leads to an increase in
purchases of cold-weather items

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.460
on cold-weather days.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.980
And not only that,
but controlling

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.470
for receive-day
temperature, the likelihood

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.540
of returning a
cold-weather object

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.660
is higher when the day
of ordering was cold.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.770
So not only people are buying
more cold-weather items

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.105
on cold-weather days--

00:35:39.105 --> 00:35:40.230
that seems very reasonable.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.942
Because you might just say, I
always wanted a jacket anyway.

00:35:42.942 --> 00:35:43.650
It's really cold.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.620
And that just reminds me
that I really need one.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.463
Or, for example, it's really
rainy and you buy an umbrella.

00:35:49.463 --> 00:35:50.880
Because again, you
just remembered

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880
that you really needed
one or that you forgot it

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.900
somewhere and so on.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.790
The telling part here
is that the likelihood

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.120
of returning the
cold-weather object

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.410
is higher when the day
of ordering was cold.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:07.050
And that's very much consistent
with projection bias.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.260
People, on
cold-weather days, act

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.100
as if the future were only
full of cold-weather days.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.410
And therefore their
preferences would be such

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.710
that they would always
want to put weather items.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:28.170
Or put differently, people
act as if their preferences

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:31.170
for cold-weather items-- they
really want a warm jacket--

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.330
would not change even
if, in the future,

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.920
there will be warm days.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.440
Notice that, in some of
this evidence, what's

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.840
hard to distinguish is
predicting people's preferences

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.900
change in the future versus
predicting future states.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.580
So if somebody predicted that
it's going to be cold forever,

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.500
who would act in
the exact same way

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.700
as if you predicted that your
preferences are such that you

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.640
always want warm jackets,
you're always going to be cold.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.710
Now, projection bias
is about the latter.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.450
It's about people's preferences.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.410
But often it's actually
hard to separate predictions

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.300
of probabilities
of how likely it

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.340
is that it's going to
be cold in the future

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.970
from predictions of
people's utility.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:21.850
Another example is car purchases
on Sunday versus radio or days

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.710
imagine it's a nice,
sunny day and you

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:27.910
go car shopping as you do it.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:33.020
And the car dealer
offers you an Audi TT.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.740
You know, "Why, I guess I
never thought of the Audi TT."

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.120
You go for a test drive.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.043
And the wind rips
through your hair.

00:37:39.043 --> 00:37:40.210
It's really sunny and great.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:45.290
And having this car during a
sunny day is really amazing.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.370
So you would love to
buy a car like this.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.800
Why not?

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.670
Imagine, in contrast, car
purchases on an icy day.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.950
Imagine you're car shopping
around the time of a freak

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:57.555
snowstorm.

00:37:57.555 --> 00:37:58.930
You kind of wanted
to have a car,

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:02.470
and somehow it's a snowstorm
when you go car shopping.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:07.420
Now, the car dealer says, how
about this grand Jeep Grand

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:07.930
Cherokee.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:11.050
And you might say, well,
I guess I never thought

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.790
of the Jeep Grand Cherokee.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.620
Why not try it?

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.677
You go for a test drive and you
gain traction on the black ice

00:38:17.677 --> 00:38:19.010
and you jump the curb with ease.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.830
It's just amazing.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:25.790
Now, you might just say, well,
I would love a car like this.

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.630
Now, what people
seem to be forgetting

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.970
in both of these examples
is that it might just

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:36.760
happen to be a really bad snow
day on that particular day.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.830
Or it might have just
been really sunny

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.180
on that particular day.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.310
And things like
change over time.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.340
And people might not understand
that their preferences

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.960
for the Audi versus
the Jeep might change

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.700
with the weather over time.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.320
And that's exactly what
Busse et al. are looking at.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.770
They're looking at how does
weather impact automobile

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.700
purchases.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:09.070
And in particular the
classical prediction

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.900
is that the weather, on
the day of a car purchase,

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.280
should have no influence
on the type of car bought.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.790
So now what Busse et al. look
at is do idiosyncratic weather

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.240
conditions, controlling for time
of year and predict car sales

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.870
and then, in particular,
also returns of those cars.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.000
And they look at
two types of cars,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.887
in particular
convertibles and then

00:39:29.887 --> 00:39:31.720
they look at four-wheel
drives like the Jeep

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.010
that I just showed you.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:36.700
And the key part here is to
look at idiosyncratic weather

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.270
conditions.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.150
That is to say, controlling
for time of the year.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.890
Suppose it's an unusually warm
and unusually cold or icy day.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:48.850
Does that predict people's
car sales or purchases

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.460
and particularly also the
returns of those cars?

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.210
Now, the buying patterns
are very much consistent

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.500
with projection bias.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.380
People buy more convertibles
on good-weather days

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.710
and more four-wheel drives
on bad-weather days.

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:08.270
And again, that
evidence by itself

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.740
is not necessarily
projection bias.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.230
It could just be a good-weather
day and you kind of always

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.300
wanted to buy a really
nice car, and therefore

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.220
you just do it on
a good-weather day.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.600
But people are also more likely
to return their convertible

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.120
if they bought it in
the good-weather day.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.000
And they're likely to return
their four-wheel drive if they

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.620
bought it on a bad-weather day.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.690
And that's very much
consistent with evidence

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:30.980
of projection bias.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.920
On a good-weather day,
you think your convertible

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.600
is going to be amazing forever.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.808
You're going to love driving.

00:40:36.808 --> 00:40:38.350
And even if it's
going to be raining,

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:39.440
it's going to be amazing.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.440
But of course, if it's
raining, that convertible

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.337
is really not a car
that you want to have.

00:40:44.337 --> 00:40:46.670
Or is really cold outside,
that's really not a great car

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.510
to have.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.750
Similarly, if you have
a four-wheel drive

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:52.790
and it's really warm
and nice outside,

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:56.360
you'd probably much rather have
a lighter car or potentially

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.220
even a convertible.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.980
Now, one important
question here is now,

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.620
in any of the behavioral
biases that we

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:07.410
discussed is how does the
market react to such behavior.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.340
So one tricky part here is that
you want to be kind of careful.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.840
So on one hand, you
might say, well,

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.128
let's exploit this
kind of behavior.

00:41:14.128 --> 00:41:15.170
And I think that's right.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:17.390
You might get people to
purchase stuff that they

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.190
don't necessarily want.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:21.710
And surely that's
happening in some cases.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:25.220
But to the extent that people
can just return these items,

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.225
that's actually not
necessarily a great idea.

00:41:27.225 --> 00:41:30.392
And particularly if
you're a car salesperson

00:41:30.392 --> 00:41:32.600
and you sell people stuff
and then you just come back

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.520
and you have to deal with
them, and they're unhappy,

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.820
and maybe, then, at
the end of the day,

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.112
you just return the car and
actually don't buy anything

00:41:38.112 --> 00:41:40.430
eventually because
they're unhappy,

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.190
that's really not great for you.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.350
Plus it wastes a lot
of time and effort.

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:48.440
On the other hand,
sometimes people

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.880
might just not return things.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.860
And they might just get
stuck with their car

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.640
and just leave it at that.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.720
And then it might be a good
idea to exploit this behavior,

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.640
particularly on a
good-weather day,

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.810
you might want to try to
sell people convertibles.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:05.540
Another thing you could
potentially exploit

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.790
is essentially people just
have higher willingness to pay.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.460
Suppose somebody
really, really wants

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.430
to buy a convertible anyway,
regardless of the weather.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.220
But on a good-weather day,
their willingness to pay

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.297
might be higher.

00:42:17.297 --> 00:42:19.880
And so you might be able to sell
them additional stuff for you

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.338
might be able to sell them maybe
a nicer version of the car,

00:42:23.338 --> 00:42:25.130
which probably they're
not going to return.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:27.630
Because once they have it,
they're just going to keep it.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:35.000
And so you might want to exploit
that if you are a company.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:46.680
There might also be some agency
issues within the sales shop,

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:52.080
which is like if the salesperson
really wants to sell things

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.390
and is incentivized
to sell things,

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.300
and that's regardless
of the returns,

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.080
then you might get
into situations where,

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.650
on sunny days, lots of
convertibles are being sold

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:03.190
but they're all being returned.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:04.860
So if you are a
company, you kind of

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.580
want to set the incentives right
that the car salesman gets only

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.210
rewarded for stuff that's not
returned because it precisely

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.660
gets you things that will not
make you happy or profitable

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.230
in the long run.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:20.070
Now, there's another--
so as a customer,

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.920
now, how might you take
advantage of production bias?

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.210
Well, there's an
article here that you

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.700
can look at that argues
that winter is the best

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.960
time to buy a convertible.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.930
And so the reason is,
of course, convertibles

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:38.530
are often cheaper
in winter in part

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:42.935
because the car dealer might
have storage costs, the like.

00:43:42.935 --> 00:43:44.560
So the convertible
is actually cheaper.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.690
Or just because people
are taking advantage

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.630
of in the summer when they
really want convertibles.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.673
Now, you might say,
well, let's just buy

00:43:51.673 --> 00:43:52.840
a convertible in the winter.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.730
And I think that's,
in principle, right

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.860
if you have the time to
wait until the summer

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.733
or have a long time horizon.

00:43:58.733 --> 00:44:00.400
Now, you want to be
a little bit careful

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.670
with exploiting these
market conditions

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:08.200
as a classical agent,
which is manifested

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.760
by some of my
colleagues who shall

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.820
be unnamed who wanted to
buy a convertible sometime

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.690
in the summer.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.670
They got really excited
about the convertible.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.250
But then they realized,
well, winter is actually

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:23.200
the time to buy a
convertible because it's

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.317
going to be cheaper.

00:44:24.317 --> 00:44:25.900
So then they decided,
well, let's just

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:29.995
wait until the winter and
then buy the convertible then.

00:44:29.995 --> 00:44:31.870
Of course, what then
unfortunately happened--

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:32.745
or maybe fortunately.

00:44:32.745 --> 00:44:34.420
It depends on the perspective.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.250
Once winter arrived,
they actually

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:38.830
didn't want a
convertible anymore.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.950
Because a convertible in
the winter is really not

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:42.700
a lot of fun.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.610
So projection bias
perhaps also kicked in

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:47.680
with my colleagues,
where they then perhaps

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.480
should have just
bought the convertible

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.880
and then predicted that, in the
summer, they really wanted it.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.047
But instead they did buy it.

00:44:53.047 --> 00:44:56.750
Because wants a
convertible in the winter?

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.320
So when exploiting behavioral
biases from others,

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:06.760
you want to be careful that you
may be affected by it yourself.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.620
Let me give you one
last example, which

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.520
is this example by Van
Boven and Loewenstein,

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.710
which is about thirst.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:18.458
Here, visitors are asked
before or after vigorous

00:45:18.458 --> 00:45:20.500
cardiovascular workouts--
so people who are going

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.430
to the gym--

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.410
to complete a short survey.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:24.950
And the survey was as follows.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:29.200
Imagine that three vacationers
in Colorado this past August

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.750
embarked on a short 6-mile hike.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.580
As the day wore
on, they realized

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.490
that they were hopelessly lost.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:40.000
Worse, because they had packed
lightly for a short hike,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.640
they had not carried much
in the way of food or water.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.640
And what people were
asked, then, about-- and so

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.640
they were essentially
given this story.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:56.200
And then they were asked
to do the following.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.840
In the space below, please
take the perspective of one

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.480
of the three hikers and
describe your situation--

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.340
how you got into it,
how you feel now,

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:07.450
both physically and mentally,
and what you are hoping

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:08.740
will happen."

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.580
And now what happens and what
the evidence of Van Boven

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.060
and Loewenstein says is that
thirsty subjects have way more

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.650
empathy for others' thirst.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.890
So when you look at
the different outcomes,

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:23.170
before and after exercising--

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:27.250
remember, after exercising
is when people are thirsty--

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:32.740
thirst was mentioned
before hunger in the assay,

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.960
for thirsty people much more.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.160
Thirst was unpleasant.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.260
For hikers, it was
mentioned much more.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:40.780
Hikers would regret
not packing water.

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.970
Thirst more unpleasant
for the self.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:46.492
Oneself would regret
more not packing water.

00:46:46.492 --> 00:46:47.950
So all of these
items that are sort

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.770
of like thirst-related,
people, when

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:53.020
they were thirsty
after exercising

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:57.760
were way more
focused on than not.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.730
So it is as if people have
projection bias in the sense

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:05.170
people understand much more
that the condition of thirst

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.080
is really bad when
they're thirsty

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.680
compared to when they are not.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.170
OK, so let me take stock
of what we discussed.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.990
So I showed you some
evidence of projection bias

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:21.100
for many short-run
changes in preferences,

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.110
and at least for some of them.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.290
There's hunger, thirst, pain,
sleep, weather, addiction.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:27.670
There's other evidence as well--

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:30.543
arousal, anger, sadness,
and so on-- when

00:47:30.543 --> 00:47:31.960
people aren't
certain states, they

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.900
have trouble to predict their
preferences when they're not

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.820
in that state.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.280
Now, one key
question that I don't

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.790
have a great answer for you
is why do people not learn?

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:45.390
People have had
lots of experience

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.140
with a lot of these
changes, in particular

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.420
when you think about sleep
or hunger or the like.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.150
But even for addiction,
when people just

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:55.460
have smoked a cigarette versus
not, that happens all the time.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.460
So they really should
have learned, over time,

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.700
to predict their preference.

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:03.330
So the misprediction is
really not due to a lack

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:04.930
of opportunity to learn.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:06.930
Yet people really seem
to believe, all the time,

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:10.450
that this time is different,
over and over again.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.810
So I think that's just
a very deep cognitive

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.430
bias in some ways
in the sense of,

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:16.830
when people are affected
by certain visceral

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.710
or other aspects that
affect their preferences,

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.220
it's really hard to
imagine how they might feel

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.767
when that visceral influence
is not at play anymore

00:48:27.767 --> 00:48:28.350
in the future.

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.720
In addition to people
underestimating

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.790
short-run changes
in preferences,

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:41.270
people also underestimate
adaptation to long-run changes.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:42.980
So Dan Gilbert, if
you're interested,

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.610
has very nice work,
including a book

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.410
called Stumbling on Happiness.

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:51.290
And he gives many examples
of the underestimation

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:55.530
of adaptation, which
they call immune neglect.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:49:02.760
And so one example is how does
a positive or negative tenure

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.130
decision affect well-being?

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:09.300
And so they ask current
assistant professors

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.490
at the University of
Texas to forecast.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:14.400
And then they ask, as
well, former University

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.070
of Texas assistant
professors to recall.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:20.430
And as a current assistant
professor like myself,

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:23.700
if you forecast, if there's
a negative tenure decision,

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.810
life will be terrible.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:29.880
And how are we ever going to
live after being denied tenure?

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.830
And so when you look at
what's actually happening,

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:41.850
professors seem to be relatively
accurate in predicting

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:44.370
the immediate impact
of the tenure decision,

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.460
but they overestimated
the long-run impact.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.160
That is to say, in
fact, immediately

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.080
after being denied
tenure, people

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.810
are maybe arguably
or understandably

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:56.850
disappointed and unhappy.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:59.850
But over time, the long run
effect is much less severe.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.460
People seem to adjust
to their circumstances.

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.650
In the medium and
long run, people

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:08.940
are almost as happy
as if not as happy

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.220
as if they had gotten tenure.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.650
So there's actually not
much of a long-run effect.

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:16.270
Yet people seem to
mispredict the effect.

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.190
They really seem to
think, in the short run,

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.440
the effect will be really bad.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.020
And that bad effect
will last forever.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.100
So people seem to essentially
sort of understand

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:30.600
there's a psychological
immune system to bad events.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.830
People recover from negative
shocks quite well over time.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:37.740
But people seem to mispredict
this recovery, which

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.010
which again is what's
called immune neglect.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:43.830
There's similar misprediction
for other life events

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:47.370
such as paraplegia or
lottery wins, so for very

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.380
negative and positive events.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.560
People seem to misunderstand
that, again, in the short run,

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.930
there's usually a
pretty large decrease

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.810
or increase in people's
happiness and life

00:50:57.810 --> 00:50:58.920
satisfaction.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:02.610
But people tend to recover
from that quite well over time.

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:04.380
But in their
prediction, people seem

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.840
to mispredict that adjustment.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:11.580
People seem to think that the
bad effects on happiness--

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.920
or bad or good effects
and happiness--

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.420
would persist forever.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.080
Let me now show you a simple
model of projection bias

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.790
by Loewenstein et al.

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:23.130
that formalizes some
of the intuitions

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:24.660
that we discussed so far.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.640
So suppose true
utility at time t

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.190
depends on both
consumption ct at time t

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:34.120
and the state st at the time t.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.850
So it's u of ct
st. The state could

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.910
be anything that affects utility
from consumption, ranging

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:42.920
from the level of
hunger or addiction,

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.050
whether somebody had
just smoked versus not

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:50.780
or whether somebody has just
gotten some BUP dose or not,

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:54.170
or past consumption, et cetera,
whether somebody is tired,

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.710
and so on.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:01.190
Now, the prediction at time t
of future utility at the time

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:03.890
tower larger than t
from assuming the c tau

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:08.990
and state as tau is u
hat of c tau as tau.

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:12.200
And that equals 1
minus alpha times u

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:18.920
of c tau as tau plus
alpha times u of c tau st.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.690
Now, what is this expression?

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:23.480
Well, if you look at the
first part, u of c tau

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:27.260
s tau, that is the
correct future utility

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.480
at time tau from consuming
c tau in state tau.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.650
So if alpha was 0, then this
term here would go away,

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:38.360
this term is just 1.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.840
So that is essentially
a correct prediction.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.330
So there is no production bias.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:46.400
The person has
rational expectation

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:53.480
about their future utility
at time tau of utility c

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.180
tau in state s tau.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.210
Now, if alpha is not
zero, then there's

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:00.810
this additional term here.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:04.318
So this is the weighted
average of alpha weights

00:53:04.318 --> 00:53:06.110
for this other term
here, which we're going

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.193
to talk about in a second.

00:53:07.193 --> 00:53:12.830
And 1 minus alpha, the
correct utility of consuming

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:15.020
c tau in state s tau.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.770
Now, what is this
other term here?

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:19.640
Well, the person
gets c tau correctly,

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.370
so the consumption is right
but the state is wrong.

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:24.200
And what state is
the person using

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.910
to predict their future utility?

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:29.220
Well, it's using st,
the current state.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.550
So the person is essentially
using their current state

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:34.370
to some degree to predict
their future utility instead

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:36.710
of the future state as tau.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.702
Now, notice that if st
and s tau is the same,

00:53:39.702 --> 00:53:40.910
then there's no problem here.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:42.660
There's going to be
no misprediction.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.080
So it better be the
case that the states st

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.760
and s tau are different.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.860
For example, a hungry person
would mispredict that utility

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.600
from not being hungry.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.860
So the utility from not being
hungry would be this part.

00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:02.390
The person is hungry right now
at time t if st equals hungry.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:04.928
The person would predict
the future utility even

00:54:04.928 --> 00:54:07.220
when they're not hungry,
thinking that they will always

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.360
be hungry in the future.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.390
So alpha in between 0 and 1 is
the degree of projection bias.

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:19.980
So just to give you
more detail, the person

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.460
predicts how she'd
feel about consuming c

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:26.010
tau in the future partially
at least by how she'd

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.930
feel about consuming it now.

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.240
That's what the parameter
alpha is measuring.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.310
Alpha between 0 and
1-- it could be 0.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.060
It could be 1--

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.050
is the degree of
projection bias.

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.510
So alpha equals 0 is
correct understanding

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:38.520
of future utility.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.260
That's essentially
no projection bias.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.180
That's rational expectations.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.533
Alpha equals 1 is
full projection bias.

00:54:44.533 --> 00:54:46.200
That's a person who
thinks, essentially,

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.165
their future state
will always be

00:54:48.165 --> 00:54:50.040
their current state,
which, of course, is not

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.865
necessarily true.

00:54:51.865 --> 00:54:54.240
So now that person will optimize
according to a perceived

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.980
future preferences.

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.640
You had c tau, s
tau, and I'm going

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.680
to assume for now is an
exponential discounter.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.710
That's, of course, you
could relax that easily.

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:06.210
And, in fact, in
some of the problem

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:08.760
sets from previous years
and from this year,

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.760
that will be, in fact, relaxed.

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.580
Now let me give you a very
simple example with hunger.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:19.830
Again, the problem set this
year and past problem sets

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:21.960
give you quite a few
other additional examples

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.220
that you can study.

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.370
So suppose there are two states.

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:28.505
The state is either hungry
or not hungry, H or N.

00:55:28.505 --> 00:55:32.610
And the consumption ct is
over burgers and money.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:37.680
So u of ct where ct is the
number of burgers and money

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.260
that the person has.

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.213
And state H is 5 times
the number of burgers

00:55:44.213 --> 00:55:46.380
that the person eats plus
the remaining money that's

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.660
left to spend on other things.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:51.480
The utility of ct and when
the person is not hungry

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.820
is 1 times the number of burgers
plus the money that's left.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.590
Now what does that imply?

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:01.770
Well, it implies that she's
willing to pay $5 for a burger

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:04.260
when hungry and $1 when full.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.560
How do we know that?

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.670
Well, we know that because
in the first case when

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:12.990
the person is hungry,
each burger gives 5 utils,

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:14.610
and each dollar gets 1 util.

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:18.270
So the exchange rate between
burgers and utils is 5.

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:21.540
So the person is going
to pay $5 per burger.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.190
In the second case,
the exchange trade

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:27.360
between utility from burgers
and utility from dollars is 1.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:31.330
So the person is willing
to pay $1 for a burger.

00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.670
Now suppose alpha is 3/4.

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:36.273
Again, remember alpha is the
degree of projection bias.

00:56:36.273 --> 00:56:37.690
I'm going to go
back and show you.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.340
Alpha is this parameter here.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.230
Alpha is the degree
of projection bias,

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:43.550
so the degree of misprediction.

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:47.920
So suppose in our example
here alpha equals 3/4,

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.325
and the person is
not hungry right now.

00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:53.200
What is their willingness
to pay for a burger

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.000
tonight when she'll be hungry?

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.280
So if the person is
not hungry right now,

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.040
her correct utility
or willingness

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.900
to pay for a burger is $1.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.340
We just established
that already.

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.360
She's full.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:08.470
And the correct utility for
willingness to pay for a burger

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:12.440
tonight when she'll
be hungry is $5.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.630
Now her projection bias is 3/4.

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:22.280
So essentially she puts 3/4 of
a weight on her current state

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.680
and 1/4 on the full state.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.040
Well, 3/4 times 1
plus 1/4 times 5

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.145
or going essentially 3/4
between a difference of 4

00:57:31.145 --> 00:57:34.130
is essentially 3.

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:35.810
So the person
essentially will think

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:43.460
that their future willingness to
pay is $2 for a burger tonight.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:48.470
Or put differently, if she
thinks she only wants like--

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:51.410
her willingness to pay will
only be $2 for a burger tonight,

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:52.910
if she orders for
a burger tonight

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:55.400
and the burger
costs like $3 or $4,

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.860
she will not be
willing to do that.

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:04.220
Now just to be very clear, so
the person only essentially--

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:07.850
if alpha equals
3/4, the person only

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:10.580
incorporates 1/4 of
the preference change

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:14.190
from being full versus
hungry in the future.

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:18.845
So that is to say there's a
difference of $4 between $1

00:58:18.845 --> 00:58:23.780
and $5, and she only takes into
account 1/4 of that $4, which

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:24.740
is $1.

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.980
So willingness to pay
is 1 plus 1 equals 2.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.780
You can also write
this down here

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.930
instead of using the
formula from the equation

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:37.250
from before, which essentially
is 3/4, which is, again,

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:43.310
alpha times utility
using the current state,

00:58:43.310 --> 00:58:47.900
and 1/4 using the
correct utility, which

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.920
is the future state.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:51.140
Once you sort of
calculate that, she

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:54.380
would be willing to pay
at most $2 for a burger.

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.360
So potentially she's
making a mistake.

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:06.600
And so again in
the problem set you

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.120
will have more
examples and questions

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:12.540
that allows you to practice
with this level model.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:15.400
Now, why should you care
about projection bias?

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.860
I showed you pretty
good evidence

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:21.320
of projection bias in many
settings in the sense of saying

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.510
we think projection bias really
exists and we think projection

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:26.410
bias might be quite important.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:26.910
Sorry.

00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:30.210
It might be relevant in
explaining people's behavior

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:33.020
in those settings.

00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:35.930
Now, the consequences
in those settings

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:37.790
is relatively unimportant.

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:41.150
For example, in car purchases
if rich people buy convertibles

00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:43.940
and then sort of return
their convertibles,

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.040
the loss from that is
not particularly large.

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.940
Maybe there's some
redistribution across people.

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.860
Similarly, the
catalog orders, people

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:55.040
might purchase too many
things and return them.

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.100
Really, the consequences
are not that large,

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.010
and the actions are
often reversible.

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:03.702
So why should we then care
about projection bias?

01:00:03.702 --> 01:00:06.035
Well, there's at least two
really important applications

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:09.380
that we're going to talk about
for a little bit that really

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.820
could matter quite a lot.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.470
One is addiction,
which is people

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:15.140
mispredict the
utility from becoming

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.310
addicted in the future.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:18.818
Second is depression and hope.

01:00:18.818 --> 01:00:20.360
When people are
depressed, they might

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.650
mispredict how they feel when
they're not depressed anymore.

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:29.930
Some might argue that
marriage and relationships are

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:32.430
quite important or projection
bias might be quite important.

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:34.130
Particularly when
people have fights,

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.350
they might want to get
divorced very quickly.

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.630
They might sort
of do rash things

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:40.190
about getting married
really quickly

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:42.550
or try to get a
divorce very quickly.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:45.040
And, in fact, there are some
laws that often prevent that.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.540
People need to actually have
some cool-down period for a few

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:50.330
days where they
have to sort of--

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:52.160
if one wants to get
married, for example,

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.285
you have to get a license,
and it takes a few days,

01:00:54.285 --> 01:00:56.240
and only then you
can get married.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.360
The same is true for a divorce,
at least in some places.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.950
Perhaps that's because people
suffer from projection bias

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:04.520
sometimes.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.740
And when they're really mad
at somebody or something

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.115
really bad happens between
them or something really great

01:01:09.115 --> 01:01:10.940
happened between
them, they might not

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.780
be able to predict that their
preferences and their views

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:19.543
towards the other person
might change over time.

01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:21.710
But let me tell you now a
little bit about addiction

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.663
and depression and hope.

01:01:24.663 --> 01:01:26.830
So first addiction, and
that's the main applications

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:28.520
we're going to discuss.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.460
So projection bias might
be important for people's

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:36.870
initiation when people are
starting to take drugs.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:38.870
So here let's define
the relevant state

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:40.760
as the person's
level of addiction.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.820
So how much has the person
consumed of cigarettes

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:46.070
in the last month or year?

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.440
In an unaddicted state,
cigarettes are really not

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.240
that hard to resist, right?

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.370
If somebody has
never smoked before,

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.140
cigarettes are really
not that attractive.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.720
Same is true also for
alcohol, for example.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.075
In an unaddicted-- so
in an addicted state,

01:01:59.075 --> 01:02:00.950
however, it's very hard
to resist cigarettes.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.367
If you have smoked
a lot recently,

01:02:02.367 --> 01:02:05.450
you really, really would like
to smoke on any given day.

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:08.540
Now, the unaddicted
person might sort of

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.330
think that experimenting
with cigarettes is fun

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:12.740
but does not want
to get addicted

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.980
for the rest of her life.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.260
It's sort of fun to
do it for a while,

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.177
but really then you want
to stop because being

01:02:17.177 --> 01:02:19.850
addicted for the rest of
your life is really bad.

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:23.840
You might get really bad health
consequences, for instance.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.610
And that might give
you some false--

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:27.710
if you sort of have
projection bias,

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:30.260
you might have some
false sense of control.

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.930
If you project your current
nonaddictive preferences

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:36.380
into the future, you might
think that you can stop smoking

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.700
or taking drugs if necessary.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.810
And so then the person might
try cigarettes, get addicted,

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:43.430
and consume much of your life.

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:46.700
Perhaps she wouldn't do so
if she knew she could quit.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.340
That's essentially to say if
you're not addicted right now,

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.140
you might predict
that it's going to be

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.650
always easy to stop smoking.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:55.550
And, in fact, right
now it is really easy

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.370
to stop smoking or resisting.

01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:02.270
But the person might mispredict
that this will always

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:05.870
be the case in the future
even once she is addicted

01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:08.360
and once she has
smoked a lot because

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.990
for the nonaddicted person,
it's really hard to imagine

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:15.760
that it might be even harder
to resist in the future.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.010
In addition, there are
quitting and restarting

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.960
cycles that are very common
when it comes to addiction.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.840
So addicts often
express a desire

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.120
to stop using
substances permanently

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.010
but are unable to
follow through.

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:31.170
That's not surprising,
and we've kind of

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:32.760
thought about this before.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.890
And quasi hyperbolic
discounting can essentially

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:36.960
predict that as well.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.550
Short-term abstention
in addiction

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:45.430
is common while long-term
abstention is rare.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:48.150
So in 2000, for
example, 41% of smokers

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:53.910
stopped for at least one day
trying to quit, but only 4.7%

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.640
successfully abstained for
more than three months.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.250
That doesn't really seem like
quasi hyperbolic discounting.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:04.200
So you wouldn't go through
a pointless short-term pain

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.300
and then not follow
through if [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.070
quasi hyperbolic discounting.

01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:11.760
The reason being in particular
that withdrawal symptoms

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.590
tend to be, on
average, strongest

01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:15.660
at the start of a quit attempt.

01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.520
So hyperbolic discounting
would not sort of

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:24.183
go over this really difficult
pain in the short run

01:04:24.183 --> 01:04:26.350
if you don't follow through
because it's essentially

01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:27.352
short-run pain.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:33.080
And then three, recidivism
rates are especially high when

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.470
addicts are exposed to
occasional cues related

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:38.130
to past consumption.

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:41.480
So treatment programs, in
fact, advise recovering addicts

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.360
to move to new locations
and to avoid places

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:49.080
when previous
consumption took place.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.080
So let's sort of go
through these one by one

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.330
and try to see whether,
particularly in two and three,

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:58.390
whether we can explain
those using projection bias.

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:01.800
So now let's define the state
as the strength of cravings

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.020
at the moment, and suppose
this varies randomly

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:06.090
or with exposure to cues.

01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:09.570
How do you explain the
starting a quit attempt?

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:12.690
Well, suppose an addict is
currently consuming regularly.

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.528
She experiences
periods of low cravings

01:05:14.528 --> 01:05:15.570
when it's easy to resist.

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:19.110
That's like when the person has
just smoked, cravings are low,

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:20.610
and it's easy to resist.

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:22.650
So then the person
might think, well, it'll

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.750
always be easy to
resist, so she thinks

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:28.770
it's worth trying to quit and
starts the quitting attempt.

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:30.960
Now, how do we explain
then how people

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.550
abandon the quit attempt?

01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:35.100
Well, suppose the addict is
currently on a quit attempt.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:38.160
Something triggers strong
cravings, which might just

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.470
be over time you get
cravings or maybe the person

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:43.410
might just be
exposed to some cues.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.360
So then the person
feels it's really hard

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.060
to resist the drugs,
and in particular, she

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.625
thinks drugs will always be
hard to resist because currently

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:53.250
she's craving a lot,
and you can't even

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:56.030
imagine that it might be--

01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.270
that that craving
might stop over time.

01:05:58.270 --> 01:06:01.020
So she thinks the quit attempt
is impossible to carry through,

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.520
and so she abandons it.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.280
So that way projection
bias can both explain

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.410
why the person starts
the quit attempt

01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:09.840
but also why the person
does not follow through.

01:06:16.578 --> 01:06:17.526
I'm sorry.

01:06:17.526 --> 01:06:19.620
Give me a second.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.990
How do we think
about the recidivism?

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:25.545
Well, here there's
not necessarily

01:06:25.545 --> 01:06:27.180
a projection bias needed.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:31.500
But here people might
misunderestimate

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:36.520
how important cues are in
affecting people's utility.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.760
So if it's a case that an
addict, for example-- when

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.920
the addict walks by,
like, a liquor store

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.890
or when the addict
is talking to friends

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:47.400
who they have been taking
drugs in the past and so on,

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.400
that might really increase
people's marginal utility

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.730
of using drugs.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:53.790
So they might get really,
really strong cravings,

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:56.580
and it might be really, really
hard for them to resist.

01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:02.040
Now if you know that as an
addict who is recovering,

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.870
who's not taking
any drugs currently,

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:06.090
you should at all
cost avoid these cues

01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:08.430
because you know you want
to make sure that you're not

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:10.440
exposed to them.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.070
But if you have protection
bias, you might underestimate

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:17.400
the importance of
those cues in affecting

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.520
your utility or your
cravings, and so

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.710
you might sort of walk
into a bar thinking like,

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:24.668
well, I haven't really
been smoking or drinking

01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:27.210
for a long time, so I'm sure
they will be able to resist.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:30.150
But, of course, then once
you're exposed to these cues,

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:32.620
you will not be able to do
so, and that misprediction

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.860
might really then
cause recidivism.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.770
So again, in that
sense, protection bias

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:42.760
is also consistent with that
kind of recidivism due to cues.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:48.478
Now let me talk very briefly
only about depression.

01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:50.020
And the reason being
that we're going

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.280
to talk about mental
health in a future lecture.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.160
So depressed individuals
have the tendency

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.560
to project the depressed
feelings not only to the future

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.420
but also to the past.

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:05.380
And so in particular, the
depressed tend to think about--

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.605
depression is the inability
to construct a future.

01:08:08.605 --> 01:08:10.480
And in particular, when
someone is depressed,

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.780
the past and future are absorbed
entirely by the present,

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.910
and people can neither
remember feeling better

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:19.553
nor imagine that they will
feel better in the future.

01:08:19.553 --> 01:08:21.220
So that's to say if
the person is really

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.370
feeling terrible
right now, they also

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:26.920
think they always have been
feeling terrible in the past,

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.630
and they also think
that they will always

01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:30.649
feel terrible in the future.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:33.220
So then life might feel
particularly hopeful

01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.350
if there's no scope for
future improvements.

01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:37.700
And if you think your
life was always that bad,

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:39.979
there's really--

01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:41.979
in some cases, people
might think there's really

01:08:41.979 --> 01:08:44.260
not much of a reason to live.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.420
And that's, of course,
an extremely dangerous

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:54.490
and difficult or consequential,
potentially, misprediction

01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:56.200
because, of course,
depressed people

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.859
can get better through therapy
and through drugs and so on.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:05.319
And often there's also
remission over time.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:09.167
But if people mispredict that,
they might, for instance, never

01:09:09.167 --> 01:09:11.500
seek treatment because they
think, why would I ever seek

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.840
treatment if I'm
always feeling terrible

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.757
for the rest of my life anyway?

01:09:15.757 --> 01:09:17.590
We're going to get back
to that a little bit

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:20.899
when talking about
mental health.

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:28.024
Now, one thing that we have
not really talked about

01:09:28.024 --> 01:09:29.899
is how to think about
these different biases.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.910
In particular,
what's the difference

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:34.700
between projection bias
and naive quasi-hyperbolic

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.029
discounting?

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:38.660
So both naivety and
quasi-hyperbolic discounting

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.609
and projection bias
entail a misprediction.

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:44.840
So as an example, take a
smoker who wants to quit.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.630
The naive quasi-hyperbolic
discounter

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.120
overestimates their
future patience.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.240
So that person will sign up
for a commitment contract

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.540
to stop smoking and might
fail due to the overestimation

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.460
of usefulness of
commitment devices.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.030
That person thinks
that commitments--

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:05.060
the person understands
that she has some--

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.683
suppose that's a partially
naive person, which we need.

01:10:07.683 --> 01:10:09.350
Otherwise the person
would never sign up

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:10.700
for a commitment contract.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.220
Suppose the person
is partially naive.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.590
The person will sign up for
that commitment contract

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:18.560
thinking that's going to
help them stop smoking,

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.300
but the person is
going to underestimate

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.550
how bad their
self-control problems are.

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:24.470
So then the person
might fail because they

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.012
think their commitment device
is really, really helpful when,

01:10:27.012 --> 01:10:29.450
in fact, it's not strong enough.

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:33.540
Now for projection
bias, the person

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.220
might underestimate
the influence

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.653
of altered future states.

01:10:37.653 --> 01:10:40.070
So the person might also sign
up for a commitment contract

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:42.300
to stop smoking
and then might feel

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.420
guilty due to the
underestimation of the changes

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:46.890
in future cravings.

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:49.673
That is to say if you are
currently not craving,

01:10:49.673 --> 01:10:51.090
you might sign up
for a commitment

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:56.100
contract that would help you
to continue not using drugs.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.130
And you might
underestimate, however,

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.500
how bad the cravings
will be in the future

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.640
once you see certain
cues or the like.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.360
So again, you might choose
a commitment contract

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.060
that is not strong enough
because you mispredict

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.410
your future preferences.

01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:12.630
In this case, not because
it's in the future,

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:15.690
not because you mispredicting
beta like in case number one

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:17.640
but rather because
you mispredict

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.333
how strongly future states
will affect your preferences.

01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:25.500
You can also think about
another example, anesthesia

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.550
during childbirth.

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:31.470
You can get similar
sort of patterns.

01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:35.010
Both naive quasi-hyperbolic
discounting and projection bias

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:37.875
might be able to explain
people's choices there.

01:11:37.875 --> 01:11:40.830
In particular, both of
them would potentially

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:44.120
predict preference reversals.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.810
Now, how can we tell projection
bias and naivety regarding beta

01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.090
apart?

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.610
Well, the key part here
is that projection bias

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:55.140
is a state-dependent
misprediction.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:57.530
So people are more likely
to predict future temptation

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.270
to overeat when hungry.

01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:01.010
They're more likely
to predict smoking

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:03.350
when you haven't had a
cigarette for a while.

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:06.110
So when people are-- when
the state in the future

01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:07.940
is different from
the current state,

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.040
people might mispredict
their preferences.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.320
So now a present
bias, in fact, has

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.750
nothing to do with the
state, essentially just about

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:20.630
the future versus the present.

01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:22.180
So now what do we need?

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:25.640
What kind of variation do we
need to disentangle the two

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.630
explanations?

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:28.670
Well, you need
variation in timing

01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:31.580
and in particular
variation in states.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.433
So present bias would
say it doesn't really

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:35.600
matter what state you're in.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.110
It doesn't matter whether
you're hungry or not right now.

01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:39.860
There's always going
to be a misprediction

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.510
between the present
and the future.

01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:46.030
And projection bias would very
much say the states matter.

01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:49.180
It's a state-dependent
misprediction.

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.390
So if you wanted to look
at people's predictions

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:58.470
for the future, present bias or
naivete regarding present bias

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:00.780
would say it doesn't matter
whether you have smoked

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.030
or whether you're hungry
right now for your prediction

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:04.050
for the future.

01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:07.770
Projection bias would say
it does matter quite a bit.

01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:10.830
But then a tricky question
is when should you,

01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:13.470
in fact, offer people
commitment devices?

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.410
Well, you should probably
offer people commitment devices

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:18.720
if you want them
to choose correct--

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.760
if you want people to
make correct choices.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.090
You probably want
to offer people

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:32.070
commitment devices at
times when they're,

01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:34.000
in fact, in the same state.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.200
So when somebody
already has cravings,

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.950
you want to offer them
a commitment device

01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:39.533
because that person
really understands

01:13:39.533 --> 01:13:41.490
how it will feel in the future.

01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:44.280
If, instead, you offer somebody
a commitment device when

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.260
they don't have
cravings, they might

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.810
choose that commitment
device, which I guess is good.

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.600
But then they might fail
because they mispredict

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.580
how strong of a
commitment device

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.140
they might need in the future.

01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.167
OK, so let me then
briefly summarize.

01:14:00.167 --> 01:14:01.250
So what did we talk about?

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:03.370
So we talked about
state-dependent preferences.

01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:05.200
So preferences
vary systematically

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.560
with the underlying states--
for example, hunger.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.570
Food is tastier
when you're hungry.

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:14.740
Going on dates is less
enjoyable while being sick.

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.520
Classes are best
when you're rested.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.842
Now, people know that
people's preferences

01:14:20.842 --> 01:14:21.800
vary with their states.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.675
They understand that.

01:14:22.675 --> 01:14:25.750
If you ask hungry people about
are your preferences different

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.820
when you're hungry
versus not, most people

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:30.070
would probably say they want
different types of kinds

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:32.140
of food and the like and
they behave differently

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.240
when they're hungry.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.990
However, there are biases
in state-dependent decision

01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.490
making.

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:42.130
In particular, both
intuition and psychology

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:43.960
suggests that we
fail to appreciate

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.120
the extent to which
our preferences change

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.950
with the underlying states.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:50.740
Projection bias is a
specific psychological error

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:51.850
of this type.

01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:55.150
People overestimate the extent
to which future tastes resemble

01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:57.880
their current tastes, and they
underestimate the influence

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:59.860
that the state has
on their utility,

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.590
and that can lead to
systematic misprediction.

01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:05.170
I showed you quite
a few applications.

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:07.360
In particular,
addiction and depression

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.390
might be the most
consequential applications

01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:12.960
of projection bias.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.833
Now there's one more
bias that I told you

01:15:15.833 --> 01:15:18.000
I'm going to talk about
very briefly-- again, that's

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.310
going to be discussed in
detail in recitation-- which

01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:22.800
is called attribution bias.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.310
Now attribution bias in
some sense is very similar,

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:28.500
but it's backward looking.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.920
So what projection bias is the
misprediction of the influence

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.400
of future states.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.008
So when you think about the
future, are you going to be--

01:15:36.008 --> 01:15:37.800
how are you going to
enjoy a meal depending

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.610
on when you're hungry versus
not or burgers versus salad?

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:46.440
How is your future preferences
shaped by future states?

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.710
Attribution bias is
instead backward looking.

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:54.130
It's the misprediction of
the influence of past states.

01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:56.460
So that's to say-- and I'm
going to sort of define that

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.480
briefly--

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.190
when judging the
value of a good,

01:15:59.190 --> 01:16:02.550
people are overly influenced
by the state in which they

01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:05.523
previously consumed it.

01:16:05.523 --> 01:16:06.940
Now let me give
you some examples.

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.590
And again, then you'll talk
about this more in recitation.

01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:13.170
People are more likely to
return to a restaurant when

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:14.328
first trying when hungry.

01:16:14.328 --> 01:16:16.620
So if you go to a restaurant
when you're really, really

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.562
hungry, you'll think
the food is amazing

01:16:19.562 --> 01:16:22.020
while, in fact, it might just
be that you're really, really

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:22.510
hungry.

01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:24.385
So when you then come
back to the restaurant,

01:16:24.385 --> 01:16:28.200
you might be surprised that,
in fact, it's not that great.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.610
People are also more likely to
negatively rate a movie when

01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:33.870
they've seen it while tired.

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:34.890
Well, why is that?

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:37.017
Because the experience
is just not that great,

01:16:37.017 --> 01:16:39.600
and then you sort of think the
movie is really not that great.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.740
But, really, it's
just you were tired.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:44.550
People are also less likely
to recommend a zoo to a friend

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:47.220
if it rained during
the last visit.

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:50.310
Well, it's just the experience
of that zoo is not that great.

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:53.590
Of course, some days it rains
and some days it doesn't.

01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:56.040
So you're not going to tell
usually your friend to only go

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.220
there when it's sunny.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:00.610
People are saying the zoo
was just not that much fun.

01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:03.040
And perhaps more
relevant for you,

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.320
people are more likely to--

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.890
or may be more likely to
recommend a class that they

01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:10.440
took while well rested.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:15.600
So a few years ago I was
teaching 1413 at 9:00 AM,

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.560
and I got lots of complaints
from students about the class

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.000
being way too early.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.470
And I was telling them or trying
to tell them that the class is

01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:27.450
really lots of fun.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:31.690
You may or may not be able to
appreciate that if you really

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:32.490
are tired.

01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:36.330
So attribution bias might
sort make you think that--

01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:40.140
might attribute some negative
or positive experience

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:44.430
to the actual underlying
quality of the issue

01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:48.030
or the good that's being offered
as opposed to, as you should,

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.650
to the underlying state.

01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:54.000
Again, you're going to talk
more about this in recitation.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.290
Now what's next?

01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:58.660
Remember, there is no
class on Monday, April 20.

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.720
On Wednesday, April
22, we're going

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.390
to talk about gender,
discrimination, and identity.

01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:06.710
Please read Heather
Sarson's paper, section one,

01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:08.680
just the introduction.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.270
Thank you very much.

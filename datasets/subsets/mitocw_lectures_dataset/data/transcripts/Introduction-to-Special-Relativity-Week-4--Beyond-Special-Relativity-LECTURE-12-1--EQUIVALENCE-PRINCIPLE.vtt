PROFESSOR: Welcome back to
[? A20, ?] special relativity.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
Very early in this lecture,
we discussed what mass is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.790
and how we can understand
the mass of a proton

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.990
and the mass of an electron
as it interacts with the Higgs

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.455
background field.

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:37.330
But here, the question
is slightly different.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.430
You want to understand
the difference or the lack

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.630
of difference between the
mass in a gravitational field

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.110
compared to the inertial
mass, a mass being

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.330
pushed through some force.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.030
And it's probably Einstein's
biggest realization

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.590
that those two
things are the same.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
And that finding is called
the equivalence principle,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.030
the equivalence of the
gravitational and inertial

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.220
mass.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.840
So if you are a
freely falling person,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.360
you will not feel
your own weight

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.680
in your gravitational field.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.390
You will just drop.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.780
And the gravitational field
provides an acceleration.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.050
And that acceleration, if you
are standing in an elevator

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.070
or just sitting on a chair
like I'm doing right now,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.220
then sets up an accelerating
reference frame.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.630
So there is an equivalence
between being accelerated

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.600
or being stationary in
a gravitational field.

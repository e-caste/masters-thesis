00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.770
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
OK, good morning.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.250
So I'd like to pick up from
where we left off last time.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.850
So we were discussing
the various properties

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.600
of the Fourier
transform and what

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.850
they mean in terms of the
Fraunhofer diffraction

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.032
patterns.

00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:41.240
So what we're doing last
time when we ran out of time

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.300
was we were proving the
convolution theorem.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090
So this is the proof here.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.610
And just to remind
you very briefly,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.240
we start with an expression
that looks like a convolution.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.610
We have an output
function equals an input

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.880
function times a kernel.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.010
Then what we did is we wrote
each one of those, the input

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.490
as well as the kernel, we wrote
those as Fourier transforms.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.490
Here they are respectively.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.460
Then we rearranged the integrals
and the order of integration.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:26.800
And we noticed that this
expression here is also

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.360
known as a delta function.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.590
The integral of an exponential,
of a complex exponential

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.395
from minus infinity to
infinity is a delta function.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.295
Oh, too bright.

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:44.920
OK, I think that's
a little bit better.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.940
I can rewrite this.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.970
Let me do it one step at a time.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.850
So I can rewrite now
this big integral.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.860
Unfortunately, the black
marker has run out of steam,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.970
so I'll switch color.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.550
So since we have a double
integral with respect

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.590
to the two frequency variables
and a delta function inside,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.280
the delta function will knock
out one of the integrals.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.385
And we simply replace the--

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.470
well, let's pick--
we can pick whichever

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.500
variable we want to
integrate, so let's pick u1.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.730
So we'll simply get du1 times
G sub in of u1 H of u1 one

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.100
e to the i 2 pi u1 x prime.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.170
And now we realize and
remember what this is.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.230
If you go back to the
beginning of the derivation,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.060
this is the outcome
of the convolution.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.120
So this is actually-- let
me write it out again.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.290
This is G sub out of x prime.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.230
What we've got now is
a Fourier transform.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.638
Because, you see, here is
the Fourier transform kernel.

00:03:33.638 --> 00:03:35.180
Actually-- I'm
sorry-- what we've got

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.730
is a Fourier integral.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.400
We've got to write the
outcome of the convolution

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.170
as a Fourier
integral, where this

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.180
is the Fourier integral
kernel or the inverse Fourier

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.480
transform kernel.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.680
The two terms mean
the same thing.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.580
And this is the actual
inverse Fourier transform.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.090
So, therefore, this result
is equivalent to G sub

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:04.070
out of u equals G sub
in of u times H of u.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.860
So this is, then, the proof of
the convolution theorem, which

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.700
says that if two
functions are related

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.970
as a convolution
with a kernel, then

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.390
the equivalent relationship
in the Fourier domain

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.570
is actually a product of the
Fourier transform of the input

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.990
function times the Fourier
transform of the kernel.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.340
So this mathematical-- this
analytical result is what

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.440
you've seen in the simulations
that I have on this screen

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.820
here, where the two--

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.320
I will do this in one dimension.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.240
The simulations
are obviously 2D,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.390
but it's a little bit easier
to do everything in 1D here

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.360
so we don't spend too
much time writing.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.300
So the two functions that
we have here are actually--

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.130
one of them is a sinusoid.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.025
So if I have a sinusoid--

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.980
I keep using the blue
marker, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.275
So the sinusoid is--

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.020
let me just write it
with full contrast

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.960
to save some writing here.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.470
This is a sinusoid.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.110
Then it's Fourier
transform will actually--

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.480
as we have said
several times, it

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.430
will consist of three
delta functions.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.130
Then we have another function
which looks like a rectangle.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.720
That's on the right-hand
side, top right.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.470
And we've already seen this one.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.880
So the rectangle is a
rectangular function.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.750
If it has a width, let's say,
a, then the Fourier transform

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.865
will look like this.

00:06:20.992 --> 00:06:22.450
And we call this
the sinc function.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.230
So the height of this
function is a by virtue

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.270
of the scaling theorem.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.690
And then the nulls, they go
like 1/a, 2/a, and so on.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.970
And then, symmetrically,
on the negative side,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.750
minus 1/a, minus 2/a,
and so on and so forth.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.380
So these are two Fourier
transform relationships.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.800
Now, what we see
on the bottom side

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.450
is basically a grating
which is truncated.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.320
So I take my infinite grating.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.480
It continues on and on.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.590
And then I truncate it.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.260
That is, I multiply--

00:07:32.924 --> 00:07:38.790
I multiply it by a rectangular
function which sets the side--

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.510
which sets the aperture
of the truncation.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.370
So the way I've written it,
the width of this boxcar

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:54.190
would be a, and the period
of the grating itself

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.890
would be uppercase lambda.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.640
So, of course, we can
go ahead and compute

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.317
this Fourier transform
analytically,

00:08:00.317 --> 00:08:01.650
but that would be quite painful.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.420
We'd have to do a lot of
changes of variable and so on.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.250
However, by virtue of
the convolution theorem,

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.620
because this is a product,
this Fourier transform

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.520
will be a convolution.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.700
So, basically, what we
have to do in order--

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:23.480
when we multiply these two
results in this domain,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.650
in this domain we
have to convolve them.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.130
So what is now-- so
the assumption here

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.340
is that the size of the
boxcar is actually bigger

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.720
by the size of the period.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.250
It does not have
to be much bigger,

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.309
but it's nice if it
is bigger for what I'm

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.000
about to draw to be correct.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.220
So what we get if we can
convolve this pattern

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.210
with the three delta
functions, each delta

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.610
will produce a replica
of this function centered

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.610
at the location of
the delta function.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.590
So, therefore, we'll
get three replicas

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.550
of this sinc pattern centered
at the corresponding locations.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.650
So let me draw this a
little bit carefully here.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.900
So I'll try to be as
accurate as I can.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.630
OK.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.450
So here are the two--

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.960
well, there's three
delta functions.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.150
One is at the origin.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.860
One is at minus 1 up on
lambda, and the other

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.000
is at plus 1 up on lambda.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.400
And then, on each
one of those, I'm

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.380
going to center one
of the sinc functions.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:42.410
So here is one sinc
function, and here

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:50.160
is another sinc function,
and another one.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.360
So I tried to do it carefully.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.385
Why is this taller?

00:09:58.385 --> 00:09:59.760
Because, if you
recall, the delta

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.130
function that was at
the origin is actually

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.590
twice the size of the
other two delta functions.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:10.170
So the size of this one
would be a/2 actually,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.610
because, if you
recall, we're also

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.810
picking up one factor of
a from the sinc itself.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.490
Then the size of this would
be a/4, and the size of this

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.070
would also be a/4.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.580
When I say the size,
I mean the height.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.350
And then where are
the nulls located?

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.830
Well, these nulls are simple.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.370
They're still at 1/a, minus 1/a.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.340
Where is this null?

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.885
For example, this null would
be at 1 over lambda plus 1/a.

00:10:39.885 --> 00:10:42.990
And then I have another
null over here at 1

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.900
over lambda minus 1/a,
and so on and so forth.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.670
And then I have more nulls
at 1 over lambda minus 2/a,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.850
minus 3/a, and so
on and so forth.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.230
And now my assumption
that I have

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.710
several periods of the
grating with the boxcar,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.150
you can see it is quite
convenient because I can draw

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.420
these sinc functions and
I can kind of ignore what

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.550
happens in between over here.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.260
As you can imagine,
something complicated

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.650
will happen over here because
the sincs are actually

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.190
adding coherently, so
something funky will happen.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.170
But if they're
pretty far apart, you

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.240
can see that the envelope
of the sinc function

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.620
actually decays quite fast.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.640
So I can more or less ignore
what is happening over here,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.460
and I can simply draw
the sinc function.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.260
Of course, this is because
I'm doing it by hand.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.920
If I use a computational tool,
such as MATLAB or Mathematical,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.780
it will do it for me.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.730
So this is the
one-dimensional calculation,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.660
that is easier to do by hand.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.420
As a bonus, I think you
guys have already computed--

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.150
or, if you haven't
already, you will

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.300
compute some time
between Tuesday midnight

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.280
and Wednesday at 8:00 AM.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.380
Some time you will compute
the same convolution

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.640
for the two-dimensional case.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.350
And you can see the result here.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.330
So, in effect, this
saves you from--

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.880
well, at least you know if your
result is correct or wrong.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.090
If you derive something
that looks like this,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.140
then you know you've
done correctly.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.630
So you see what's happened.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.840
If you had the infinite
grating, the infinite grating

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.850
gives you three
delta functions whose

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.690
axis is kind of perpendicular
to the fringes of the grating,

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.270
and the one that the
origin is stronger.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.950
Of course, the
rectangular function

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.768
produces a sinc pattern.

00:12:25.768 --> 00:12:27.310
And then when you
convolve them, when

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:35.600
you have a tilted grating now
and multiply it by a rect,

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.290
then you see that you get
three sinc patterns oriented

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.230
along the same axis, which is
perpendicular to the fringes

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.310
of the grating.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.290
But the sinc pattern
itself is actually

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.740
perpendicular to the
rectangular aperture.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.110
So this is what the
convolution theorem says.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.670
And, of course, you
can turn it around.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.050
You can actually turn
the grating around

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.730
and rotate the aperture.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.990
In this case now, again, you
will see the sincs oriented

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.710
parallel to the fringes again,
but now the rectangular pattern

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.860
itself is rotated, and therefore
the sinc patterns themselves

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.730
are rotated.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.985
So the reason we use these
properties is because--

00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:17.360
again, as you can
imagine, if you

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.700
were to write this as
an explicit integral,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.410
it can be done and
you would-- of course

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.300
you would still get
the correct result,

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.220
but it would be quite
painful to compute.

00:13:30.447 --> 00:13:32.030
So now that we have
all these results,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.790
we can actually apply them.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.670
So far, these were
mathematically results.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.700
I could pretend
I'm teaching 18085,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.660
or whatever it is that
you learn those things.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.420
But this is also-- of course,
they actually become Fraunhofer

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.200
diffraction patterns if you
simply perform a scale--

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.420
a coordinate change.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.820
So the Fourier transforms,
we compute them with respect

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.730
to the frequency variables,
u and v we call them.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.640
Goodman calls them
F sub x, F sub y,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.010
but it is actually
the same variable.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.520
Well, if you substitute
a special variable

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.093
and you multiply by the
scaling factor lambda z,

00:14:11.093 --> 00:14:13.260
that we saw the derivation
in the previous lecture--

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.550
I'm not going to do it again--

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.330
then you actually get the
Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.200
So it's a simple
scaling argument.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.630
And you can tell that--

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.540
well, at least it is
plausibly correct.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.080
Here, the units are
correct, because u and v

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.500
are frequency variables.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.300
So, therefore, their
units are inverse meters.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.260
And then multiply
it by meter squared.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.490
The wavelength is meter,
the distance is meter.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.380
So, therefore, I get meters.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.380
So the units are correct.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.640
And this is one
example that we did.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.920
Then here's another
one where I shrink

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.240
the rectangular aperture.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.130
And, of course, the Fraunhofer
diffraction pattern will grow.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:54.060
We call this a similarity
or scaling theorem.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.090
Then I can, for example,
use the shift theorem

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.110
to calculate the
Fraunhofer diffraction

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.150
pattern from three rectangles.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.710
As we discussed
the last time, this

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.960
will give rise to a sinusoidal
modulation in the Fraunhofer

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.850
domain.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.460
And you can also do
the convolution theorem

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.362
in this case with a
truncated aperture,

00:15:13.362 --> 00:15:14.320
and so on and so forth.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:26.360
So this basically concludes the
discussion of the Fraunhofer

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.100
diffraction pattern.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.640
But since we've been
discussing Fourier transforms,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.880
there's another very
basic property of Fourier

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.600
transforms that I would
like to introduce here,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.660
and then we will see it in
full glory for the next two

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.010
lectures, and that
is spatial filtering.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.380
So spatial filtering is
basically the following.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.070
It says if you go
to this Fraunhofer

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.440
domain, or, in general,
in the transform domain--

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.120
which, we will see
a little bit later,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.940
that we don't need to have
to go very far actually.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.970
By using a lens, we can produce
a Fraunhofer diffraction

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.270
pattern at the back
focal plane of the lens.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.870
That's very convenient.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.720
But if I go here and I
do some modification,

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.480
and then take another Fourier
transform, then, of course,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.580
the signal I reconstruct
is not identical

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.260
to my original
signal, but it will

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.290
have changed because I've
modified the frequency

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.560
spectrum.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.960
So this is called
spatial filtering.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.720
So here's an example
that I have constructed.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.140
So in this case, I've
contacted the signal

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.690
in the space domain that
looks like three sinusoids.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.150
Now, you cannot tell very
clearly from this pattern that

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.140
you have three sinusoids, but if
you take the Fourier transform,

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.090
then you see three
spots here, three dots.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.740
Actually, you see six.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.410
But you recall that each
sinusoid corresponds

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.850
to two dots.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.130
So the conjugate dots here,
this one and this one,

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.330
they are one sinusoid.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.040
This and this one,
another sinusoid.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.860
This and this one are
yet another sinusoid.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.010
So spatial filtering, a
very simple occurrence

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.550
of spatial filtering is what
happens if, for example, you

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.369
go in with some black
marker or some opaque screen

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.859
in the case of optics and
you remove one of these dots.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.770
If you do that in the transform
domain, then you will see it.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.300
Now, watch as I
transition the slide.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.139
You will see that the
spatial pattern also changes.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:24.829
OK.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.920
So now it becomes
kind of horizontal,

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.950
and it is horizontal because
the two dominant-- the two

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.340
dominant sinusoids are actually
along the horizontal axis.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.810
So, therefore,
your grooves are--

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:37.310
I'm sorry.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.330
Your grooves are vertical
because the two dots here

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.980
are on the horizontal axis.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.840
But there's also
a weaker sinusoid

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.930
that gives rise to
these weak diagonal

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.730
fringes that you see over here.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.230
But, basically, you
can see that one

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.820
of the three spatial
frequencies has vanished here.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.740
So this is the simplest
case of spatial filtering.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.640
And, of course, you
can generalize it.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.710
Here's again the Red Sox--

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.430
or I should say the GO SOX
pattern on the Boston high rise

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.110
that I showed last time.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:16.070
And this is the spatial
frequency representation

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.320
or the Fourier transform
of this pattern.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.010
And then we can apply
various filters.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.980
For example, if I
go with a filter

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.560
and I block all the
high frequencies,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.260
then you can see that my
pattern appears blurred.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.910
In fact, it is
more than blurred.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:33.050
The windows have kind of
disappeared of the building.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.730
And that is because the
windows, if I go back,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.970
you will see that the--

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:37.730
hi, Colin.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.530
You're back.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.410
COLIN: Yes.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.160
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Welcome.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.077
COLIN: Sorry I'm late.

00:18:41.077 --> 00:18:42.932
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Oh, no problem.

00:18:42.932 --> 00:18:44.390
I thought you were
still in Poland.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.480
COLIN: No, I got back.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Oh.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.920
Oh, OK, welcome back.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.530
And so the windows,
if you recall,

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.740
the windows are kind of
periodic in this high rise here.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.210
So they correspond to these
dots in the frequency domain,

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.160
kind of like delta functions.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.670
And because, in this case,
I have blocked the dots,

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.898
you see that the windows
disappear from the high rise.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.190
And, of course, you can do
other funky kind of filters.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.290
This is called a
band pass filter.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.200
And, in this case,
the windows reappear

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.280
because now I center this
doughnut, this annulus.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.940
I centered it so that some of
these dots in the frequency

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.210
domain, they survive.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.480
And you can see that,
of course, the--

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.715
well, it is not
fully reconstructed,

00:19:28.715 --> 00:19:30.090
the original
building, of course,

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.480
because there's still
spatial frequencies missing.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.810
But you can see that the pattern
of windows of the high rise

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.610
has kind of reappeared.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.340
Now, what happened
to the sign GO SOX?

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.100
It vanished, and it vanished
because, in this case,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.440
I have blocked the
lower frequencies.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.970
The GO SOX sign, it has
survived the low pass filter

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:55.440
because this is a relatively
slow-varying signal, right?

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.930
So its frequency content, you
expect it to be centered--

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.960
I'm sorry-- to be concentrated
near the center of the Fourier

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.580
domain where the
frequencies are low.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.550
When we do the band pass
filter, the GO SOX vanishes.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.030
And that is because I blocked
the low frequencies where

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.610
this signal was represented.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.750
So you can see that you can do
quite interesting manipulations

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.620
on images using this concept
of spatial frequency.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:29.480
And, actually, the GO SOX
signal has not quite vanished.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.470
If you look carefully, there is
a little bit of evidence of it

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.070
here, but it's
quite hard to see.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.070
And, of course, there's
a little bit of evidence

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.063
because there is a little bit
of the frequency content leaking

00:20:41.063 --> 00:20:42.480
into the intermediate
frequencies.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.330
So, therefore, some
of it has survived,

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.280
but mostly it is gone.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.080
So that is the--

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.130
so it is not a perfect filter,
but it works quite well.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.650
Of course, the other thing
that vanished is the average.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.640
You can see that
the sky, that used

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.750
to be kind of an average
gray, it is gone also.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.120
Because the average--
of course, the average

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.610
is presented at the zero spatial
frequency, and I blocked it.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.180
So, therefore, the
average is gone.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:13.080
So this is called
a spatial filter.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.240
OK.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.630
So we're still one
lecture behind.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:25.040
So this is what I was supposed
to have done last Wednesday.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.800
And if you look ahead, there is
some discussion of the transfer

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.750
function of a
Fresnel propagation,

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.570
and then something
called the Talbot effect.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.370
So I will not do this right now.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.115
I will postpone it, if
I may, for next week.

00:21:39.115 --> 00:21:40.660
What I would like
to do is I would

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:45.740
like to switch to the lecture
that I posted today online,

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.550
and that is Lecture 10A.

00:22:00.995 --> 00:22:02.120
The reason I'm doing that--

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.280
I will go back and talk
about the Talbot effect.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.150
Don't worry.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.980
But the reason
I'm doing that now

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.260
is because I would
like to press on

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.390
with the concept of
spatial frequencies

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.100
and spatial filtering.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.770
Because it is quite an important
one, and I think the sooner

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.340
you learn it, the better.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.870
Talbot effect, well
you can learn later.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.140
But this business of spatial
filtering, in my experience,

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.150
it takes quite a bit
of time to digest,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.202
so I would like to do it
sooner rather than later.

00:22:29.202 --> 00:22:30.410
So I already alluded to that.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.090
I said that this Fraunhofer
diffraction pattern

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.320
is a Fourier
transform, but we don't

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.320
have to go to infinity to watch
the Fraunhofer diffraction

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.740
pattern if we want to generate
a Fourier transform optically.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.887
We can also do it
by using a lens.

00:22:44.887 --> 00:22:46.220
So this is what I will do today.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.410
For the rest of the
lecture, I will show you

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:53.330
how a lens can produce a
spatial Fourier transform,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.792
and what can we do with it.

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:59.900
So, very briefly, to remind
you, from geometrical optics,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.770
this is--

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.450
we did this some time ago,
maybe about a month ago.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.040
So, to remind you,
a lens is a device

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:13.820
that looks like a, well, at
least one curved glass surface,

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:17.150
typically more than one.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.880
And it is a device
that we can use

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.430
to focus or collimate light.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.100
So, for example, if you
illuminate a lens with a plane

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.400
wave, then the lens will
focus that plane wave

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.240
at one focal distance
to the right.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.340
On the other hand, if
you place a point source

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.620
at one focal
distance to the left,

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.810
the lens will collimate
it, will produce

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.180
a plane wave,
which we also refer

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.742
to as an image at infinity.

00:23:42.742 --> 00:23:44.450
And, of course, what
I am discussing here

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:48.305
is for the case of a
positive spherical lens.

00:23:48.305 --> 00:23:49.680
There's other
lenses that we saw,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.270
negative lenses that would do
something slightly different.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.460
But I don't want to do a
full review of lenses here,

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.280
just to remind you what is
relevant to our discussion

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:58.943
here.

00:23:58.943 --> 00:24:00.860
And, of course, the other
thing that lenses do

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.010
is they can produce images
as finite conjugates.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.750
If you place an object
at some distance s sub o,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.120
then the lens will form
an image at a distance

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.340
s sub i, which is related
to s sub o by the lens law.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.170
So we did the stuff to that
when we did geometrical optics,

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:26.070
so I don't want to produce
recurrent nightmares to you

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.800
by repeating it here.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.080
So what I will do now is
I will describe the lens

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.030
in the context of wave optics.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.960
So, of course, in the
context of wave optics,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.060
we have to describe the lens
as some kind of a transparency,

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.380
as some kind of a
phase function that is

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.970
applied to the optical field.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.818
So I don't want to go into
the details of this one.

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:47.860
Is there a question, or--

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.430
someone has a
microphone on, so I can

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.867
hear you shifting on your seat.

00:24:54.867 --> 00:24:56.284
Anyway, it doesn't
matter, though.

00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:01.130
If you have a question,
please interrupt me.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.570
Of course, this applies always.

00:25:08.977 --> 00:25:09.810
So what is this now?

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:15.310
So we will do a very
crude approximation here.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.310
We will actually neglect
the thickness of the lens.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.760
We did this again when we
did geometrical optics.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.730
And that is, of course, because
it is not, strictly speaking,

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.420
correct, but the results
that we get are pretty good,

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.800
and it makes our
mathematics pretty simple.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.800
So the combination of the
two is a good justification

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.850
to make an approximation.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:39.330
If you have one of
the two reasons,

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.160
it is not good to
make an approximation.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.810
For example, if it
makes your math simple

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.820
but the answer is wrong, then
you don't do the approximation.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.477
If you get the correct answer
but the math is not simplified,

00:25:52.477 --> 00:25:54.060
again we don't make
the approximation.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.940
You might as well go with
the accurate calculation.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.590
But, in this case,
we get two bonuses.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.950
And if we have both bonuses,
then we do the approximation.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:10.310
So what is happening here,
if you take a field--

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.730
imagine like Huygens
wavelets impinging

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.650
on the lens from the left.

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.720
The wavelet that
impinges in the center

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.300
will actually see the
thickest part of the lens,

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.450
so it will sustain the
longer phase delay because it

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.040
propagates through glass.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.670
If you take a Huygens wavelet
that actually impinges away

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.670
from the axis, it will see a
thinner portion of the lens.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.640
Therefore, it will
have less phase delay

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.360
because it propagates a
shorter distance in glass.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.390
It will still propagate
some distance in air

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.610
on the left and the
right of the lens.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:53.750
So if you compute that
now, the difference is,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:58.940
of course, it is given by
the spherical calculation.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.540
I don't want to go through this.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.590
You can go back and
do it yourselves.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.970
It's a very simple
geometrical calculation,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.880
with the addition of the
paraxial approximation.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.420
So even if you glance at
this here, you see that--

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.790
actually, this I
copied from Goodman,

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.533
so the equations are
verbatim from Goodman's book.

00:27:16.533 --> 00:27:17.450
It's a scan, actually.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.300
I'm sorry.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.140
It is not a scan.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.060
It is a scan from my own
notes from last year.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.960
But, anyway, it is verbatim
copied from Goodman.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.730
And you can see that I replaced
the square root with a Taylor

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:29.570
expansion.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:31.573
So it is a paraxial
approximation.

00:27:31.573 --> 00:27:32.990
And the result
that you get, which

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.630
is what I really
wanted to do, is

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.250
something that looks like this.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.210
OK.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.130
This is what we get.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:05.910
So we'll get the complex
amplitude transmittance

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.360
of the lens if you
express it in wave optics.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.350
It is actually a
quadratic phase delay.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.850
That's if.

00:28:15.466 --> 00:28:18.600
And in this quadratic
phase delay,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.610
a magical distance happens.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.770
A magical distance
appears, which we recognize

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.080
to be the focal length.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.930
This, if we recall from
geometrical optics,

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.840
we used to call this
the lensmaker's formula.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.540
So, basically, we
recover the expression

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:43.805
for the focal length of the
lens, but now we have a wave--

00:28:46.723 --> 00:28:48.140
I don't want to
say wave function.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.920
That sounds like
quantum mechanics.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.500
But now we have actually--
we have a complex amplitude

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.610
transmittance.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.130
That's what we have
associated with that one.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:04.280
So now let's see why this is the
same result as we had before.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.410
So the trick here is that
we replace the lens--

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:17.710
when we have a
situation like this one,

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.640
we replace the lens
with its amplitude--

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.662
complex amplitude transmittance.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.438
So forget about the curvature.

00:29:35.438 --> 00:29:37.230
Forget about the glass
and everything else.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.480
We just replace it with
a thin transparency.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.520
And then we illuminate
it with something.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.440
Let's start by choosing this
something to be a plane wave.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.500
So here's the wave vector
of this plane wave.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.640
And because it is propagating at
an angle, we write it as g sub

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.140
in.

00:30:04.382 --> 00:30:09.470
Actually, we write
it g sub t sub minus,

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.630
because it is the
field immediately

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:21.760
to the left of the
transparency, of x comma y.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.820
It is a plane wave.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.130
Let's call this angle theta--

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.120
what did they call it?

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:26.620
Theta 0.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.160
So since it is a plane wave,
the proper expression for it

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:43.165
is e to i 2 pi sine theta 0 up
on lambda x plus cosine theta

00:30:43.165 --> 00:30:45.430
0 up on lambda z.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.360
And I'm going to
do two things here.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.540
First of all, I'm going to place
the transparency at z equal 0.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.550
So that knocks out this
factor, because equal 0.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.900
And then I'm going to make
the paraxial approximation,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.940
so that knocks out the sine.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.760
So, basically,
the field incident

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.090
upon the transparency,
upon the lens, that this,

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:16.370
is simply e to the i 2 pi
theta 0 x up on lambda.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.850
So what I would
like to do now is

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:29.870
to compute the field after the
transparency, g sub t plus.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:39.040
So the rule that we described
when we did thin transparencies

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.580
is that we multiply.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.080
I'm sorry.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.360
I'm using a slightly different
notation on the whiteboard

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.410
than in the notes.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.505
You don't have a
minus and a plus,

00:31:47.505 --> 00:31:51.330
but it's basically
the same thing.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:32:06.170
So g sub t plus multiplied
by the transparency itself.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:16.240
So the plus stands for after,
the minus stands for before,

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.055
and the nothing stands for
the transparency itself.

00:32:19.055 --> 00:32:23.755
Oh, and another thing that I
did in the notes is I defined--

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:37.220
I defined this quantity u0
equals theta 0 up on lambda.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.340
And this now we recognize
as a spatial frequency

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.010
because it has units
of inverse meters.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.000
So what do we get now?

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.970
What do we do is a
little bit of algebra,

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:55.470
but it actually results
in an physically

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.320
intuitive, physically
meaningful result.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.080
So that justifies the
algebra, I suppose.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.110
So let me write it out.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.370
Let me write out this
product over here.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.800
OK, that's it.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.400
So now I have to
do something that--

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.155
let me leave it
here so you can see.

00:33:27.155 --> 00:33:29.660
We have to do something that
you may remember from horror,

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.300
from your high school
or elementary school.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.202
I don't know where you
learned these things.

00:33:34.202 --> 00:33:35.660
It's called to
complete the square.

00:33:38.778 --> 00:33:40.570
What is the square that
I want to complete?

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.640
If you look at
the exponents, you

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.910
have an expression
that looks like this.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:49.400
I'll knock out the minus sign.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:58.022
x square over lambda
f minus 2 u0 x.

00:33:58.022 --> 00:33:58.730
Can you see that?

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.880
I've neglected the y's
and everything else,

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.800
and the pi's, and so on.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.530
If I can do that, then I
can take care of the rest.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.020
So how can I complete the sign?

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.449
Well, I tend to get
confused with this,

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.690
so let me knock out the
1 over lambda f also.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:24.800
Now it looks better.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.467
Now I can do it.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.000
Basically, to
complete the sign, I

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.889
have to add and subtract the
square of this business here.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.340
And now I can write it as--

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.790
OK, now I can go
back and substitute

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.140
into my original expression.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.860
I'm done with
manipulating the exponent.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.980
And my original
expression was this one.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:25.235
So I can rewrite out now, g sub
t plus of x comma y equals--

00:35:28.466 --> 00:35:32.400
first of all, I have
this constant term.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.250
That is constant.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:37.520
It means it does not depend
on x, the spatial variable.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.750
So I'll just take it out.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.570
I should not forget my pi's.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:45.950
So there's a pi over here.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:01.810
So-- no, I don't like
the way this came out.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.378
I was expecting to divide,
but I had multiplied.

00:36:09.856 --> 00:36:12.100
OK, that looks better.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.280
So I'm doing OK here,
because what are the units?

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:15.860
No units.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.130
I have a spatial
frequency squared times

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.520
distance squared, so no units.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.358
And what I have
left is something

00:36:23.358 --> 00:36:24.400
that looks like this now.

00:36:39.804 --> 00:36:40.304
OK.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.240
So the first part, I don't
have to worry too much about.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.750
This is just a constant
factor, as I said.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.460
But this one, now I recognize
that's a spherical wave.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:57.050
It is a spherical wave because
it contains quadratic phases

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.700
in the exponent.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.690
It is a converging spherical
wave because of the minus sign

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.190
here.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:12.410
And it's not quite its
origin but its sink.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:15.880
The location where the
spherical wave becomes a point

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:21.420
is actually shifted by
this factor over here.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:27.330
This is displacement.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:27.830
OK.

00:37:31.198 --> 00:37:32.740
So, basically, this
is what I've got.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.550
I've got a spherical
wave which converges.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.610
Oh, and where does it converge?

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.900
Well, the distance that a
spherical wave converges

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.630
is what multiplies the
wavelength in the denominator.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.652
So this is where it converges.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.050
So this is basically
what you see here.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.270
The spherical wave
after the lens

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:59.800
converges to a
distance u0 lambda f.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.890
If you substitute the definition
for u0, it is theta 0 times

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:07.250
f away from the axis.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.250
And the distance between
the lens and the focus

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.730
is one focal distance.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.860
So this is not news.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.590
We knew this from
geometrical optics.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:19.238
We just rederived it using
the thin transparency.

00:38:19.238 --> 00:38:20.780
So this, I guess,
gives us conviction

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.410
that our approach is correct,
because we rederived something

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:28.550
from geometrical optics.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.800
I will not do the next one.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.020
The next one, I'll let
you do by yourselves.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:37.340
You can repeat a similar
procedure of completing squares

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.850
in order to see what
happens to a diverging

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.860
spherical wave placed
at one focal distance

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.240
to the left of the lens.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.220
And you can convince
yourselves easily

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.040
that this becomes a
plane wave propagating

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.270
at an angle equal to the
ratio of the displacement

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.628
over the focal length.

00:38:54.628 --> 00:38:57.170
So this is again something that
we saw in geometrical optics.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.880
It is not new.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.380
OK.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.600
The real result that I
want to derive here--

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.300
and I will try to do it
carefully in the time that we

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.800
have left--

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.230
is the Fourier
transform property which

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.483
I will do for a special case.

00:39:17.483 --> 00:39:19.400
Actually, I will not do
it for a special case.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.190
I'm going to--

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.340
I take it back.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.480
I will do it for the
general case of a lens--

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.010
I'm sorry-- of a
thin transparency

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:32.830
placed at a distance z
to the left of the lens.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.230
Goodman does three cases.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.090
First, he does the
case z equals 0.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.860
Then he does the case z equals
f, and then another case.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.710
It doesn't matter.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:44.085
We'll just do it for the
general case, and we're covered.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.000
So what-- first
of all, let me do

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.790
the derivation in one variable.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.110
So don't write too much.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.310
So we'll basically skip y.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:03.570
All of the derivations
will be just with x.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.240
So I have a thin
transparency g of x.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.550
And then what I will
do is I will propagate

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:24.910
it distance z to the lens.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:37.420
Now, on the lens, my
coordinate is x prime.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.925
And since I'm
propagating a field--

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:45.070
also, I forgot to
say-- that's quite

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.170
important-- the
implicit assumption here

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:51.340
is that the illumination is
an on-axis plane wave coming

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.540
from the left.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.730
So that, if you recall,
we said a couple

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.500
of times, that is simply--

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.480
its complex amplitude is 1,
because I can choose that--

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.680
a constant phase.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.690
And there's no x
variations with this one.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.209
So the Fresnel propagation
kernel, if I go from z--

00:41:16.041 --> 00:41:21.640
So g is-- let me maintain
my notation consistent here.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:31.220
So to the left of the
lens, L minus of x prime--

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.340
so that is the field to
the left of the lens--

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.730
is going to be given by a
Fresnel diffraction integral.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:45.195
And, actually, in my derivation,
I skipped the constant.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.390
And what is the
constant that I skipped?

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.300
It is this one.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.160
And this constant
should be there,

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.382
but it is not doing
anything significant for us

00:42:15.382 --> 00:42:17.090
in this case, so that's
why I skipped it.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.160
To save writing, basically.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.490
So from now on, we will
basically neglect this.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.410
Even though it is there,
we will simply neglect.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:36.470
Now, the field after the
lens equals the field

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:40.570
before the lens times
the lens itself.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.480
And the lens itself is
something of the form

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:47.200
e to the minus i pi x
squared up on lambda f.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:43:01.410
And, finally, I have this field,
and I have to propagate it.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.100
How long?

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.160
Now I have to do
this part, which

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.730
means I have to propagate
by distance f until I

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.250
reach the back focal plane.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:27.010
And that is another
Fresnel integral.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:30.930
I will call it g sub f, I guess.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.120
Again, there is a factor
here which I will neglect.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.010
OK.

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.645
So now let's put
everything together.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:12.590
I have two Fresnel
convolution integrals--

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.140
one with respect to
the input coordinates,

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:20.310
one with respect to
the lens coordinates.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:24.300
And what is left inside, I will
simply substitute all the rest.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.425
I have the input itself.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.990
Then I have the
propagation kernel

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.120
from the input to the lens.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:39.420
Then I have the lens.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.140
And then I have the
propagation kernel

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.100
from the lens to the
back focal plane.

00:44:56.884 --> 00:44:59.330
OK.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:00.990
That's what it is.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.660
This looks a little
scary, but part

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.420
of the purpose of this
class is to teach you

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:09.100
how to not be scared by
this kind of integrals.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.940
So the way you know
this, you don't

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.910
get scared by this
sort of integral

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.810
is you manipulate
the exponents here.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.340
And you try to--
the first thing you

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.130
do when you reach an
integral of this kind

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.220
is you try to collect terms.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.660
So I'll write the
exponents here.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:29.520
I will expand the exponents
and collect terms then.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.140
So if I expand the exponents,
I will get x prime squared

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:41.650
plus x squared minus 2x
x prime over lambda z.

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:44.320
This came from this
term over here.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:51.300
Then I have minus x
square over lambda f.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.335
And then I have plus--

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.650
and I think I
missed a prime here.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:04.900
That should have been x prime.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:09.070
Yes, correct.

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:11.180
The lens should also
be with an x prime.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:11.680
Thank you.

00:46:24.938 --> 00:46:26.730
It is very fortunate
that you corrected me,

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.630
because if you hadn't I
would be kind of stuck here.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:30.130
OK.

00:46:32.902 --> 00:46:34.750
So the thing that
you notice first

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:39.090
is that some of these
exponents get knocked out.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:46.100
This one kills this one.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.560
That's very pleasant.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.550
Now what do I have to do?

00:47:07.175 --> 00:47:09.750
I still need to make an
integration with respect

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:10.490
to x prime.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:19.050
So x prime appears
here and here.

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:21.810
And I have to make an
integration with respect to x.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.570
Well, here is x.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:28.880
Here is x.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:32.560
OK.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.945
So what-- any ideas?

00:47:37.945 --> 00:47:40.070
Anybody want to speculate
on what I should do here?

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.157
Let me write the integral.

00:47:50.157 --> 00:47:51.990
That's a little bit
confusing the way it is.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:55.260
Let me rewrite it so you can see
what the integral looks like.

00:49:05.834 --> 00:49:07.050
Let me do it carefully.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:12.282
So I have e to the minus i
2 pi x prime up on lambda.

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:13.740
That's common in
the two exponents.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:20.400
Inside, I have x up on z
plus x double prime up on f.

00:49:31.228 --> 00:49:32.270
So what should I do next?

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:08.500
Is there any glaring sort of
integral that popped up here?

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.190
What is-- here, we
have an integral

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:45.790
of another exponential, right?

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:58.490
And they-- let me
rewrite it like this.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.460
OK.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.470
So the glaring integral
that I was referring

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.930
to before is this one.

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:52.440
That's a Fourier transform.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.316
Whose Fourier transform?

00:51:54.316 --> 00:51:56.580
The Fourier
transform of whomever

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.290
appears in this
location over here.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:09.940
And where is the Fourier
transform computed?

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:15.580
Well, it is computed in this
spatial frequency, right?

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:19.630
It is computed in whatever
spatial frequency multiplies

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:23.880
the dummy variable
in the exponent.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.380
Now, what is this
Fourier transform?

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.170
We don't know, but we have
our notes, or we have Goodman,

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:30.270
or we have the
tables of formulas.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:35.910
So switching to Lecture 9B.

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.690
This is our Fourier
transform pairs.

00:52:56.690 --> 00:53:01.130
I recognize this
integral, recognize

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:02.620
this Fourier transform.

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.380
It is the second
row from the bottom.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:13.910
If you look at this expression
and the expression over here,

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:16.270
it is actually the
same Fourier transform.

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:18.370
It is the Fourier
trans-- what you

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:20.380
see here is the
Fourier transform

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:24.220
of the quadratic phase
in the exponential.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:26.770
So we have the answer.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.740
The answer is right here.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:29.980
Again, I will neglect--

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.810
actually, this constant
is quite important,

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:33.800
but I will be neglect
it nevertheless.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:42.850
So, basically, the way to get
a one-to-one correspondence is

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:45.990
to simply substitute
what would--

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.840
what in the table is denoted
as a square is actually

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:55.630
identical to 1 over
lambda z in our case.

00:53:55.630 --> 00:54:00.050
So I can write out
now the answer.

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:10.850
This thing equals-- first of
all, before I do any further,

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:13.930
we recognize that this does
not play in the integration.

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:15.710
This has the output
plane coordinate,

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:17.120
so I will simply
take it outside.

00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:36.620
And then I will write out the--

00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:39.260
in one shot, I will
write out the outcome

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.390
of this Fourier transform.

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:50.060
So that a square that I have
in the original function,

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.840
it will go inverse
in the other one.

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:56.560
So we'll get, then,
e to the what?

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.210
I will get an extra minus sign.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:03.140
If I have plus j here,
I have minus j here.

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.946
So this will then
become e to the minus--

00:55:05.946 --> 00:55:11.470
we'll have all the pi's and
so on-- minus i pi lambda z.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:15.520
And then I will get the square
of the spatial frequency.

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:21.400
So it will be 1 over lambda
square x up on z plus x double

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:25.370
prime up on f squared.

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:27.496
OK, that's it.

00:55:27.496 --> 00:55:30.770
So now I can manipulate
it a little bit further.

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:49.240
And now let me write
out all these exponents

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.910
that come out of this square.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:53.590
So I will get--

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:57.640
the first one will be x
square up on z square.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.320
So one z will be killed.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.540
One lambda has
already been killed.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.530
So I will get e to
the minus i pi x

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:08.610
square over lambda z, right?

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:12.390
Then I will get this term.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:16.960
That will be e to
the minus i pi--

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:23.100
this is tricky-- z x double
prime square over lambda

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.110
f square.

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:27.130
This came out of the
square of this one.

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.040
And I will also
get the cross term.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.562
So that will be
e to the minus i.

00:56:33.562 --> 00:56:35.170
And then we'll do it carefully.

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:37.790
I will get 2 pi.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:40.070
And what is left here--

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:41.670
one z will cancel.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:49.130
I will get x x double
prime up on lambda f.

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:52.560
And now, happily, we see that
this additional quadratic that

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:56.070
was very annoying over
here, this one, it got

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:58.950
killed by this one.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:02.460
This one is not playing
in the integration either,

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.490
so I can actually
take it out of here.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.770
And this is the result
that I was after.

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:43.620
You see that I actually got
another Fourier transform.

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:46.590
This is well recognizable as
a Fourier transform kernel.

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:54.090
So what I have in
this part over here,

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:56.250
it is actually the
Fourier transform

00:57:56.250 --> 00:58:02.615
of the transparency calculated
at these coordinates, that is

00:58:02.615 --> 00:58:05.250
the argument of the integral.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.930
Now, something
funny happened here,

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:14.820
and this doesn't look
quite right to me.

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.570
That should be f, right?

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.110
OK.

00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:20.420
I don't know how this became z.

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.050
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:25.883
OK, I know now, yes.

00:58:25.883 --> 00:58:29.250
That should be f, yes.

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:31.200
Somewhere in my
notes I converted

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.560
this to f, but, thankfully,
not the physics.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.802
So this should not be z.

00:58:35.802 --> 00:58:36.510
This should be f.

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:46.510
OK, so now it looks right.

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:48.060
OK.

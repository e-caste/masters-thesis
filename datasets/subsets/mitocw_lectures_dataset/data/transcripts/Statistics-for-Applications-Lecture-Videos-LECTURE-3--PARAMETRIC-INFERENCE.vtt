PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Doesn't
to run Flash Player.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.560
So I had to run them on Chrome.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.450
All right, so let's move
on to our second chapter.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.270
And hopefully, in
this chapter, you

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.820
will feel a little
better if you felt

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.412
like it was going a bit
fast in the first chapter.

00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:38.620
And the main reason we
actually went fast, especially

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.534
in terms of
confidence intervals.

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:41.950
Some of you came
and asked me what

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.880
you mean by this is a
confidence interval?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.588
What does it mean that
it's not happening

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:47.662
in there with probability
95%, et cetera?

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:49.120
I just went really
fast so that you

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.440
could see why I didn't want
to give you a first week doing

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.170
probability only
without understanding

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.780
what the statistical
context for it was.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.041
So hopefully, all
these things that we've

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.790
done in terms of
probability, you actually

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.701
know why we've been doing them.

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.200
And so we're basically going
to go back to what we're doing,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.110
maybe start with some
statistical setup.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.000
But the goal of this
lecture is really

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.500
going to go back again to
what we've seen from a purely

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.940
statistical perspective.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.870
All right?

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.660
So the first thing
we're going to do

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.080
is explain why we're doing
statistical modeling, right?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.810
So in practice,
if you have data,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.620
if you observe a
bunch of points--

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.820
in here, I gave you some
numbers, for example.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.960
So here's the partial data sets
with the number of siblings,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.180
including self, that were
collected from college

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.470
students a few years back.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.570
So I was teaching
a class like yours

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.950
and actually asked
students to go

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.560
and fill out some Google form
and tell me a bunch of things.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.870
And one of the questions
was, including yourself,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.520
how many siblings do you have?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.790
And so they gave me this
list of numbers, right?

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.411
And there's many ways I can
think of this list of numbers,

00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:57.910
right?

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.780
I could think of it as being
just a discrete distribution

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.200
on the set of
numbers between 1--

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.070
I know there's not going to be
an answer which is less than 1,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.949
unless, well, someone doesn't
understand the question.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.620
But all the answers I should
get are positive integers--

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.450
1, 2, 3, et cetera.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.970
And there probably
is an upper bound,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.780
but I don't know it
on the top of my head.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.900
So maybe I should say 100.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.550
Maybe I should say 15.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.660
It depends, right?

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.611
And so I think the largest
number I got for this was 6.

00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:29.110
All right?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.610
So here you can see you have
pretty standard families,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.930
you know, lots of
1s, 2s, and 3s.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.640
What statistical
modeling is doing

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.160
is to try to compress
this information that I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.920
could actually describe
in a very naive way.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.380
So let's start with the
basic usual statistical set

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.960
up, right?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.540
So I will start with many
of the boards that look

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.570
like x1, xn, random variables.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.120
And what I'm going to
assume, as we said typically

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.600
is that those guys are IID.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.730
And they have some
distribution, all right?

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.422
So they all share the
same distribution.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:10.630
And the fact that their IID
is so that I can actually

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.350
do statistics.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.840
Statistics means looking at
the global averaging thing

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.890
so that I can actually
get a sense of what

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.316
the global behavior is
for the population, right?

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:22.690
If I start assuming that those
things are not identically

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.810
distributed-- they all
live on their own--

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.380
that my sequence of number
is your number of siblings--

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.190
the shoe size of this person--

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.756
the depth of the
Charles River, and I

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:33.130
start measuring
a bunch of stuff.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.990
There's nothing I can
actually get together.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.330
I need to have something
that's cohesive.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.350
And so here, I collected
some data that was cohesive.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.310
And so the goal here--

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.830
the first thing is to say what
is the distribution that I

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.586
actually have here, right?

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.830
So I could actually
be very general.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.640
I could just say at
some distribution p.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.440
And let's so those are random
variables, not random vectors,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.940
right?

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.060
I could collect entire
vectors about students,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.400
but let's say those are
just random variables.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.530
And so now I can start
making assumptions

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.630
on this distribution p, right?

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.550
What can I say about
a distribution?

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.640
Well, maybe if those
numbers are continues,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.034
for example, I could assume
they have a density--

00:04:17.034 --> 00:04:19.810
a probability density function.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.220
That's already an assumption.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.469
Maybe I could start to assume
that they're probability

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:25.620
density function is smooth.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.822
That's another assumption.

00:04:26.822 --> 00:04:29.280
Maybe I could actually assume
that it's piecewise constant.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.960
That's even better, right?

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.270
And those things make my
life simpler and simpler,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.260
because what I do by making
the successive assumptions is

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.190
reducing the degrees of
freedom of the space in which I

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.970
am actually searching
the distribution.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.230
And so what we actually
want is to have something

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.510
which is small enough
so we can actually

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.710
have some averaging going on.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.940
But we also want something
which is big enough

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.550
that it can actually express.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.590
It has chances of actually
containing a distribution that

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.837
makes sense for us.

00:04:59.837 --> 00:05:01.920
So let's start with the
simplest possible example,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.420
which is when the
xi's belong to 0, 1.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.310
And as I said, here,
we don't have a choice.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.880
The distribution of those
guys has to be Bernoulli.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.330
And since they are IID,
they all share the same p.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.520
So that's definitely the
simplest possible thing

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.600
I could think of.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.240
They are just Bernoulli p.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.030
And so all I would have to
figure out in this case is p.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.030
And this is the simplest case.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.570
And unsurprisingly, it has
the simplest answer, right?

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.340
We will come back
to this example

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.400
when we study maximum
likelihood estimators or method

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.230
of moments estimators
by method of moments.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.180
But at the end of
the day, the things

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.980
that we did-- the
things that we will do

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.630
are always the
naive estimator you

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.490
would come up with is what
is the proportion of 1.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.560
And this will be, in
pretty much all respects,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.071
the best estimator
you can think of.

00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:01.570
All right?

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.819
So then we're going to try
to assess this performance.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.830
And we saw how to do that in
the first chapter as well.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.420
So this problem here somehow
is completely understood.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.630
We'll come back to it.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.400
But there's nothing fancy
that is going to happen.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.260
But now, I could have some
more complicated things.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.500
For example, in the example
of the students now,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.050
my xi's belong to the
sequence of integers 1, 2, 3,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.301
et cetera, OK, which is also
denoted by n, maybe without 0

00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:32.800
if you want to put
0 in that, right?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.250
So the positive integers.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.860
Or I could actually
just maybe put

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.350
some prior knowledge
about how humans

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.880
have time to have families.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.470
But maybe some people thought
of their college mates

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.090
as being their
brothers and sisters.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.740
And one student would
actually put 465 siblings,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.530
because we're all good friends.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.279
Or maybe they actually think
that all their Facebook

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.820
contacts are actually
their siblings.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.160
And so you never know
what's going to happen.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.874
So maybe you want
to account for this,

00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:06.790
but maybe you know that
people are reasonable,

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.956
and they will actually give
you something like this.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.745
Now intuitively, maybe
you would say, well,

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:15.620
why would you bother
doing this if you're not

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.420
really sure about the 20?

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.920
But I think that
probably all of you

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.830
intuitively guess that this
is probably a good idea

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.130
to start putting this
kind of assumption

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.750
rather than allowing for any
number in the first place,

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.830
because this eventually
will be injected

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.145
into the precision
of our estimators.

00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:36.020
If I allow anything, it's going
to be more complicated for me

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.600
to get an accurate estimator.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.370
If I know that the numbers
are either 1 or 2, then

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.930
I'm actually going to be
slightly more accurate as well.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.430
All right?

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.560
Because I know that, for
example, somebody put the 5,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.226
I can remove it.

00:07:46.226 --> 00:07:48.980
Then it's not going to actually
corrupt with my estimator.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:55.320
All right, so now,
let's say we actually

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.080
agree that we have numbers.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.290
And here I put
seven numbers, OK?

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.995
So I just said,
well, let's assume

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:05.370
that the numbers
I'm going to get

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.050
are going to be 1 all the way
to say this number that I denote

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.360
by larger than or
equal to 7, which

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.570
is a placeholder for any
numbers larger than 7, OK?

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.250
Because I know
maybe I don't want

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.750
to distinguish between people
that have 9 or 25 siblings.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.270
OK, and so now, this
is a distribution

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.110
on seven possible values--
the discrete distributions.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.518
And you know from
your probability class

00:08:30.518 --> 00:08:32.309
that the way you describe
this distribution

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.549
is using the probability
mass function.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.560
OK, or PMF--

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.810
So that's how we describe
a discrete distribution.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.370
And the PMF is just a
list of numbers, right?

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.590
So as I wrote here, you
have a list of numbers.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.750
And here, you wrote
the possible value

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.000
that your random
variable can take.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.500
And here you rate
the probability

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.020
that your random variable
takes this value.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.970
So the possible values being 1,
2, 3 all the way to larger than

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.620
or equal to 7.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.050
And then I'm trying to
estimate those numbers.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.620
Right?

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.480
If I give you those
numbers, at least up to this

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.130
you know compression of all
numbers that are equal to 7,

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.800
you have the full description
of your distribution.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.190
And that is the ultimate
goal of statistics, right?

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.810
The ultimate goal
of statistics is

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.314
to say what distribution
your data came from,

00:09:33.314 --> 00:09:34.980
because that's basically
the best you're

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.970
going to be able to do.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.980
Now admittedly, if I started
looking at the fraction of 1s,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.610
and the fraction of 2s, and
the fraction of 3s, et cetera,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.180
I would actually eventually
get those numbers--

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.950
just like looking at
the fraction of 1s

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.000
gave me a good estimate for
p in the Bernoulli case,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.060
it would do the same
in this case, right?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.750
It's a pretty intuitive idea.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.076
It's just the law
of large numbers.

00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:00.200
Everybody agrees with that?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.560
If I look at the proportion
of 1s, the proportion of 2s,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.310
the proportion of 3s,
that should actually

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.810
give me something that gets
closer and closer, as my sample

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.360
size increases to what I want.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.610
But the problem is if my
sample size is not huge,

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.450
here I have seven
numbers to estimate.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.700
And if I have 20
observations, the ratio

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.280
is not really in my favor--

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.089
20 observations to estimate
seven parameters-- some of them

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:27.630
are going to be
pretty off, typically

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.420
the ones with the large values.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.380
If you have only 20 students,
look at the list of numbers.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.588
I don't know how many numbers
I have, but it probably

00:10:34.588 --> 00:10:35.460
is close to 20--

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.140
maybe 15 or something.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.420
And so if you look at
this list, nobody's

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:45.570
actually-- nobody has four
or more siblings, right?

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.900
There's no such person.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.200
So that means that eventually
from this data set,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.680
my estimates--

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:56.040
so those numbers I denote by
say p1, p2, p3, et cetera--

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.390
those estimates p4 hat would be
equal to what from this data?

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.350
0, right?

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:12.340
And p5 hat equal to 0 and
p6 hat would be equal to 0.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.090
And p larger than or equal
to 7 hat would be equal to 0.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.690
That would be my estimate
from this data set.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.580
So maybe this is not--

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.300
maybe I want to actually
pull some information

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.460
from the people who
have less siblings

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.210
to try to make a guess,
which is probably

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.940
slightly better for the
larger values, right?

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.740
It's pretty clear that in
average, there is more than 0--

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.850
the proportion of the
population of households

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.460
that have four children or
more is definitely more than 0,

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:46.960
all right?

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.475
So it means that
my data set is not

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:51.100
representative of
what I'm going to try

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.649
to do is to find a model that
tries to use the data they have

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:56.190
for the smaller values that I
can observe and just push it up

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.530
to the other ones.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.970
And so what we can do is to
just reduce those parameters

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.740
into something
that's understood.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.950
And this is part of the
modeling that I talked about

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.100
in the first place.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.447
Now, how do you succinctly
describe a number of something?

00:12:12.447 --> 00:12:14.780
Well, one thing that you do
is the Poisson distribution,

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:15.550
right?

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.230
Why do Poisson?

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.670
There's many reasons.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.660
Again, that's part
of statical modeling.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.710
But once you know that you
have number of something that

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.302
can be modeled by a Poisson,
why not try a Poisson, right?

00:12:26.302 --> 00:12:27.510
You could just fit a Poisson.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.340
And the Poisson is something
that looks like this.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.090
And I guess you've all seen it.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.040
But if x follows a
Poisson distribution

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.170
with parameter lambda,
than the probability

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.200
that x is equal to little
x is equal to lambda

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:47.420
to the x over factorial
x e to the minus lambda.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:47.920
OK?

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.410
And if you did the sheet that
I gave you on the first day,

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.970
you can check those numbers.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:00.200
So this is, of course, for x
equals 0, 1, et cetera, right?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.470
So x is in natural integers.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.480
And if you sum from x equals 0
to infinity, this thing you get

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.660
is e to the lambda.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.390
And so they cancel,
and you have some

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.730
which is equal to 1,
which is indeed a PMF.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.610
But what's key about this PMF
is that it never takes value 0.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.600
Like this thing is
always strictly positive.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.076
So whatever value of lambda
I find from this data

00:13:24.076 --> 00:13:25.700
will give me something
that's certainly

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.240
more interesting than
just putting the value 0.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.490
But more importantly,
rather than having

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.390
to estimate seven parameters
and, as a consequence,

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.790
to actually have
to estimate 1, 2,

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.150
3, 4 of them being equal to
0, I have only one parameter

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.680
to estimate which is lambda.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.070
The problem with doing this
is that now lambda may not

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.660
be just something as simple as
computing the average number.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.560
Right?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.690
In this case, it will.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.940
But in many instances,
it's actually not clear

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.275
that this parametrization
with lambda that I chose--

00:14:01.275 --> 00:14:03.650
I'm going to be able to estimate
lambda just by computing

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.220
the average number that I get.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.530
It will be the case.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.640
But if it's not, remember this
example of the exponential

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.244
we did in the last lecture--

00:14:12.244 --> 00:14:13.910
we could use the delta
method and things

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.400
like that to estimate them.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.900
All right, so
here's modeling 101.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.950
So the purpose of
modeling is to restrict

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.630
the base of possible
distributions

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.960
to a subspace that's actually
plausible, but much simpler

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.590
for me to estimate.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.230
So we went from
all distributions

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.110
on seven parameters,
which is a large space--

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.590
that's a lot of things--

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.030
to something which
is just one number.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.370
This number is positive.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.750
Any question about the
purpose of doing this?

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.880
OK, so we're going to have to do
a little bit of formalism now.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.070
And so if we want to talk--

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.420
this is a statistics classroom.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.700
I'm not going to want to
talk about the Poisson model

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.260
specifically every single time.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.300
I'm going to want to talk
about generic models.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.370
And then you're going to build
to plug in your favorite word--

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.066
Poisson, binomial,
exponential, uniform--

00:15:11.066 --> 00:15:12.440
all these words
that you've seen,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.920
you're going to be
able to plug in there.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.045
But we're just going to
have some generic notations

00:15:16.045 --> 00:15:19.170
and some generic terminology
for a statistical model.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:19.670
All right?

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.430
So here is the
formal definition.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.160
So I'm going to go
through it with you.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:35.580
OK, so the definition is
that of a statistical model.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:47.830
OK?

00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:53.280
Sorry, that's a statistical
experiment, I should say.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.861
So a statistical experiment
is actually just a pair--

00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:08.930
E. And that's a set--

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:19.640
and a family of distributions
P theta, where theta ranges

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.050
in some set capital theta.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:22.550
OK?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:26.040
So I hope you're up to date
with your Greek letters.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.870
So the small theta
is the capital theta.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.980
And enough of us--

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.690
I don't have the handwriting.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.010
So if you don't see
something, just ask me.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.650
And so this thing now--
so each of this guy

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.700
is a probability distribution.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.390
All right?

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:47.460
So for example, this could be
a Poisson with parameter theta

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.560
or a Bernoulli with
parameter theta--

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.091
OK, or an exponential
with parameter--

00:16:54.091 --> 00:16:56.090
I don't know-- 1 over
theta squared if you want.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.850
OK, but they're just
indexed by theta.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.820
But for each theta,
this completely

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.190
describes the distribution.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.510
It could be more complicated.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.980
This theta should be a pair--
could be a pair-- a mu sigma

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.619
square.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:16.790
And that could actually give
you some n mu sigma squared.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:20.720
OK so anything where
you can actually--

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.319
rather than actually giving
you a full distribution,

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.193
I can compress into a parameter.

00:17:26.193 --> 00:17:27.109
But it could be worse.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.460
It could be this guy here.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:28.960
Right?

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.110
Theta could be p1--

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.850
p larger than or equal to 7.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.610
And my distribution could just
be something that has PMF--

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.779
p1-- p larger than 7.

00:17:44.779 --> 00:17:45.820
That's another parameter.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.524
This one is seven dimensional.

00:17:48.524 --> 00:17:49.690
This one is two dimensional.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.590
And all these guys are
just one dimensional.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.460
All these guys are parameters.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.939
Is that clear?

00:17:56.939 --> 00:17:59.230
What's important here is that
once they give you theta,

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.860
you know exactly all the
probabilities associated

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.840
with this random variable.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.401
You know its
distribution perfectly.

00:18:09.307 --> 00:18:10.390
So this is the definition.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.150
Is that clear?

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.682
Is there a question
about this distribution--

00:18:13.682 --> 00:18:14.890
about this definition, sorry?

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.360
All right.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.440
So really, the key thing is the
statistical model associated

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.090
to a statistical experiments.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.590
OK?

00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:29.140
So let's just see some examples.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.630
It's probably just better
because, again, the formalism

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.900
is never really clear.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.860
Actually, that's the next slide.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.900
OK, so there's two
things we need to assume.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.680
OK, so the purpose of
a statistical model

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.795
is once I estimate
the parameter,

00:18:46.795 --> 00:18:51.310
I actually know exactly what
distribution it has, OK?

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.760
So it means that I
could potentially

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.410
have several
parameters that give me

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.034
the same distribution that would
still be fine, because I could

00:18:59.034 --> 00:18:59.800
estimate one guy.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.150
Or I could estimate
the other guy.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.220
And I would still recover
the underlying distribution

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:03.730
of my data.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.420
The problem is that this
creates really annoying

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.797
theoretical
problems, like things

00:19:09.797 --> 00:19:11.380
don't work, the
algorithms won't work,

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.629
the guarantees won't work.

00:19:12.629 --> 00:19:14.670
And so what we typically
assume is that the model

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.300
is so-called well-specified.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.665
Sorry, that's not
well specified.

00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:23.740
I'm jumping ahead of myself.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.690
OK, well-specified
means that your data--

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.720
the distribution of your data
is actually one of those guys.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.220
OK?

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:46.070
So some vocabulary--
so well-specified

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:51.310
means that for my
observations x,

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:55.250
there exists a theta
in capital theta

00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:00.764
such that x follows p sub theta.

00:20:00.764 --> 00:20:03.610
I should put a double bar.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.850
OK, so that's what
well-specified means.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.770
So that means that
the distribution

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.920
of your actual data is
just one of those guys.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.790
This is a bit strong
of an assumption.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.920
It's strong in the sense that--

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:26.740
I don't know if you've heard of
this sense, which I don't know,

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.370
I can tell you who
it's attributed to,

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.370
but that probably means
that this person did not

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.930
come up with it.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.920
But I said that all models
are wrong, but some of them

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.890
are useful.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.690
All right, so all
models are wrong

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.470
means that maybe it's not true
that this Poisson distribution

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.965
that I assume for the number of
siblings for college students--

00:20:47.965 --> 00:20:50.350
maybe that's not
perfectly correct.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.210
Maybe there's a spike
at three, right?

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.900
Maybe there's a spike at
one, because you know,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.180
maybe those are slightly
more educated families.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.260
They have less children.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.260
Maybe this is actually
not exactly perfect.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.496
But it's probably good
enough for our purposes.

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:05.870
And when we make
this assumption,

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.750
we're actually assuming
that the data really

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.756
comes from a Poisson model.

00:21:09.756 --> 00:21:11.380
There is a lot of
research that goes on

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.380
about misspecified
models and that tells you

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.686
how well you're doing
in the model that's

00:21:16.686 --> 00:21:18.310
the closest to the
actual distribution.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.630
So that's pretty much it.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.049
Yeah?

00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:22.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.970
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: So my data--

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.620
so it's always the
way I denote one

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.480
of the generic
observations, right?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.100
So my observations are x1, xn.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.670
And they're IID with
distribution p--

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:40.990
always.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.610
So x is just one of those guys.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.720
I don't want to write x5 or x4.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.490
They're IID.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.840
So they all have the
same distribution.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.780
So OK-- no, no, no.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.490
They're all IID.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.490
So they all have
the same p data.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.150
They'll have the
same p, which means

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.840
they'll have the same p data.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.250
So I can pick any one of them.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.470
So I'd just remove the
index just so we're clear.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.940
OK?

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.580
So when I write x, I
just mean think of x1.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.540
Right they're an idea.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.607
I can pick whichever I want.

00:22:12.607 --> 00:22:13.690
I'm not going to write x1.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.648
It's going to be weird.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.470
OK?

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.670
Is that clear?

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.780
OK.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:26.522
So this particular theta is
called the true parameter.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.060
Sometimes since we're going
to want some variable theta,

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.610
we might denote it by
theta star as opposed

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.750
to theta hat, which is
always our estimator.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.250
But I'll keep it to
be theta for now.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.280
And so the aim of this
physical experiment

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.500
is to estimate theta
so that once I actually

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.010
plug in theta in the form of
my distribution, for example,

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.020
I could plug in theta here.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.600
So theta here was
actually lambda.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.600
So once I estimate this
guy, I would plug it in,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.183
and I would know the probability
that my random variable takes

00:23:06.183 --> 00:23:09.240
any value, by just putting the
lambda hat and the lambda hat

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.700
here.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.240
OK?

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.960
So my goal is going
to be to estimate

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.080
this guy so that I can actually
compute those distributions.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.520
But actually, we'll
see, for example,

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.540
when we talk about regression
that this parameter actually

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.340
has a meaning in many instances.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.670
And so just knowing
the parameter itself

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.360
intuitively or say more--

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.680
let's say more so than just
computing probabilities,

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.480
will actually tell us
something about the process.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.880
For example, we're going
to run linear regression.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.260
And when we do
linear regression,

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.490
there's going to be
some coefficients

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.810
in the linear regression.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.250
And the value of
this coefficient

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.460
is actually telling me what is
the sensitivity of the response

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.620
that I'm looking at to
this particular input.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.120
All right?

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.950
So just knowing if
this number is larger

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.050
or if this number
is small is actually

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.180
going to be useful for us
to just look at this guy.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:58.680
All right?

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.485
So there's going to be
some instances where

00:24:00.485 --> 00:24:01.610
it's going to be important.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.026
Sometimes we're going to want
to know if this parameter is

00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:07.260
larger or smaller than something
or if it's equal to something

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.647
or not equal to something.

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:10.730
And those things are also
important-- for example,

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.091
if theta actually
measures the true--

00:24:13.091 --> 00:24:13.590
right?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.380
So theta is the true unknown
parameter-- true efficacy

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.010
of a drug.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:18.510
OK?

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.720
Let's say I want to know what
the true efficacy of a drug is.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.084
And what I'm going to want to
know is maybe it's a score.

00:24:25.084 --> 00:24:27.500
Maybe I'm going to want to
know if theta is larger than 2.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.166
Maybe I want to know if theta is
the average number of siblings.

00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:32.080
Is this true number
larger than 2 or not?

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:32.580
Right?

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.410
Maybe I am interested in knowing
if college students come from--

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.217
so maybe from a
sociological perspective,

00:24:40.217 --> 00:24:42.300
I'm interested in knowing
if college students come

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.375
from households with
more than two children.

00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:47.070
All right, so those
can be the questions

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.814
that I may ask myself.

00:24:48.814 --> 00:24:50.730
I'm going to want to
know maybe theta is going

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:51.940
to be equal to 1/2 or not.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.810
So maybe for a drug
efficacy, is it completely

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.640
standard-- maybe for elections.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.220
Is the proportion
of the population

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.380
that is going to vote for
this particular candidate

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.420
equal to 0.5?

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.584
Or is it different from 0.5?

00:25:05.584 --> 00:25:07.250
OK, and I can think
of different things.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.025
When I'm talking
about the regression,

00:25:09.025 --> 00:25:11.400
I'm going to want to test if
this coefficient is actually

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.650
0 or not, because
if it's 0, it means

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.200
that the variable that's in
front of it actually goes out.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.900
And so those are
things we're testing.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.050
Actually having this very
specific yes/no answer

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:26.760
is going to give me a huge
intuition or huge understanding

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.850
of what's going on in the
phenomenon that I observe.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.850
But actually, since the
questions are so precise,

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.204
it's going to be much more--

00:25:34.204 --> 00:25:36.370
I'm going to be much better
at answering them rather

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.520
than giving you an
estimate for theta

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.240
with some confidence around it.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.870
All right, it's sort of the same
principle as trying to reduce.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.620
What you're trying to
do as a statistician

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.830
is to inject as much knowledge
about the question and about

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.740
the problem that you
can so that the data has

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.450
to do a minimal job.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:58.300
And henceforth, you
actually need less data.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.720
So from now on, we
will always assume--

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.030
and this is because this
is an intro stats class--

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.550
you will always
assume that theta--

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:09.180
the subset of parameters
is a subset of r to the d.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.940
That means that
theta is a vector

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.320
with at most a finite
number of coordinates.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.970
Why do I say this?

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.280
Well, this is called
a parametric model.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:31.750
So it's called a parametric
model or sometimes

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.022
parametric statistics.

00:26:35.022 --> 00:26:37.480
Actually, we don't really talk
about parametric statistics.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.330
But we talk a lot about
nonparametric statistics

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.340
or a non-parametric model.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.852
Can somebody think of a model
which is non-parametric?

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.190
For example, in the
siblings example,

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.160
if I did not cap the
number of siblings to 7,

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.350
but I let this list
go to infinity,

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:09.530
I would have an infinite number
of parameters to estimate.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.207
Very likely, the
last ones would be 0.

00:27:12.207 --> 00:27:14.540
But still, I would have an
infinite number of parameters

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.295
to estimate.

00:27:15.295 --> 00:27:17.400
So this would not be
a parametric model

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.430
if I just let this
list of things

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.740
to be estimated to be infinite.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.580
But there's other classes
that are actually infinite

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.990
and cannot represented
by vectors.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.700
For example, function-- right?

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:38.870
If I tell you my
model, pf, is just

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:43.880
the distribution of x's, the
probability distributions,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.187
that have density f, right?

00:27:48.187 --> 00:27:50.270
So what I know is that the
density is non-negative

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.100
and that it integrates
to one, right?

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.900
That's all I know
about densities.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.620
Well f is not
something you're going

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:01.250
to be able to describe with a
finite number of values, right?

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.610
All possible functions
is the huge set.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:08.730
It's certainly not
representable by 10 numbers.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:12.470
And so non-parametric
estimation is typically

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.600
when you actually want
to parametrize this

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.600
by a large class of functions.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.810
And so for example,
histograms is the prime tool

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.970
of non-parametric
estimation, because when

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.470
you fit a histogram
to data, you're

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.929
trying to estimate the
density of your data,

00:28:26.929 --> 00:28:28.470
but you're not trying
to represent it

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.920
as a finite number of points.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.040
That's really-- I
mean, effectively,

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.390
you have to represent it, right?

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.480
So you actually truncate
somewhere and just

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.670
say those things are
not going to matter.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:41.360
All right?

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.690
But really the key thing is
that this is non-parametric

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.360
where you have a potentially
infinite number of parameters.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.490
Whereas we're going to
only talk about finites.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:53.790
And actually finite in the
overwhelming majority of cases

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.320
is going to be 1.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.404
So theta is going to
be a subset of r1.

00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:00.320
OK, we're going to be
interested in estimating

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.770
one parameter just like
the parameter of a Poisson

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.760
or the parameter
of an exponential--

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.460
the parameter of Bernoulli.

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.539
But for example,
really, we're going

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:11.330
to be interested in
estimating mu and sigma

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.730
square for the normal.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.850
So here are some
statistical models.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:20.350
All right?

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.040
So I'm going to go
through them with you.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.050
So if I tell you I observe--

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.940
I'm interested in
understanding--

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.040
I'm still [INAUDIBLE] I'm
interested in understanding

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.680
the proportion of people
who kiss by bending

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.240
their head to the right.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.050
And for that, I
collected n observations.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.050
And I'm interested in
making some inference

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.880
in the statistical model.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.000
My question to you is, what
is the statistical model?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.050
Well, if you want to read
the statistical model,

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.170
you're going to have
to write this E--

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.960
oh, sorry, I never
told you what E was.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.610
OK, well actually just
go to the examples,

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.350
and then you'll know what E is.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:14.532
So you're going to have to write
to me an E and a p theta, OK?

00:30:14.532 --> 00:30:16.240
So let's start with
the Bernoulli trials.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.480
So this e here is
called the sample space.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:37.040
And in the normal
people's words,

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:44.980
it just means the space or
the set in which x and--

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.200
back to your question, x is
just a generic observation lips.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:56.110
OK, and hopefully, this is
the smallest you can think of.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.560
OK, so for example,
for Bernoulli trials,

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.270
I'm going to observe a
sequence of 0's and 1's.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.360
So my experiment is going to
be-- as written on the board,

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.880
is going to be 1, 0, 1.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.657
And then the probability
distributions

00:31:08.657 --> 00:31:10.240
are going to be,
well, it's just going

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.290
to be the Bernoulli
distributions indexed

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.240
by p, right?

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.050
So rather than
writing p sub p, I'm

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:20.650
going to write it
as Bernoulli p,

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:24.145
because it's clear what
I mean when I write that.

00:31:24.145 --> 00:31:25.537
Is everybody happy?

00:31:25.537 --> 00:31:27.370
Actually, I need to
tell you something more.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.880
This is a family
of distributions.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.932
So I need p.

00:31:29.932 --> 00:31:31.390
And maybe I don't
want to have to p

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.370
that's a value 0, 1, right?

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.390
It doesn't make sense.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.660
I would probably not
look at this problem

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.660
if I anticipated that everybody
would kiss to the right.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.280
And everybody would
kiss to the left.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.400
So I am going to assume
that p is in 0, 1,

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.930
but does not have 0 and 1.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:48.430
OK?

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:52.494
So that's the statistical
model for a Bernoulli trial.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.180
OK, now the next
one, what do we have?

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:03.991
Exponential.

00:32:03.991 --> 00:32:04.490
OK?

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.684
OK, so when I have
exponential distributions,

00:32:12.684 --> 00:32:14.850
what is the support of the
exponential distribution?

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.150
What value is it going to take?

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.190
0 to infinity, right?

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.700
So what I have is
that my first space

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.740
is the value that my
random variables can take.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:34.290
So its-- well, actually I
can remove the 0 again--

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.140
0 to plus infinity.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.450
And then the family
of distributions

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.320
that I have are exponential
with parameter lambda.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.090
And again, maybe you've
seen me switching

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:49.147
from p, to lambda, to theta,
to mu, to sigma square.

00:32:49.147 --> 00:32:50.730
Honestly you can do
whatever you want.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.430
But its just that it's customary
to have this particular group

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:54.740
of letters.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.620
OK?

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.950
And so the parameters
of an exponential

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:02.210
are just positive numbers.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.710
OK?

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:08.714
And that's my exponential model.

00:33:08.714 --> 00:33:09.630
What is the third one?

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.960
Can somebody tell me?

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.960
Poisson, OK?

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.230
OK, so Poisson-- is a
Poisson random verbal

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:21.545
discrete or continuous?

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.740
Go back to your probability.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.150
All right, so the answer being
the opposite of continuous--

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.790
good job.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.471
All right, so it's going to be--

00:33:38.471 --> 00:33:39.720
what value can a Poisson take?

00:33:43.157 --> 00:33:44.490
All the natural integers, right?

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.434
So 0, 1, 2, 3, all
the way to infinity.

00:33:47.434 --> 00:33:48.850
We don't have any
control of this.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:53.830
So I'm going to write
this as n without 0.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.882
I think in the slides,
it's n-star maybe.

00:33:55.882 --> 00:33:57.340
Actually, no, you
can take value 0.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:57.840
I'm sorry.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.630
This actually takes
value 0 quite a lot.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.190
That's typically, in many
instances, actually the mode.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:05.780
So it's n, and then
I'm going to write it

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.500
as Poisson with
parameter-- well,

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.350
here it's again
lambda as a parameter.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.492
And lambda can take
any positive value.

00:34:13.492 --> 00:34:13.992
OK?

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:21.280
And that's where you can
actually see that the model

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.719
that we had for the
siblings-- right?

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:27.270
So let me actually just squeeze
in the siblings model here.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:35.920
So that was the bad model
that I had in the first place

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.210
when I actually kept this.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.106
Let's say we just kept it at 7.

00:34:39.106 --> 00:34:40.730
Forget about larger
than or equal to 7.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.290
We just assumed it was 7.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.749
What was our sample space?

00:34:54.228 --> 00:34:56.699
We said 7.

00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:01.530
So it's 1, 2, to 7, right?

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.770
Those were the possible values
that this thing would take.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.160
And then what was my--

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.330
what's my parameter space?

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.750
So it's going to be
a nightmare write.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:14.210
But I'm going to write it.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.380
OK, so I'm going to write it as
something like the probability

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.470
that x is equal to k
is equal to p sub k.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.540
OK?

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:33.480
And that's going to be for p.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.150
OK, so that's for
all k's, right?

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.890
Or for k equal 1 to 7.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:44.999
And here the index is the
set of parameters p1 to pk.

00:35:44.999 --> 00:35:47.040
And I know a little more
about those guys, right?

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.670
I know there are going
to be non-negative--

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.910
PJ non-negative.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.320
And I know that they sum to 1.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.770
OK, so maybe writing
this, you start

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:05.880
seeing why we like those
Poisson, exponential,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.010
and short notation, because
I actually don't have

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.530
to write the PMF of a Poisson.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.870
The Poisson is really just this.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.570
But I call it Poisson
so I don't have

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.600
to rewrite this all the time.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.620
And so here, I did not
use a particular form.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.810
So I just have this thing,
and that's what it is.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:24.940
The set of parameters is the
set of positive numbers of--

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.560
p1 to p7, pk--

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.010
and sum to 7, right?

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:34.110
And so this as just
a list of numbers

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.240
that are non-negative
and sum up to 1.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.971
So that's my parameter space.

00:36:39.971 --> 00:36:40.470
OK?

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.280
So here that's my theta.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.360
This whole thing here--

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.551
this is my capital theta.

00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:48.051
OK?

00:36:51.947 --> 00:36:53.760
So that's just the
set of parameters

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.530
that theta-- the
set of parameters

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.440
that theta is allowed to take.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.890
OK, and finally, we're going
to end with the star of all,

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.970
and that's the
normal distribution.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.960
And in the normal
distribution, you still

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.080
have also some flexibility
in terms of choices,

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.710
because then naturally,
the normal distribution

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.740
is parametrized by--

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.380
the normal distribution is
parametrized by two parameters,

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:19.880
right?

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.709
Mean and variance.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.450
So what values can a Gaussian
random variable take?

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.980
An entire real line, right?

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.990
And the set of
parameters that it

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:42.200
can take it-- so this is going
to be n, mu, sigma square.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.190
And mu is going to be positive.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:49.080
And stigma square is going--

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.720
sorry, m is going to be an r.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.070
And sigma square is
going to be positive.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.414
OK, so again here,
that's the way

00:37:57.414 --> 00:37:58.580
you're supposed to write it.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.260
If you really want to
identify what theta is,

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:08.760
well, theta formally is the set
of mu sigma square such that--

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:15.821
well, in r times
0 infinity, right?

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.200
That's just to be formal, but
this does the job just fine.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.700
OK?

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.820
You don't have to
be super formal.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.500
OK, that's not three.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.170
That's like five.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.120
Actually, I just want
to write another one.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.130
Let's call it 5-bit.

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:41.030
And 5-bit is just Gaussian
with known variants.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.230
And this arises a
lot in labs when

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.550
you have measurement error--

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.870
when you actually receive
your measurement device.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.910
This thing has been
tested by the manufacturer

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:00.940
so much that it actually comes
in on the side of the box.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.030
It says that the standard
deviation of your measurements

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.574
is going to be 0.23.

00:39:07.574 --> 00:39:09.490
OK, and actually why you
do this is because we

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.290
can brag about accuracy, right?

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.510
That's how they sell you
this particular device.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.480
And so you actually know
exactly what sigma square is.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.230
So once you actually get
your data in the lab,

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.210
you actually only
have to estimate mu,

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.530
because stigma
comes on the label.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:28.660
So now, what is your
statistical model?

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.190
Well, the numbers are
collecting still in r.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:42.034
But now, the models that I
have is n, mu, sigma squared.

00:39:42.034 --> 00:39:46.010
But the parameter space is not
mu, and r, and sigma positive.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.897
It's just mu and r.

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:58.449
And to be a little more
emphatic about this,

00:39:58.449 --> 00:39:59.990
this is enough to
describe it, right?

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.300
Because if sigma
is the sigma that

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.580
was specified by
the manufacturer,

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.340
then this is the sigma you want.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.710
But you can actually
write sigma is equal to--

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:15.420
sigma square is equal to
sigma square manufacturer.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:15.920
Right?

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.860
You can just fix it to
be this particular value.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.230
Or maybe you don't want
to write that index that's

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:22.007
the manufacturer.

00:40:22.007 --> 00:40:23.590
And so you just say,
well, the sigma--

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.740
when I write n
squared what I mean

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.490
is the sigma square
from the manufacturer.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:27.404
Yeah?

00:40:27.404 --> 00:40:29.368
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.080
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.597
For a particular
measuring device?

00:40:39.597 --> 00:40:42.180
You know, you're in a lab, and
you have some measuring device.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.260
I don't know--
something that measures

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.042
tensile strength of something.

00:40:48.042 --> 00:40:49.750
And it's just going
to measure something.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.480
And it will naturally
make errors.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.865
But it's been tested so
much by the manufacturer

00:40:53.865 --> 00:40:55.770
and calibrated by them.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:57.807
They know it's not
going to be perfect.

00:40:57.807 --> 00:40:59.265
But they knew
exactly what error it

00:40:59.265 --> 00:41:00.690
was making, because
they've actually tried it

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.231
on things for which
they exactly knew

00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:04.431
what the tensile strength was.

00:41:04.431 --> 00:41:05.385
OK?

00:41:05.385 --> 00:41:06.339
Yeah.

00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:07.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:09.155 --> 00:41:10.155
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: This?

00:41:10.155 --> 00:41:11.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.898
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Oh,
like that's pointing to--

00:41:13.898 --> 00:41:14.886
5 prime?

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.260
OK?

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.230
And we can come up with
other examples, right?

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.030
So for example,
here's another one.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.350
So the names don't
really matter, right?

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.670
I call it the siblings model.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.662
But you won't find the siblings
model in the textbook, right?

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:38.870
So I wouldn't worry too much.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.810
But for example, let's say
you have something-- so

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:42.710
let's call it 6.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:45.700
You have-- I don't know--

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:54.240
a truncated-- and that's the
name I just came up with.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.490
But it's actually not exactly
describing what I want.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:03.510
But let's say I observe y, which
is the indicator of x larger

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:11.460
than say 5 when x follows some
exponential with parameter

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.181
lambda.

00:42:13.181 --> 00:42:13.680
OK?

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.570
This is what I get to observe.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:18.990
I only observe if
my waiting time

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:20.610
was more than five
minutes, because I

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.160
see somebody coming out
of the Kendall Station

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.380
being really upset.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.310
And that's all I record
is I've been waiting

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.770
for more than five minutes.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.460
And that's all I get to record.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:29.960
OK?

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.109
That happens a lot.

00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:32.400
These are called censored data.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.960
I should probably not
call it truncated,

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.712
but this should be censored.

00:42:36.712 --> 00:42:38.140
OK?

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.620
You see a lot of censored
data when you ask people

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.290
how much they make.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.330
They say, well, more
than five figures.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.720
And that's all they
want to tell you.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.380
OK?

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:54.410
And so you see a lot of censored
data in survival analysis,

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.560
right?

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.620
You are trying to understand
how long your patients are going

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.720
to live after some surgery, OK?

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.970
And maybe you're not going
to keep people alive,

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:07.491
and you're not
going to actually be

00:43:07.491 --> 00:43:09.490
in touch in their family
every day and ask them,

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:10.920
is the guy still alive?

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.750
And so what you
can do is just you

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.540
ask people maybe five
years after your study

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.060
and say, please, come in.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.970
And you will just happen to
have some people say, well, you

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.470
know, the person is deceased.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.560
And you will only be able to
know that the person deceased

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.780
less than five years ago.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.980
But you only see what
happens after that, OK?

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.080
And so this is this
truncated and censored data.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.940
It happens all the
time just because you

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.750
don't have the ability
to do better than that.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.380
So this could happen here.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.270
So what is my physical
experiment, right?

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.650
So here, I should probably
write this like this,

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.380
because I just told you that my
observations are going to be x,

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.720
but there is some unknown y.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.210
I will never get to see this y.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:57.230
I only get to see the x.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:58.700
What is my statistical
experiment?

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.215
Please help me.

00:44:00.215 --> 00:44:02.460
So is it the real line?

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.850
My sample space--
is it the real line?

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.410
Sorry, who does not
know what this means?

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:13.440
I'm sorry.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.450
OK.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:18.460
So this is called an indicator.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.586
So I read it as--

00:44:20.586 --> 00:44:23.940
if I wrote well, that would
be one with a double bar.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.070
You can also write
i if you prefer

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.200
if you don't feel like
writing one in double bars.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.235
And it's one of say--

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:32.610
I'm going to write
it like that--

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:43.590
1 of a is equal to 1 if a
is true and 0 if a is false.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:44.880
OK?

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.370
So that means that if y is
larger than 4, this thing is 1.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:52.350
And if y is not larger
than 5, this thing is 0.

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.754
OK.

00:44:53.754 --> 00:44:56.247
So that's called an indicator--

00:45:00.143 --> 00:45:01.604
indicator function.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.760
It was very useful to just
turn anything into a 0, 1.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.387
So now that I'm here,
what is my sample space?

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.800
0, 1.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.610
Well, whatever this
thing I did not tell you

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:24.247
was taking value with the
thing you should have--

00:45:24.247 --> 00:45:26.580
if I end up telling you that
is taking value 6 or 7 that

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.760
would be your sample space, OK?

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.220
OK, so it takes values 0, 1.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.060
And then what is the
probability here?

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.410
What should I write here?

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.243
What should you write
without even thinking?

00:45:44.062 --> 00:45:45.020
Yeah.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.070
So let's assume
there's two seconds

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.830
before the end of the exam.

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.164
You're going to write Bernoulli.

00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:52.663
And that's where you're going
to start checking if I'm going

00:45:52.663 --> 00:45:54.174
to give you extra time, OK?

00:45:54.174 --> 00:45:55.840
So you write Bernoulli
without thinking,

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.330
because it's taking value 0, 1.

00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:59.760
So you just write Bernoulli,
but you still have to tell me

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.110
what possible parameters
this thing is taking, right?

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:06.450
So I'm going to write it
p, because I don't know.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.080
And then p take value--

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.370
OK, so sorry.

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:14.980
I could write it like that.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.910
Right?

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:21.260
That would be perfectly
valid, but actually no more.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.390
It's not any p.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.330
The p is the probability
that an exponential lambda

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:27.560
is larger than 5.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.530
And maybe I want to have
lambda as a parameter.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:33.450
OK, so what I need to
actually compute is,

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:38.180
what is the probability
that y is larger than 5--

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.725
when y is this
exponential lambda,

00:46:40.725 --> 00:46:42.350
which means that what
I need to compute

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:46.414
is the integral between
5 and infinity of--

00:46:46.414 --> 00:46:47.388
what is it?

00:46:47.388 --> 00:46:49.823
1 over lambda.

00:46:49.823 --> 00:46:52.745
How did I define
it in this class?

00:46:52.745 --> 00:46:54.206
Did I change it-- what?

00:46:54.206 --> 00:46:57.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.090
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Yeah,
right, right, right.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:46:59.760
Yeah.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.230
Lambda e to the minus
lambda x dx, right?

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.760
So that's what I
need to compute.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.580
What is this?

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.678
Yeah, so what is the
value of this integral?

00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:16.658
Can you take
appropriate measures?

00:47:25.622 --> 00:47:28.112
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:32.594 --> 00:47:33.610
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: OK?

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.984
And again, you can
cancel this, right?

00:47:35.984 --> 00:47:37.650
So when I'm going to
integrate this guy,

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.070
those guys are going to cancel.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.900
I'm going to get 0 for infinity.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.929
I'm going to get
a 5 for this guy.

00:47:42.929 --> 00:47:45.470
And well, I know it's going to
be positive number, so I'm not

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:46.890
really going to
bother with the signs,

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.556
because I know that's
what it should be.

00:47:48.556 --> 00:47:51.850
OK, so I get e to
the minus 5 lambda.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:55.231
And so that means that I can
actually write this like that--

00:47:57.973 --> 00:48:01.710
and now parametrize this
thing by lambda positive.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:02.210
OK?

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:05.480
So what I did here is I changed
the parametrization from p

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.890
to lambda.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:07.490
Why?

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:10.550
Well, because maybe if I
know this is happening,

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:13.400
maybe I am actually
interested in reporting lambda

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.910
to MBTA, for example.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:20.375
Maybe I'm actually trying to
estimate 1 over lambda, so

00:48:20.375 --> 00:48:22.857
that I know it is--

00:48:22.857 --> 00:48:24.440
well, lambda is
actually the intensity

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.819
of arrival of my
Poisson process, right?

00:48:26.819 --> 00:48:27.860
I have a Poisson process.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:31.357
That's how my trains
are coming in.

00:48:31.357 --> 00:48:32.690
And so I'm interested in lambda.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:34.314
So I will parametrize
things by lambda.

00:48:34.314 --> 00:48:35.680
So the thing I get is lambda.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.010
You can play with this, right?

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:39.051
I mean, I could parametrize
this by 1 over lambda

00:48:39.051 --> 00:48:42.960
and put 1 over lambda
here if I want it.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.650
But you know, the
context of your problem

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:50.321
will tell you exactly
how to parametrize this.

00:48:50.321 --> 00:48:50.820
OK?

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:59.200
So what else did I
want to tell you?

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.688
OK, let's do a final one.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.800
By the way, are you guys OK
with Poisson exponential,

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.060
Bernoulli's--

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.930
I don't know, binomial, normal--

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:24.155
all these things.

00:49:24.155 --> 00:49:25.780
I'm not going to go
back to it, but I'm

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:26.863
going to use them heavily.

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:29.435
So just spend five
minutes on Wikipedia

00:49:29.435 --> 00:49:31.870
if you forgot about
what those things are.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:35.140
Usually, you must have seen them
the in your probability class.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.670
So they should not
be a crazy name.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.410
And again, I'm
not expecting you.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.804
I don't remember what the
density of an exponential is.

00:49:40.804 --> 00:49:42.220
So it would be
pretty unfair of me

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.069
to actually ask you to
remember what it is.

00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:45.610
Even for the Gaussian,
I don't expect

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:46.760
you to remember what it is.

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.550
But I want you to remember that
if I add 5 to a Gaussian, then

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:54.490
I have a Gaussian with me and
mu plus 5 if I multiply it

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:55.800
by something, right?

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.170
You need to know how to
operate those things.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.110
But knowing
complicated densities

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.290
is definitely not
part of the game.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:05.740
OK?

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:09.591
So let's do a final one.

00:50:09.591 --> 00:50:11.090
I don't know what
number I have now.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:12.298
I'm going to just do uniform.

00:50:14.999 --> 00:50:15.790
That's another one.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.370
Everybody knows what uniform is?

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.360
So it's uniform, right?

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.810
So I'm going to have x,
which my observations are

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:27.140
going to be uniform on the
interval 0 theta, right?

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.100
So if I want to define
a uniform distribution

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.575
for a random variable, I have
to tell you which interval

00:50:32.575 --> 00:50:35.200
or which set I want
it to be uniform on.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.210
And so here I'm telling you
is the interval 0 theta.

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:41.270
And so what is going
to be my sample space?

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:42.204
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:42.204 --> 00:50:44.480
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: I'm sorry?

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:44.980
0 to theta.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.770
And then what is my
probability distribution?

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:52.228
My family of parameters?

00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.000
So well, I can write
it like this, right?

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.444
Uniform theta, right?

00:51:03.444 --> 00:51:06.408
And theta let's say is positive.

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:12.336
Can somebody tell me what's
wrong with what I wrote?

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.592
This makes no sense.

00:51:20.592 --> 00:51:21.554
Tell me why.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.845
Yeah?

00:51:26.845 --> 00:51:30.292
Yeah, this set depends on theta,
and why is that a problem?

00:51:30.292 --> 00:51:32.188
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:36.869 --> 00:51:38.410
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET:
There is no theta.

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:40.990
Right now, there's
the families of theta.

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:43.430
Which one did you pick here?

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.540
Right, this is just something
that's indexed by theta,

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.090
but I could have very well
written it as, you know,

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:51.860
just not being
Greek for a second,

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.652
I could have just written
this as t rather than theta.

00:51:55.652 --> 00:51:56.860
That would be the same thing.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.349
And then what the hell is theta?

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:00.640
There's no such thing as theta.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.230
We don't know what
the parameter is.

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:04.314
This parameter should
move with everyone.

00:52:04.314 --> 00:52:05.980
And so that means
that I actually am not

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.200
allowed to pick this theta.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.060
I'm actually-- just for
the reason that there is no

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.056
parameter to put
on the left side--

00:52:12.056 --> 00:52:13.180
there should not be, right?

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:14.910
So you just said, well, there's
a problem because the parameter

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.030
is on the left-hand side.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.405
But there's not
even a parameter.

00:52:17.405 --> 00:52:19.630
I'm describing the family
of possible parameters.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.060
There is no one that you
can actually plug it in.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.352
So this should really be 1.

00:52:24.352 --> 00:52:25.810
And I'm going to
go back to writing

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:29.776
this as theta because
that's pretty standard.

00:52:29.776 --> 00:52:31.750
Is that clear for everyone.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:37.780
I cannot just pick one and put
it in there and just take the--

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.600
before I run my experiments,
I could potentially

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.370
get numbers that are
all the way up to 1,

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:45.206
because I don't know what theta
is going to be ahead of time.

00:52:45.206 --> 00:52:47.740
Now, if somebody
promised to me that theta

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.690
was going to be less
than 0.5, that would be--

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:50.980
sorry, why do I put 1 here?

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.490
I could put theta
between 0 and 1.

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:00.150
But if somebody is going
to promise me, for example,

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:01.649
if theta is going
to be less than 1,

00:53:01.649 --> 00:53:03.599
then you expect to put 0, 1.

00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:04.565
All right?

00:53:08.912 --> 00:53:12.310
Is that clear?

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:15.410
OK, so now you know how
to answer the question--

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.390
what is the statistical model?

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:20.140
And again, within the
scope of this class,

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:23.110
you will not be asked to just
come up with a model right that

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:24.260
will just tell you.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.390
Poisson would be probably
be a good idea here.

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:28.681
And then you would just have
to trust me that indeed it

00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:30.460
would be a good idea.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:35.230
All right, so what I started
talking about 20 minutes ago--

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:38.350
so it's definitely
ahead of myself

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.000
is the notion-- so
that's when I was

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.290
talking about well-specified.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:44.650
Remember, well-specified says
that the true distribution

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.080
is one of the distributions
in this parametric families

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:48.310
of distribution.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.050
The true distribution
of my siblings

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:52.570
is actually a Poisson
with some parameters.

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:56.800
And all I need to figure out
is what this parameter is.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.560
When I started saying
that, I said, well,

00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.970
but then that
could be that there

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.428
are several parameters
that give me

00:54:01.428 --> 00:54:03.010
the same distribution, right?

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:07.840
It could be the case that
Poisson 5 and Poisson 17

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.910
are exactly the same
distributions when

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:13.540
I started putting those numbers
in the formula which I erased,

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.140
OK?

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:18.070
So it could be the case that two
different numbers would give me

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:20.360
exactly the same probabilities.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.600
And in this case, we see that
the model is not identifiable.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.680
I mean, the parameter
is not identifiable.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.410
I cannot identify the parameter,
even if you actually gave me

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:32.080
an infinite amount of data,
which means that I could

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.750
actually estimate
exactly the PMF.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.277
I might not be able to go
back, because there would

00:54:37.277 --> 00:54:38.860
be several candidates,
and I would not

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.360
be able to tell you which one
it was in the first place.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:41.860
OK?

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.310
So what we want is
that this function--

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:49.720
theta maps to p
theta is injective.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.067
And that really can be fancy.

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.560
What I really mean
is that if theta

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:01.580
is different from theta
prime, then p of theta

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.100
is different from
p of theta prime.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.580
Or, if you prefer to think about
the contrapositive of this,

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:11.960
this is the same as saying
that if p theta gives me

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.320
the same distribution
as theta prime,

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.480
then that implies
that theta must

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.180
be equal to the theta prime.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:24.330
The logic of those two
things are equivalent, right?

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.780
So that's what this means.

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:37.130
So this is-- we say that the
parameter is identifiable

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:41.414
or identified-- it
doesn't really matter--

00:55:41.414 --> 00:55:42.386
in this model.

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:50.920
And this is something
we're going to want.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.920
OK?

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.980
So in all the examples
that I gave you,

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.090
those parameters are
completely identified.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:57.590
Right?

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:58.410
If I tell you--

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:01.440
I mean, if those things
are in probability box,

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.920
it means that they were
probably thought through, right?

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.290
So when I say
exponential lambda,

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:09.987
I'm really talking about one
specific distribution and not--

00:56:09.987 --> 00:56:11.820
there's not another
lambda going to give you

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.910
exactly the same distribution.

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.020
OK so that was the case.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.150
And you can check that,
but it's a little annoying.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:19.306
So I would probably not do it.

00:56:19.306 --> 00:56:20.930
But rather than doing
this, let me just

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:24.210
give you some examples where
it would not be the case.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:25.980
Again, here's an
example, if I take xi--

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:36.980
so now I'm back to just using
this indicator function--

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.080
but now for a Gaussian.

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:42.030
So what I observe is
x is the indicator

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:44.020
that y is, what did we say?

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:44.914
Positive.

00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:49.350
OK?

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.458
So this is a Bernoulli
random variable, right?

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.709
And it has some parameter p.

00:56:57.709 --> 00:56:59.250
But p now is going
to depend-- sorry,

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:04.890
and here y is n mu sigma square.

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:09.090
So the p, the probability
that this thing is positive,

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:10.020
is actually--

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.390
I don't think I put the 0.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:13.010
Oh, yeah, because I have mu.

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.935
OK, so this distribution--
this p the probability

00:57:15.935 --> 00:57:17.560
that it's positive
is just the probably

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.715
that some Gaussian is positive.

00:57:19.715 --> 00:57:22.410
And it will depend on
mu and sigma, right?

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:31.680
Because if I draw a 0, and I
draw my Gaussian around mu,

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:35.430
then the probability of
this Bernoulli being 1

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:39.790
is really the area
under the curve here.

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:40.770
Right?

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:42.827
And this thing-- well,
if mu is very large,

00:57:42.827 --> 00:57:44.160
it's going to become very large.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.540
If mu is very small, it's
going to become very small.

00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:51.961
And if sigma changes, it's
also going to effect--

00:57:51.961 --> 00:57:53.970
is that clear for everyone?

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:56.040
But we can actually
compute this, right?

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:59.610
So the parameter p that
I'm looking for here

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:01.650
as a function of mu
and sigma is simply

00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:06.270
the probability that
some y is non-negative,

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:12.150
which is the probability that
y minus mu divided by sigma

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:16.790
is larger than minus
mu divided by sigma.

00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:20.160
But when you study probability,
is that some operation you

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:22.170
were used to making?

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:26.010
Removing the mean and dividing
by the standard deviation?

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:28.116
What is the effect of
doing that on the Gaussian

00:58:28.116 --> 00:58:30.655
random variable?

00:58:30.655 --> 00:58:32.030
Yeah, so you
normalize it, right?

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:33.490
And you standardize it.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:34.900
You make it a standard Gaussian.

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:36.880
You remove the mean.

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.470
The mean 0 is Gaussian.

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:41.170
And you remove the variance
for it to become 1.

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:43.019
So when you have a
Gaussian, remove the mean

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:44.560
and divide by the
standard deviation,

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.570
it becomes a standard Gaussian--

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:50.975
which this thing has
n , 0, 1 distribution,

00:58:50.975 --> 00:58:53.350
which is the one you can read
the quintiles of at the end

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:54.640
of the book.

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.140
Right?

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.020
And that's exactly what we did.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:57.520
OK?

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.190
So now you have the probability
that some standard Gaussian

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:04.366
exceeds negative mu
over sigma, which

00:59:04.366 --> 00:59:06.490
I can write in terms of
the cumulative distribution

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:07.894
function, capital phi--

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.560
like we did in
the first lecture.

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.070
So if I do this cumulative
distribution function,

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:21.012
what is this probability
in terms of phi?

00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:26.413
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:26.413 --> 00:59:28.307
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:28.307 --> 00:59:30.640
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Well,
that's what your name tag says.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.366
1 minus--

00:59:34.366 --> 00:59:36.034
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:36.034 --> 00:59:37.700
PHILLIPPE RIGOLLET:
1 minus mu of sigma.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.786
What happens with phi in our--

00:59:39.786 --> 00:59:43.450
do you think I
defined this for fun?

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:50.210
1 minus phi of mu
over sigma, right?

00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:50.710
Right?

00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:52.320
Because this is 1
minus the probability

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.361
that it's less than this.

00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:55.180
And this is exactly
the definition

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.915
of the cumulative
distribution function.

00:59:57.915 --> 01:00:04.080
So in particular, this thing
only depends on mu over sigma.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.640
Agreed?

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.630
So in particular, if I
had 2 mu over 2 sigma,

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:11.240
p would remain unchanged.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:15.340
If I have 12 mu over
12 sigma, this thing

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.370
would remain
unchanged, which means

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:22.780
that p does not
change if I scale mu

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.410
and sigma by the same factor.

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:28.840
So there's no way just
by observing x, even

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.090
an infinite times, so that I can
actually get exactly what p is.

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.870
I'm never going to be able to
get mu and sigma separately.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.842
All I'm going to be able
to get is mu over sigma.

01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:41.730
So here, we say that mu sigma--

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:43.120
the parameter mu sigma--

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.056
or actually each of them
individually-- those guys--

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:51.769
they're not identifiable.

01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:03.180
But the parameter mu over
sigma is identifiable.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:13.820
So if I wanted to write a
statistical model in which

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.620
the parameter is identifiable--

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:32.440
I would write 0, 1 Bernoulli.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:41.289
And then I would write 1
minus phi over mu over sigma.

01:01:41.289 --> 01:01:42.830
And then I would
take two parameters,

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:48.940
which are mu and r and
sigma squared positive.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.244
So let's write sigma positive.

01:01:52.244 --> 01:01:52.744
Right?

01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:59.440
No, this is not identifiable.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.848
I cannot write those two guys
as being two things different.

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:22.050
Instead, what I want to write
is 0, 1, Bernoulli 1 minus--

01:02:26.026 --> 01:02:30.002
and now my parameter--

01:02:30.002 --> 01:02:37.610
I forgot this-- my
parameter is mu over sigma.

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:41.180
Can somebody tell me
where mu over sigma lives?

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.670
What values can this thing take?

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:48.115
Any real value, right?

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.920
OK, so now I've done this
definitely out of convenience,

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.430
right?

01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:59.130
Because that was the only
thing I was able to identify--

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:01.020
the ratio of mu over sigma.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.260
But it's still something
that has some meaning.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.570
It's the normalized mean.

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:08.880
It really tells me what
the mean is compared

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.200
to the standard deviation.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.980
So in some models, in reality,
in some real applications,

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.050
this actually might
have a good meaning.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:17.940
It's just telling
me how big the mean

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:22.620
is compared to the standard
fluctuations of this model.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.936
But I won't be able
to get more than that.

01:03:24.936 --> 01:03:25.436
Agreed?

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:32.500
All right?

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:37.510
So now that we've set
a parametric model,

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:40.580
let's try to see what our
goals are going to be.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.080
OK?

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.740
So now we have a sample
and a statistical model.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:47.560
And we want to estimate
the parameter theta,

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.510
and I could say,
well, you know what?

01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:51.190
I don't have time
for this analysis.

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:53.390
Collecting data is going
to take me a while.

01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:55.010
So I'm just going to mmm--

01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:57.509
and I'm going to say
that mu over sigma is 4.

01:03:57.509 --> 01:03:59.050
And I'm just going
to give it to you.

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:00.970
And maybe you will
tell me, yeah,

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.140
it's not very good, right?

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.870
So we need some
measure of performance

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:05.770
of a given parameter.

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:09.310
We need to be able to evaluate
if eyeballing the problem

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:11.680
is worse than
actually collecting

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.030
a large amount of theta.

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:16.150
We need to know if even if I
come up with an estimator that

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.520
actually sort of uses
the data, does it

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.620
make an efficient
use of the data?

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.750
Would I actually need 10
times more observations

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.279
to achieve the same accuracy?

01:04:24.279 --> 01:04:25.820
To be able to answer
these questions,

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.390
well, I need to define
what accuracy means.

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.550
And accuracy is something
that sort of makes sense.

01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:31.716
It says, well, I want theta.

01:04:31.716 --> 01:04:33.520
I have to be close to theta.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.344
And the theta is
a random variable.

01:04:35.344 --> 01:04:36.760
So I'm going to
have to understand

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.218
what it means for
a random variable

01:04:38.218 --> 01:04:40.570
to be close to a
deterministic number.

01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:44.354
And so, what is a
parameter estimator, right?

01:04:44.354 --> 01:04:46.770
So I have an estimator, and I
said it's a random variable.

01:04:49.692 --> 01:04:51.640
And the formal definition--

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:10.470
so an estimator is a measurable
function of the data.

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:12.570
So when I write
theta hat, and that

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:18.060
will typically be my notation
for an estimator, right?

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:24.820
I should really write
theta hat of x1 xn.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.380
OK?

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.930
That's what an estimator is.

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:28.620
If you want to know
an estimator is,

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.400
this is a measurable
function of the data.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:35.187
And it's actually also
known as a statistic.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.350
And you know, if
you're interested in,

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:43.340
you know, I see every day
I think when I have like,

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.250
you know, a dinner
with normal people.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:48.630
And they say I'm a statistician.

01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:50.660
Oh, yeah, I really
like baseball.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.210
And they talk to me
about batting averages.

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:54.119
That's not what I do.

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:55.910
But for them, that's
what it is, and that's

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.010
because in a way, that's
what a statistic is.

01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:00.450
A batting average
is a statistic.

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:02.240
OK, and so here
are some examples.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.250
You can take the average xn bar.

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:06.400
You can take the maximum
of your observation.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.370
That's the statistics.

01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:08.990
You can take the first one.

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:10.820
You can take the first
one plus log of 1

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.830
plus the absolute
value of the last one.

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:15.980
You can do whatever you want
that will be an estimator.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:17.780
Some of them are
clearly going to be bad.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.090
But that's still a statistic,
and you can do this.

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:24.610
Now, when I say
measurable, I always have--

01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:26.277
so you know, graduate
students sometimes

01:06:26.277 --> 01:06:28.943
ask me like, yeah, how do I know
if this estimator is measurable

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:29.480
or not.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.710
And usually, my answer is,
well, if I give you data,

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:32.866
can you compute it.

01:06:32.866 --> 01:06:35.240
And they say, yeah, I'm like,
well, then it's measurable.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.390
That's a very good rule to
check if you can actually--

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:40.970
if something is
actually measurable.

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:42.560
When is this thing
non-measurable?

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.750
It's when it's
implicitly defined.

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:46.700
OK, and in
particular, the things

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.880
that give you problems are--

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:53.525
sup or inf.

01:06:53.525 --> 01:06:55.820
Anybody knows what
a sup or an inf is?

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.560
It's like a max or a min.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.720
But it's not always attained.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.120
OK, so if I have x1.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:06.800
So if I look at the
infimum of the function

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.610
f of x for x on the real
line and f of x, sorry,

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.880
let's say x on the 1 infinity.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.970
And f of x is equal to 1 over x.

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:18.070
Right?

01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:20.030
Then the infimum is
the smallest value

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:22.850
we can take except
that it doesn't really

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:28.270
take it at 0 right, because
1 over x is going to 0.

01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:30.240
But it's never
really getting there.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.590
So we just called the inf 0.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.340
But it's not the value
that it ever takes.

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.952
And these things might actually
be complicated to compute.

01:07:37.952 --> 01:07:40.160
And so that's when you
actually have problems, right?

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.870
When the limit is not--

01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:44.030
you're not really quite
reaching the limit.

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:47.481
You won't have this problem in
general, but just so you know,

01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:48.980
an estimator is not
really anything.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.440
It has to actually
be measurable.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.630
OK, so the first thing we
want to know I mentioned it--

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:57.690
so an estimator is a statistic
which does not depend on theta,

01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:58.670
of course.

01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:01.430
So if I give you the data, you
have to be able to compute it.

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:04.250
And that probably should not
require not knowing any known

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.840
parameters.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.070
OK, so an estimator is
said to be consistent.

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:13.790
When my data-- when I collect
more and more data, this thing

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:16.130
is getting closer and closer
to the true parameter.

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.629
All right?

01:08:16.629 --> 01:08:20.080
And we said that eyeballing and
saying that it's going to be 4

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.770
is not really something
that's probably

01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:22.907
going to be consistent.

01:08:22.907 --> 01:08:24.740
But they can have things
that are consistent

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:28.850
but that are converging to
theta at different speeds.

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:29.816
OK?

01:08:29.816 --> 01:08:32.479
And we know also that
this is a random variable.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:33.649
It converges to something.

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:35.390
And there might be
some different notions

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:36.556
of convergence that kick in.

01:08:36.556 --> 01:08:38.060
And actually there are.

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.850
And we say that it's weakly
convergent if it converges

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.670
in probability and
strongly convergent

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:46.310
if it converges
almost [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:46.970
OK?

01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:48.890
And this is just vocabulary.

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:50.581
It won't make a big difference.

01:08:50.581 --> 01:08:51.080
OK?

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:56.228
So we will typically say it's
consistent with any of the two.

01:08:56.228 --> 01:08:57.707
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:02.637 --> 01:09:07.488
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: Well, so
in parametric statistics,

01:09:07.488 --> 01:09:09.529
it's actually a little
difficult to come up with.

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:15.022
But in non-parametric ones, I
could just say, if I had xi,

01:09:15.022 --> 01:09:24.180
yi, and I know that yi is
f of xi plus noise s1i.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.800
And I know that f belongs
to some class of function,

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.930
let's say--

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:31.310
[INAUDIBLE] class of smooth
functions-- it's massive.

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:33.810
And now, I'm going to actually
find the following estimator.

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:35.279
I'm going to take the average.

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:36.945
So I'm going to do
least squares, right?

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:41.720
So I just check.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.300
I'm trying to minimize the
distance of each of my f of xi

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.979
to my yi.

01:09:45.979 --> 01:09:49.700
And now, I want to find
the smallest of them.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:56.240
So if I look at the infimum
here, then the question is--

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.590
so that could be--

01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:59.750
well, that's not really
an estimator for f.

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:02.630
But it's an estimator for
the smallest possible value.

01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:04.550
And so for example,
this is actually

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:07.340
an estimator for the
variance of sigma square.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.990
This might not be attained,
and this might not

01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:13.710
be measurable if f is massive?

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:16.285
All right, so that's the
infimum over some class f of x.

01:10:16.285 --> 01:10:18.150
OK?

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:20.810
So those are all voice things
that are defined implicitly.

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:24.982
If it's an average, for example,
it's completely measurable.

01:10:24.982 --> 01:10:27.467
OK?

01:10:27.467 --> 01:10:28.958
Any other question?

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:37.809
OK, so we know that the first
thing we might want to check,

01:10:37.809 --> 01:10:40.350
and that's definitely something
we want about estimators that

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:43.020
is consistent, because
all consistency tells

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:45.924
us is that just as I
collect more and more data,

01:10:45.924 --> 01:10:47.382
my estimator is
going to get closer

01:10:47.382 --> 01:10:51.300
and closer to the parameter.

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.930
There's other things
we can look at.

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:55.600
For each possible value
of n-- now, right now,

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.560
I have a finite number
of observations--

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.850
25.

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:04.450
And I want to know something
about my estimator.

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:08.672
The first thing I want to check
is maybe if in average, right?

01:11:08.672 --> 01:11:09.880
So this is a random variable.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.860
Is this random
variable in average

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.540
going to be close
to theta or not?

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.260
And so the difference
how far I am from theta

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:20.140
is actually called the bias.

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:28.400
So the bias of an estimator is
the expectation of theta hat

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.640
minus the value that I hope
it gets, which is theta.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:38.642
If this thing is equal to 0, we
say that theta hat is unbiased.

01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:44.680
And unbiased estimators
are things that people

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.967
are looking for in general.

01:11:46.967 --> 01:11:49.300
The problem is that there's
lots of unbiased estimators.

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:52.829
And so it might be misleading
to look for unbiasedness

01:11:52.829 --> 01:11:54.370
when that's not
really the only thing

01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:55.870
you should be looking for.

01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:58.690
OK, so what does it
mean to be unbiased?

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.432
Maybe for this
particular round of data

01:12:00.432 --> 01:12:02.140
you collected, you're
actually pretty far

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.240
from the true estimator.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.440
But one thing that actually--

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.580
what it means is that if I redid
this experiment over, and over,

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:16.870
and over again, and I averaged
all the values of my estimators

01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:19.770
that I got, then this would
actually be the right--

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.371
the true parameter.

01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:21.870
OK.

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:22.990
That's what it means.

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:25.360
If I were to repeat
this experiment,

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.610
in average, I would actually
get the right thing.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:30.300
But you don't get to
repeat the experiment.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.070
OK, just a remark
about estimators,

01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:34.910
look at this estimator-- xn bar.

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:35.410
Right?

01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:36.670
Think of the kiss example.

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:39.605
I'm looking at the average
of my observations.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.980
And I want to know what the
expectation of this thing is.

01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:45.780
OK?

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:56.843
Now, this guy is by
linearity of the expectation,

01:12:56.843 --> 01:12:59.710
it is this, right?

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:03.850
But my data is
identically distributed.

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:07.060
So in particular, all the xi's
have the same expectation,

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:09.070
right?

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:10.734
Everybody agrees with this.

01:13:10.734 --> 01:13:12.150
When it's identically
distributed,

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:14.870
they'll get the
same expectation.

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:17.950
So what it means is
that this guy's here--

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:22.210
they're all equal to
the expectation of x1.

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:23.710
Right?

01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:25.980
So what it means is
that these guys--

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.280
I have the average
of the same number.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.830
So this is actually
the expectation of x1.

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:32.517
OK?

01:13:32.517 --> 01:13:33.100
And it's true.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.836
In the kiss example, this was p.

01:13:36.836 --> 01:13:37.780
And this is p--

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.200
the probability of
turning your head right.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:43.840
OK?

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.670
So those two things
are the same.

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:50.020
In particular, that means
that xn bar and just x1

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:54.120
have the same bias.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.100
So that should probably
illustrate to you

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.400
that bias is not something
that really is telling you

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.930
the entire picture, Right?

01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:05.350
I can take only one
of my observations--

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:06.484
Bernoulli 0, 1.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:07.900
This thing will
have the same bias

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.880
as if I average 1,000 of them.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.350
But the bias is really telling
you where I am in average.

01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:16.261
But it's really not telling me
what fluctuations I'm getting.

01:14:16.261 --> 01:14:18.510
And so if you want to start
having fluctuations coming

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:20.460
into the picture,
we actually have

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.350
to look at the risk
or the quadratic risk

01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:23.852
of the estimator.

01:14:23.852 --> 01:14:25.560
And so the quadratic
risk is the finest--

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.590
the expectation of the square
distance between theta hat

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:30.770
and theta.

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:33.155
OK?

01:14:33.155 --> 01:14:34.520
So let's look at this.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.830
So the quadratic risk--

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:48.710
sometimes it's
denoted that people

01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:57.590
call it the l2 risk of
theta hat, of course.

01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:59.950
I'm sorry for maintaining
such an ugly board.

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:00.910
[INAUDIBLE] this stuff.

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:10.960
OK, so I look at
the square distance

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.070
between theta hat and theta.

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:14.530
This is still-- this is the
function of a random variable.

01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:16.250
So it's a random
variable as well.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:19.081
And now I'm looking at the
expectation of this guy.

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:23.060
That's the definition.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.560
I claimed that when this
thing goes to 0, then

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.350
my estimator is actually
going to be consistent.

01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:30.298
Everybody agrees with this?

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:47.715
So if it goes to zero as n
goes to infinity-- and here,

01:15:47.715 --> 01:15:50.090
I don't need to tell you what
kind of convergence I have,

01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:51.715
because this is just
the number, right?

01:15:51.715 --> 01:15:52.640
It's an expectation.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.260
So it's a regular, usual
calculus-style convergence.

01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:03.326
Then that implies that theta hat
is actually weakly consistent.

01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:09.774
What did I use to tell you this?

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.450
Yeah, this is the
convergence in l2.

01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:19.950
This actually is
strictly equivalent.

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:26.264
This is by definition saying
that theta hat converges in l2

01:16:26.264 --> 01:16:29.360
to theta.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.190
And we know that
convergence in l2

01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:37.305
implies convergence in
credibility to theta.

01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:38.180
That was the picture.

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:40.160
We're going up.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.498
And this is actually
equivalent to a consistency

01:16:42.498 --> 01:16:46.329
by definition-- a
weak consistency.

01:16:46.329 --> 01:16:48.370
OK, so this is actually
telling you a little more

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.380
because this guy here--

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.810
they are both unbiased.

01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:55.010
Theta xn bar is unbiased.

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.470
X1 is unbiased.

01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:58.060
But x1 is certainly
not consistent ,

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.150
because the more data I collect,
I'm not even doing anything

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:01.650
with it.

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:04.120
I'm just taking the first data
point you're giving to me.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.650
So they're both unbiased.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:07.420
But this one is not consistent.

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.930
And this one we'll see
is actually consistent.

01:17:09.930 --> 01:17:11.370
xn bar is consistent.

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:14.358
And actually, we've
seen that last time.

01:17:14.358 --> 01:17:15.816
And that's because of the?

01:17:19.704 --> 01:17:23.752
What guarantees the fact
that xn bar is consistent?

01:17:23.752 --> 01:17:25.210
AUDIENCE: The law
of large numbers.

01:17:25.210 --> 01:17:26.110
PHILIPPE RIGOLLET: The law
of large numbers, right?

01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:27.780
Actually, it's
strongly consistent

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.880
if you have a
strong [INAUDIBLE]..

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:35.580
OK, so just in the
last two minutes,

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:39.920
I want to tell you a little bit
about how this risk is linked

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.350
to see, quadratic
risk is equal to bias

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:44.840
squared plus the variance.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.030
So let's see what
I mean by this?

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.030
So I'm going to forget
about the absolute values

01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.988
that you have a square.

01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:54.600
I don't really need them.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.530
If theta hat was
unbiased, this thing

01:17:57.530 --> 01:18:01.619
would be the expectation
of theta hat.

01:18:01.619 --> 01:18:02.660
It might not be the case.

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:06.464
So let me see how I can actually
see-- put the bias in there.

01:18:06.464 --> 01:18:07.880
Well, one way to
do this is to see

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.170
that this is equal to
the expectation of theta

01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:13.110
hat minus the
expectation of theta hat,

01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:17.160
plus the expectation of
theta hat minus theta.

01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:22.620
OK?

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.860
I just removed the same
and added the same thing.

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:27.030
So I didn't change anything.

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:29.840
Now, this guy is my bias, right?

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:34.680
So now let me expand the square.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.680
So what I get is the expectation
of the square of theta

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.295
hat minus its expectation.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.850
I should put some
square brackets--

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:50.410
plus two times
the cross-product.

01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:52.900
So the cross-product
is what expectation

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:59.740
of theta hat minus the
expectation of theta hat times

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:03.516
expectation of theta
hat minus theta.

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:08.892
And then I have the last square.

01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:22.890
Expectation of theta
hat minus theta squared.

01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:24.240
OK?

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.100
So square,
cross-products, square.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.980
Everybody is with me?

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:32.830
now this guy here--

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:35.070
if you pay attention, this
thing is the expectation

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.070
of some random variable.

01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:38.450
So it's a deterministic number.

01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:39.800
Theta is the true parameter.

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:41.810
It's a deterministic number.

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:44.020
So what I can do is pull
out this entire thing out

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:52.090
of the expectation like this
and compute the expectation only

01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:53.607
with respect to that part.

01:19:53.607 --> 01:19:56.529
But what is the
expectation of this thing?

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.240
It's zero, right?

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.323
The expectation of theta
hat minus the expectation

01:20:02.323 --> 01:20:03.852
of theta hat is 0.

01:20:03.852 --> 01:20:07.900
So this entire thing is equal 0.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:12.200
So now when I actually collect
back my quadratic terms--

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.980
my two squared terms
in this expansion--

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:18.650
what I get is that
the expectation

01:20:18.650 --> 01:20:21.800
of theta hat minus
theta squared is

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:26.450
equal to the expectation of
theta hat minus expectation

01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:32.220
of theta hat squared plus
the square of expectation

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:35.650
of theta hat minus theta.

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:41.190
Right?

01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:42.600
So those are just the two--

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:46.560
the first and the last term
of the previous equality?

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.690
Now, here I have the
expectation of the square

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:50.481
of the difference
between a random variable

01:20:50.481 --> 01:20:52.440
and its expectation.

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.100
This is otherwise known
as the variance, right?

01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:03.660
So this is actually equal to
the variance of theta hat.

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.690
And well, this was the bias.

01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:07.200
We already said that's there.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.385
So this whole thing
is the bias square.

01:21:12.531 --> 01:21:13.030
OK?

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:15.550
And hence the quadratic
term is the sum

01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:18.010
of the variance and
the squared bias.

01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:18.940
Why squared bias?

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.130
Well, because otherwise,
you would add dollars

01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:22.799
in dollars squared.

01:21:22.799 --> 01:21:24.715
So you need to add dollars
squared and dollars

01:21:24.715 --> 01:21:27.870
squared so that this thing
is actually homogeneous.

01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:30.910
So if x is in dollars, then
the bias is in dollars,

01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:32.870
but the variance is
in dollars squared.

01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:35.036
OK, and the square here
forced you to put everything

01:21:35.036 --> 01:21:36.150
on the square scale.

01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:39.190
All right, so what's nice is
that if the quadratic risk goes

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:42.820
to 0, then since I have the
sum of two positive terms,

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:45.040
both of them have to go to 0.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.930
That means that my
variance is going to 0--

01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:48.790
very little fluctuations.

01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:51.580
And my bias is also going to 0,
which means that I'm actually

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.260
going to be on
target once I reduce

01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:55.450
my fluctuations, because
it's one thing to reduce

01:21:55.450 --> 01:21:56.732
the fluctuations.

01:21:56.732 --> 01:21:58.690
But if I'm not on target,
it's an issue, right?

01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:03.422
For example, the estimator for
the value 4 has no variance.

01:22:03.422 --> 01:22:05.380
Every time I'm going to
repeat the experiments,

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:07.510
I'm going to get 4, 4, 4, 4--

01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:08.890
variance is 0.

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.390
But the bias is bad.

01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:12.880
The bias is 4 minus theta.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:17.140
And if theta is far from 4,
that's not doing very well.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:21.420
OK, so next week, we will--

01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:25.060
we'll talk about what
is a good estimate--

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.740
how estimators
change if they have

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:32.440
high variance or low variance
or high bias and low bias.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:35.640
And we'll talk about
confidence intervals as well.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.990
PROFESSOR: ih bar
d psi dt equal E

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:19.890
psi where E hat is equal to p
squared over 2m, the operator.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.800
That is the
Schrodinger equation.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
The free particle
Schrodinger equation--

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.910
you should realize it's
the same thing as this.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.060
Because p is h bar over i ddx.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:43.151
And now Schrodinger did the
kind of obvious thing to do.

00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:49.170
He said, well, suppose I have a
particle moving in a potential,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.770
a potential V of x and t--

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.740
potential.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.905
Then the total energy is kinetic
energy plus potential energy.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:17.710
So how about if we think of
the total energy operator.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.280
And here is a guess.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.480
We'll put the just p squared
over 2m, what we had before.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.310
That's the kinetic
energy of a particle.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:39.680
But now add plus V of
x and t, the potential.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.040
That is reasonable from
your classical intuition.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.760
The total energy
is the sum of them.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.980
But it's going to change
the Schrodinger equation

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.150
quite substantially.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:58.500
Now, most people,
instead of calling this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.350
the energy operator,
which is a good name,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.750
have decided to call
this the Hamiltonian.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.850
So that's the most popular
name for this thing.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.260
This is called
the Hamiltonian H.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.230
And in classical
mechanics, the Hamiltonian

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.160
represents the energy
expressed in terms

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.580
of position and momenta.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.960
That's what the
Hamiltonian is, and that's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.080
roughly what we have here.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.050
The energy is [? in ?]
[? terms ?] [? of ?] momenta

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.470
and position.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.970
And we're going to soon
be getting to the position

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.900
operator, therefore.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.770
So this is going to
be the Hamiltonian.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.430
And we'll put the hat as well.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.450
So Schrodinger's
inspiration is to say, well,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.850
this is going to be H hat.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:05.860
And I'm going to say that ih bar
d psi dt is equal to H hat psi.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:14.770
Or equivalently, ih bar ddt
of psi of x and t is equal

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.980
to minus h squared over
2m, [? v ?] [? second ?] dx

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.890
squared--

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.000
that's the p squared over 2m--

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.090
plus V of x and t,
all multiplying psi.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.890
This is it.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.305
This is the full
Schrodinger equation.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.810
So it's a very simple departure.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.430
You see, when you
discover the show

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.240
that the equation for a free
particle, adding the energy

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.440
was not that difficult. Adding
the potential energy was OK.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.590
We just have to interpret this.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.845
And maybe it sounds to
you a little surprising

00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:13.310
that you multiply this by psi.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.570
But that's the only way it could
be to be a linear equation.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.360
It cannot be that psi is
acted by this derivative,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.930
but then you add v.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.400
It would not be a
linear equation.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.700
And we've realize that the
structure of the Schrodinger

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:37.990
equation is d psi dt is equal
to an energy operator times psi.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.390
The whole game of
quantum mechanics

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.800
is inventing energy
operators, and then solving

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.630
these equations, then
see what they are.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.500
So in particular, you
could invent a potential

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.040
and find the equations.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.130
And, you see, it looks funny.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.640
You've made a very
simple generalization.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.000
And now you have an equation.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.710
And now you can put the
potential for the hydrogen atom

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.290
and calculate, and
see if it works.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.280
And it does.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.300
So it's rather unbelievable
how very simple generalizations

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.610
suddenly produce
an equation that

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.610
has the full spectrum
of the hydrogen atom.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.540
It has square wells, barrier
penetration, everything.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.080
All kinds of dynamics
is in that equation.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.410
So we're going to say a few more
things about this equation now.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:42.120
And I want you to understand
that the V, at this moment,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.490
can be thought as an operator.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.660
This is an operator,
acts on a wave

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.270
function to give you a function.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.400
This is a simpler operator.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.520
It's a function of x and t.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.370
And multiplying by a
function of x and t gives you

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.870
a function of x and t.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.780
So it is an operator.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.110
Multiplying by a given
function is an operator.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.250
It changes all the functions.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.060
But it's a very simple one.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.780
And that's OK, but
V of x and t should

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:23.740
be thought as an operator.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.590
So, in fact, numbers
can be operator.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.760
Multiplication by a
number is an operator.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.770
It adds on every function and
multiplies it by a number,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.890
so it's also an operator.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.800
But x has showed up.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.800
So it's a good time to
try to figure out what

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.620
x has to do with these things.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.240
So that's what we're
going to do now.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.070
Let's see what's x
have to do with things.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.640
OK, so functions
of x, V of x and t

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.500
multiplied by wave functions,
and you think of it

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.540
as an operator.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.020
So let's make this formal.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:35.550
Introduce an operator,
X hat, which,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:59.380
acting on functions of
x, multiplies them by x.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.580
So the idea is that if you
have the operator X hat acting

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.580
on the function f
of x, it gives you

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.890
another function, which is
the function x times f of x--

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.990
multiplies by x.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.330
And you say, wow,
well, why do you

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.980
have to be so careful in
writing something so obvious?

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.450
Well, it's a good
idea to do that,

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.020
because otherwise
you may not quite

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.750
realize there's something
very interesting happening

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.870
with momentum and
position at the same time,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.880
as we will discover now.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.860
So we have already
found some operators.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:54.070
We have operators
P, x, Hamiltonian,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.430
which is p squared over 2m.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:03.090
And now you could
put V of x hat t.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:09.180
You know, if here you
put V of x hat, anyway,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.510
whatever x hat does
is multiplied by x.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.120
So putting V of x hat here--

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.790
you may want to do
it, but it's optional.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.000
I think we all know
what we mean by this.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.430
We're just multiplying
by a function of x.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.500
Now when you have operators,
operators act on wave functions

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.510
and give you things.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.650
And we mentioned that
operators are associated

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.400
or analogs of matrices.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.730
And there's one fundamental
property of matrices.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.060
The order in which you multiply
them makes a difference.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:54.880
So we've introduced
two operators, p and x.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.250
And we could ask whether
the order of multiplication

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.270
matters or not.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:06.740
And this is the way Heisenberg
was lead to quantum mechanics.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.030
Schrodinger wrote
the wave equation.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.620
Heisenberg looked at operators
and commutation relations

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.400
between them.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.070
And it's another way of
thinking of quantum mechanics

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.610
that we'll use.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:24.990
So I want to ask the question,
that if you have p and x

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.680
and you have two operators
acting on a wave function,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.420
does the order matter,
or it doesn't matter?

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.180
We need to know that.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.170
This is the basic
relation between p and x.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.150
So what is the question?

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.315
The question is, if I have--

00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:47.470
I'll show it like that--

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:53.660
x and p acting on a
wave function, phi,

00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:04.260
minus px acting on a wave
function, do I get 0?

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.350
Do I get the same result or not?

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.030
This is our question.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.510
We need to understand
these two operators

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.820
and see how they are related.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.120
So this is a very good question.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.130
So let's do that computation.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.850
It's, again, one of
those computation that

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.250
is straightforward.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.580
But you have to be careful,
because at every stage,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.840
you have to know very
well what you're doing.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.400
So if you have two
operators like a and b

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.250
acting on a function,
the meaning of this

00:11:52.250 --> 00:12:01.450
is that you have a acting on
what b acting on phi gives you.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.600
That's what it means to
have two things acting.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.520
Your first act with
the thing on the right.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.630
You then act on the other one.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.210
So let's look at this thing--

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:18.820
xp phi minus px phi.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.620
So for the first
one, you would have

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:34.215
x times p hat on phi minus p hat
times x on phi, phi of x and t

00:12:34.215 --> 00:12:35.670
maybe--

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.061
phi of x and t.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:46.160
OK, now what do we have?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.850
We have x hat acting on this.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.100
And this thing, we
already know what it is--

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.160
h over i ddx of phi of x and t--

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:06.970
minus p hat and
x, acting on phi,

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:12.562
is little x phi of x and t.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:22.050
Now this is already a
function of x and t.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.660
So an x on it will
multiply it by x.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:36.440
So this will be h
over i x ddx of phi.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.180
It just multiplies it
by x at this moment--

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:47.766
minus here we have h
bar over i ddx of x phi.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:58.550
And now you see that when
this derivative acts on phi,

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.560
you get a term
that cancels this.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.630
But when it acts on x, it
gives you an extra term. ddx

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.810
of x is minus h over i phi--

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.590
or ih phi.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.630
So the derivative
acts on x or an phi.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.600
When it acts on phi,
gives you this term.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.910
When it acts on x, gives you
the thing that is left over.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:37.380
So actually, let me write
this in a more clear way.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.630
If you have an operator,
a linear operator A

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:50.910
plus B acting on a function
phi, that's A phi plus B phi.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.640
You have linear
operators like that.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.520
And we have these things here.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:03.560
So this is actually equal
to x hat p hat minus p hat

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.570
x hat on phi.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:21.540
That's what it means when
you have operators here.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.940
So look what we got, a
very surprising thing.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.060
xp minus px is an operator.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.830
It wants to act on function.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.730
So we put a function
here to evaluate it.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.870
And that was good.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:41.410
And when we evaluate it, we got
a number times this function.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.810
So I could say--

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.295
I could forget about the phi.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:16:02.260
I'm simply right that xp
minus px is equal to ih bar.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.100
And although it looks a little
funny, it's perfectly correct.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:11.780
This is an equality
between operators--

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:17.160
equality between operators.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.960
On the left-hand side, it's
clear that it's an operator.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.800
On the right-hand side,
it's also an operator,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.480
because a number acts as an
operator on any function it

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.370
multiplies by it.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:34.410
So look what you've
discovered, this commutator.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.180
And that's a notation
that we're going

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:43.050
to use throughout this semester,
the notation of the commutator.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.100
Let's introduce it here.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:17:00.700
So if you have two
operators, linear operators,

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.520
we define the commutator
to be the product

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.670
in the first direction minus the
product in the other direction.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:21.400
This is called the
commutator of A and B.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.230
So it's an operator,
again, but it shows you

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:31.090
how they are non-trivial, one
with respect to the other.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.810
This is the basis, eventually,
of the uncertainty principle.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.140
x and p having a
commutator of this type

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.400
leads to the
uncertainty principle.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.760
So what did we learn?

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:49.330
We learned this
rather famous result,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:56.250
that the commutator of x and p
in quantum mechanics is ih bar.

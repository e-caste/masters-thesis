00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.170
This week, we will examine
some more advanced topics

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.970
in the application of
Newton's laws of motion.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.700
First, we will look at more
examples of constrained motion,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.280
where the motion
is forced to obey

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.520
some particular
condition in addition

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.370
to Newton's laws of motion.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.980
These conditions usually specify
some particular relationship

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.380
between coordinates of objects
and the system we are studying.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.960
Specifically, we will
re-examine the case

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.700
of objects suspended
with pulleys and ropes,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.480
but with more complex
systems than we

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.480
have discussed previously.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.620
The fact that the
ropes have fixed length

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.240
will provide a
constraint condition

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.890
relating the coordinates
of our various masses.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.140
Second, we will examine
the case of forces

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.280
acting on a continuous, extended
mass distribution as opposed

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.780
to acting on discrete
point masses.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.240
This will allow us to introduce
a powerful differential

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.500
analysis technique from calculus
where we model continuous mass

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.480
distributions as made up of
lots of small, discrete mass

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.240
elements and then
examine the limiting case

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.620
of infinitesimally
small elements

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.835
to obtain the
continuous behavior.

00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:09.210
This is a technique
that you will

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.390
see applied over and over again
in physics and engineering.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.700
And in fact, we will return to
it again later in this course.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.890
Our specific example will
be to study how tension

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.440
varies in a long, massive rope.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.140
This is in contrast
to the light,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.320
effectively massless ropes
that we discussed previously.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.250
Finally, we will discuss
velocity-dependent forces--

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.759
that is, forces whose strength
depends on the velocity

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.890
or some function of the velocity
of the mass being acted on.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.300
The most common example of this
is resistive forces or drag

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.570
forces, which are caused
by motion of a solid object

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.390
through a fluid,
like air or water.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.770
That is the example we
will discuss this week.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.820
Another example
you may be aware of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.880
is the magnetic force that acts
on a charged particle, which

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.390
depends upon the velocity
of the charged particle.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.860
In all three of these
cases, we will simply

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.470
be applying Newton's
three laws of motion,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.240
but the situations will require
a more sophisticated treatment

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.283
to what has come before.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.660
ADAM MARTIN: So to
start out, I just

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.770
wanted to mention we talk a
lot about dogma in the lab.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.240
So we talk about dogma, right?

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.100
There's the central
dogma, which is DNA.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.910
Information flows from
DNA to RNA to protein.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.630
I'm going to describe
another dogma, if you will,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.740
which is that life starts
as sort of a fertilized egg.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.180
So you get a fertilized egg.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.470
And this fertilized egg, which
you see in the video up here,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.060
undergoes development.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.680
And as part of that
development there

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.860
is what is known
as differentiation,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.940
where cells acquire more
specialized cell types.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.250
So there's development
and differentiation.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.830
And this results in
adult cell types that

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.450
are known as differentiated.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.870
So it results in
differentiated/adult cell types

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.570
with specialized functions.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.260
And you see just a few of
them up on the slide above.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.670
There are, in fact, thousands
of different sort of cell types

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.340
that humans have.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.450
But the dogma, at least
up until fairly recently--

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.620
in the past couple of decades
or so or at least before 1960,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.030
1950s--

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.070
is that this is
you unidirectional,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.760
that basically the development
goes in one direction, where

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.720
you go from the fertilized egg
to the differentiated adult

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.370
cell types.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.570
And so this state down here--

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.180
the differentiated adult cell
types are fairly stable, right?

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.040
I mean, if you look
at your neighbor

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.930
you see they don't
have muscle growing

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.820
on the outside of their bodies.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.060
Their skin cells
stay skin cells.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.440
And that is a
relatively stable state.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.670
OK.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.650
Now, last week you learned
about a contradiction

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:58.190
to the central dogma, which is
the behavior of retroviruses,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.880
which have reverse
transcriptase, which

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.640
can sort of go backwards up this
pathway, where you can get DNA

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.720
from RNA.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.220
OK.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.770
And today, we're going
to talk about how

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.460
you can sort of overcome this
you unidirectional path here.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.880
And this is going to be what
we will call reprogramming.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.860
But first, I want to talk about
this differentiation process

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.380
because it's important
for us to understand this

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.140
before we get into the
reprogramming event.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.840
And so the fertilized egg
is capable of producing all

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.430
of these different cell types.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.390
OK.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.300
So the fertilized egg will
be known as totipotent,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.185
meaning it has the potential
to form all cell types.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.450
And then over
development, this potency

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.350
goes down such that
when cells differentiate

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.080
into their final
adult form there

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.160
is a much more limited
repertoire of cell types

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.100
that the cell can go into.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.870
And one way of
thinking about this

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.830
is that if you think of
this marble run here,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.740
the totipotent state is
right at the top here, right?

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.710
If I put a marble
in the top here,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.580
it has the potential of
going into any of these three

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.290
sort of different fates.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.470
OK.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.060
So this is the totipotent
state up at the top.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.570
And you'll see
these marbles will

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.960
be able to go into any of these
three different states here.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.460
OK.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.820
But you see how that marble
went down on this path.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.250
Some marbles go
down in this path.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.720
And so you can think of cells
going through development

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.130
is sort of getting funneled
into these distinct paths.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.050
And in this case,
it's kind of random.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.680
But in development,
it relies on signaling

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.470
between cells and
interaction between cells

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.985
in the multicellular organism.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.840
So as an example,
I want to tell you

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.390
about early
mammalian development

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.680
and the differentiation
of cell types

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.255
in the early mammalian embryo.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.560
OK.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.312
So we start with an oocyte.

00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:45.910
That's the female gamete.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.500
And the male gamete, the sperm.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.920
So these can come together
to form the zygote.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.810
If I draw a little circle in
the middle, it's a nucleus.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.440
And this zygote is totipotent.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.970
And the embryo undergoes
cleavage divisions,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:16.990
which I'll show here.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.040
You see how that zygote
divided into two cells.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.870
Now it's going to
divide into four.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.185
And it'll keep dividing
till it's 16 probably.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.980
So you get cleavage
divisions that

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.332
generate more than one cell.

00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:37.540
You start with a single cell.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.450
The cleavage divisions give
you more than one cell.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.300
And what you see up
here now is a stage

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.950
known as the blastocyst
or the blastula.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.460
You can see there's a hollow
sort of inner fluid-filled area

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.240
here.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.070
And you see there
are cells around

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.530
that fluid-filled cavity.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.200
And there's a thickening
on one side of the embryo.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.060
OK.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.710
So I'm going to
draw that out here.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.000
Sorry.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.650
Mine is a little flat up here.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.910
It should be
perfectly spherical.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.260
And there is this thickening on
one side of the blastula, which

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.610
is a bunch of cells that
are kind of interior

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.370
on the inside of the embryo.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.375
These cells on the interior are
known as the inner cell mass.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.230
And these cells
are now restricted

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.150
in what they can become.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.815
These cells will become
the embryo proper.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.240
So they'll become
the cell types that

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.520
will be a part of the fetus.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.315
These cells on the outside are
known as the trophoblast cells.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.700
And these cells will form
part of the placenta--

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.340
the embryonic portion
of the placenta.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.690
So they form part
of the placenta.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.780
And they're important
for this embryo

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.690
being able to implant
into the uterine wall.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.550
So if we think about--
this is the first example

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:31.610
of differentiation in the
early mammalian embryo

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.340
because you can see,
based on what I said here,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.600
these cells are
becoming restricted

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.559
in what they can become.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.510
So this is kind of
like the first branch

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.520
point in differentiation.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.590
So we get some more
marbles going down here.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.280
All right.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.250
So this would be the
sort of stage right

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.580
before the blastula,
before differentiation.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.050
And you can see these marbles--

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.010
when I let them, they
will either go this way

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.770
and become one fate, or
they'll go the other way

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:15.220
and be sort of directed
down another potential fate.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.970
There we go.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.100
So this is the first sort of
branch point, if you will,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.190
in fate determination
for the mammalian embryo.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.380
And so this branch point
here is different from this

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.530
because once the marble
goes one way or the other,

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.320
it's restricted in what
fate it can become.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.820
OK.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:44.750
So these cells here
are not totipotent

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.950
because they can't
form the trophoblast.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.580
They can't form the part of the
placenta needed by the embryo.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.160
But they do form
the embryo proper.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.130
So they are still
capable of many fates.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.650
And so these cells are
known as pluripotent, which

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.850
means capable of many things

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.350
OK.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.390
And so a type of
cell type, which

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:19.610
I'm sure you've heard about,
is called Embryonic Stem cells,

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.840
or ES cells.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.890
These ES cells are derived
from the inner cell mass.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.210
So these would be--

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.670
if they were taken
out of the blastula--

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.160
sorry-- this is
called the blastula--

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.390
if they are taken from the
blastula and cultured in vitro,

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.690
these would be sort of
embryonic stem cells

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.470
that can be propagated.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:54.050
And they form the embryo proper,
so these are pluripotent stem

00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:00.680
cells that can basically-- they
are still capable of forming

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.310
sort of any of the cell
types in the embryo--

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:14.450
capable of forming
embryonic cell types.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.090
Now let's look at
the next slide.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.860
So this branch point--

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.280
this first branch point
sort of in development

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.360
is associated with changes
in gene expression.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.900
So there are changes
in gene expression.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.050
And you're seeing one
up on the slide above.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:55.420
The slide above is
a fixed blastula.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.820
And all of the nuclei
in the blastula

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.380
are stained with green.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.460
But there is one gene
that's stained in red.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.240
It's called Oct4.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.520
And this is a
transcription factor that

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.130
marks sort of pluripotency.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.790
And you can see how it's
expressed specifically

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.610
in these cells of the
inner cell mass, which

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:21.160
are what the embryonic stem
cells are derived from.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.340
So there are clearly
changes in gene expression.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.840
And one question you might
have is whether or not

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.210
these cells that are going
to form the embryo proper,

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.150
whether they have lost
information such that they're

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:42.080
unable to form the
part of the placenta.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.870
And you can also ask
this for an adult cell.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:52.450
Has an adult cell in your body--
has it lost gene content such

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:56.590
that it's unable to
make an entire organism?

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.210
I'm going to tell
you the answer.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.250
I want you to think
about what experiment

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.390
would allow you to sort
of determine the answer.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:08.140
But I'm going to tell you the
answer is that there is not

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.030
a loss of gene content.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.270
But this differentiation
process is

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.700
due to changes in
gene expression

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.190
for the vast majority
of our cell types.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.780
So let's say you wanted to
determine whether or not

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.900
a differentiated cell had
lost some sort of capability

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.590
to regenerate an
entire organism.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.410
What might be some type of
experiment you could do?

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.477
Brett.

00:13:45.477 --> 00:13:47.435
AUDIENCE: Creating
conditions that will perhaps

00:13:47.435 --> 00:13:52.660
be similar to what embryonic
stem cells or perhaps

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.730
[INAUDIBLE] factors that
allow for you to change

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.794
the expression back to
more than one impact

00:13:58.794 --> 00:14:01.272
to see if that would
actually change it.

00:14:01.272 --> 00:14:02.230
ADAM MARTIN: All right.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.730
Great.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.530
So Brett had two really
good points, I think.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.670
The first is to try to sort
of reproduce conditions

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.320
of pluripotency.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.710
Or you can even try to reproduce
conditions of totipotency,

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:15.670
right?

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.580
In which case you'd
want to sort of take

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.310
the genetic material
of the somatic cell

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.680
and sort of put it back
in this situation where

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.110
it's present sort of in the
cytoplasm of the zygote.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.660
And the other point
that Brett made

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:37.240
is to try to maybe express
something that would induce

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.180
this type of pluripotent state.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.300
If we knew exactly
what the genes were

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.450
that create this
pluripotent state,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.750
maybe we could just
express those genes

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.590
and regenerate
sort of a cell that

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:59.290
moves from way down here all
the way up to the top again.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.750
And, actually, what
Brett suggested

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.770
were the two experiments that
won these two folks the Nobel

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.980
Prize in 2012.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.600
So in 2012, the Nobel
Prize was awarded jointly

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.400
to Sir John Gurdon, right
here, who incidentally

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.220
has the best hair of all
Nobel laureates, and also

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.550
Shinya Yamanaka.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.940
And so these two folks were
awarded the Nobel Prize

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.220
for being able to show that
mature differentiated cells can

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.620
be reprogrammed to
become pluripotent again,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.340
which basically gives us the
conclusion that there's not

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.950
a loss of gene content during
the differentiation process.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.170
And the work from
Yamanaka showed us

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:57.100
several genes whose expression
is critical to induce

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.000
this type of reprogramming.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.560
And their work
spanned from frogs--

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.030
so John Gurdon worked
on development of frogs,

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.810
specifically Xenopus laevis,
which you've seen before.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:21.290
Shinya Yamanaka's work involved
mice and also human cell lines.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.930
So I'm going to tell you
about their experiments

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.810
and how this-- sort of
demonstrated this conclusion

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.067
here.

00:16:29.067 --> 00:16:30.650
And the first thing
I want to show you

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.430
is an experiment, which is
very simple conceptually.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.980
Technically it's very
complicated, which

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:42.680
is if you were able to take
a nucleus from an adult cell

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.020
that's differentiated,
could you get

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.100
it to change by introducing
it back into the egg

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.780
cell or a zygote cell?

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:01.070
So this experiment
involves having an oocyte,

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:06.470
but in this case an oocyte where
the nucleus has been removed.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.780
So you take an
enucleated oocyte.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.849
And want to know if the
cytoplasm of this oocyte

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:19.220
is somehow special
that would allow

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.819
it to reprogram the nucleus
of a differentiated cell.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.869
And so you could
suck up the nucleus

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.290
of a differentiated cell.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:35.560
So a somatic cell is another
way to say differentiated.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.205
So it's a somatic cell nucleus.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.970
And the experiment
conceptually then

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.970
is to just take this somatic
cell nucleus that you've

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.890
sucked up and inject it into
an oocyte without a nucleus

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.320
and see if the
cytoplasm of this oocyte

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.970
is somehow able to change
the properties of the nucleus

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.000
such that it now is in an
undifferentiated state.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.990
So you generate oocyte now
with the somatic cell nucleus.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.220
And the question is whether
the somatic cell nucleus

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.880
is capable of generating
the diversity of cell types

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.550
that are normally
present in an organism.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.170
So you could then let
this go and develop.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.920
You could let it develop
into a blastula, which

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.730
I'm drawing here.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.540
So you could
generate a blastula.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.990
And this will be a way to get
embryonic stem cells derived

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.870
from sort of this
type of nucleus.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:58.190
But you could also let it
grow into an entire organism.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.260
But this organism
would be genetically

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.570
identical to whatever
organism donated this nucleus.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.210
So because you're
duplicating an organism,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.190
that is known as
reproductive cloning.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:20.930
So this is reproductive
cloning, if you

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.235
go all the way to the organism.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:31.763
I'll show you just a little
video on the nuclear transfer.

00:19:31.763 --> 00:19:32.430
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.140
- You see now that this drilling
pipe head is going to suck--

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.250
drill a little hole
into the membrane.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.823
You can maybe see a little
bit of the hole right

00:19:41.823 --> 00:19:42.740
here at the next part.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.323
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:43.323 --> 00:19:46.077
ADAM MARTIN: He's talking
about this pipette here.

00:19:46.077 --> 00:19:48.410
The embryo is being held with
another pipette over here.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.077
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:49.077 --> 00:19:51.090
- You can see a bit of the hole.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.030
And now the pipette's going to
go in and remove the nucleus.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.910
And if you look
carefully in the pipette,

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.950
you'll see a line in
the nucleus, which are

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.530
all the chromosomes lined up.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.140
So the nucleus is going to be
squirted out now because we

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.470
don't need it anymore.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.140
And then we have
an enucleated egg.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.690
Now, the next step is to take
a set of eggs like that--

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.130
and I'll show you two--

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.980
and then transfer
into them a nucleus

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.200
from another kind of cell, a
fully-differentiated somatic

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.700
cell.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.370
So here, the enucleated
egg is set on the side.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:26.460
And it's held by this
holding pipette on the left.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.870
There's drilling the little
hole in the membrane.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.260
Here we go in.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.080
Here comes the nucleus
from the right.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.380
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.310
ADAM MARTIN: That's
from a somatic zone.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.977
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:34.977 --> 00:20:37.550
- And these pipettes
are operated

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.373
with a piezoelectric device.

00:20:39.373 --> 00:20:40.790
So you can't see
it here, but it's

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.610
like a little jackhammer
going very quickly,

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.000
(TRILLING SOUND) like Woody the
Woodpecker, getting in there.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.583
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:47.583 --> 00:20:49.083
ADAM MARTIN: I don't
know if I would

00:20:49.083 --> 00:20:51.120
have used Woody the
Woodpecker as an analogy,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.710
but that's basically the idea.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.110
So you can take a nucleus
from a somatic cell

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:01.340
and transplant it, if you
will, into an oocyte and then

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:06.380
determine whether you
can get either a blastula

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:13.430
or an entire organism from that
differentiated cell's nucleus.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.030
So this is one result
from Sir John Gurdon.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.710
And what the experiment
was, in this case,

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:27.900
was to take oocytes, or eggs,
from this wild-type laevis frog

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:35.040
and to transplant nuclei from
donor frogs that are albino.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.610
So you can see this is an
elegant experiment in that you

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.160
can sort of track the
origin of the nucleus,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.120
because it's genetically
marked with this albino sort

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.460
of phenotype.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.740
So you're getting
a nuclei from--

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.060
you're getting nuclei
from albino tadpoles.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.060
So these are
differentiated cell nuclei.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.110
And they're transplanted
into wild-type donor eggs.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.540
So normally, the
wild-type frog would

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.380
reproduce frogs that look
like it-- that are non-albino.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.160
But in this experiment,
Gurdon and his lab

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.120
were able to get frogs
that were albino.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:25.310
So these would be sort of clones
of whatever albino tadpoles

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.010
they got the nuclei from.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:32.720
So you see, in this case, it's
the origin of the nucleus that

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.920
is determining sort of the
phenotype of these frogs.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.100
So that allowed them to show
that the nucleus is getting

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.610
reprogrammed from
this albino tadpole

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.180
and is able to still generate
all of the cell types

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.400
present in a normal organism.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:50.900
Yes.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.400
Brett.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.795
AUDIENCE: So this is
an unfertilized egg

00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:55.280
that they were taking from the--

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.330
ADAM MARTIN: Yes.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.742
AUDIENCE: And so they're
extracting all this DNA,

00:22:58.742 --> 00:23:01.732
then putting in a full set
of DNA from the albinos.

00:23:01.732 --> 00:23:02.440
ADAM MARTIN: Yep.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.148
AUDIENCE: It would go
on to differentiate

00:23:04.148 --> 00:23:05.090
a full set of DNA?

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.840
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.830
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.580
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.410
So, yeah, they're--
and actually,

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.610
it was taking unfertilized eggs,
which is the biggest trick.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.290
I think people had tried
to do this in frogs before,

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.850
and it failed because they
were using fertilized eggs.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:24.650
And there's something about sort
of the oocyte development that

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.950
makes it better at
reprogramming the nucleus.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:29.450
OK.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.730
So that's with frogs.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.150
So that experiment was actually
done in the late 1950s,

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.120
published in the early 1960s.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.520
And so it took another 40 years
or so for the first mammal

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.660
to be cloned.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.810
And you guys probably
weren't even born yet.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.460
But for those of
us who are older,

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.080
we remember this
because there was

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.710
a big brouhaha over
Dolly the sheep, which

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.530
was the first cloned mammal.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.925
I believe that's Dolly there.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.850
So this is--

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.590
I'm not sure which one is Dolly.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.550
They're both the
same type of sheep.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.270
So this was done by Ian
Wilmut and his group.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.550
One thing I want to
point out about this

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.460
is it's incredibly inefficient.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.220
If you look over
here, this Dolly

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:27.700
resulted from over
400 oocytes having

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.600
this sort of nuclear
transplant take place.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.610
So it's not a very
efficient process.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.100
And so that lack of
efficiency is due to the fact

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.320
that the nucleus is resisting
getting reprogrammed.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:51.900
And this is a graph from one
of John Gurdon's sort of--

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.600
he wrote a review article
on sort of reprogramming

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.550
after he won the Nobel Prize.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.870
This is from that.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.230
And what's plotted is
sort of the frequency

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.080
in which transfers
results in sort

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.950
of a differentiated organism.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.370
And what's on the
x-axis is the stage

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.970
of the cell that's
used to transplant.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.230
And so what you see is that over
the course of differentiation

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.450
it gets harder and
harder for the nucleus

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:27.790
to get reprogrammed to create
sort of all the cell types that

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:32.670
are normally present
in an adult animal.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.790
So nuclei do become
more restricted

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.360
in their ability to be
reprogrammed over development.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.200
But the fact that any of them
are able to be reprogrammed

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.060
suggests that when they are--

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.030
that during
differentiation there

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.080
is not a loss of gene content.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.560
And John Gurdon has done
a lot to characterize

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.430
sort of the changes
in the nucleus that

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.150
happen during differentiation
which sort of resist

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:06.220
this reprogramming by
the oocyte cytoplasm.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.180
All right.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.910
So mechanistically,
what's happening?

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:20.560
Well, one big--
one of the people

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.970
who really showed what's going
on there is Shinya Yamanaka.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:35.750
And what his work shows is that
you can take just a few genes--

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.810
it turns out it is four--

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.380
and you can induce
reprogramming by just

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:47.380
expressing these four genes in
an adult differentiated cell.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:56.640
So in this case you have
a differentiated cell.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.600
And what he initially used
we're fibroblasts, which are

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.360
a type of differentiated cell.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.940
And what Yamanaka
showed is that you

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.900
can express four
transcription factors, one

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.660
of them being this
factor here, Oct4,

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.380
which is expressed in
the inner cell mass

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.655
and was shown to
be involved in sort

00:27:23.655 --> 00:27:29.700
of maintaining pluripotency of
these inner cell mass cells.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.060
So you could take Oct4 plus
another transcription factor,

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.290
which is important for
pluripotency, plus two

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:45.008
others and c-Myc.

00:27:45.008 --> 00:27:45.800
These are the four.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.320
So these are all
transcription factors.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.930
And what they found is
if you express these four

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:55.550
transcription factors in
a differentiated cell,

00:27:55.550 --> 00:28:01.280
you could get it to revert
to a more pluripotent state.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:12.230
So this results in what is known
as Induced Pluripotent Stem

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:19.010
cells, or IPS cells, for short.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:28.380
And then like
embryonic stem cells,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.930
here these cells can give
rise to different cell types.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:39.030
And so one of the goals of this
field of developmental biology

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:45.720
and cell reprogramming
is to use this technology

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.630
to replace cells that
are lost in patients.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.170
So this is known as
regenerative medicine.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.840
And the idea of the theory
of regenerative medicine

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:15.420
is to take ES cells or
induced pluripotent stem

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:24.840
cells from patients and to be
able to culture them in vitro--

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.205
so culture in vitro--

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.570
and then to be able to
direct these cultured cells

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:40.410
into different
cell fates in order

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:46.020
to use these cells possibly
to transplant them back

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.390
into an individual where maybe
these cell types are dying.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:58.860
So you could then
differentiate these cells using

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.490
certain biochemical signals
that you can add to the media

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.370
in order to create
different cell types,

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:13.200
like neurons,
muscle, maybe skin.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.010
And one example of this was
shown by Shinya Yamanaka, where

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:27.710
what they did was to take
human fibroblast cells,

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.900
put them back in the
pluripotent state

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.840
by expressing
those four factors,

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.270
and then get these
cells to differentiate

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:40.470
into cardiac tissue,
so cardiac cells.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:41.480
Here's a movie.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.160
So these are from
adult fibroblast cells.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.590
But now you can see
they're beating sort

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.380
of like a cardiac tissue would.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:56.940
So these were made into IPS
stem cells, cultured in vitro,

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.310
and then directed into
a cardiac muscle fate.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.650
So the goal would
then to be use these

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:21.620
and to transplant them
back into a patient, such

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.390
that if a patient
had, let's say,

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.600
a neurodegenerative
disease and was lacking

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.700
a certain type of
neuron, you could then

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.170
take cells, start them on the
path to neuronal development,

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.200
and then transplant them
back into that patient.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:42.260
And if these cells are derived
from the DNA of that patient,

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.130
then there won't be
transplant rejection.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.460
Because what regulates
transplant rejection

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:54.530
is the major histocompatiblity
complex locus.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.450
And it's polymorphic.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.810
But if you're taking a
nucleus from the patient

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.110
and then causing the cells
to differentiate in vitro,

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.120
you're taking the exact same--

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.340
you're taking clonal cells
and putting them back

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.380
in the same patient,
such that they

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.765
won't be rejected, ideally.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:16.370
All right.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.390
Now I want to try something
with the remainder of our time.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.070
I want a group--

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.760
all right.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.320
Everyone on this
side of the room

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.530
over, I want you over here.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.880
And everyone on this
side of the room,

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.140
I want you on this
side over here.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.200
OK.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.125
Maybe you guys can go over here
so that we're more balanced.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.860
We're going to have
a little debate.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.240
You can sit down.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:52.760
It's OK.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.150
Be in a position to
talk to each other.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.354
I want you guys
talking to each other.

00:33:04.354 --> 00:33:07.060
That was the goal of
putting you close together.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:07.560
OK.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.480
So in the past
couple weeks, there's

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.200
been a little bit of
a stir because there's

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.800
a researcher in China who
has claimed to have made

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.470
the first gene-edited baby.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.570
Perhaps you have heard of this.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.630
You probably have because
it's been all over the news.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.580
So I want you guys--

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.970
let's see.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:34.360
I want us to debate
whether we should--

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.990
what are the advantages
or disadvantages

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.750
of gene editing
or human cloning.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.420
You could talk about both.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.960
And then I want you guys to
be able to present them to me.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.690
I'll write them down, and we'll
have a discussion about it.

00:33:56.799 --> 00:34:00.220
Guys, continue this discussion
sort of outside class.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.720
I think it's really interesting.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.670
And it's going to be
something that you're

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.710
going to hear a lot about in
the coming years, I'm sure.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.580
So we're now beginning to
make our complete study

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.070
of rigid body motions
about fixed axis.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.460
Let's consider something
like a bicycle wheel.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.460
Here's the center of
mass of the wheel.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.320
And our bicycle wheel--
the center of mass

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.880
has some velocity.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.120
And here's ground.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.070
And the reference frame
is the ground frame.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.790
Now if the bicycle
wheel is rolling,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.130
then there will be some type of
rotational motion of the wheel.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.520
So you can imagine a point
on the rim is rotating.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.280
And so what we have here
is a angular velocity

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.250
of this bicycle,
which we'll write

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.200
like this, our vector omega.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.680
And we'll use our
right hand rule

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.890
to establish that
direction for omega.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.550
And now in this
reference frame, we

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.210
have translational motion
of the center of mass.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.530
And we have rotational motion
around the center of mass.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:14.260
If we go to the center
of mass reference frame--

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.730
so if you want just a
little cartoon to show that,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.010
here's your observer.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.430
And your observer
is moving with VCM.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.360
And so in that frame, the
center of mass is at rest,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.759
and the only thing
we have is rotation

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.300
about the center of mass.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.890
And so in this
picture, our motivation

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.800
will be that the total external
force causes the center of mass

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.240
to accelerate.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.660
And that's how we can figure
out the center of mass motion.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.430
And in this picture,
we no longer

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.190
have to consider
translational motion.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.830
And what we'll study
and learn to analyze

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.080
is just pure rotation
about the center of mass--

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.960
so torque will produce
angular acceleration.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.320
We can talk about
the rotational energy

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.690
about the center of mass.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.800
And so we'll begin our
analysis of rotational motion

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.810
of translation and rotation
by focusing our interest

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.790
in the center of mass
frame-- so we've just

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.690
isolated the rotational motion.

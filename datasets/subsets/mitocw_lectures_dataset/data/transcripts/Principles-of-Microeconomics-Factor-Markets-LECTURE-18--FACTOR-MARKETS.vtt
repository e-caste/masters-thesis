00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:29.230
PROFESSOR: OK, so what we're
going to do today is the last

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.780
in what I'd say are the
core set of lectures.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.910
Our core set of lectures,
we started with

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.170
talking about the market.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.466
We then moved on and talked
about consumer theory and did

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.130
a series of lectures on that.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.340
Now we're doing producer
theory.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.070
This is the last in our series
of lectures on producer theory

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.110
and then basically we
move on to topics.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.020
So the remainder of the section
we'll talk about

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.480
things like international trade,
uncertainty, equity and

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.920
efficiency, asymmetric
information

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.610
in insurance markets.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.980
We'll move on to in the last
part of the course showing you

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.855
how you can apply what we've
learned in the basics to

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.250
answer a bunch of interesting,
real world questions.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.450
So this is the last of our
core basics lectures.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.040
What we're going to do here is
fit in something that's fallen

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.150
through the cracks, which is
we've talked about firms and

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.700
their decisions about
how much to produce.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.820
And we've talked about
the output side.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.250
But we haven't talked about
the input side at all.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.070
How do firms decide what kind
of the inputs to use and in

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.230
what ratio to use et cetera.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.560
We talked a bit about it.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.350
We talked about isoquants and
isocosts and doing that

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.800
tradeoff between inputs.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.160
We haven't really talked about
the input markets themselves.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.940
So firms go and they say, look
I've done my isoquants and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.200
isocosts and I want
63 workers.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.960
Well they've then got to go to
a market for labor and hire

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.340
those workers and how does
that actually work.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.830
So today what we want to
focus on is the demand

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.760
side of input markets.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.520
That is, what's the actual
market analysis by which a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.640
firm having maximized its
profits and deciding how many

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.940
workers it wants goes and
actually finds those workers.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.470
So we're going to do is talk
about demand for factors.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.670
In particular today we'll focus
on the demand for labor.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.530
Although the demand for capital,
the analysis will be

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.789
very similar.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.460
But today we're going to focus
on the demand for labor.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.490
And what we're going to do is
begin by focusing on the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.540
demand for labor in a
competitive factor market.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.160
So we're going to begin by
talking about competitive

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.410
factor markets.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.890
What I mean by that is that a
perfectly competitive factor

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.320
market is one where, just as
perfect competition and output

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.260
markets means there's lots of
sellers selling the same good,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.710
a perfectly competitive factor
market means there's lots of

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.790
sellers, in this case workers,
selling an identical good.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.000
That is their labor.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.230
So the notion is we're in a
market where there's many,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.770
many workers firms could hire,
all of whom are equally

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.640
qualified for a job.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.310
So this is not, obviously,
a high-tech market.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.740
This is some low-tech,
construction, other sort of

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.630
blue collar market, where
there's lots of workers out

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.930
there who could equally well
be qualified for a job.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.280
In fact what we're going to
assume is that there's a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.100
perfectly flat labor
supply curve.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.040
Let's assume a perfectly flat
labor supply curve.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.720
Perfectly elastic labor supply
just to make life easy.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.140
Obviously it's not
true in reality.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.770
Let's assume we're looking at
some market with perfectly

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.320
elastic labor supply.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.090
Now how do we think about what
happens in factor markets in

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.520
that world?

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.290
Well once again let's start
with the short run.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.040
So in the short run
capital's fixed.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.520
So a firm has said, look, I've
done my short run profit

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.780
maximization, my isoquants
and isocosts.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.790
I've decided how many workers
I want given a

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.310
fixed level of capital.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.210
And that gives me some
demand for labor.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.130
I can derive a demand for labor
curve by essentially

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.270
saying, at different wage rates,
given a fixed capital

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.620
price, that will shift my
isocost curve, going back to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.269
the producer theory, at
different wage rates that will

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.769
shift my isocost curve, that
will cause me to demand

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.670
different amounts of labor.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.830
So that traces out a demand
curve for labor.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.550
And we can see that graphically
in figure 18-1.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.920
So you've got a perfectly
elastic labor supply curve and

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.870
then you've got a downward
sloping labor demand curve.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.060
And that labor demand curve
comes from the profit

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.330
maximization.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.190
The other way to think about
how we get there though is

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.590
interesting.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.100
You say, how do we think about
the marginal benefit versus

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.595
the marginal cost of hiring
another worker.

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:58.150
We know the marginal cost is
the wage, that's easy.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.590
What's the marginal benefit
of hiring another worker?

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.150
Well recall that another unit of
labor raises output by the

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.100
marginal product of labor.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.420
Remember the marginal
product of labor.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.120
We talked about this
a while ago.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.690
This is delta q delta l.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.310
So the next worker raises your
output by an amount marginal

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.940
product of labor.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.190
That's what you get from
the next worker.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.820
But that's a quantity.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.380
The firm cares about profit
not quantity.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.480
So what it cares about
is revenues.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.190
So the revenues from the next
worker would be the marginal

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.860
revenues that are made on that
next unit times the marginal

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.430
product of labor.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.290
That's the marginal benefit to
the firm of the next unit of

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.240
labor is the marginal product
that that worker produces

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.630
times the marginal revenue
the firm raises from

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.970
selling that next unit.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.370
So they have to consider two
things, two margins.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.910
How much is it worth them to
sell that next unit and how

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.540
much will be produced by that
next unit of worker?

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:26.100
So if we have a perfectly
competitive labor market, the

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.740
marginal cost is going
to be the wage.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.640
So we're going to set this
equal to the wage.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.640
So in a perfectly competitive
labor market the marginal cost

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.140
of another worker is the wage
and this is the marginal

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.520
benefit of another worker.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.630
So this is going to be the
condition the firm's going to

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.240
use to decide how many
workers to hire.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.570
We're going to call
this the marginal

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.340
revenue product of labor.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.260
So you're going to set the
marginal revenue product of

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.430
labor equal to the wage.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.400
That's going to be your profit
maximizing condition--

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.760
the marginal revenue product.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.040
The marginal product is
about quantities.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.990
Marginal revenue product
is about dollars.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.900
What's the dollars that the next
unit of labor produces

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.390
for you is your marginal
revenue product.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:15.310
Now if the output market is also
perfectly competitive.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.720
That is, imagine for a minute
now, take one further step.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.175
Not a perfectly competitive
labor supply but also a

00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:23.620
perfectly competitive
output market.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.740
So it's not a monopolist. It's
selling in a perfectly

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.620
competitive output market.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.780
Then we know what the
marginal revenue is.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.310
We know the marginal revenue
is the price.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:37.860
So for a perfectly competitive
output market we could rewrite

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.570
this as price times marginal
product of

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.810
labor equals the wage.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.620
Because we know the marginal
revenue is the price in a

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.920
perfectly competitive
output market.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.710
And basically this makes it even
easier to see which is to

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.740
say, look, how many workers
do you hire?

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.610
You hire until the wage you pay
that worker is equal to

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.540
the price you sell your good for
times how many goods that

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.790
worker produces.

00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:10.190
If one worker produces 100 goods
and each good sells for

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.430
100, then you'll only pay
the worker $10,000.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.725
Basically that is going
to determine your

00:08:19.725 --> 00:08:20.870
labor demand curve.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:26.150
And so the labor demand curve
is also labeled the marginal

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.540
revenue product of labor
curve, I'm sorry.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.355
Why is this diminishing?

00:08:32.355 --> 00:08:33.650
Why is it downward sloping?

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.820
Because remember the marginal
product of labor's

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.380
diminishing.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.830
The marginal product of
labor's diminishing.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:45.050
As a result this curve
is downward sloping.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.910
Now here price is fixed,
so it doesn't matter.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.980
Marginal revenue also is
diminishing so that's going to

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.950
make it even more downward
sloping than the

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.060
more general case.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.370
But in this specific case of
perfectly competitive output

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.140
markets where this is just a
constant price you get this

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.760
downward sloping marginal
revenue product of labor curve

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.770
because the marginal product of
labor is diminishing, as we

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.020
talked about.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.240
So that's the analysis of what
we see for a perfectly

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.320
competitive factor market.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.610
So the equilibrium is where the
labor supply curve, which

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.480
is perfectly elastic, intersects
this marginal

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.870
revenue product curve, which
is determined by how

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.880
productive the workers are and
how much money they're making

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.520
for you with each unit
they produce.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.770
And that gets you the short
run equilibrium.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.290
Questions about that?

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.460
Questions about what
we're doing here?

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.500
So that just says the underlying
analysis of where

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.780
demand for labor comes from or
where the equilibrium level of

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.480
labor is going to come.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.470
It's going to come from
intersection of this demand

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.080
with the supply,
which is flat.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.620
Now how is this going to
differ in the long run?

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.730
Well let me ask the question
this way, forget the math,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.810
forget the graphs, I'm just
going to ask you intuitively.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:09.100
In the long run, do we think
the long run demand for

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.790
workers will be more elastic or
less elastic than the short

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.020
run demand, in general.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.080
Will the long run demand curve,
this is short run

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.500
demand curve, will the long run
demand curve typically be

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.690
more elastic or less elastic
than the short run demand

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.240
curve for workers?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.830
Somebody take a guess.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.524
Yeah.

00:10:27.524 --> 00:10:28.736
AUDIENCE: More elastic.

00:10:28.736 --> 00:10:29.690
PROFESSOR: More elastic.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.940
Why?

00:10:33.142 --> 00:10:34.380
It's more elastic.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.767
But intuitively, don't worry
about the graph, I'm just

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:36.320
looking for intuition.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.615
Yeah.

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:38.006
AUDIENCE: Because in
the long run you

00:10:38.006 --> 00:10:38.790
can substitute capital.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.960
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.960
More substitutability equals
more elasticity.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.380
General intuition you want to
remember for this course.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.820
In the long run if I can
substitute towards capital,

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.360
then that long run demand curve
for labor will be even

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.140
more elastic than the short
run demand curve.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.470
I'm not going to work through
the math or anything.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:59.960
I just want you to remember that
intuition that when you

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.790
have more margins you can use,
that's more substitutability,

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.040
that means more elasticity.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.810
So the idea is in the short run,
if the wage increases for

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.850
workers all you can do is if
you hire fewer workers you

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.270
just produce less, so you're
sort of stuck.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.140
But in the long run if the wage
decreases you just say,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.640
fine, I'll just use
machines instead.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.590
So in the long run you can
substitute away from workers

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.010
towards machines.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.910
So in the long run your
demand curve is

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.160
going to be more elastic.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.710
Questions about that?

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.590
Now this is all relatively
straightforward, just follows

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.540
from producer theory.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.470
The sort of stuff you had to
do in the exam last night.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.540
Let's now talk about a little
more interesting case which is

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.310
one of my other favorite words
in economics which is the case

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.970
of monopsony.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.410
Not monopoly, but monopsony.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.270
We've been talking in lectures
about monopoly which is the

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.700
case where one firm
is the only seller

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.230
in the output market.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.490
One firm is the only seller
in the output market.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.780
A parallel case in input
markets is the case of

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:22.230
monopsony which is when one firm
is the only demander in

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.040
the input market.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.050
So monopoly is when one firm
is the only seller in the

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.160
output market.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.120
The parallel in input markets
is monopsony which is where

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.330
one firm is the only buyer
in the input market.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:46.010
And the key thing that's going
to drive monopsony is that

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:52.930
when there are barriers to exit
from a factor market it's

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.400
going to create a monopsony.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.440
And any time there are barriers
to exit, any time

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.960
workers are stuck and cannot
leave a market, workers are

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.750
stuck working one place, that
will give the employer market

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.560
power over those workers.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.490
The classic example is
the company town.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.510
In the 1800s when there were
mining operations and they'd

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.740
come in and they'd
hire people.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.940
And basically there
was nowhere else

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.700
to work in the area.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.695
These were areas which were
dying agricultural areas there

00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:21.910
was nowhere else to work.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.460
You'd go work for the
mining company.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.940
That mining company had
tremendous monopsony power

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.900
over you because basically there
was nowhere else to work

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.740
within a decent area.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.490
There weren't cars yet.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.200
You couldn't just commute
to somewhere else.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.920
A modern example is MIT's
monopsony power over me.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.930
MIT has monopsony
power over me.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.940
Why is that?

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.420
Well that's because my life's
pretty comfortable now.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.050
I'm in a house I've lived
in a long time.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.260
My kids are in schools I like.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.880
I've got a lot of friends.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.720
It'd be a real pain in the
ass for me to move.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.840
And as a result MIT has some,
not unlimited, don't tell

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.410
them, but they have some
monopsony power over me

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.970
because they know that that's
a barrier to my exit.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.480
To my exiting MIT a barrier
is that I'm very

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.830
comfortable and satisfied.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:15.030
And given the nature tenets of
psychology, it is harder to

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.180
move someone with a pull
than with the push.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.200
So someone could come and try
to pull me away, but they're

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.910
going to have to blow me
away with an offer--

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.490
once again, don't
tell MIT this--

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.490
they'll have to blow
me away an offer

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.490
because I'm pretty satisfied.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.760
And that satisfaction inherently
gives MIT some

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.220
monopsony power over me.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.720
Now the question is what
implications does this have.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.140
And the implications are
quite interesting.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.630
And what they are is a
complicated flip of the

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.330
monopoly case.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.760
Let's look at figure 18-2.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.460
Here's an example of
a company town.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.000
Now let's imagine a labor market
where you've got some

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.260
labor demand curve, the marginal
revenue product of

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.530
labor, MRPL, and some
labor supply curve.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.480
And now labor supply
is upward sloping.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.930
This is a not a perfectly
competitive labor market now.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.560
This labor supply is
now upward sloping.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.800
So the demand curve for
labor we're going to

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.790
say is 60 minus l.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.740
So in our example the marginal
revenue product of labor is

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.690
going to be 60 minus l.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.140
The notion is you have some
downward sloping demand curve

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.105
for labor because of diminishing
marginal product.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.270
The wage you're willing to pay
is diminishing in the number

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:41.800
of workers.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.050
To get that first worker
you'll pay a high wage,

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.310
because you got to produce
something.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.030
But as you hire more workers
the wage you're

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.140
willing to pay falls.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.640
So the demand curve is
downward sloping.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.490
And let's say that our labor
supply curve is that the

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.230
amount of labor workers are
willing to supply is

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.680
the wage over 2.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.950
I'm just making this up.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.080
These are just made up numbers
just to make the math work.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.590
So this is it just an upward
sloping labor supply curve.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.460
A higher wage calls
forth more labor.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:16.110
So let's ask what happens
in the competitive case.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.820
Well in the competitive case
you set the supply equal to

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.590
the demand.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:24.860
Well supply is that firms are
going to set the wage equals

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.170
60 minus l.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.850
Labor supply is l
equals w over 2.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.790
So we could just have two
equations and two unknowns we

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.050
can solve and get that the
amount of labor supplied in

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.520
the competitive case
is 20 units.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.320
20 hours, 20 days,
weeks, whatever.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.600
20 units.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.280
That's the competitive
outcome.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:54.060
And the wage we can read off
the labor supply curve.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.980
If they're going to supply 20
units, they're going to need a

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.030
wage of 40.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.520
So once again we can read that
off the labor supply or the

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.440
labor demand curve if there's
going to be 20 workers the

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.700
wage is going to be 40.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.089
So the wage, labor competitive
and the wage

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.260
competitive is 40.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.740
So in a competitive market with
this demand and supply

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.170
curve you should know by now you
just set them equal, you

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:21.630
solve, you get an outcome
of 20 workers

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.930
working a wage of 40.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.869
Now let's imagine this isn't
the competitive case.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.359
Let's imagine it's the
monopsony case.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.140
Let's imagine this firm
has monopsony power.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.020
Workers can't exit.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.830
And let's further assume that
the firm cannot wage

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.110
discriminate.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.760
Just as we talked about
monopolists that couldn't

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.900
price discriminate, we're going
to talk about a firm

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.280
they can't wage discriminate.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.870
It has to pay one wage to
all of its workers.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.400
And we'll come back once again
with this assumption.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.800
Just as we talked about price
discrimination we'll come back

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.220
and talk about wage
discrimination.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.740
But for now assume a non-wage
discriminating monopsonist.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.500
They have to pay one wage
to all their workers.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:04.470
Well what that means is just as
when a monopolist wanted to

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.020
sell more goods it had to
lower the price, if a

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.270
monopsonist wants to hire
more workers it has

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.150
to raise the wage.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.810
Parallel thing.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.950
Just as the monopolist had to
lower the price to sell more

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.730
units because it had to respect
the demand curve, a

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.460
monopsonist if it wants to hire
more workers has to raise

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.440
the wage because it has to
respect the supply curve--

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.270
parallel.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:32.000
And what this will do is that
will lead them to under hire

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.920
workers ct too low a wage.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.460
Just as monopoly led firms to
under produce at too high a

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.550
price, monopsony will
lead to under hiring

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.660
at too high a wage.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.220
So once again, to think about
this, let's think about the

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.460
firm's decision to hire
an extra worker.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.020
What is the firm's total
expenditure on labor?

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.170
Its expenditure on labor is the
wage, which is a function

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.640
of the amount of labor, times
the amount of labor.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.430
That's the expenditure
on labor.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:08.230
So its marginal expenditure, if
you take the derivative, is

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:16.050
going to be w plus
dw/dl times l.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.300
That's its marginal
expenditure.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.040
If you want to hire an
additional worker what's the

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.270
marginal cost.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.510
Well I want to hire
an additional

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.000
worker, what's the cost?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.050
I've got a pay him w and to hire
him I have to raise the

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:36.040
wage, so I have to pay all my
previous workers more as well.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.770
So to hire one more worker I've
got to pay that worker a

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.120
wage and in order to entice
him I've got to raise the

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.850
wage, which means I've got to
pay a higher wage to all my

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.040
previous workers too.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.680
Once again, remember, I
have to pay one wage.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.610
So if I'm going to hire that
worker there is the same

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.240
poisoning effect that we
saw with monopolists.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.390
With monopolists the poisoning
effect was if I want to sell

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.350
one more unit I'm going to have
to undercut my price on

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.150
all previous units.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.622
For a monopsonist, if I want to
hire one more worker I have

00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:09.160
to pay all my previous
workers more.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.330
And that's going to mean that
there's a poisoning effective

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.220
in reverse.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.350
That's going to cost me
a lot of money to

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.140
hire that extra worker.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.870
So we can actually derive now
a marginal expenditure curve

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.100
just as we derived a marginal
revenue curve for the

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.310
monopolist.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:28.040
The marginal expenditure
curve.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:33.010
So we know expenditure
is w of l times l.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:42.090
And we know from the supply
curve, we can rewrite this as

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.960
w equals 2l.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.980
So that says that the
expenditure on

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:51.170
labor is 2l times l.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:55.240
So plugging in from the supply
curve the expenditure on labor

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.750
is 2l times l.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.880
Its wage is a function
of labor times labor.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.930
So 2l times l.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:06.030
So that means that marginal
expenditure is 4l.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.240
The marginal expenditure
is 4l.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.430
So we can now draw a marginal
expenditure curve that's

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.980
steeper than the labor
supply curve.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.280
Once again it's confusing
but it's all parallel.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.570
It's just we're flipping
everything around from

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.620
monopolist. Instead of drawing
that marginal revenue curve

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.160
that was steeper than the
product demand curve, now

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.600
we're drawing a marginal
expenditure curve which is

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.920
steeper than the labor
supply curve.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.150
And once again to find the
outcome we'll find the

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.010
intersection of that marginal
expenditure curve with

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.910
marginal cost.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.760
Well here we'll find the
intersection of marginal

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.700
expenditure curve, I'm sorry,
with labor demand.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.510
I'm sorry, so the parallel was
we found the intersection of

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.070
marginal revenue with marginal
cost. Now find the

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.030
intersection of marginal
expenditure with labor demand.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:57.280
That intersection is going
to happen at 12 workers.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.360
So the firm is going
to hire 12 workers.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.960
But what ways you're going to
pay-- once again our first

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.390
temptation is to look at that
high intersection and say,

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.260
well at that intersection
what's the wage.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.140
We didn't put that on the
diagram for a reason.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.160
Maybe we should have
to throw you off.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.570
Remember, to figure out the wage
you've got to respect the

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.820
labor supply curve.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.180
Just like you have to respect
the product demand curve to

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.480
figure out the price.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.050
So what's the wage when I hire
12 workers they pay 24.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:28.180
So the monopsonist is going to
hire 12 workers and pay 24.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.860
It's going to hire the number
of workers where marginal

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.620
expenditure equals
the labor demand.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.970
That's going to determine
the quantity.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.480
And the wage they're going
to read off the

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.730
labor supply curve.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.710
And as a result this firm is
going to under hire at too low

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.110
a wage relative to the
perfect competition.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.540
Relative to the competition
they're going to hire fewer

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.215
workers at a lower wage.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.380
So if you think about this,
let's come back to

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.680
the example of MIT.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.990
MIT, say, would like to expand
the economics department.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.780
But to do so it's got to poach
an economics professor away

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.740
from another university.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.390
Well, it poaches another
professor away from another

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.190
university.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.590
And let's say that at MIT pays
all its professors the same.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.880
If they're going to poach
a professor from another

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.030
university they're going
to have to pay

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.680
the rest of us more.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.160
And that's going to cost
them a ton of money.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.900
So they think think we'd rather
have a little bit more

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.630
crowded undergrad class, we
don't really see it here

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.750
today, but maybe in general,
more crowded undergrad class

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.540
and not get that extra professor
to avoid having to

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:38.220
pay a higher wage to all our
existing professors.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:44.270
So as a result MIT will under
hire professors and they'll

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:49.020
under hire professors
at too low a wage.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:54.220
And once you can determine how
big monopsony power is, what

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.090
determined how big monopoly
power was?

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.768
What was the key thing I don't
want to say what it is because

00:24:00.768 --> 00:24:02.460
it will give it away, what's the
key thing that determined

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.600
the size of monopoly power.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:04.800
Yeah.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.420
AUDIENCE: Elasticity demand.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.880
PROFESSOR: Elasticity
of demand.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.490
So just like that, the key
factors going to determine the

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.970
market power of monopsonist is
going to be the elasticity of

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.140
supply of labor.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.660
The elasticity of demand for a
good is what determined the

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.236
market power of monopolist
because as goods were more

00:24:21.236 --> 00:24:23.110
elasticity demanded, they
had less ability

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.240
to jack up the price.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.600
The elasticity of supply of
labor is what's going to

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.500
determine the market power
of monopsonists.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.690
Because if I have
more options.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.220
they can't underpay me.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.580
So if I'm very willing to move
to another university.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.040
That is as my labor supply
curve gets flatter, then

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.750
there's less market power that
they have. In particular, in a

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.460
perfectly competitive labor
market there's no monopsony

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.180
power at all.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.250
So monopsony power is a function
of the options facing

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.500
their workers.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.590
Questions about that?

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.970
Now the key question this all
raises, at least when I first

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:08.130
learned about it and think
about it, is it maybe was

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.080
plausible to think that
monopolists can only charge

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.710
one price for their good.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.210
That the iPod is what
the iPod costs.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.250
And you couldn't start charging
different amounts for

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.380
iPods to different people.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.200
That would get bad
press and stuff.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.120
But it's seems a little bit
stranger to think that

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.450
employers have to pay one wage
to all their workers.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.604
As a matter of fact we know that
MIT doesn't pay the same

00:25:29.604 --> 00:25:32.370
to all its professors.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.470
There is some wage
discrimination.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.450
In particular, it's a well known
fact that the way to get

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.870
a raise as a professor is to
get an offer from another

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.130
university.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.740
Because MIT, the pay structure
professors at competitive

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.030
departments like economics is
typically they will underpay

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.470
you until the university comes
and says you're worth more,

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.900
and then they'll ratchet up
to try to match them.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.120
So there is wage discrimination
in practice at

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.880
universities as there is
in most workplaces.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.420
There's very few workplaces
where all

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.300
workers make the same.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.200
There's wage discrimination.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.160
So does that mean this
model is irrelevant?

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.550
And the answer is,
no, it doesn't.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.750
Because there are still major
barriers to perfect wage

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.330
discrimination.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.420
There's some wage
discrimination, but there's a

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.750
lot of barriers to perfect
wage discrimination.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:22.410
The most important one is
workplace norms or fairness.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.310
So what MIT should do, here's
the MIT optimal strategy.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.100
The older the professor, the
less they should pay them.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.460
Not because they're
less productive.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.430
Marginal productivity is
constant, it's not, we get

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.400
less productive as we get older,
but put that aside.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.770
It's because the older you are,
the less likely you are

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.820
to get up and move.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.640
And the less likely, quite
frankly, other universities

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.120
are going to want to hire
you and take you away.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.030
Because no one gets
that excited about

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.270
hiring a 60 year old.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.607
So what you should do is take
all the 60 over professors and

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:53.220
say we're cutting your wage
in half or by a third.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.910
Because the truth, we've written
our lectures already,

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.450
the wage is already well above
our marginal product.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.950
We're all doing pretty
well anyway.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.980
And the truth is people
wouldn't leave.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.100
So why doesn't MIT do that?

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.790
MIT doesn't do that because I'm
going to someday be one of

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.200
those old guys.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.710
I'm getting there rapidly.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.910
I say, wait a second, if they're
going to do to me when

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.790
I'm 60, I'm going to get out of
here while I'm 45 because I

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:20.950
don't want to be in
that situation.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.740
Because that's unfair.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.610
Workplace norms matter.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.210
Employers really do not like
to discriminate within the

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.830
workplace because it breeds bad
blood and ultimately can

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.120
lower productivity.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.370
And this is something that we
miss in our basic models.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.760
We don't have fairness and
workplace norms in our models.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.220
So wage is just about setting
the wage that maximizes the

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.290
profit, which means screwing
the 60 year olds.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.195
But in fact, in reality,
that's not the

00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:48.040
way workplaces work.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.830
And that's what the point
of labor economics is.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.640
If you're interested in this we
have an excellent course in

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.080
labor economics that follows
up on these issues.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.400
But a key issue is how much
wage discrimination can be

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.600
done given workplace norms,
given the notions of fairness

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.710
we have. And the answer is it
might be kind of tough.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:10.100
Because basically MIT doesn't
want to worry about upsetting

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:14.420
all its younger faculty by
mistreating its older faculty.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.220
And part of that could
be solidarity.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.560
Some of those guys are
my friends and I

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.930
feel bad for them.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.090
But partly it could be just more
selfish which is, I don't

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.670
want to be at a place that's
going to discriminate in that

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.450
way against me when
I get older.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.770
And that's just something that's
missed by the basic

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.870
14.01 models.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.280
Questions about that?

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:34.565
Yeah.

00:28:34.565 --> 00:28:36.678
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you
model the person's

00:28:36.678 --> 00:28:38.506
life wage or something?

00:28:38.506 --> 00:28:40.450
PROFESSOR: So yeah.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:46.260
So what you can do is you could
say to people, look,

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.640
when we're hiring you we're
going to overpay you relative

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.080
to other universities when
you're young and we'll

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.970
underpay you when
you're older.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.960
And so on a lifetime basis
you'll be fine.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.760
What would the problem
with that be?

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.880
So let's say the say-- yeah.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.680
AUDIENCE: You'd leave.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.900
PROFESSOR: I'd leave as soon as
I reached that point where

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.380
I was being paid more elsewhere
that didn't pay this

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.420
downward slope.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.530
And, in fact, there's a lot of
interesting labor economics

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.570
theory which says the optimal
formal labor contract is

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:15.010
actually the opposite.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.720
It's to overpay when
you're old and

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.800
underpay when you're young.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.070
And the notion is
to get people to

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.990
want to stick around.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.240
And so in some sense, common
labor theory says exactly the

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.450
opposite of what
you suggested.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.960
You want to overpay older
people to get

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.010
them to stick around.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.850
And for many years in America
that's often the way labor

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:29.390
markets worked.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.440
We had very generous pensions
and health benefits and high

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.650
wages for older workers.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.510
That equilibrium is now breaking
down because in this

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.620
more competitive labor market
you can't afford to overpay

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.060
those older workers because
then you can't attract the

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.130
younger workers in
the first place.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.650
And we're moving towards a
flatter profile by age.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.750
But that's exactly the set of
interesting issues we have to

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.920
deal with in labor economics in
setting pay that we don't

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.240
really get into here.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.250
Other questions or
comments on that?

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.530
Of course there's another every
reason why MIT couldn't

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.600
do this, which is it's
against the law.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.890
We have age discrimination laws
in our country which say

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.740
you cannot discriminate
against people based

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.340
purely on their age.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.920
MIT could say, well look,
I could demonstrate a

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.930
productivity difference.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.800
This guy is publishing fewer
articles than he did 20 years

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.690
ago et cetera, but they do
have a legal hurdle to

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.550
overcome as well as an
administrative hurdle.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.540
It would be a pain in the ass
for MIT to have to figure out

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.070
exactly how to shift their wage
schedule to do all this.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.240
And that causes administrative
costs and extra Deans and

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.440
extra things and they just don't
want to deal with it.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.460
So there are other barriers as
well which is administrative

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.610
costs and legal costs.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.160
But I think probably the main
barrier is just the difficult

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.930
issue of workplace norms
and how it affects the

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:41.556
productivity of the workers who
are behind while you get

00:30:41.556 --> 00:30:43.360
rid of these older workers or
underpay these older workers

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.610
who aren't as productive.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.040
Questions or thoughts on that?

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.840
So now with this monopsony model
in mind I want to go

00:30:53.840 --> 00:31:00.020
back and revisit a major topic
that we talked about early in

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.350
the course.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.460
And a couple times in this
course we talked about as an

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.820
example of how governments can
screw up markets we talked

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.880
about the minimum wage.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.360
We talked about if you take a
competitive labor market and

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.350
impose a minimum wage above the
competitive level, that

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.610
could lead to deadweight loss.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.270
Because what will happen is at
that higher wage firms will

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.080
want fewer workers.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.340
Workers who would be happy to
work at the competitive wage

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.130
will not be able to work.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:31.050
Trades which would make social
welfare higher won't be made.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.800
And there will be
deadweight loss.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.850
The monopsony model says that
may not be the case.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:41.860
Because in the monopsony model,
a minimum wage can play

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.770
the same role that optimal price
regulation paid with

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.960
monopolists.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.705
Remember with monopolists we
said if you regulated a

00:31:49.705 --> 00:31:52.460
monopolist and forced them to
charge a competitive price,

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.130
that you could actually
force them into

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.090
the competitive outcome.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:02.260
Well if a minimum wage is set
above the prevailing wage but

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.140
that's because a monopsony
prevailing wage is too low,

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.560
and the minimum wage is set at
the competitive level, then

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.610
you could actually increase
employment and improve

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.710
outcomes with a minimum wage.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:12.560
Sort of counter intuitive.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.180
So let's look at it,
pretty confusing.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.010
Let's look at figure 18-3.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:20.660
Figure 18-3 once again parallels
a figure you saw on

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.320
the entire flip side for price
regulation of a monopolist,

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.380
this is the parallel which
is wage regulation of a

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.020
monopsonist. Let's walk
through this.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.460
It's pretty confusing so let's
walk through this slowly.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:37.610
Initially you have a monopsonist
who is hiring at

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:42.210
the point where their marginal
expenditure curve, which is

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.880
the dashed line and then
the solid line.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.190
So the line me1 is original
marginal expenditure curve.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:52.990
It's the me1 plus the me2,
it's that segment.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.080
That line which is, once again,
more elastic than the

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.480
supply curve.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.560
That intersects the demand curve
at a labor supply l1.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.770
So they hire l1 workers and
they pay a wage w1.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:10.150
That's the initial monopsony
equilibrium.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.680
The competitive equilibrium is
where supply equals demand.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.180
That would be hiring l2
workers and paying

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.930
a higher wage w2.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:25.320
So the monopsonist is under
hiring relative to the

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.030
competitive firm.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.280
Now let's say the government
rolls in and says we're going

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.210
to set a minimum wage and we're
going to happen to get

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.530
it right and set it at the
competitive wage level, w2.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.460
Well now let's think about
the monopsonist calculus.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.970
The monopsonist new marginal
expenditure curve is the old

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.140
one for the solid segment.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.220
So where it says me2, that solid
segment is still the

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.260
marginal expenditure curve.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.780
So as they think about hiring
additional workers, they're

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.170
working down that curve.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.420
But once they get to l2 workers
they can't lower the

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.900
wage anymore.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:01.560
So that marginal expenditure
curve, they can no longer

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.720
lower the wage below w2.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.990
So their new marginal
expenditure curve hops down

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.139
and becomes the minimum wage.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.790
So the new marginal expenditure
curve is the two

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:10.860
segments labeled me2.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.530
It's the horizontal segment
from the y-axis to e2.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:18.600
And then it jumps up to that
upward sloping segment to the

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.199
right of l2.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:23.750
So the new marginal expenditure
curve is basically

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.040
at a wage that's above minimum
wage they continue to behave

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.040
like a monopsonist. But once you
hit the minimum wage and

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.400
they can't lower the wage
anymore, what happens?

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.350
The poisoning effect goes away,
just like we talked

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:41.570
about with the monopolist.
Essentially what this has done

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.190
has killed the poisoning
effect.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.659
Because it said as you're
thinking about hiring that

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:52.790
next worker to the right of l1,
typically say I want to

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.460
hire them because I'm going to
have to raise my wage to

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.170
everybody else.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.250
But you're already paying
everybody else a higher wage.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.100
You're already paying everybody

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.320
else the minimum wage.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.290
So there's no poisoning
effect.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:02.770
You're not going to have to pay
them a higher wage to hire

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.060
that next worker because you're
already paying them

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.550
that higher wage.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:08.720
So just as optimal price
regulation undoes the

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.890
poisoning effect on the demand
side, optimal wage regulation

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.610
undoes that poisoning effect
on the supply side and can

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.100
lead you to the optimal
outcome.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.520
So minimum wage can actually
increase employment.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.500
Pretty bizarre.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.095
Minimum wage is our whipping boy
for this course about how

00:35:24.095 --> 00:35:28.560
it causes dead weight loss and
leads to lower employment.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.390
Here we're saying, actually,
if we start a monopsony

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.980
equilibrium, a minimum wage
could increase employment.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.440
Of course, as you should know,
the minimum wage could reduce

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.455
employment even in a monopsony
setting if it

00:35:40.455 --> 00:35:42.080
gets set too high.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.900
So if the minimum wage
got set very high--

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.010
Jessica maybe this is something
we should actually

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.020
add for next year-- so if you
can imagine a minimum wage

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:56.050
that's set very high, that could
lead to a level of labor

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.550
supply that's actually below
the monopsony level.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:10.020
So just as with optimal price
regulation, we talked about

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.470
how setting a price too high can
make things worse, setting

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.380
a minimum wage too high
can make things worse.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.290
So it's ultimately an empirical
question of does the

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:20.320
minimum wage raise employment,
which would require two

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.540
conditions, a monopsony market
and a well-set minimum wage.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.120
Or does it lower employment?

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.850
Which can happen either with a
competitive labor market or it

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.220
could happen with a poorly-set
minimum wage.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.130
This pretty confusing so you'll
probably have to go

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:33.470
home and think more
about this.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.240
But are there questions now
about anything that's not

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.490
apparent from the diagram?

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:46.210
So now this is why we have
empirical economics.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:47.710
We have empirical
economics, well

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:48.740
really we have two reasons.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.550
One, is sometimes we know the
direction of what we're

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.780
looking for, we want measure
its magnitude.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.700
Sometimes we don't even know the
direction, not to mention

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.650
the magnitude.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.420
Here's a case we don't even
know the direction.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.490
Will increasing the minimum wage
raise or lower employment

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:01.870
and by how much?

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:03.630
Well how do we test this?

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.050
Well the traditional way to
look at it to say, OK, the

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.430
minimum wage changes over
time, let's look at what

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:14.020
happens to employment when
the minimum wage goes up.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.700
And what people found was an
increase in minimum wage

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.690
tended to be associated
with lower employment.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.510
When the minimum wage went
up, employment fell.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:28.160
So people took that to mean
that there was a situation

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.750
where we're either in a
competitive market or we're

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.000
screwing up the monopsony market
by setting too high a

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.650
minimum wage.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.860
Because we raised the minimum
wage, employment fell.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.400
And what is wrong with
drawing that

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.420
conclusion from that evidence?

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.280
Or could someone tell me a story
about why that might not

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.500
be a convincing piece
of evidence?

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.180
Why the fact that when we
raise the minimum wage

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.190
employment falls, why that
may not be by itself be

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.010
compelling.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.110
What problem you might have with
that piece of evidence.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.360
If you read that in the New York
Times tomorrow, look at

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.820
this graph, we raised the wage
and employment falls.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.630
Clearly minimum wage is bad.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.211
What should your first thought
be upon reading that article?

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.660
Well what do we care about?

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.680
We care about causation
not correlation.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.960
So what could be causing this
to be correlation but not a

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.210
causation effect?

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:26.020
Someone want to try?

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.613
AUDIENCE: It would depend
on when you

00:38:29.613 --> 00:38:30.920
raise the minimum wage.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.245
PROFESSOR: Right, in particular
what story might

00:38:33.245 --> 00:38:34.474
cause this effect?

00:38:34.474 --> 00:38:38.538
AUDIENCE: If they're in a
depression and they decide to

00:38:38.538 --> 00:38:39.090
raise the minimum wage.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:42.050
PROFESSOR: Right, what if
governments, worried about

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.790
workers in bad economies, that's
exactly when they raise

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.450
the minimum wage.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:46.950
What if the government raised
the minimum wage in bad

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.780
economy, because that's exactly
when they're worried

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.380
about workers suffering.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.010
Then you would see that a
higher minimum wage is

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:53.800
associated with lower
employment.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.830
But it's got nothing to do with
the higher minimum wage.

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:57.320
It's got to do with the fact
that you raised the minimum

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.490
wage when unemployment
is falling anyway.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.090
It's causation versus
correlation.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.160
You have to be critical reader
of evidence like this.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.460
The minimum wage is not
handed down by God.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.960
It's determined by legislators
who are subject to political

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.340
pressures which may depend
the state of the economy.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:19.030
If the minimum wage increases
when employment happens to be

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.610
falling, then it will look
like the minimum wage has

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.810
harmed employment when
it really hasn't.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.910
So what we do about this?

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:36.190
What we do about this is to try
to think about a way we

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:41.030
can find a causal relationship
between the minimum wage and

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.350
employment.

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:48.830
And one way to do that is to
try to find cases where a

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:52.720
minimum wage increased and
yet we know there was no

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.960
independent change in
economic activity.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.900
And the way economists have
done that is by looking at

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.570
state minimum wages.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.140
Turns out a lot of states
actually set minimum wages

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.040
higher than the national
minimum wage.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.220
Not really much anymore because
the national minimum

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.140
wage has gone up a lot
the last decade.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.765
But about a decade ago the
national minimum wage, or

00:40:12.765 --> 00:40:14.570
about 15 years ago, the national
minimum wage was at a

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:17.840
real historical minimum in
real terms. And a lot of

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.820
states exceeded that in setting
their minimum wage.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.870
So take two states, for
example New Jersey and

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.120
Pennsylvania.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.480
New Jersey raised its minimum
wage, Pennsylvania doesn't.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.730
But any economic shock is going
to hit New Jersey and

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.880
Pennsylvania pretty similarly.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.570
They're both right next to each
other on the East coast.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.570
Any recession's going to hit
them pretty similarly.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.850
So what you could do is you
could ask what happens to

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:45.720
employment in New Jersey when
they raise their minimum wage

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.060
relative to Pennsylvania,
which suffers the same

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.210
economic shocks but doesn't
raise its minimum wage.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.960
We try to achieve the
gold standard.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.910
What's the gold standard?

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:56.500
The gold standard is
a randomized trial.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.465
What we'd like is literally a
trial where we change the

00:41:00.465 --> 00:41:01.750
minimum wage randomly
at different places

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.880
and different times.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.980
That's ever going to happen.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.430
So we try to approximate in
what we call a natural

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.770
experiment or quasi experiment
which say, are there

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:14.680
experimental interventions that
nature gives us, even if

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.420
they're not perfectly
randomized trials.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.180
And this is one.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.920
Here's a situation where we have
two states, very similar,

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:26.710
one raises the minimum
wage and one doesn't.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.160
And they're set by
economic shocks.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.410
You can look at that.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.090
Another way people have taken
this approach is say, well

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.030
when the minimum wage increases
it's going to have

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.390
different effects in
different places.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:41.450
And why is that?

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.320
That's because the minimum wage
is going to be higher

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.670
relative to the market wage in
some areas than in others.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.210
So, for example, when they
raised the minimum wage a

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:54.190
dollar nationally, most people
in Massachusetts already make

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.730
more than they raised it to.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.000
So it's not going to affect
Massachusetts much.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.570
Whereas in Mississippi
that's a big hit.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:07.100
So given a national raise we can
compare states that were

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.660
hit harder by that raise to
states that were hit less

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.480
hard, another way to
try to do this.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.990
A number of studies have done
this and they've come up with

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.180
the striking conclusion that the
minimum wage, if anything,

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.570
raises employment, at least at
the levels that we've seen

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.450
over the last 15,20 years.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.990
Changes in the minimum wage are
actually associated with

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:30.450
modest, but increases
in employment.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:33.820
And certainly no decreases.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:37.270
They've been associated with
modest increases in employment

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.680
and not decreases.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:43.530
And this is really, really
striking because this is

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.880
something that economists
just never

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.940
even really took seriously.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.750
We always taught that minimum
wage was the bad boy of

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.470
economics, and this is saying,
no, in fact, if you take it

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:59.060
seriously and look at the
evidence carefully you can

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.380
actually see that a minimum
wage can actually increase

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.080
employment as this
model shows.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.190
Now, this is still the subject
of some controversy, there's

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.640
still a lot of work on it.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.825
But it then raises the
question of, well how

00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:16.450
can this really be?

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.780
Don't we have a pretty
competitive labor market?

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.280
How do we really have a
monopsony labor market?

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.640
And the answer is that if you
look at who's getting the

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.840
minimum wage it's largely
younger and low-skilled

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.790
workers who don't have a lot
of employment options.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:37.730
So basically McDonald's in a
given area in a city could

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:39.880
have some monopsony power.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.670
Because people don't
have cars.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:43.620
These low-income urban youths
don't have cars.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.390
They can't go somewhere
else to work.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:48.090
They don't have skills so they
can even work retail because

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.260
they don't have good enough
skills to work retail.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.290
So McDonald's has them.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:54.550
McDonald's has some monopsony
power over them because

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.250
McDonald's is a job
they can get.

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.730
Or McDonald's and Burger King
together maybe are the jobs

00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:59.690
they can get.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:01.620
That gives them some
monopsony power.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.500
So given that's where the
minimum wage is going to bite

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.110
the most it's maybe not
implausible that the minimum

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.590
wage could actually increase
employment which is what we

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:12.130
see in the studies.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:13.160
Questions about that?

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:13.360
Yeah.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:20.108
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] anti-trust
would it be

00:44:20.108 --> 00:44:22.036
possible [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:22.036 --> 00:44:24.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah exactly.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.730
So let's take my inner
city example.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.860
McDonald's isn't the
only employer.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.820
There's Burger King and Wendy's
and lots of other

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.400
low-skilled employers.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.800
The notion is if there's a few
of them that should be enough

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.530
to break any monopsony power
unless they collude.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.770
So likewise just as there's not
supposed to be collusion

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.880
on the output side, there are
laws against collusion on the

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.360
input side in the same way.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.154
But once again, just as those
laws are hard to enforce on

00:44:46.154 --> 00:44:48.050
the output side they're
hard to enforce.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:52.135
Because what you can do is you
can get together in the back

00:44:52.135 --> 00:44:55.120
room, or they can just say,
Wendy's and Burger King can

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.910
wait and see what McDonald's
does and just

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.360
follow in lock step.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.290
So there's lots of ways to
get around those rules.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:05.390
But yes, just as there's
antitrust laws on the output

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:09.710
side, there are the labor market
laws on the input side

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.610
which get in the way
of collusion.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:13.870
The difference is those
are more on a

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.100
sector by sector basis.

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:24.470
So, for example, the
unionization of the workers

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.735
affects the collusion ability
of the employers.

00:45:27.735 --> 00:45:31.350
So if the workers are unionized
it's more lax in

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.470
terms of allowing employers to
collude as well because the

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:34.710
workers are colluding.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.190
If workers aren't unionized
it's less lax.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.110
And there's a complicated body
of labor law about that.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:40.940
Other questions?

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.245
Yeah.

00:45:41.245 --> 00:45:45.640
AUDIENCE: So it would be bad for
unions to try and get an

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:49.000
industry-wide standard
wage or--

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.630
PROFESSOR: Well that's about
efficiency versus equity.

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.380
If a union got an industry-wide
standardized

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.200
wage then that's going to
penalize the talented workers

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.530
who would want to go work
elsewhere and help the less

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.710
talented workers.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:03.180
And basically a lot of the
complaints employers have

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.710
about unions is that they lose
their talented workers because

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:08.700
the union doesn't allow them
to pay those differentials.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.080
Teachers is a great example
that's very controversial

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.150
right now which is,
should there be

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:13.710
merit pay for teachers.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.240
A lot of teachers say, no, there
shouldn't be merit pay

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.360
because that's going to violate
workplace norms and

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.380
it's unfair.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.870
But we might not be getting the
most talented people into

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:24.150
teaching as a result.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.510
So we'll come back next time
and we'll start our topics

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.790
part of the course by talking
about international trade and

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.640
whether it's good or bad.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.550
Answer, it's good.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:36.800
But we'll talk about why.

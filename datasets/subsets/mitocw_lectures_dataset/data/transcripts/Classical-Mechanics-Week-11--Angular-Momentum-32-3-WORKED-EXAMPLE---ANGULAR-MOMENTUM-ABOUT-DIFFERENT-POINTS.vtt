00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.890
I'd like to now calculate
the angular momentum of a two

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.220
particle system.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.380
So here's one particle.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.730
Call that 1.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.300
And here's the other particle 2.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.730
And particle 1 has a momentum
in the downward direction.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.430
And particle 2 has a momentum
in the upper direction.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.410
Now, in this case, I want to
make some of the momentum--

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.070
so this momentum
of the system is 0.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.560
And now I want to calculate
the angular momentum

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.370
about two different points.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.150
So let's just draw an axis here.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.220
And let's choose one point A.
And we'll call this distance r,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.540
and this distance r.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.460
And let's choose
another point B,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.650
and we'll call that distance d.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.380
Now, in order to calculate
angular momentum of the system,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.820
I need to draw my vectors.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.010
Let's start with
the angular momentum

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.140
about the point A. That's going
to be a vector from A to object

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.070
1, cross the momentum of 1, plus
the vector from A to object 2,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.510
cross the momentum of 2.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.440
Now what's crucial
here, is at this point,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.640
things are a little
bit of a abstract,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.710
but we want to draw these
vectors, rA1 and rA2.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.340
So we're now constructing our
angular momentum diagrams.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.440
So there's rA1, and there rA2.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.060
but again, in order
to calculate this,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.510
we could do it geometrically
with right hand rules,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.280
but I now want to
introduce unit vectors,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.600
so I can do vector
decomposition at every point.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.460
So I'm going to choose a
unit vector, i-hat, j-hat,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.550
and k-hat.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.800
And now I can decompose
all of these vectors

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.420
in terms of my unit vectors.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.250
This is the angular
momentum of the system.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.020
So now it's not hard at
all to write these out.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.620
rA1 is minus r in
the i-hat direction.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.030
Cross P1 is down.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.540
That's minus P1 in
the j-hat direction,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.820
where P1 is the magnitude .

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.370
And rA2 is in the
plus i-hat direction.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.090
So that's r i-hat.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.480
And I'm crossing
that with P2, which

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.650
I'll write right now as
P2 in the j-hat direction.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.650
Now remember, P2 has the
same magnitude as P1,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.930
but they're pointing
in opposite directions.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.780
So when I take
the cross project,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.930
i-hat cross j-hat is k-hat
minus sign minus sign.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.650
So I get rP1 k-hat.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.510
And now over here,
P2 is equal to P1.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.820
i-hat cross j-hat is k-hat.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.320
And I get another rP1 k-hat.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.890
And so I have 2rP1 k-hat.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.300
And that's the angular momentum
of the system about point A.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.560
Now I'd like to calculate the
angular momentum about B So

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.610
let's draw the
same diagram, 1, 2.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.300
Here is P2.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.980
Here's P1.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.870
Here is B. And now
I'll draw my vectors.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.610
This is rB2 and this is rB1.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.840
This distance was 2r.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.120
This distance was d.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.800
I'm going to use the
same unit vectors.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.140
And so I get l for the
system about B. Again,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.910
I'll just write everything out.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.310
P1 plus rB2 cross P2.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.910
So I'm going to write
P2 as, in this case,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.910
it's equal to minus P1.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.790
And magnitudes P2 equals P1.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.160
In magnitude directions
are opposite.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:09.220
So rB1 is equal 2r plus D
i-hat, and it's pointing

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.440
in the minus i-hat direction.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.839
Cross P1 is in the
minus j-hat direction.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.010
rB2 is also in the
minus i-hat direction,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.760
so that's minus D i-hat.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.600
And P2 is in the plus j
direction, so that is plus--

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.670
the magnitudes are the same--

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.420
P1 j-hat.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.460
We don't need the
plus sign there.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.280
And now I take the
cross products.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.790
i-hat cross j-hat is k-hat.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.950
A minus sign minus sign.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.730
That makes plus.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.990
So I have 2r plus D P1 k-hat.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.720
Now notice here I have i-hat
cross j-hat, which is k-hat,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.510
but there's a minus sign.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.570
So I have minus D P1 k-hat.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.640
Here I have plus D P1
k-hat minus D1 P k-hat.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.430
And so I get 2rP1 k-hat.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:20.550
And I have the same result.
L system A equals L system B.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.860
Now that's not a
coincidence in this problem.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.890
And the reason is
that whenever--

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.980
so we can say it this way.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.460
Whenever the momentum
of the system is 0,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:50.260
then LA is independent of
the choice of the point A.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.750
So coming back to our
example, no matter where

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.540
I picked our points A and B--

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.470
any point I could
pick, anywhere I want--

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.050
I could pick a
point C up there--

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.180
I make this cross
product calculation.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.770
I would get exactly
the same answer, 2rP1k.

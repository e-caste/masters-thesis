00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.170
JOSH TENENBAUM: So where we
left off was, you know, again,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.850
I was telling you a story, both
conceptual and motivational

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.180
and a little bit technical
about how we got to the things

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.520
we're trying to do now
as part of the center.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.170
And it involves, again both
the problems we want to solve.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380
We want to understand
what is this common sense

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.850
knowledge about
the physical world

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.760
and the psychological world that
you can see in some form even

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.900
in young infants?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.400
And what are the
learning mechanisms

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.140
that build it and grow it?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.647
And then what's the kind
of technical ideas that

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:52.730
are going to be also
hopefully useful for building

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.240
intelligent robots or
other AI systems that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.330
can explain on the scientific
side how this stuff works?

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.129
All right, so that
was all this business.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.670
And what I was suggesting, or
I'll start to suggest here now,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.760
is that it goes
back to that quote

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.510
I gave at the beginning
from Craik, right?

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.460
The guy who in 1943
wrote this book

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.840
called The Nature
of Explanation.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.210
And he was saying that's the
essence of intelligence is

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.000
this ability to
build models that

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.430
allow you to explain the
world, to then reason,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.890
simulate, plan, and so on.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.740
And I think we need
tools for understanding

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.900
how the brain is a modeling
engine or an explaining engine.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.650
Or to get a little bit
recursive about it,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.024
since what we're
doing in science

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:34.070
is also an explanatory
activity, we

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.440
need modeling
engines in which we

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.059
can build models of the
brain as a modeling engine.

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:40.850
And that's where the
probabilistic programs

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.870
are going to come in.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.170
So part of why I spent a
while in the morning talking

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.300
about these graphical
models and the ways

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.130
that we tried and, I
think, made progress

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.410
on, but ultimately
we're dissatisfied with,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.860
talking about how we're modeling
various aspects of cognition

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.720
with these kinds of
graphical models.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.530
I put up-- I didn't say too much
about the technical details.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.070
That's fine.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.840
You can read a lot
about it or not.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.949
But these ways of using
graphs, mostly directed graphs,

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:09.199
to capture something about
the structure of the world.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.240
And then you put probabilities
on it in some way,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.340
like a diffusion process
or a noisy transmission

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.020
process for a food web.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.410
That's a style of
reasoning that sometimes

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.060
goes by the name of
Bayesian networks

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.490
or causal graphical models.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.880
It's been hugely influential
in computer science,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.347
many different fields, not just
AI, and many fields outside

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:29.180
of computer science.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.388
Not just cognitive science,
neuroscience-- many areas

00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:32.870
of science and engineering.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.270
Here are just a few examples
of some Bayesian networks

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.606
you get if you search on Google
image for Bayesian networks.

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:39.980
And if you look
carefully, you'll

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.880
see they come from biology,
economics, many chemical

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.330
engineering, whatever.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.644
They're due to many people.

00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:50.060
Maybe more than
anyone, the person

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.310
who's most associated with
this idea and with the name

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.870
Bayesian networks
is Judea Pearl.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.820
He received the
Turing Award, which

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.730
is like the highest reward
in computer science.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.440
This is a language
that we were using

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.250
in all the projects you saw
up until now in some form

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.930
that we and many others used.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.140
Because they provide a
powerful set of tools

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.270
for general purpose tools.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.270
It goes back to this dream
of building general purpose

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.140
systems for
understanding the world.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.590
So these provide general
purpose languages

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.950
for representing
causal structure--

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.580
I'll say a little
bit more about that--

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.470
and general purpose
algorithms for doing

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.710
the probabilistic
inference on this.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.209
So we talked about
ways of combining

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.120
sophisticated
statistical inference

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.800
with knowledge
representation that's

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.274
causal and compositional.

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:34.190
These models-- I'll just
tell you a little bit

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.630
about the one in the
upper left up there,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.421
that thing that says
diseases and symptoms.

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.150
It is causal.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.020
It is compositional.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.802
It does support
probabilistic inference.

00:03:40.802 --> 00:03:42.260
And it was the
heart of why we were

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.390
doing what we were
doing and showing you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.765
how different kinds of
causal graphical models

00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:48.890
basically could capture
different modes of people's

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.330
reasoning.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.670
And the idea that maybe
learning about different domains

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.256
was learning those different
kinds of graphs structures.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:58.130
So let me say a little
bit about how it works

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.320
and then why it's not enough,
because it really isn't enough.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.730
I mean, it's the right start.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.900
It's definitely in
the right direction.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.940
But we need to go beyond it.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.910
That's where the problematic
programs come in.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.930
So look at that network up
there on the upper left.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.000
It's one of the most
famous Bayesian networks.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.160
It's a textbook example.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.780
One of the first
actually implemented

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.769
AI systems was based on this for
a system for medical diagnosis.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.910
Sort of a simple approximation
to what a general practitioner

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.140
might be doing if a patient
comes in and reports

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.640
some pattern of symptoms, and
they want to figure out what's

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.230
wrong.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.480
So diagnosis of a disease
to explain the symptoms.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.460
The graph is a bipartite graph.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.080
So two sets of nodes
with the arrows,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.670
again, going down in
the causal direction.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.970
The bottom layer, the
symptoms, are the things

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.190
that you can nominally observe.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.997
A patient comes in
reporting some symptoms.

00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:46.580
Not all are observed,
but others maybe

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.640
are things that you could test,
like medical test results.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.330
And then the top
level is this level

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
of latent structure, the
causes, the things that

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.560
cause the symptoms.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.090
The arrows represent
basically which

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.970
diseases cause which symptoms.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.250
In this model there's roughly
500, 600 diseases-- you know,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.440
the commonish ones,
not all that common--

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.500
and 4,000 symptoms.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.020
So it's a big model.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.670
And in some sense,
you can think of it

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.080
as a big probability model.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.200
It's a way of specifying a
joint distribution on this

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.080
4,600-dimensional space.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.530
But it's a very particular one
that's causally structured.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.680
It represents only the minimal
causal dependencies and really

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.610
only the minimal
probabilistic dependencies.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.845
That sparsity is really
important for how you use it,

00:05:29.845 --> 00:05:31.970
whether you're talking
about inference or learning.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.000
So inference means observing
patterns of symptoms

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.430
or just observing the values
of some of those variables

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.930
and making guesses
about the others.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.555
Like observing some
symptoms and making

00:05:40.555 --> 00:05:42.350
guesses about the
diseases that are most

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.970
likely to have explained those.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.130
Or you might make a prediction
about other symptoms

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.770
you could observe.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.410
So you could go up
and then back down.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.150
You could say, well,
from these symptoms,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.940
I think the patient might have
one of these two rare diseases.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.130
I don't know which one.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.660
But if it was this
disease, then it

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.505
would predict that symptom
or that test maybe.

00:05:59.505 --> 00:06:01.130
But this disease
wouldn't, so then that

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.140
suggests a way to plan
an action you could

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.852
take to figure things out.

00:06:04.852 --> 00:06:06.560
So then I could go
test for that symptom,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.184
and that would tell me which of
these diseases the patient has.

00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:11.960
They're also useful in planning
other kinds of treatments,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.650
interventions.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.180
Like if you want
to cure someone--

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.280
again, we all know
this intuitively--

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.530
you should try to cure the
disease, not the symptom.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.429
If you have some
way to act to change

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:22.220
the state of one of
those disease variables

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.460
to kind of turn it
off, reasonably that

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.627
should relieve the symptoms.

00:06:26.627 --> 00:06:29.293
If that disease gets turned off,
these symptoms should turn off.

00:06:29.293 --> 00:06:30.770
Whereas just
treating the symptom

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.922
like taking Advil for
a headache is fine

00:06:32.922 --> 00:06:34.130
if that's all the problem is.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.620
But if it's being caused
by something, you know,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.220
god forbid, like a brain
tumor, it's not going to help.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.760
It's not going to cure the
problem in the long term.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.720
OK, so all those patterns of
causal inference, reasoning,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.466
prediction, action
planning, exploration

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:48.590
is a beautiful language
for capturing all of those.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.260
You can automate all
those inferences.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.030
Why isn't it enough, then, for
capturing commonsense reasoning

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.800
or this approach to cognition?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.380
Which I'm calling the kind
of model-building explaining

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.440
part, as opposed to the
pattern recognition part.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.190
I mean, again, I don't
want to get too far

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.398
behind in talking about this.

00:07:05.398 --> 00:07:06.890
But that example is so rich.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.170
Like if you can build
a neural network,

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.640
you can just turn
the arrows around

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.514
to learn a mapping from
symptoms to diseases,

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:14.850
and that would be a
pattern classifier.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.359
So these two different
paradigms for intelligence--

00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:20.900
as some of the questions we're
getting at, and as I will show

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.066
versions of that with some
more interesting examples

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:24.470
in a little bit--

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.320
often it's very subtle, and
the relations between them

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.630
are quite valuable.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.190
So one way to work with
such a model, for example,

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.057
or one nice way--

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:36.140
I mean, I mentioned a lot
of people want to know--

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.760
and I'll keep talking about
this for the rest of the hour--

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.370
productive ways to combine
these powerful generative

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.050
models with more pattern
recognition approaches.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.475
For some classes of this model--

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.990
there are always general
purpose algorithms

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.730
that can support
these inferences, that

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.980
can tell you what diseases
you're likely to have given

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.760
what symptoms.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.160
But in some cases, they
could be very fast.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.320
In other cases, they
could be very slow.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.480
Whereas if you
could imagine trying

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.527
to learn a neural network
that looks just like that,

00:08:08.527 --> 00:08:10.610
only the arrows go up, so
they implement a mapping

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.980
from data to
diseases, that could

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.440
help to do much faster
inference in the cases

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.740
where that's possible.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.250
So that's just one
example of where

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.900
a model, which might
be not a crazy way

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.691
to think about, for
example, more generally

00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:25.517
the way top-down and bottom-up
connections work in the brain.

00:08:25.517 --> 00:08:28.100
I'll take that a little bit more
literally in a vision example

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.620
in a second.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.530
So there's a lot you
can get from studying

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.220
these causal graphical models,
including some version of what

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.900
it is for the mind
to explain the world

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.150
and how that explanation
and pattern recognition

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.919
approach can work together.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.960
But it's not enough
to really get

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.040
at the heart of common sense
The mental generative models

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.690
we build are more
richly structured.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.042
They're more like programs.

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:54.000
What do I mean by that?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.160
Well, here I'm giving a bunch of
examples of scientific theories

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.540
or models.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.630
Not commonsense ones, but I
think the same idea applies.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.670
Ways of, again,
explaining the world,

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.270
not just describing the pattern.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.840
So we went at the beginning
through Newton's laws

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.151
versus Kepler's laws.

00:09:10.151 --> 00:09:11.150
That's just one example.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.710
And you might not have thought
of those laws as a program,

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.480
but they're certainly
not a graph.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.724
On the first slide when
I showed Newton's laws,

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.390
there was a bunch of
symbols, statements

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.580
in English, some math.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.340
But what it comes
down to is basically

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.890
a set of pieces of
code that you could

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.980
run to generate the orbits.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.630
It doesn't describe the
sheep or the velocities,

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.700
but it's a machine that
you plug in some things.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.560
You plug in some
masses, some objects,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.570
some initial conditions.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.911
And you press run, and it
generates the orbits, just

00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:46.160
like what you're seeing there.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.110
Although those probably
weren't generated.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.480
That's a GIF.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.600
OK.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.000
That's more like
Kepler or Ptolemy.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.089
But anyway, it's a
powerful machine.

00:09:58.089 --> 00:09:59.630
It's a machine,
which if you put down

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.340
the right masses in
the right position,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.090
they don't just all
go around in ellipses.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.320
Some of them are
like moons, and they

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.930
will go around the things that
will go around the others.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.090
And some of them will be
like apples on the Earth,

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.506
and they won't go
around anything.

00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:11.610
They'll just fall down.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.360
So that's the powerful machine.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.040
And in the really simplest
cases, that machine--

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.370
those equations can be
solved analytically.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.414
You can use calculus or
other methods of analysis

00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:22.080
like Newton did.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.280
He didn't have a computer.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.670
And you can show that for a
two-body system, one planet

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.997
and one sun, you can solve
those equations to show

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:31.080
that you get Kepler's law.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.460
Amazing.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:38.165
And under the approximation
that only the sun is--

00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:39.540
for every other
planet, it's only

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.730
the sun that's exerting
a significant influence,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.110
you can describe all of
Kepler's laws this way.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.320
But once you have more
than two bodies interacting

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.350
in some complex way,
like three masses similar

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.280
in size near each
other, you can't

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.140
solve the equations
analytically anymore.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.960
You basically just have
to run a simulation.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.300
For the most part, the
world is complicated,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.200
and our models have to be run.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.040
Here's a model of a
riverbed formation.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.000
Or these are snapshots of a
model of galaxy collision,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.070
you know, and climate
modeling or aerodynamics.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.530
So basically what
most modern science

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.369
is is you write
down descriptions

00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:17.160
of the causal processes,
something going on

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.920
in the world, and you study
that through some combination

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.740
of analysis and simulation
to see what would happen.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.260
If you want to
estimate parameters,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.300
you try out some guesses
of the parameters.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.674
And you run this thing, and
you see if its behavior looks

00:11:29.674 --> 00:11:31.410
like the data you observe.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.584
If you are trying to decide
between two different models,

00:11:34.584 --> 00:11:36.000
you simulate each
of them, and you

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.250
see which one looks more
like the data you observe.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.915
If you think there's something
wrong with your model--

00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:42.016
it doesn't quite look
like the data you observe.

00:11:42.016 --> 00:11:43.890
You think, how could I
change my model, which

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.140
basically if I run it, it'll
look more like the data I

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.540
observe in some important way?

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.600
Those activities of science--

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.030
those are, in some
form I'm arguing,

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.520
the activities of common
sense explanation.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.200
So when I'm talking about
the child as scientist,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.260
that's what I'm
basically talking about.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.940
It's some version of that.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.150
And so that includes
both using--

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.530
describing the causal processes
with a program that you run.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.950
Or if you want to
talk about learning,

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.730
the scientific analog is
building one of these theories.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.520
You don't build a
theory, whether it's

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.720
Newton's laws or Mendel's
laws or any of these things,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.210
by just finding
patterns and data.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:32.190
You do something like
this program thing,

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.230
but kind of recursively.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.800
Think of you having some kind
of paradigm, some program that

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.660
generates programs,
and you use it

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.970
to try to somehow search
the space of programs

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.500
to come up with a program
that fits your data well.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.470
OK, so that's, again,
kind of the big picture.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.780
And now, let's talk
about how we can actually

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.230
do something with this
idea-- use these programs.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.862
And you might be wondering,
OK, maybe I understand--

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:01.500
I'm realizing I didn't
say the main thing I

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.190
want you to understand.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.940
The main thing I want
you to get from this

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.330
is how programs
go beyond graphs.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.660
So none of these
processes here can nicely

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.300
describe with a
graph the way we have

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.060
in the language of
graphical models.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.732
So the interesting causality--

00:13:16.732 --> 00:13:18.690
I mean, in some sense,
there's kind of a graph.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.610
You can talk about the state
of the world at time T,

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.000
and I'll show you graphs
like this in a second.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.166
The state of the world at
time T plus 1 and an arrow

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:25.290
forward in time.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.960
But all the interesting stuff
that science really gains power

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.870
from are the much more
fine-grained structure

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.520
captured in equations
or functions

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.410
that describe exactly
how all this stuff works.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.450
And it needs languages
like math or C++ or LISP.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.810
It needs a symbolic
language of processes

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.509
to really do justice to.

00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:46.050
The second thing I
want to get, which

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.770
will take a minute to get,
but let's put it out there.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.000
As yes, OK, maybe
you get the idea

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.340
that programs can be used
to describe causal processes

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.430
in interesting ways.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.910
But where is the
probability part come in?

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:01.980
So the same thing is actually
true in graphical models.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.470
How many people have
read Judea Pearl's 2000

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.450
book called Causality?

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.490
How many people have
read his '88 book?

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.630
Or nobody's read anything.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.450
But, OK, so what Pearl
is most famous for--

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.450
I mean, when we say Pearl's
famous for inventing

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.310
Bayesian networks,
that's based on work

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.150
he did in the '80s,
in which, yes,

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.320
they were all
probability models.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.737
But then he came
to what he calls,

00:14:24.737 --> 00:14:27.195
and I would call, too, a deeper
view in which it was really

00:14:27.195 --> 00:14:29.370
about basically deterministic
causal relations.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.730
Basically it was a graphical
language for equations--

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.050
certain classes of equations
like structural equations.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.420
If you know about linear
structural equations,

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.610
it was sort of like nonlinear
structural equations.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.290
And then probabilities
are these things

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.210
you put on just on
top of it to capture

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.670
the things you don't know
that you're uncertain about.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.680
And I think he was he
was getting at the fact

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.687
that to scientists,
and also to people--

00:14:49.687 --> 00:14:52.020
there's some very nice work
by Laura Schultz and Jessica

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.660
Sommerville, both of whom will
be here next week actually,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.940
on how children's
concepts of causality

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.032
are basically
deterministic at the core.

00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:00.490
And where the
probabilities come in

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.730
is on the things
that we don't observe

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.300
or the things we don't
know, the uncertainty.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.710
It's not that the
world is noisy.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.270
It's that we believe, at least--

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.674
except for quantum mechanics--
but our intuitive notions

00:15:10.674 --> 00:15:12.590
are that the world is
basically deterministic,

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:13.910
but with a lot of
stuff we don't know.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.400
This was, for example, Laplace's
view in philosophy of science.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.858
And really until
quantum mechanics,

00:15:17.858 --> 00:15:21.089
it was broadly the
Enlightenment science view

00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:23.630
that the world is full of all
these complicated deterministic

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.690
machines, and where uncertainty
comes from the things

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.400
that we can't observe or that
we can't measure finely enough,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.100
or they're just in some form
unknown or unknowable to us.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.860
Does that make sense?

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.019
So you'll see more
of this in a second.

00:15:38.019 --> 00:15:39.560
But where the
probabilities are going

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.440
to come from is basically if
there are inputs to the program

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.910
that we don't know
or parameters we

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.620
don't know that in
order to simulate them

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.300
we're going to have to
put distributions on those

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.924
and make some guesses
and then see what

00:15:48.924 --> 00:15:50.180
happens for different guesses.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.260
Does that make sense?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.950
OK.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:53.450
Good.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.908
So again, that's most of the
technical stuff I need to say.

00:15:55.908 --> 00:15:58.130
And you'll learn about how
this works in much more

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.050
concrete details if
you go to the tutorial

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.101
afterwards that Tomer
is going to run.

00:16:02.101 --> 00:16:03.350
What you'll see there is this.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.683
So here are just a few examples.

00:16:04.683 --> 00:16:06.920
Many of you hopefully already
looked at the web pages

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.930
from this probmods.org thing.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.500
And what you see here is
basically each of these boxes

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.030
is a probabilistic
program model.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.620
Most of it is a bunch
of defined statements.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.500
So if you look here, you'll
see these defined statements.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.170
Those are just
defining functions.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.370
They name the function.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.650
They take some inputs,
which call other functions,

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.120
and then they maybe
do something--

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.650
they have some output
that might be an object.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.470
It might itself be a function.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.760
These can be functions that
generate other functions.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.590
And where the
probabilities come in

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.470
is that sometimes these
functions call random number

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.520
of generators basically.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.186
If you look carefully,
you'll see things

00:16:42.186 --> 00:16:48.670
like Dirichlet, or uniform
draw, or Gaussian, or flip.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.740
Right those are primitive random
functions that flip a coin,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.110
or roll a die, or
draw from a Gaussian.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.040
And those captured things
that are currently unknown.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.470
In a very important sense, the
particular language, Church,

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.800
that you're going to learn here
with its sort of stochastic

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.970
LISP--

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.520
basically just functions
that call other functions

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.650
and maybe add in some
randomness to that--

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.931
is very much analogous to the
directed graph of a Bayesian

00:17:15.931 --> 00:17:16.430
network.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.550
In a Bayesian network,
you have nodes and arrows.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.490
And the parents of a node, the
ones that send arrows to it,

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.530
are basically the
minimal set of variables

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.530
that if you were going
to sample from this model

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.521
you'd have to sample first in
order to then sample the child

00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:30.020
variable.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.270
Because those are the
key things it depends on.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.640
And you can have a
multi-layered Bayesian network

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.410
that, if you are going
to sample from it,

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.755
it's just you start at the
top and you sort of go down.

00:17:38.755 --> 00:17:40.130
That's exactly
the same thing you

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.879
have in these probabilistic
programs where

00:17:41.879 --> 00:17:44.570
the defined statements are
basically defining a function.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.436
And the functions are the
nodes, and the other functions

00:17:48.436 --> 00:17:50.060
that they call as
part of the statement

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.970
are the things that are the
nodes that send arrows there.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.520
But the key is, as you can
imagine if you've ever--

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.950
I mean, all of you have
written computer programs--

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.650
is that only very
simple programs look

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:02.240
like directed acyclic graphs.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.190
And that's what a
Bayesian network is.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.129
It's very easy and
often necessary

00:18:06.129 --> 00:18:08.420
to write a program to really
capture something causally

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.050
interesting in the
world where it's not

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.634
a directed acyclic route.

00:18:11.634 --> 00:18:12.800
There's all sorts of cycles.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.850
There's recursion.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.570
One thing that a function can
do is make a whole other graph.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.290
Or often it might be
directed and acyclic,

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.940
but all the interesting
stuff is kind

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.169
of going on inside what happens
when you evaluate one function.

00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:27.710
So if you were to
draw it as a graph,

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.680
it might look like you could
draw a directed acyclic graph,

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.096
but all the
interesting stuff will

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:35.342
be going on inside
one node or one arrow.

00:18:35.342 --> 00:18:37.550
So let me get more specific
about the particular kind

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.300
of programs that we're
going to be talking about.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.280
In a probabilistic
programming language

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.160
like Church, or in general
in this view of the mind,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.140
we're interested in being
able to build really

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.220
any kind of thing.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.860
Again, there's lots
of big dreams here.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.840
Like I was saying
before, I felt like we

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.100
had to give up on
some dreams, but we've

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.600
replaced it with
even grander ones,

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.000
like probabilistic
modeling engines that

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.990
can do any computable model.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.400
But in the spirit of trying to
scale up from something that we

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.300
can get traction on, what
I've been focusing on

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.130
in a lot of my work
recently and what we've

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.960
been doing as part
of the center,

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.300
are particular
probabilistic programs

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.180
that we think can capture this
very early core of common sense

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.140
intuitive physics and intuitive
psychology in young kids.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.520
It's what I called-- and I
remember I mentioned this

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.330
in the first lecture--

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.780
this game engine in your head.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:31.310
So it's programs for graphics
engines, physics engines,

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.140
planning engines, the
basic kinds of things

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.760
you might use to build one of
these immersive video games.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.970
And we think if you wrap
those inside this framework

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.190
for probabilistic
inference, then

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.610
that's a powerful way to do
the kind of common sense seen

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.680
understanding, whether
in these adult versions

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.230
or in the young kid versions.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:56.690
Now, to specify this
probabilistic programs

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.670
view, just like with
Bayesian networks

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.471
or these graphical models, we
wanted general purpose tools

00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.470
for representing interesting
things in the world

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.470
and for computing the
inferences that we want.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.280
Again, which means basically
observing, say, just like you

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.110
observe some of the
symptoms and you

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.330
want to compute the
likely diseases that best

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.130
explain the observed symptoms.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.360
Here we talk about observing
the outputs of some

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.754
of these programs,
like the image

00:20:22.754 --> 00:20:24.420
that's the output of
a graphics program.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.150
And we want to work backwards
and make a guess at the world

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.030
state, the input to
the graphics engine

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.280
that's most likely to
have produced the image.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.520
That's the analog of getting
diseases from symptoms.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.624
Or again, that's our
explanation right there.

00:20:38.624 --> 00:20:41.040
And there are lots of different
algorithms for doing this.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.748
I'm not going to say
too much about them.

00:20:42.748 --> 00:20:44.942
Tomer will say a little
bit more in the afternoon.

00:20:44.942 --> 00:20:46.400
The main thing I
will do is, I will

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.710
say that the main
general purpose

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.500
algorithms for inference in
probabilistic programming

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.590
language are in the
category of slow

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.360
and slower and
really, really slow.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.850
And this is one of the
many ways in which there's

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.360
no magic or no free lunch.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.350
Across all of AI and
cognitive science,

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.777
when you build very
powerful representations,

00:21:08.777 --> 00:21:10.610
doing inference with
them becomes very hard.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.144
It's part of why
people often like

00:21:12.144 --> 00:21:13.310
things like neural networks.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.809
They're much weaker
representations,

00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:17.600
but inference can
be much faster.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.984
And at the moment, the only
totally general purpose

00:21:19.984 --> 00:21:22.400
algorithms for doing inference
with probabilistic programs

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.300
are slow.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.580
But first of all,
they're getting faster.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.520
People are coming up with--

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.780
and I can talk about this
offline where that's going--

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.210
but also-- and this is what
I'll talk about in a sharper way

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.450
in a second--

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.767
there are particular classes
of probabilistic programs,

00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:40.100
in particular, the ones in
the game engine in your head.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.710
Like for vision is
inverse graphics and maybe

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.400
some things about physics
and psychology too.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.987
I mean, again, I'm just thinking
of the stuff of like what's

00:21:48.987 --> 00:21:50.570
going on with it
when a kid is playing

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.980
with some objects
around them and thinking

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.271
about what other people might
think about those things.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:57.680
It's just that
setting where we think

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.179
that you can build sort of in
some sense special purpose.

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:02.720
I mean, they're
still pretty general.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.720
But inference algorithms
for doing inference

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.940
in probabilistic programs,
getting the causes

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.670
from the effects that
are much, much faster

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.170
than things that
could work on just

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.845
arbitrary probabilistic programs
and that actually often look

00:22:15.845 --> 00:22:16.970
a lot like neural networks.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.710
And in particular,
we can directly

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.010
use, say for example, deep
convolutional neural networks

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.880
to build these
recognition programs

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.350
or basically inference
programs that

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.020
work by pattern recognition
in, for example,

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.790
an inverse graphics
approach to vision.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.550
So that's what I'll
show you basically now.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.350
I'm going to start
off by just working

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.725
through a couple
of these arrows.

00:22:37.725 --> 00:22:41.630
I'm going to first talk about
this sort of approach we've

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.690
done to tackle both
vision as inverse graphics

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.539
and some intuitive
physics on the scene

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.830
recovered and then say a
little bit about the intuitive

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.260
psychology side.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.090
Here's an example of the kind of
specific domain we've studied.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.150
It's like our Atari setting.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.360
It's a kind of video game
inspired by the real game

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.535
Jenga.

00:23:00.535 --> 00:23:02.660
Jenga's this cool game you
play with wooden blocks.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.500
You start off with a very, very,
very nicely stacked up thing

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.380
and you take turns
removing the blocks.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.330
And the player who
removes the block that

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.662
makes the whole thing fall
over is the one who loses.

00:23:13.662 --> 00:23:15.620
And it really exercises
this part of your brain

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.500
that we've been studying
here, which is an ability

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.130
to reason about stability and
support I very briefly went

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.730
over this, but this
is something that

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.371
is one of the classic case
studies of infant object

00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:26.870
knowledge.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.480
Looking at how basically
these concepts develop

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.240
in some really interesting ways
over the first year of life.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.880
Though what we're doing here
is building models and testing

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.110
them primarily with adults.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.568
It is part of what we're trying
to do in our brains, minds,

00:23:38.568 --> 00:23:40.220
and machines research
program here,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.470
collaboration with
Liz and others,

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.007
to actually test these ideas
in experiments with infants.

00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:47.090
But what I'll show you is
just kind of think of it

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.790
as like infant-inspired
adult intuitive physics

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.490
where we build and test the
models in an easier way,

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.082
and then we're taking it
down to kids going forward.

00:23:55.082 --> 00:23:56.540
So the kind of
experiment we can do

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.990
with adults is show them
these configurations of blocks

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:05.440
and say, for example,
how stable under gravity

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.989
is one of these towers
or configurations?

00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:09.530
So like everything
else, you can make

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.930
a judgment on a scale of
zero to 10 or one to seven.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.430
And probably most
people would agree

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.739
that the ones in the upper left
are relatively stable, meaning

00:24:17.739 --> 00:24:19.280
if you just sort of
run gravity on it

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.630
it's not going to fall over.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.280
Whereas the ones
in the lower right

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.590
are much more likely
to fall under gravity.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.702
Fair enough?

00:24:25.702 --> 00:24:26.660
That's what people say.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.260
OK.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.762
So that's the kind of thing
we'd like to be able to explain

00:24:29.762 --> 00:24:31.220
as well as many
other judgments you

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.680
could make about
this simple, but not

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.057
that simple world of objects.

00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.890
And again, you can see
how in principle this

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.473
could very nicely interface with
what Demis was talking about.

00:24:39.473 --> 00:24:42.350
He talked about their ambition
to do the SHRDLU task, which

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.620
was this ability to
basically have a system that

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.600
can take in instructions
and language

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.094
and manipulate objects
and blocks world.

00:24:50.094 --> 00:24:51.260
They are very far from that.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.210
Everybody's really far from
having a general purpose

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.418
system that can do that in
any way like a human does.

00:24:55.418 --> 00:24:58.280
But we think we're building some
of the common sense knowledge

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.330
about the physical
world that would

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.000
be necessary to get something
like that to work or to explain

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.400
how kids play with blocks,
play with each other,

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.410
talk to each other while they're
playing with blocks and so on.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.490
So the first step
is the vision part.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.770
In this picture here, it's
that blue graphics arrow.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.260
Here's another way into it.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.469
We want to be able to take a
2D image and work backwards

00:25:19.469 --> 00:25:21.260
to the world state,
the kind of world state

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.850
that can support
physical reasoning.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.570
Again, remember
these buzzwords--

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.820
explaining the mind
with generative models

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.010
that are causal
and compositional.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.530
We want a description
of the world which

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.390
supports causal
reasoning of the sort

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.464
that physics is doing,
like forces interacting

00:25:37.464 --> 00:25:38.130
with each other.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.520
So it's got to have things
that can exert force

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.630
and can suffer forces.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.910
It's got to have
mass in some form.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.710
It's got to be
compositional because you've

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.570
got to be able to pick up
a block and take it away.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.230
Or if I have these blocks over
here and these blocks over here

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.620
and I want to put these
ones on top of there,

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.240
the world state has
to be able to support

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.070
any number of objects
in any configuration

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.560
and to literally
compose a representation

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.570
of a world of objects
that are composed together

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.824
to make bigger things.

00:26:00.824 --> 00:26:02.240
So really the only
way we know how

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.180
to do that is something like
what's sometimes in engineering

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.022
called a CAD model or
computer-aided design.

00:26:07.022 --> 00:26:08.480
But it's basically
a representation

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.640
of three-dimensional
objects, often

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.650
with something like
a mesh or a grid

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.470
of key points with their masses
and springs for stiffness,

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.636
something like that.

00:26:16.636 --> 00:26:18.260
Here my only picture
of the world state

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.090
looks an awful lot
like the image,

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.100
only it's in black and
white instead of color.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.590
But the difference is that
the thing on the bottom

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.030
is actually an image.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.530
Whereas the thing
on the top is just

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.840
a 2D projection of a 3D model.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.190
I'll show you that one.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.194
Here's a few others.

00:26:32.194 --> 00:26:33.860
So I'll go back and
forth between these.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.443
Notice how it kind of looks like
the blocks are moving around.

00:26:36.443 --> 00:26:38.360
So what's actually
going on is these

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.460
are samples from the
Bayesian posterior

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.410
in an inverse graphics system.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.330
We put a prior on
world states, which

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:48.050
is basically a prior on what we
think the world is made out of.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.490
We think there's these
Jenga blocks basically.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.140
And then the likelihood, which
is that that forward model is

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.170
the probability of seeing
a particular 2D image given

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.610
a 3D configuration of blocks.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.110
And going back to
the thing you had,

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.750
it's basically deterministic
with a little bit of noise.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.590
It's deterministic.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.590
It just follows the
rules of OpenGL graphics.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.540
Basically says
objects have surfaces.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.660
They're not transparent.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.784
You can't see through them.

00:27:10.784 --> 00:27:13.540
That's an extra complication
if you wanted to have that.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.920
And basically the
image is formed

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.190
by taking the closest
surface of the closest object

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.160
and bouncing a ray of light off
of it, which really just means

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.060
taking its color and
scaling it by intensity.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.840
It's a very simple shadow model.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.980
So that's the causal model.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.188
And then we can add a little
bit of uncertainty like,

00:27:30.188 --> 00:27:31.550
for example, maybe we can't--

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.700
there's a little bit of
noise in the sensor data.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.690
So you can be uncertain about
exactly the low level image

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.255
features.

00:27:39.255 --> 00:27:41.630
And then when you run one of
these probabilistic programs

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.840
in reverse to make a guess of
what configuration of blocks

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.720
is most likely to have
produced that image,

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.950
there is a little bit
of posterior uncertainty

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:54.530
that inherits from the fact that
you can't perfectly localize

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.220
those objects in the world.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.930
So again, what you see here
are three or four samples

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.910
from the posterior--
the distribution

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.220
over best guesses
of the world state

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.160
of 3D objects that were
most likely to have rendered

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.780
into that 2D image.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.270
And any one of those is now
an actionable representation

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.220
for physical manipulation
or reasoning.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.285
OK?

00:28:16.285 --> 00:28:17.660
And how we actually
compute that,

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.540
again, I'm not going
to go into right now.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.250
I'll go into something
like it in a minute.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.830
But at least in its
most basic form,

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.230
it involves some
rather unfortunately

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.720
slow random search
process through the space

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.870
of blocks models.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:33.900
Here's another example.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.050
This is another
configuration there--

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:36.830
another image.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.950
And here is a few samples
again from the posterior.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.200
And hopefully when you see
these things moving around,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.970
whether it's this one
or the one before,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.550
you see them move a little
bit, but most of them

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.780
look very similar.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.966
You'd be hard pressed
to tell the difference

00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:52.340
if you looked away for a second
between any one of those.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.930
Which one are you
actually seeing?

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.820
And that's exactly the point.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.000
The uncertainty you see there
is meant to capture basically

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.280
the uncertainty you
have in a single glance

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.420
at an image like that.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.430
You can't perfectly tell
where the blocks are.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.000
So basically any one
of these configurations

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.860
up here is about equally good.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.420
And we think your
intuitive physics,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.090
your sort of common sense
core intuitive physics

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.610
that even babies have,
is operating over one

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.310
or a few samples like that.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.840
Now in separate work
that is not really--

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.960
I think of it as really
about common sense,

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.293
but it's one of the things
we've been doing in our group

00:29:26.293 --> 00:29:28.709
and in CBMM where are these
ideas best make contact

00:29:28.709 --> 00:29:30.500
with the rest of what
people are doing here

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.530
and where we can really test
interesting neural hypotheses

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.780
potentially and
understand the interplay

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.940
between these generative
models for explanation

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.100
and the more sort of
neural-network-type models

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.207
for pattern recognition.

00:29:42.207 --> 00:29:43.790
We've been really
pushing on this idea

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.440
vision as inverse graphics.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.810
So I'll tell you a little
bit about that because it's

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.075
quite interesting for CBMM.

00:29:49.075 --> 00:29:51.800
But I want to make sure to only
do this for about five minutes

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.930
and then go back to
the how this gets

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:57.500
used for more the intuitive
physics and planning stuff.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.950
So this is this an example from
a paper by Tejas Kulkarni who's

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.750
one of our grad students.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.540
And it's joint work with a
few other really smart people

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.400
such as Vikash Mansinghka
who's a research

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.500
scientist at MIT
and Pushmeet Kohli

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.750
who's at Microsoft Research.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.380
And it was a computer vision
paper, pure computer vision

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.610
paper from the summer,
where he was developing

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.860
a specific kind of probabilistic
programming language,

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.200
but a general one for
doing this kind of vision

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.992
as inverse graphics
where you could give

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.200
a number of different models.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.574
Here I'll show you one for
faces, another one for bodies,

00:30:31.574 --> 00:30:33.030
another one for generic objects.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:38.250
But basically you can pretty
easily specify a graphics model

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.260
that when you run it in
the forward direction

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.260
generates random images of
objects in a certain class.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.420
And then you can run it
in the reverse direction

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.480
to do scene parsing
to go from the image

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.980
to the underlying scene.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.070
So here's an example
of this in faces

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:56.460
where the graphics model--
it's really very directly based

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.280
on work that Thomas Vetter,
who was a former student

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.870
or post-doc of
Tommy's actually, so

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.500
kind of a early
ancestor of CBMM, built.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.000
And his group in Basel,
Switzerland, where

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.570
it's a simple but
still pretty nice

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.090
graphics model for
making face images.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.550
There's a model of the shape
of the face, which again, it's

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.690
like a CAD model.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.520
It's a mesh surface description.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.390
Pretty fine-grained
structure of the 2D surface

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.430
of the face in 3D.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.710
And there is about
400 dimensions

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:28.374
to characterize the
possible shapes of faces.

00:31:28.374 --> 00:31:29.790
And there's another
400 dimensions

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.206
to characterize
the texture, which

00:31:31.206 --> 00:31:34.560
is like the skin, the beard,
the eyes, the color, and surface

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.779
properties that get
mapped on top of the mesh.

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:38.820
And then there's a little
bit more graphic stuff,

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.740
which is generic, not
specific to faces.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.530
That stuff is all
specific to faces.

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:43.890
But then there is a
simple lighting model.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.639
So you basically have
a point light source

00:31:45.639 --> 00:31:48.474
somewhere out there and you
shine the light on the face.

00:31:48.474 --> 00:31:49.890
It can produce
shadows, of course,

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.990
but not very complicated ones.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.284
And then there's a
viewpoint camera thing.

00:31:54.284 --> 00:31:56.700
So you put the light source
somewhere and you put a camera

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.530
somewhere specifying
the viewpoint.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.050
And the combination of these,
shape, texture, lighting,

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.680
and camera, give you a
complete graphic specification.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.000
It produces an image
of a particular face

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.920
lit from a particular
direction and viewed

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.870
from some particular
viewpoint and distance.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.870
And what you see on the
right are random samples

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.414
from this probabilistic
program, this generative model.

00:32:15.414 --> 00:32:16.830
So you can just
write this program

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.030
and press Go, Go, Go, Go, Go,
and every time you run it,

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.488
you get a new face viewed from
a new direction and lighting

00:32:21.488 --> 00:32:22.417
condition.

00:32:22.417 --> 00:32:23.250
So that's the prior.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.347
Now, what about inference?

00:32:28.347 --> 00:32:30.180
Well, the idea of vision
as inverse graphics

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.570
is to say take a real image
of a face like that one

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.179
and see if you can
produce from your graphics

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:37.720
model something that
looks like that.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.690
So, for example, here
in the lower left

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.360
is an example of a face that
was produced from the graphics

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.300
model that hopefully most of you
agree looks kind of like that.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.970
Maybe not exactly the
same, but kind of enough.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.170
And in building this system--

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.290
this system, by the
way, is called Picture.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.330
That's that first word
of the paper title,

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.769
too, the Kulkarni, et al. paper.

00:32:56.769 --> 00:32:58.810
There were a few neat
things that had to be done.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.351
One of the things
that had to be done

00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:03.259
was to come up with
various ways to say

00:33:03.259 --> 00:33:05.550
what does it mean for the
output of the graphics engine

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.150
to look like the image.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.450
In the case of faces,
actually matching up pixels

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:10.750
is not completely crazy.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.140
But for most vision
problems, it's

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.020
going to be unrealistic and
unnecessary to build a graphics

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.070
engine that's
pixel-level realistic.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.970
And so you might,
for example, want

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:25.062
to have something where the
graphics engine hypothesis is

00:33:25.062 --> 00:33:26.520
matched to the
image with something

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.739
like some kind of features.

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:30.030
Like it could be convolutional
neural network features.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.400
That's one way to use, for
example, neural networks

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.800
to make something
like this work well.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.590
And Jojen just showed me a
paper by some other folks

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.114
from Darmstadt,
which is doing what

00:33:39.114 --> 00:33:41.280
looks like a very interesting
similar kind of thing.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.330
Let me show what inference looks
like in this model and then

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.430
say what I think is an
even more interesting way

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:51.750
to use convolutional.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.620
And that's from another recent
paper we've been looking at.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.100
So here is, if you watch this,
this is one observed face.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.230
And what you're seeing
over here is just

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.140
a trace of the system
kind of searching

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.890
through the space of traces
of the graphics program.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.698
Basically trying
out random faces

00:34:08.698 --> 00:34:10.239
that might look like
that face there.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.106
It's using a kind
of MCMC inference.

00:34:12.106 --> 00:34:13.980
It's very similar to
what you're going to see

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.739
from Tomer in the tutorial.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.280
It basically starts
off with a random face

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.909
and takes a bunch of
small random steps

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:27.270
that are biased towards making
the image look more and more

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.973
like the actual observed image.

00:34:28.973 --> 00:34:30.389
And at the end,
you have something

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.031
which looks almost identical
to the observed face.

00:34:33.031 --> 00:34:35.489
The key, right, though, is that
though the observed face is

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:37.679
literally just a
2D image, the thing

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.659
you're seeing on the
right is a projection

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.610
of a 3D model of a face.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:45.570
And it's one that supports
a lot of causal action.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.020
So here just to show you
on a more interesting sort

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.170
of high-resolution set of face
images, the ones on the left

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.489
are observed images.

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:55.916
And then we fit this model.

00:34:55.916 --> 00:34:58.290
And then we can rotate it
around and change the lighting.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.749
If we had parameters that
control the expression--

00:35:00.749 --> 00:35:02.790
there's no real expression
parameters here-- that

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.710
wouldn't be too hard to put in.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.400
You could make us happy or sad.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.740
But you can see--

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.290
hopefully what you can see
is that the recovered model

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:12.840
supports fairly
reasonable generalization

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.874
to other viewpoints and
lighting conditions.

00:35:14.874 --> 00:35:16.290
It's the sort of
thing that should

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.951
make for more robust
face recognition.

00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:20.700
Although that's not
the main focus of what

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.360
we're trying to use it here.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.250
I just want to emphasize
there's all sorts of things that

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.791
would be useful if you had an
actual 3D model of the face you

00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.260
could get from a single image.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.600
Or here's the same kind of idea
now for a body pose system.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.585
So now, the image
we're going to assume

00:35:33.585 --> 00:35:35.460
has a person in it
somewhere doing something.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.751
Remember back to that challenge
I gave at the beginning

00:35:37.751 --> 00:35:41.400
about finding the bodies in a
complex scene like the airplane

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.880
full of computer
vision researchers

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.090
where you found the right
hand or the left toe.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.280
So in order to do
that, we think you

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.950
have to have something like
an actual 3D model of a body.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.840
What you see on
the lower left is

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.060
a bunch of samples from this.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:00.180
So we basically just took a kind
of interesting 3D stick figure

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.360
skeleton model and just
put some knobs on it.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.540
You can tweak it around.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.030
You can put some simple
probability models

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.720
to get a prior.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.095
And these are just
random samples

00:36:08.095 --> 00:36:09.502
of random body positions.

00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:11.460
And the idea of the system
is to kind of search

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.250
through that space
of body positions

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.800
until you find one, which
then when you project it

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.960
from a certain
camera angle looks

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.700
like the body you're seeing.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.510
So here is an example
of this in action.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:24.030
This is some guy--

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.090
I guess Usain Bolt. Some kind
of interesting slightly unusual

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.240
pose as he's about to break
the finish line maybe.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.280
And here is the
system in action.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.991
So it starts off from
a random position

00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:35.490
and, again, sort
of takes some takes

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.910
a bunch of random steps
moving around in 3D space

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.890
until it finds a
configuration, which

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.720
when you project it
into the image looks

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.270
like what you see there.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:48.600
Now, notice a key difference
when I say looks like--

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.050
it doesn't look like it at the
pixel level like the face did.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.530
It's only matching at the level
of these basically enhanced

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:57.280
edge statistics
which you see here.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.280
So this is an example of
building a model that's

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.160
not a photorealistic render.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.380
The graphics model is not
trying to match the image.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.880
It's trying to match this.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.130
Or it could be, for example,
some intermediate level

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:09.252
of convonet features.

00:37:09.252 --> 00:37:10.710
And we think this
is very powerful.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.420
Because more generally
while we might

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.040
have a really detailed model of
facial appearance, for bodies,

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.630
we don't have a
good clothing model.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:21.310
We're not trying
to model the skin.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.752
We're just trying
to model just enough

00:37:24.752 --> 00:37:26.460
to solve the problem
we're interested in.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.200
And again, this is reflective
of a much more broad theme

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.340
in this idea of
intelligence as explanation,

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.190
modeling the causal
structure of the world.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.047
We don't expect,
even in science,

00:37:37.047 --> 00:37:38.880
but certainly not in
our intuitive theories,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.820
to model the causal structure
of the world at full detail.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.110
And a way that either I am
always misunderstood or always

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.582
fail to communicate--
it's my fault really--

00:37:48.582 --> 00:37:50.790
is I say, oh, we have these
rich models of the world.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.800
People often think
that means that somehow

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.800
the complete thing.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.680
Like if I say we have a
physics engine in our head,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.720
it means we have all of physics.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.303
Of if I say we have
a graphics engine,

00:37:58.303 --> 00:38:00.330
we have all of every
possible thing.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.250
This isn't Pixar.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.280
We're not trying to
make a beautiful movie,

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.170
except maybe for faces.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.980
We're just trying to capture
just the key parts, just

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.925
the key causal parts
of the way things move

00:38:13.925 --> 00:38:16.050
in the world as physical
objects and the way images

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.510
are formed that at the
right level of abstraction

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:22.560
that matters for us allows
us to do what we need to do.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.910
This is just an
example of our system

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:31.230
solving some pretty challenging
body pose recognition problems

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:34.540
in 3D, cases which
are problematic

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.070
even for the best of standard
computer vision systems.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.510
Either because
it's a weird pose,

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.090
like these weird sports
figures, or because the body

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.355
is heavily occluded.

00:38:43.355 --> 00:38:45.730
But I think, again, these are
problems which people solve

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:46.590
effortlessly.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.840
And I think something
like this is

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.341
on the track of
what we want to do.

00:38:50.341 --> 00:38:51.840
You can apply the
same kind of thing

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.820
to more generic
objects like this,

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.700
but I'm not going to
go into the details.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.408
The last thing I want
to say about vision

00:38:58.408 --> 00:39:02.490
before getting back to common
sense for a few minutes--

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.310
and in some sense, maybe this
is the most important slide

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.370
for the broader CBMM, brains,
minds, and machines thing.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.410
Because this is
the clearest thing

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.807
I can point to to the thing
I've been saying all along

00:39:12.807 --> 00:39:14.640
since the beginning of
the morning about how

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.090
we want to look for ways to
combine the generative model

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.520
view and the pattern
recognition view.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.980
So the generative model is
what you see on the left here.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:24.370
It's the arrows going down.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.430
It's exactly just the
face graphics engine,

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.130
the same thing I showed you.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:33.060
The thing on the right with the
arrows going up is a convonet.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.440
Basically it's a
out-of-the-box, cafe-style,

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.180
convolutional neural net with
some fully connected layers

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:39.921
on the top.

00:39:39.921 --> 00:39:41.670
And then there's a few
other dashed arrows

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:45.330
which represent linear decoders
from layers of that model

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.670
to other things,
which are basically

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.320
parts of the generative model.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.835
And the idea here-- this is
work due to Ilker Yildirim, who

00:39:51.835 --> 00:39:52.960
some of you might have met.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.600
He was here the other day.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.840
He's one of our CBMM
postdocs, but also

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.210
joint with Tejas and with
Winrich who you saw before.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.540
It's to try to in
several senses combine

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.790
the best of these
perspectives, to say, look,

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.244
if we want to recognize
anything or perceive

00:40:10.244 --> 00:40:11.660
the structure of
the world richly,

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.450
I think it needs to be something
like this inverse graphics

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:16.074
or inverting a graphics program.

00:40:16.074 --> 00:40:17.240
But you saw how slow it was.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.239
You saw how it took a
couple of seconds at least

00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:21.380
on our computer just
for faces to search

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.310
through the space
of faces to come up

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.518
with a convincing hypothesis.

00:40:23.518 --> 00:40:24.380
That's way too slow.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.970
It doesn't take that long.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.300
We know a lot about exactly how
long it takes you from Winrich,

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.060
and Nancy's, and many
other people's work.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.390
So how can vision in this case,
or really much more generally,

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.840
be so rich in terms of the
model it builds, yet so fast?

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.730
Well, here's a
proposal, which is

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:44.570
to take the things that are good
at being fast like the pattern

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.524
recognizers, deep
ones, and train

00:40:47.524 --> 00:40:49.190
them to solve the
hard inference problem

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.440
or at least to do
most of the work.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.540
It's an idea which is
very heavily inspired

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.550
by an older idea
of Geoff Hinton's

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:58.010
sometimes called the
Helmholtz machine.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.250
Here the idea in
common with Hinton

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.300
is to have a generative
model and a recognition model

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.460
where the recognition
model is a neural network

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.740
and it's trained to invert
the generative the model.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:15.620
Namely, it's trained to map not
from sense data to task output,

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.290
but from sense data to
the hidden deep causes

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.020
of the generative model, which
then, when you want to use this

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:26.630
to act to plan what you're going
to do, you plan on the model.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.390
To make an analogy to say the
DeepMind video game player,

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:31.280
this would be like
having a system which,

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.380
in contrast to the
DeepQ network, which

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.050
mapped from pixel images
to joystick commands,

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:38.600
this would be like
learning a network that

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.316
maps from pixel images
to the game state,

00:41:40.316 --> 00:41:42.440
to the objects, the sprites
that are moving around,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.760
the score, and so on,
and then plans on that.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:50.190
And I think that's much more
like what people do is that.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.990
Here just in the
limited case of faces,

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.031
what are we doing, right?

00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:55.860
So what we've got
here is we take

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.080
this convolutional
neural network.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.570
We train it in ways that you
can read about in the paper.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:05.400
It's very easy kind of training
to basically make predictions,

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.260
to make guesses
about all the latent

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.510
variables, the shape, the
texture, the lighting,

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.160
the camera angle.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.160
And then you take those
guesses, and they start off

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.150
that Markov chain.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.614
So instead of starting off at
a random graphics hypothesis,

00:42:17.614 --> 00:42:19.030
you start off at
a pretty good one

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.520
and then refine it a little bit.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.978
What you can see
here in these blue

00:42:21.978 --> 00:42:29.220
and red curves is the blue
curve is the course of inference

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.820
for the model I
showed you before,

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.820
where you start off
at a random guess,

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.380
and after, I don't know, 100
iterations of MCMC, you improve

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.650
and you kind of get there.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.025
Whereas the red
curve is what you

00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:42.400
see if you start off with
the guess of this recognition

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:42.900
model.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.060
And you can see that
you start off sort

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.732
of in some sense almost as good
as you're ever going to get,

00:42:47.732 --> 00:42:48.690
and then you refine it.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:49.930
Well, it might look
like you we're just

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.180
were refining it a little bit.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.070
But this is a kind of
a double log scale.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.140
It's a log plot of
log probability.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.680
So what looks like a little
bit there on the red curve

00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.890
is actually a lot--

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.470
I mean perceptually.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.900
You can see it here where
if you take-- on the top

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.360
I'm showing observed
input faces.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.920
On the bottom I'm
showing the result

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.480
of this full inverse
graphics thing.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.063
And they should look
almost identical.

00:43:11.063 --> 00:43:14.534
So the full model is able to
basically perfectly invert this

00:43:14.534 --> 00:43:16.200
and come up with a
face that really does

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.492
look like the one on the top.

00:43:17.492 --> 00:43:19.200
The ones in the middle
are the best guess

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.824
you get from this
neural network that's

00:43:20.824 --> 00:43:23.425
been trained to approximately
invert the generative model.

00:43:23.425 --> 00:43:25.050
And what you can see
is on first glance

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.280
it should look pretty good.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.080
But if you pay a little
bit of attention,

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.310
you can see differences.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.340
Like hopefully you can see
this person is not actually

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.862
that person in a way that this
is much more convincingly.

00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:36.570
Or this person-- this
one is pretty good,

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.500
but I think this one--

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.210
I think it's pretty
easy to say, yeah,

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.085
this isn't quite the
same person as that one.

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:41.980
Do you guys agree?

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.464
We've done some
experiments to verify this.

00:43:44.464 --> 00:43:46.380
But hopefully they should
look pretty similar,

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.410
and that's the point.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:52.590
How do you combine the best of
these computational paradigms?

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.030
How can perception
more generally

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.500
be so rich and so fast?

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.150
Well, quite possibly like this.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:01.362
It even actually might
provide some insight

00:44:01.362 --> 00:44:03.570
into the neural circuitry
that Winrich and Doris Tsao

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.640
and others have mapped out.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.950
We think that this
recognition model that's

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:09.840
trained to invert
the graphics model

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.090
can provide a really nice
account of some of Winrich's

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.230
data like you saw before.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:14.910
But I will not go
into the details

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:17.700
because in maybe
five to 10 minutes

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.430
I want to get back to
physics and psychology.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:25.061
So physics-- and there won't
be any more neural networks.

00:44:25.061 --> 00:44:26.310
Because that's about as much--

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:32.769
I mean, I think we'd like to
take those ways of integrating

00:44:32.769 --> 00:44:34.560
the best of these
approaches and apply them

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.610
to these more general cases.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.980
But that's about as
far as we can get.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.240
Here what I want to just
give you a taste of at least

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.550
is how we're using
ideas just purely

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.590
from probabilistic
programs to capture

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.791
more of this common sense
physics and psychology.

00:44:45.791 --> 00:44:47.790
So let's say we can solve
this problem by making

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.620
a good guess of
the 3D world state

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.860
from the image very quickly
inverting this graphics engine.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.880
Now, we can start to do
some physical reasoning,

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.910
a la Craik's mental model of in
the head of the physical world,

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:02.760
where we now take a
physics engine, which is--

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.340
here again we're using the
kind of physics engines

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.610
that game physics--

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.900
like very simple--
again, I don't have time

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.070
to go into the details.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.730
Although Tomer has written a
very nice paper with, well,

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:15.330
with himself.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:19.620
But he's nicely put my
name and Liz's on it--

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.660
about sort of
trying to introduce

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.490
some of the basic
game engine concepts

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.170
to cognitive scientists.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.766
So hopefully we'll be able
to show you that soon too.

00:45:27.766 --> 00:45:28.890
Or you can read about them.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.973
Basically it's that these
physics engines are just

00:45:30.973 --> 00:45:36.090
doing again a very quick, fast,
approximate implementation

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.632
of certain aspects of
Newtonian mechanics.

00:45:38.632 --> 00:45:40.340
Sufficient that if
you run it a few times

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.915
steps with a
configuration of objects

00:45:41.915 --> 00:45:43.290
like that you
might get something

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.120
like what you see over
there on the right.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.970
That's an example of running
this approximate Newtonian

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:50.260
physics forward
a few time steps.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.500
Here's another sample from
this model, another kind

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.180
of mental stimulation.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.790
We take a slightly different
guess of the world state,

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:58.560
and we run that forward
a few time steps,

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.794
and you see something
else happens.

00:46:00.794 --> 00:46:03.210
Nothing here is claimed to be
accurate in the ground truth

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:03.979
way.

00:46:03.979 --> 00:46:06.270
Neither one of these is
exactly the right configuration

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.020
of blocks.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.000
And you run this thing forward,
and it only approximately

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.208
captures the way blocks
really bounce off each other.

00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:14.092
It's a hard problem to actually
totally realistically simulate.

00:46:14.092 --> 00:46:16.050
But our point is that
you don't really have to.

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.330
You just have to make
a reasonable guess

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:20.910
of the position of the
blocks and a reasonable guess

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:23.250
of what's going to happen a
few time steps in the future

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:25.110
to predict what you need to
know and common sense, which

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.776
is that, wow, that's
going to fall over.

00:46:26.776 --> 00:46:28.410
I better do something about it.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.510
And that's what our
experiment taps into.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.220
We give people a
whole bunch of stimuli

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.290
like the ones I showed
you and ask them,

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.760
on some graded
scale, how likely do

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.320
you think it is to fall over?

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.510
And what you see here--

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:43.770
this is again one of those plots
that always are the same where

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:46.920
on the y-axis are the average
human judgments now of-- it's

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.657
an estimate of how
unstable the tower is.

00:46:48.657 --> 00:46:50.490
It's both the probability
that it will fall,

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.410
but also how much of
the tower will fall.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.270
So it's like the
expected proportion

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.870
of the tower that's going
to fall over under gravity.

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:59.110
And along the x-axis is
the model prediction,

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.669
which is just the average
of a few samples from what

00:47:01.669 --> 00:47:02.210
I showed you.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:04.170
You just take a few
guesses of the world state,

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:06.210
run it forward a few
time steps, count up

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.065
the proportion of blocks
it fell, and average that.

00:47:09.065 --> 00:47:10.440
And what you can
see is that does

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:15.270
a really nice job of predicting
people's stability intuitions.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:17.790
I'll just point to an
interesting comparison.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.320
Because it does come into where.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.410
Where does the
probability come in

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:21.330
in these probabilistic programs?

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.280
Well, here's one
very noticeable way.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.690
So if you look down
there on the lower right,

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:29.740
you'll see a smaller
version of a similar plot.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.640
It's plotting now
the results of--

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.140
it says ground truth physics,
but that's a little misleading

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:34.639
maybe.

00:47:34.639 --> 00:47:36.210
It's just a noiseless
physics engine.

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:37.699
So we take the
same physics model,

00:47:37.699 --> 00:47:39.740
but we get rid of any of
the state uncertainties.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.810
So we tell it the true
position of the blocks,

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.340
and we give it the true physics.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.830
Whereas our probabilistic
physics engine

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.110
allows for some uncertainty
in exactly which forces

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.070
are doing what.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:52.860
But here we say we're just going
to model gravity, friction,

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.880
collisions as best we can.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.320
And we're going to get the
state of the blocks perfectly.

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.000
And because it's noiseless,
you notice that--

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.157
so those crosses over
there are crosses

00:48:03.157 --> 00:48:05.490
because they're arrow bars,
both across people and model

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:06.047
simulations.

00:48:06.047 --> 00:48:07.380
Now they're just vertical lines.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.254
There's no arrow bars
in the model simulation

00:48:09.254 --> 00:48:10.600
because it's deterministic.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.100
It's graded because there's the
proportion of the tower that

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:13.620
falls over.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.630
But what you see is the
model is a lot worse.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.520
It scatters much more.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.620
The correlation
dropped from around 0.9

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.890
to around 0.6 in terms
of correlation of model

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:24.060
with people's judgments.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.310
And you have some cases
like this red dot here--

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.380
that corresponds
to this stimulus--

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.720
which goes from being a
really nice model fit.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.280
This is one which people
judged to be very unstable,

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.370
and so does the
probabilistic physics engine.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:37.930
But actually it's
not unstable at all.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:39.330
It's actually perfectly stable.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:41.370
The blocks are actually
just perfectly balanced

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:42.180
so that it doesn't fall.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.888
Although I'm sure
everybody looks at that

00:48:43.888 --> 00:48:45.240
and finds that hard to believe.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.060
So this is nice.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.670
This is a kind of
physics illusion.

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:50.400
There are real world versions
of this out on the beaches

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.260
not too far from here.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:54.990
It's a fun thing to do to
stack up objects in ways

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.180
that are surprisingly stable.

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.260
We would say a surprise
because your intuitive physics

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.410
has certain irreducible noise.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:09.180
What we're suggesting here is
that your physical intuitions--

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.040
you're always in
some sense making

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.440
a guess that's sensitive to
the uncertainty about where

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.470
things might be and what forces
might be active on the world.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:19.080
And it's very hard to see
these as deterministic physics,

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.330
even when you know that
that's exactly what's going on

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.190
and that it is stable.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.290
Let me say just a little
bit about planning.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.170
So how might you use
this kind of model

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:32.120
to build some model of this
core intuitive psychology?

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.016
And I don't mean here
all of theory of mind.

00:49:35.016 --> 00:49:36.390
Next week, we'll
hear a lot more.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.889
Like Rebecca Saxe
will be down here.

00:49:37.889 --> 00:49:41.604
We'll hear a lot more about
much richer kinds of reasoning

00:49:41.604 --> 00:49:43.020
about other people's
mental states

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.030
that adults and older
children can do.

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.130
But here we're
talking about, just

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:48.960
as we were talking
about what I was calling

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.350
core intuitive physics, again
inspired by Liz's work of just

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:56.010
you know what objects do right
here on the table top around us

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.054
over short time scales,
the core theory of mind,

00:49:59.054 --> 00:50:01.470
something that even very young
babies can do in some form,

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.160
or at least young children.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.680
There's controversy over
exactly what age kids can be

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.930
able to do this sort of thing.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:13.210
But in some form I
think before language,

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:17.010
it's the kind of thing that when
you're starting to learn verbs,

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.382
the earliest language
is kind of mentalistic

00:50:19.382 --> 00:50:20.590
and builds on this knowledge.

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:24.180
And take the red and blue ball
chasing scene that you saw,

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.260
remember from Tomer.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.310
That was 13-month-olds.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:29.850
So there's definitely some
form of kind of interpretation

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:32.220
of beliefs and desires
in some protoform

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:36.430
that you can see even in infants
of around one year of age.

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:38.546
And it's exactly that
kind of thing also.

00:50:38.546 --> 00:50:40.920
Remember that, if you saw John
Leonard's talk yesterday--

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.410
he was the robotics guy who
talked about self-driving cars

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:46.110
and how there's certain
gaps in what they

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.700
can do despite the
all the publicity,

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.250
like the can't
turn left basically

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:52.124
in an unrestricted intersection.

00:50:52.124 --> 00:50:53.790
Because there's a
certain kind of theory

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.689
of mind in street scenes when
cars could be coming and people

00:50:56.689 --> 00:50:58.230
could be crossing
or all those things

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:00.229
about the police officers.

00:51:00.229 --> 00:51:01.770
Part of why this is
so exciting to me

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:04.590
and why I love that talk is
because this is, I think,

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:06.840
that same common sense
knowledge that if we can really

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.510
figure out how to capture
this reasoning about beliefs

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:11.580
and desires in the
limited context

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.250
where desires are people moving
around in space around us

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.560
and the beliefs
are who can see who

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.980
and who can see
who can see who--

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.960
in driving, the art of making
eye contact with other drivers

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.559
or pedestrians is seeing
that they can see you

00:51:24.559 --> 00:51:26.100
or that they can
see what you can see

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.930
and that they can see
you seeing you them.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.910
It doesn't have to be
super deeply recursive,

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.537
but it's a couple
of layers deep.

00:51:31.537 --> 00:51:33.370
We don't have to think
about it consciously,

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:35.050
but we have to be able to do it.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:37.059
So that's the kind
of core belief desire

00:51:37.059 --> 00:51:38.100
theory of mind reasoning.

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.500
And here's how we've
tried to capture this

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.110
with probabilistic programs.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:47.080
This is work that Chris Baker
started doing a few years ago.

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.250
And a lot of it
joint Rebecca Saxe

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:53.820
and also some of it with Julian
Jara-Ettinger and some of it

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:54.510
with Tomer.

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:55.410
So there's a whole
bunch of us who've

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:56.620
been working on
versions of this,

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.411
but I'll just show you
one or two examples.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:08.730
Again, the key programs here
are not graphics or physics

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.200
engines, but planning engines
and perception engines.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.090
So very simple kinds
of robotics programs,

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:18.210
far too simple in
this form to build

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:20.760
a self-driving car
or a humanoid robot,

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.520
but maybe the kind of thing that
in game robots like the zombie

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.460
or the security guard
in Quake or something

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.720
might do something like this.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.100
So planning basically just
means it's a little bit more

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.220
than sort of shortest
path planning.

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.890
But it's basically like
find a sequence of actions

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:39.720
in a simple world
like moving around

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.490
a 2D environment that maximizes
your long run expected reward.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:46.050
So there's a kind
of utility theory,

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:49.340
or what Laura Schulz calls a
naive utility calculus, here.

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.800
A calculation of costs and
benefits where in a sense

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.620
you get a big reward,
a good positive utility

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.740
for getting to your goal and a
small cost for each action you

00:52:58.740 --> 00:52:59.640
take.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.525
And under that view,
then in some sense--

00:53:03.525 --> 00:53:06.600
and some actions might be
costly than others, something

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.690
that Tomer is looking at
in infants and something

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:11.430
that Julian
Jara-Ettinger has looked

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:13.890
at in older kids, this
understanding of that.

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:15.832
But this sort of basic
cost-benefit trade

00:53:15.832 --> 00:53:18.984
off that is going on whenever
you move around an environment

00:53:18.984 --> 00:53:21.150
and decide, well, is it
worthwhile to go all the way

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:24.330
over there, or, well, I know
I like the coffee up at Pie

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:26.850
in the Sky better than the
coffee in the dining hall

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:27.540
here at Swope.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.090
But to think about, am I
going to be to my lecture?

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:31.830
Am I going to be late
to Nancy's lecture?

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.870
Those are different costs--

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.130
both costs.

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:36.600
It's that kind of calculation.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:42.310
So here let me
get more concrete.

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:44.580
So here's an example
of an experiment

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:46.980
that Chris did a few years
ago where, again, it's

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.540
like what you saw what the
Heider and Simmel, the squares

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.230
and the triangles and
circles or the south gate

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.840
and chibra, the red and blue
balls chasing each other.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:56.280
Very simple stuff.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.450
Here you see an agent.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.890
It's like an overhead
view of a room,

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.290
2D environment from the top.

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.270
The agents moving
along some path.

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.384
There are three possible
goals, A, B, or C.

00:54:06.384 --> 00:54:08.550
And then there's maybe some
obstacles or constraints

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:10.505
like a wall like like
you saw in those movies.

00:54:10.505 --> 00:54:12.630
Maybe the wall has a hole
that he can pass through.

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.190
Maybe it doesn't.

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:16.194
And across different
trials of the experiment,

00:54:16.194 --> 00:54:18.360
just like in the physics
stuff we vary all the block

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.900
configurations and so on, here
we vary where the goals are.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.790
We vary whether the
wall has a hole or not.

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.440
We vary the agent's path.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.440
On different trials, we also
stop it at different points.

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.600
Because we're trying to
see as you watch this agent

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.060
move around, action
unfolds over time.

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:36.570
How do your guesses about
his goal change over time?

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:39.060
And what you see--

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.570
so these are just examples
of a few of the scenes.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:44.590
And here what you see
are examples of the data.

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:47.680
Again, the y-axis is the
average human judgment.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.680
Red, blue, and green is
color coded to the goal.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.055
They're just asked,
how likely do

00:54:51.055 --> 00:54:53.490
you think each of those
three things is his goal?

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.810
And then here the
x-axis is time.

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:58.830
So these are time steps that
we ask at different points

00:54:58.830 --> 00:54:59.952
along the trajectory.

00:54:59.952 --> 00:55:01.410
And what you can
see is that people

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.571
are making various systematic
kinds of judgments.

00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:05.820
Sometimes they're not sure
whether his goal is A or B,

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.010
but they know it's
not C. And then

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.837
after a little while or
some key stat happens,

00:55:10.837 --> 00:55:12.670
and now they're quite
sure it's A and not B.

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:14.430
Or they could change their mind.

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:18.480
Here people were pretty sure it
was either green or red but not

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.390
blue.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:21.150
And then there comes a point
where it's surely not green,

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:22.316
but it might be blue or red.

00:55:22.316 --> 00:55:23.480
Oh no, then it's red.

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.290
Here they were pretty
sure it was green.

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:26.910
Then no, definitely not green.

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.250
And now, I think it's red.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:29.850
It was probably never blue.

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:30.780
OK.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:32.640
And the really
striking thing to us

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.000
is how closely, you can
match those judgments

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.250
with this very simple
probabilistic planning

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:39.552
program run in reverse.

00:55:39.552 --> 00:55:41.510
So we take, again, this
simple planning program

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:44.850
that just says basically just
kind of get as efficiently

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:46.237
as possible to your goal.

00:55:46.237 --> 00:55:47.820
I don't know what
your goal is though.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.370
I observe your actions that
result from an efficient plan,

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:52.100
and I want to work
backwards to say,

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.850
what do I think your
goal is, your desire,

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:55.290
the rewarding state?

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:57.090
And just doing
that just basically

00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:58.830
perfectly predicts
people's data.

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:00.990
I mean, of all the
mathematical models of behavior

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:02.760
I've ever had a
hand in building,

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.190
this one works the best.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.600
It's really quite striking.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.130
To me it was striking
because I came

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:11.310
in thinking this would be a
very high-level, weird, flaky,

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:13.230
hard-to-model thing.

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:14.760
Here's just one
more example of one

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.350
of these things, which
actually puts beliefs in there,

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:18.090
not just desires.

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:19.950
So it's a key part of
intuitive psychology

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.670
that we do joint inference
over beliefs and desires.

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:26.040
In this one here, we assume
that you, the subject,

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.750
the agent who's moving
around, all of us

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:29.716
have shared full
knowledge of the world.

00:56:29.716 --> 00:56:31.090
So we know where
the objects are.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:31.830
We know where the holes are.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:33.270
There's none of
this false belief,

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:36.090
like you think something
is there when it isn't.

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:38.010
Now, here's some
later work that Chris

00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:42.575
did, what we call the
food truck studies,

00:56:42.575 --> 00:56:44.700
where here we add in some
uncertainty about beliefs

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.080
in addition to desires.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.330
And it's easiest just to
explain with this one example

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:49.940
up there in the upper left.

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:54.390
So here, and this, like a
lot of university campuses,

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:56.720
lunch is best found
at food trucks,

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.540
which can park in different
spots around campus.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.840
Here the two yellow squares
show the two parking spots

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.467
on this part of campus.

00:57:04.467 --> 00:57:06.050
And there are several
different trucks

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:07.490
that can come and park
in different places

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.240
on different days.

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.350
There's a Korean truck.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:10.350
That's k.

00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:11.600
There's a Lebanese truck.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.522
That's l.

00:57:12.522 --> 00:57:14.480
There's also other trucks
like a Mexican truck.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:15.900
But there's only two spots.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.780
So if the Korean won parks
there and the Lebanese one

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.821
parks there, the Mexican
has to go somewhere else

00:57:19.821 --> 00:57:21.470
or can't come there today.

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:24.150
And on some days the trucks
park in different places.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:26.290
Or a spot could
also be unoccupied.

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:28.070
The trucks could be elsewhere.

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:29.870
So look at what
happens on this day.

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:33.830
Our friendly grad
student, Harold,

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:35.550
comes out from his office here.

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:38.000
And importantly, the way we
model interesting notions

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.874
of evolving belief
is that now we've

00:57:39.874 --> 00:57:41.790
got that perception and
inference arrow there.

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:43.550
So Harold forms his
belief about what's

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:44.870
where based on what he can see.

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:47.420
And it's just the simplest
perception model, just

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.710
line-of-sight access.

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:51.470
We assume he can kind of see
anything that's unobstructed

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:52.490
in his line of sight.

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:56.270
So that means that
when he comes out here,

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:59.389
he can see that there is
the Korean truck here.

00:57:59.389 --> 00:58:01.430
But you can't see-- this
is a wall or a building.

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:03.722
He can't see what's on
the other side of that.

00:58:03.722 --> 00:58:04.680
OK, so what does he do?

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.721
Well, he walks down here.

00:58:05.721 --> 00:58:07.471
He goes past the Korean
truck, goes around

00:58:07.471 --> 00:58:08.762
the other side of the building.

00:58:08.762 --> 00:58:10.340
Now at this point,
his line of sight

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:11.715
gives him-- he
can see that there

00:58:11.715 --> 00:58:13.280
is a Lebanese truck there.

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.920
He turns around, and he goes
back to the Korean truck.

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.310
So the question for you is,
what is his favorite truck?

00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:21.702
Is it Korean,
Lebanese, or Mexican?

00:58:21.702 --> 00:58:22.646
AUDIENCE: Mexican.

00:58:22.646 --> 00:58:23.510
PROFESSOR: Mexican,
yeah, it doesn't sound

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:24.950
very hard to figure that out.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:27.500
But it's quite interesting
because the Mexican one

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.080
isn't even in the scene.

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.660
The most basic kind of goal
recognition-- and this,

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.660
again, cuts right to the
heart of the difference

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.681
between recognition
and explanation.

00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:39.680
There's been a lot of
progress in machine vision

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.290
systems for action
understanding, action

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:43.880
recognition, and so on.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:48.110
And they do things like, for
example, they take video.

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:50.699
And the best cue that
somebody wants something

00:58:50.699 --> 00:58:52.490
is if they reach for
it or move towards it.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:54.740
And that's certainly
what was going on here.

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.800
In all of these scenes,
your best inference

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.426
about what the guy's
goal is is which

00:59:00.426 --> 00:59:01.550
thing is he moving towards.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:03.650
And it's just
subtle to parse out

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:05.150
the relative degrees
of confidence

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:08.550
when there's a complex
environment with constraints.

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:10.400
But in every case,
by the end it's

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.350
clear he's going for
one thing, and the thing

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.660
he is moving towards
is the thing he wants.

00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.880
But here you have
no trouble realizing

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.680
that his goal is
something that isn't

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.095
even present in the scene.

00:59:20.095 --> 00:59:21.470
Yet he's still
moving towards it.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:23.990
In a sense, he's moving towards
his mental representation

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:25.190
of it.

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:30.300
He's moving towards the Mexican
truck in his mind's model.

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.230
And that's him explaining
the data he sees.

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:34.882
For some reason,
he must have had

00:59:34.882 --> 00:59:37.340
maybe a prior belief that the
Mexican truck would be there.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.140
So he formed a plan to go there.

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:41.180
And in fact, we can
ask people not only

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.474
which truck does he like--
it's his Mexican truck.

00:59:43.474 --> 00:59:45.390
That's what people say,
and here is the model.

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:47.420
But we also asked them
a belief inference.

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.060
We say, prior to
setting out, what

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.089
did Harold think was
on the other side?

00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:54.380
What was parked in the other
spot that he couldn't see?

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.050
Did he think it was Lebanese,
Mexican, or neither?

00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:58.300
And we ask a degree of belief.

00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.692
So you could say he had no idea.

00:59:59.692 --> 01:00:01.400
But interestingly,
people say he probably

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.358
thought it was Mexican.

01:00:02.358 --> 01:00:05.510
Because how else could you
explain what he's doing?

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:09.440
So I mean, if I had to point to
just one example of cognition

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.090
as explanation, it's this.

01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:14.630
The only sensible way, and it's
a very intuitive and compelling

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:17.960
way to explain why did
he go the way he did

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.830
and then turn around
just when he did

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:23.360
and wind up just where he did,
is this set of six instances

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.200
basically.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.480
That his favorite is
Mexican, his second favorite

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.460
is Korean-- that's also
important-- his least

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.960
favorite is Lebanese.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.480
And he thought that
Mexican was there,

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.730
which is why it was
worthwhile to go and check.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:36.710
At least, he thought
it was likely.

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:37.850
He wasn't sure, right?

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.010
Notice it's not very high.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:41.630
But it it's more likely than
the other possibilities.

01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:44.090
Because, of course, if he was
quite sure it was Lebanese,

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.560
well, he wouldn't have
bothered to go around there.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.610
And in fact, you do see that.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:47.330
So you have ones--

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.621
I guess I don't have them here.

01:00:48.621 --> 01:00:50.960
But there are scenes where
he just goes straight here.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.480
And then that's consistent
with him thinking possibly it

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.320
was Lebanese.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.820
And if he thought
nothing was there,

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.340
well, again, he wouldn't
have gone to check.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.770
And again, this model is
extremely quantitatively

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:05.510
predictive of people's judgments
about both desires and beliefs.

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:08.195
You can read in some
of Battaglia's papers

01:01:08.195 --> 01:01:10.320
ways in which you take the
very same physics engine

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.650
and use it for all these
different tasks, including

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:14.750
sort of slightly weird
ones like these tasks.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:16.220
If you bump the
table, are you more

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.010
likely to knock off red
blocks or yellow blocks?

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:22.430
Not a task you ever got any
end-to-end training on, right?

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:24.980
But an example of
the compositionality

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:26.810
of your model and your task.

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.310
Somebody asked me
this during lunch,

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:31.340
and I think it is a key point
to make about compositionality.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:34.310
One of the key ways in
which compositionality

01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:37.004
works in this view of the
mind, as opposed to the pattern

01:01:37.004 --> 01:01:38.420
recognition view
or the way, let's

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.130
say, like a DeepQ
network works--

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.410
AUDIENCE: You mean
the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:45.680
PROFESSOR: Just ways of getting
a very flexible repertoire

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.230
of inferences from composing
pieces without having

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:50.840
to train specifically for it.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.930
It's that if you have
a physics engine,

01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:55.209
you can simulate
the physical world.

01:01:55.209 --> 01:01:57.250
You can answer questions
that you've never gotten

01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:58.564
any training at all to solve.

01:01:58.564 --> 01:01:59.980
So in this experiment
here, we ask

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.879
people, if you bump
the table hard enough

01:02:01.879 --> 01:02:03.670
to knock some of the
blocks onto the floor,

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.544
is it more likely to be
red or yellow blocks?

01:02:05.544 --> 01:02:07.630
Unlike questions
of will this tower

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:09.400
fall over, which we've made a
lot of judgments of that sort.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.358
You've never made that
kind of judgment before.

01:02:11.358 --> 01:02:12.550
It's a slightly weird one.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:13.840
But you have no
trouble making it.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.760
And for many different
configurations of blocks,

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.990
you make various
grade adjustments,

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:19.330
and the model captures it
perfectly with no extra stuff

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:20.080
put in.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.030
You just you just
take the same model,

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:23.830
and you ask it a
different question.

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:26.410
So if our dream is to
build AI systems that

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.210
can answer questions,
for example, which

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.040
a lot of people's
dream is, I think

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.170
there's really no
compelling alternative

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.160
to something like this.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.534
That you build a model that
you can ask all the questions

01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:36.920
of that you'd want to ask.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.700
And in this limited domain,
again, it's just our Atari.

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.290
In this limited
domain of reasoning

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.880
about the physics of blocks,
it's really pretty cool

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.490
what this physics
engine is able to do

01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:47.079
with many kinds of questions.

01:02:47.079 --> 01:02:49.120
It can reason about things
with different masses.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.920
It can make guesses
about the masses.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.570
You can make fun of the
objects bigger or smaller.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:56.806
You can attach constraints
like fences to the table.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.930
And the same model, without
any fundamental change,

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:00.130
can answer all these questions.

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:01.588
So it doesn't have
to be retrained.

01:03:01.588 --> 01:03:03.490
Because there's
basically no training.

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:05.080
It's just reasoning.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.399
If we want to understand
how learning works,

01:03:07.399 --> 01:03:09.190
we first have to
understand what's learned.

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:10.960
I think right now,
we're only at the point

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.418
where we're starting
to really have

01:03:12.418 --> 01:03:15.950
a sense of what are these mental
models of the physical world

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:17.440
and intentional action--

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.400
these probabilistic programs
that even young children

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.415
are using to reason
about the world.

01:03:23.415 --> 01:03:24.790
And then it's a
separate question

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:27.550
how those are built up
through some combination

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:34.090
of scientific discovery sorts
of processes and evolution.

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:36.265
So here's the story,
and I've told most

01:03:36.265 --> 01:03:37.390
of what I want to tell you.

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:40.836
But the rest you'll
get to hear--

01:03:40.836 --> 01:03:42.460
some of it you'll
get to hear next week

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:45.190
from both our
developmental colleagues

01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:46.480
and from me and Tomer.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.897
More on the computational side.

01:03:47.897 --> 01:03:49.480
But actually the
most interesting part

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.644
we just don't know yet.

01:03:50.644 --> 01:03:52.810
So we hope you will actually
write that next chapter

01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:53.800
of this story.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.630
But here's the outlines of
where we currently see things.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:02.080
We think that we have a good
target for what is really

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.751
the core of human intelligence,
what makes us so smart in terms

01:04:04.751 --> 01:04:06.250
of these ideas of
both what we start

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:09.790
with, this common sense
core physics and psychology,

01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:12.590
and how those things grow.

01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:16.390
What are the learning mechanisms
that I've just justified.

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:20.260
Again, more next week on the
sort of science-like mechanisms

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.740
of hypothesis formation,
experiment testing, play,

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:27.280
exploration that you can use to
build these intuitive theories,

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.182
much like scientists build
their scientific theories.

01:04:30.182 --> 01:04:32.140
And that we're starting
on the engineering side

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.780
to have tools to capture this,
both to capture the knowledge

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.390
and how it might
grow through the use

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.800
of probabilistic
programs and things

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.410
that sometimes go by the name
of program induction or program

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.340
synthesis.

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.170
Or if you like
hierarchical Bayes

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:46.720
on programs that generate
other programs where

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.380
the search for a good program is
like the inference of a program

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.170
that best explains the data as
generated from a prior that's

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:54.820
a higher level program.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:57.160
If you go to the
tutorial from Tomer

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.684
you'll actually see
building blocks.

01:04:58.684 --> 01:05:00.100
You can write
Church programs that

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.766
will do something
like that, and we will

01:05:01.766 --> 01:05:03.080
see more of that next time.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.030
But the key is that
we have a language now

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.740
which keeps building the
different ingredients that we

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:09.340
think we need.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.030
On the one hand, we've gone from
thinking that we need something

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:14.530
like probabilistic generative
models, which many people will

01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:16.197
agree with, to
recognizing that not only

01:05:16.197 --> 01:05:17.863
do they have to be
generative, they have

01:05:17.863 --> 01:05:19.180
to be causal and compositional.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:21.670
And they have to have this
fine-grained compositional

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:24.010
structure needed to capture
the real stuff of the world.

01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:26.440
Not graphs, but something
more like equations

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.100
that capture graphics
or physics or planning.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.360
Of course, that's not all.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.220
I mean, as I tried
to gesture at,

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.970
we need also ways to make these
things work very, very quickly.

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.460
There might be a place in
this picture for something

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.930
like neural networks
or some kind

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:44.440
of alternative
pro-and-con approach based

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.060
on pattern recognition.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.710
But these are just
a number of the ways

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.260
which I think we need to
think about going forward.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:53.710
We need to take the idea of both
the brain as a pattern ignition

01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:56.680
engine seriously and the idea
of the brain as a modeling

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.425
or explanation engine seriously.

01:05:58.425 --> 01:05:59.800
We're excited
because we now have

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.852
tools to model modeling
engines and maybe

01:06:01.852 --> 01:06:04.060
to model how pattern
recognition engines and modeling

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.410
engines might interact.

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:08.620
But really, again,
the great challenges

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.960
here are really very
much in our future.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.240
Not the unforeseeable future,
but the foreseeable one.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.890
So help us work on it.

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:16.440
Thanks.

YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah, so I
think a sense of humor

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.180
is really a very, very
good tool in the teaching.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.580
So I usually insert interesting
figures in my slides.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.700
Then people will
be really focusing

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.180
on your slides and your
lecture because people

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.570
don't want to miss the joke.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.170
Right?

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.790
And also, that makes the
lecture much more enjoyable

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.420
as well because everybody
wants to learn things happily.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.610
Right?

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.710
And also, those jokes I
insert, most of the time,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.420
they are relevant to physics
interpretation of those jokes.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.430
So that's actually my idea
to make the lecture much more

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.720
enjoyable, and also keeping
the students very focused

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.700
on the material we cover.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.960
So my idea is to have a much
more relaxed classroom so that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.890
you can actually-- then people
will feel that they can ask

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.580
whatever question they
have because I'm not, like,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.040
super serious, I mean, asking
for everybody to keep quiet

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.670
and cannot react to any funny
things that I have been doing.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.226
From here, actually,
Maxwell see the light.

00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:32.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.690
Can you see it?

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.150
Maybe not yet.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.020
Maybe we are slightly
slower than Maxwell.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.520
But-- but we will see that
together in this lecture.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.850
First of all, I will
feel very relaxed

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.150
because I can do whatever I
want to help the students.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.675
And also, the students
will feel that their stress

00:01:55.675 --> 00:01:58.840
of asking questions
were greatly reduced

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.846
if the instructor is actually
very funny, and very,

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:02.840
very humorous.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.330
So that's actually my idea,
which drive me to the decision

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.480
to insert a lot of interesting
pictures and the jokes

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.280
during the lecture.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.910
PROFESSOR: OK, so
happy to see you again.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.140
Welcome back to 8.03.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.360
So in the beginning
of the class,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.720
I will give you a reminder about
what we discussed last time.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.370
Then the main topic we
are going to discuss today

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.885
is about how to
take good photos.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.410
So let's get started.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.250
So last time we have
been working together

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.440
trying to understand
how to produce

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.660
electromagnetic waves which
can travel to a distance which

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.600
is actually very, very far away,
a place which is very, very

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.519
far away from the source.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.480
And what we actually figured
out is that in order to do that,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.650
you have to create a kink
in the electric field line

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.120
such that you will propagate
and produce radiation.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.940
And this is actually what
we have done last time.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.780
And what we concluded
is that if you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.990
want to produce
electromagnetic waves,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.800
you have to introduce
acceleration

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.320
of that charge, such that
you will be able to produce

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.890
electromagnetic waves.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.210
And also, we have derived, based
on geometrical arguments, what

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.040
would be the magnitude
and the direction

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.920
of the radiated electric
field and magnetic field.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.910
And it's actually showing here.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.610
The radiated electric
field is going

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.080
to be in the opposite
direction of the projection

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.830
of the acceleration, a perp.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.139
The magnitude is
proportional to a perp,

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:14.630
but only evaluated at retarded
time, t prime equal to t

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.350
minus r/c, where r is
actually the distance

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.640
between the observer and
the radiating charge.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.300
And the reason why we have this
t prime, the retarded time,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.960
is because of the speed of
propagation of information.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.810
So that's actually what
we discussed last time.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.980
And you cannot actually
instantaneously send

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.180
the information about the
acceleration of this charge

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.760
to somewhere which is
very, very far away.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.090
Therefore, the
acceleration, a perp,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.760
is evaluated at
t prime, which is

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.770
t minus r/c, the amount
of time for the speed

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.960
of the information traveling
at the speed of light.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.550
And also, the corresponding
magnetic field

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.620
can be also evaluated, whether
it's through Maxwell's equation

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.060
or using this
formula, this t here.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.010
And finally, we will
be able to evaluate

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.300
what would be the pointing
vector, the energy flux

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.640
direction or energy flux through
exactly the same equation which

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.600
we used before.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.780
That's actually what we
have learned last time.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.470
And today, what
we are going to do

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.140
is to learn how to take photos.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.330
So we have prepared ourself.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.190
We know how to produce
electromagnetic waves.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.440
We also know about polarization
of electromagnetic waves.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.940
And we also know how the
polarizer actually works.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.190
So that means we will be able
to make very good photos,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.090
theoretically.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.620
So yeah, that's what
we all care about.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.480
Theoretically, we can actually
make very good photos.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.600
So the first thing which
we would like to discuss

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.490
is how to make very good
contrast when you actually

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.890
take a photo of the sky.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.649
So as you can see,
the left-hand side

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.070
is a photo taken
without a polarizer.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.850
And the right-hand side is the
photo taken with a polarizer.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.130
You can see-- aha!
-- the contrast,

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.970
or say the sky is
actually darker,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.740
therefore you can see the
cloud much more clearly.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.090
And also on the same
graph, you can see

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.970
there is a photo at the beach.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.600
And you can see exactly
the same phenomenon.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.130
And now we are in the position
to understand what is going on.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.290
So this is actually why
we can use polarizer

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.720
to make such a good photo.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.290
So now we know what is actually
happening at the sun, right?

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.910
So at the sun,
there are something

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.680
which is oscillating--

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:14.360
OK, some kind of
emission from the sun.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.720
And those emissions are not
correlated to each other.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.980
And that produces
unpolarized sunlight.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.760
So if you're looking
to the sun, you

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.300
are looking at
unpolarized light.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.650
On the other hand, if you
are looking at the sky,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.020
roughly like 45 or 90 degree--

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.110
OK, 45 degree from on the
sun, what is going to happen

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.440
is that what you
are actually seeing,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.410
all this light from
the sky, actually,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.850
the sunlight after
scattering between sunlight

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.930
and the dust in the air.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.930
So basically, on this
guide, in our air,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.310
there are many, many
little dust, right?

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.360
And when light-- as
you shine on this dust,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.700
they change direction,
this so-called scattering.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.400
And those light are
collected by your camera.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.500
The interesting thing is that
if you have a molecule which

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.040
is actually here, and you
have some unpolarized sunlight

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.760
shining on this molecule,
and it changed direction

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.640
by 90 degrees, what is going to
happen is that all the things--

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.240
originally you have an
unpolarized sunlight.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.080
Therefore, you have all kinds
of different polarizations,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.210
if you look at the
electromagnetic wave.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.130
However, if you only choose
the light which are scattered

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.870
and are going toward this
direction, apparently,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.240
the electromagnetic wave,
or the polarization,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.730
or let's say the direction
of the electric field,

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.960
has to be perpendicular to
the direction of propagation.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.540
Therefore, what
is going to happen

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.450
is that only this direction,
only the polarization

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.085
in this direction, which is
perpendicular to the direction

00:07:22.085 --> 00:07:24.820
of propagation will survive.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.700
All the other
components, like the one

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.810
which is pointing upward or
pointing downwards, or coming

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.510
from the original
sunlight will not survive.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.920
Therefore, what is going
to happen is that when

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.470
you do get 45 degrees--

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.190
the sky 45 degrees from
the sun, the sunlight

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.950
is actually what
kind of sunlight?

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.160
Is polarized sunlight.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.730
Therefore, if you
tune your filter

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.770
to be aligned with
the polarization,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.950
you will be able to
filter a large amount

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.710
of the scattered sunlight.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.600
And that is actually
how this works.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.820
And then you can see that,
indeed, the sky becomes darker

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.260
after you apply this polarizer
in front of your camera.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.950
So that's essentially the
first thing which we learn.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.440
The second thing is
that, OK, we also

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.620
found that the polarizer
is particularly

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:30.820
usefull for the filtering of the
reflected light on the window.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.080
And of course, we can also
use exactly the same technique

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.150
to filter out the
reflected light

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.240
from the water for dipole.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.770
And how does this work?

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.670
And it turns out that this
actually much more complicated

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.140
than what we thought.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.040
And we have to
actually derive this.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.220
And that is actually related
to the electromagnetic wave

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.730
propagation inside
the material, and also

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.740
related to Brewster's angle.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.790
And that is actually
the main topic

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.570
which we are going
to talk about today.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.340
So let's immediately
get started.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.090
So now what we
are interested is,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.800
how does this actually work?

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.700
And why is this happening?

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:21.520
And why is the reflected
light become polarized?

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.430
So that's the question
we are trying to answer.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.640
So we have talked about
electromagnetic waves

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.940
in vacuum.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.320
And we also know how to
generate electromagnetic,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.690
and now we are interested
in electromagnetic wave

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.600
in dielectrics.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.910
So we have talked about two
kinds of materials already.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.870
The first one is a
perfect conductor.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.120
And the second one which
we are going to talk about

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.820
is a dielectrics material.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.680
In case of perfect
conductor, it costs nothing

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.090
to move all the charges
inside this conductor around.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.860
And basically, that will give
you a zero electric field

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.900
inside the conductor.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.760
And also, we have a
limited supply of charges.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.570
And therefore, inside this
kind of perfect conductor,

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.630
there will be no electric field.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.130
On the other hand, if you have
a dielectrics material, what

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.000
is going to happen
is that there are

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.380
a lot of charges
inside the material,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.110
but all those
charges are attached

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.050
to a specific atom or molecule.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.250
They cannot be moving
freely all over the place.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.550
And that is actually
so-called bound

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.050
to the atom or the
location of the molecule.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:51.570
And that introduces a
little bit of complication.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.340
So this kind of
material, they also

00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:00.030
respond to the external magnetic
field or electric field.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.520
For example, in this case,
I have electron cloud which

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.320
is around the nuclei in this--

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.890
around the positive charge
nucleus in this figure.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.005
And you can see
that before we apply

00:11:18.005 --> 00:11:24.900
an external electric field,
it's symmetric around zero.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:30.720
After we introduce this electric
field, external electric field,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.830
there can be some kind
of polarization produced,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:40.140
because the electrons
around this nucleus

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:46.710
can be moved slightly, such
that this material is actually

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.100
trying to compensate a
little bit the effect

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.500
of the external force.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.400
So that is actually
leading to a modification

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.810
of the electric field.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.260
But as I mentioned,
you are not going

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.420
to cancel all the effect
of the external field.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.340
So how do we understand this?

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.700
The idea is the following.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.220
So since this system
is complicated,

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.610
you have a free charge.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:22.380
It could have free charge
as we really kick out

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.350
or add some electrons
into this system.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.350
It can have bounce charge.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.551
And if becomes a rather
complicated description.

00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:32.800
So the idea is the followiong.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.720
So in order to actually--

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.710
for our convenience,
to be similar to what

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.650
we have been doing
in vacuum case,

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.510
our goal is to
define a field which

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:53.520
is actually with the
material itself subtracted.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.310
In this case, what we can
do is to define a D field,

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.300
which is related--

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.400
we hope that this is
actually only related

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.750
to the free charge
inside the material.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.910
And then we can actually
do all the tricks

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.460
which is actually similar
to what we have already

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.140
learned from the vacuum--

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.090
Maxwell's equation to solve
the problems inside material.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.270
So that's essentially our goal.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:29.980
In order to do that, we have
to classify the total charge

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.920
density, rho, into
two components.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.320
The first component
is the free charge,

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.000
which essentially is the
charges which can travel freely

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.250
inside the media.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.990
And the bound charge, which
is actually, as I mentioned,

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.260
for example, those electrons--

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.440
the electron cloud.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:55.310
And essentially, they are
bound around central location

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.240
in the media.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.780
So the idea is the following.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.120
So I can now define a D field.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:10.170
This D field is a so-called
electric displacement field.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:17.682
It's defined as epsilon0 times
E field plus a P vector, which

00:14:17.682 --> 00:14:20.610
is the polarization vector.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.660
Where this P vector is
defined in the following way--

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:31.050
minus divergence of the
P factor is actually

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:37.020
equal to the bound charge
density, which is rho.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.550
If we have this definition
and we actually continue

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.190
and write down the Gauss' law--

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.600
and we can see that this is
the Gauss' law, epsilon0--

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.180
divergence of E will
be equal to rho.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.680
And we also-- under
our classification,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.930
essentially, there are two
components, rho f and rho p.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.130
The bound charge
and the free charge.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.050
And according to
our definition, this

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:13.980
can be written as rho
f minus delta P vector.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.200
And now what we
can do is that we

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.270
can use the definition of the
electric displacement field

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.620
and collect all the
terms except the rho

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.460
f to the left-hand side.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.030
Then you will conclude
that the divergence of D

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.470
will be equal to rho f.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.960
So after this
calculation, you can

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.790
see that what we
have achieved is

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.990
that we have defined a
field, a displacement field

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:51.230
D, which is totally related to
the effect of the free charge.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.700
In this case, what we
derived is actually

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.860
delta D equal to rho f.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.160
And this actually looks pretty
similar to the situation

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.790
in vacuum, right?

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:09.290
Because what we actually have is
epsilon0 delta E equal to rho.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.920
And after we actually remove
the contribution of the bound

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.050
charge, this becomes
this expression.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.710
Any questions so far?

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.910
All right, so this is
actually a purely definition.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:29.180
And we can also do a very
similar thing to the current.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.350
So the total current, J,
will have the following three

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.680
components.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.830
The first component
is the free current,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:43.130
which is the current related
to free charge moving around

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.190
inside this dielectrics method.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.950
There can be contribution
from the bound current.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.955
The bound current is
actually the current

00:16:50.955 --> 00:16:55.190
which is only moving around
some specific location.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.990
And finally, the
polarization contribution.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.900
So changing polarization
also introduced a current,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:08.230
because polarization is
actually defined as q dot times

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.130
D, which is the distance
between charges.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.349
And that if I have a changing
polarization, that means also

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.680
there are some charges
floating around.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.569
And that actually gives
you the third contribution,

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:26.210
which is, let's say, P.
Once we have classified

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.290
the current into three
pieces, and basically, we

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:38.400
can define H field, which is
actually defined as B over mu0,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.810
and the minus M, where M is
a magnetic dipole moment.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.670
And the M field is
actually defined

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:55.120
as the curl of M defined as
the magnitude and direction

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.220
of the bound current.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.310
And once we have
finished this definition,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:06.010
we can actually plug
that into Ampere's law.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.560
Ampere's law, just
a reminder, is

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.670
curl B will be equal to
mu0 times J. J is actually

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.590
the total current.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.710
Plus a component which is
actually added by Maxwell.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:26.800
So that actually results in
the electromagnetic waves,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.460
which is epsilon0
partial E partial T.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.460
By using those definitions
and classification,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.310
we can immediately write down--

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.570
so if we divide
both sides by mu0,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.790
basically, you conclude
that left-hand side

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:49.400
is 1 over mu0 curl B.
And right-hand side,

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.290
you have the contribution
of free charge current.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.160
And you have the contribution
of bound current.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.960
And you have the
third contribution

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.670
which is related to a
change in polarization.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.520
And finally, you
have the term which

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:11.170
is added by Maxwell
epsilon 0 partial E

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.590
partial T. By using the
definition which we defined

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.780
here for the D
displacement field,

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:26.390
and H, which is
actually defined here,

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.470
you can see that now we
conclude that the curl of H

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:37.610
will be equal to Jf plus
partial D partial P.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.560
So remember why
we are doing this.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.060
The reason is the following.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:47.450
We would like to classify the
effect coming from free charge

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.960
or free current
inside the material

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.830
by subtracting the effect from
the bound current and the bound

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.880
charge.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.700
So that's actually what
we have been doing.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:05.210
Then once we define new fields,
which is actually showing here,

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.920
D, which is the displacement
field, is only related to--

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.980
which is the field related
to the free charge.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.400
After all, those are
actually just definition.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.050
And the edge field,
the magnetic field

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.670
which is actually only related
to the displacement field

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:27.020
and the free
current, we actually

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:32.750
arrive something really,
really similar to the vacuum

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.540
case, Maxwell equation.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.580
So that's, essentially,
the excitement.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.090
And you will see that in
8.03, we will use immediately

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.280
those conclusions.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.990
And also, we would
limit ourselves

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.040
in the discussion of
linear homogeneous

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.800
and isotopic materials.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.070
And only work on this
kind of material.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.240
And that is, you would
need to highly simplify

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.550
the solution for the
electromagnetic field

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.740
or waves inside material.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.160
Any questions so far?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.880
I hope those are just
different issues.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.562
Yes.

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:16.990
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.760
PROFESSOR: The bound
current is actually

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:25.070
inside the whole
dielectric material.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.370
But of course, you can
have many, many small loops

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.320
and they will cancel.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.790
Because if you are looping--

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:37.090
for example, you can have
many, many bound current,

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:43.190
which is actually
surrounding the atom.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.620
But you can see that
all those things--

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.670
all the nearby little bound
current will cancel each other.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.790
So therefore, you could
do an integration,

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.670
and it becomes a
total bound current,

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.900
which is happening
around the surface

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.780
of the dielectrics material.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.690
So it depends on what you
mean by how this bound current

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.560
actually moves.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.490
So you do have little ones.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.740
And then if you do
integral, then it

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.360
becomes a surface bound current.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:26.550
So if we step these two
conclusions we arrive here,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.530
basically, we can
immediately write down

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.860
what would be the Maxwell's
equation in matter.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:39.320
So now, instead of electric
field and E and the--

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.250
E field and the magnetic
field, B field, we also have--

00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:52.170
oh, I think there's a
typo there probably.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.890
Ah, there's a typo
in the lower left.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.520
So the lower left
equation, which

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.970
is, unfortunately,
propagated to many places,

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.730
should be like this.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.040
So the lower left
equation should

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:20.260
be del cross H. That would
be equal to Jf plus partial D

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.180
partial t.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.290
So somehow, this is actually
propagated to many places.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:30.760
So basically, we have
Maxwell's equation

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.430
in matter, which is actually
really similar to what

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:39.350
we have in the vacuum case.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.950
So very similar to a discussion
we had in the vacuum case,

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:49.130
what we actually do is to set
the Jf and rho f equal to 0.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.880
If I set the Jf equal
to 0, the last equation

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.790
will become curl of
H. And that would be

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.810
equal to partial D partial t.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:10.310
So you can see that this is very
similar to what we had before,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:15.230
but the problem is that we have
the H field and the D field.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.630
The question is,
how do we actually

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:22.500
relate H field and the D
field with the electric field?

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.370
So as we mentioned
before, the D field

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:37.260
is as we defined as epsilon0 D
field plus P, which is actually

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:43.190
the induced polarization
of the material.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:48.230
And in the case of very
small electric field,

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.470
and there is more
magnetic field, and also

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:57.470
a linear and homogeneous
isotropic material,

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:04.400
this induced polarizaiton can
be proportional to the size

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.620
of the electric field.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.960
So if this polarization
is proportional

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.920
to the electric field,
I can immediately

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.610
write down that the
D field is actually

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:27.510
some kind of constant
epsilon times E.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:33.530
On the other hand, I can
also discuss the H field.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:42.870
H feel is defined as 1
over mu0 B minus M, which

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.470
is the magnetic dipole moment.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.000
In the case of very
small magnetic field

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.370
and the linear material,
basically, this and M vector

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:01.110
can be proportional
to the B vector.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.890
Therefore, I can
quickly rewrite this

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.830
saying since the M field is
also proportional to the B

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.350
field in this linear
material, therefore,

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:17.300
I can rewrite that H will
be equal to B divided by mu.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.980
What is epsilon and the mu?

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:27.610
Epsilon is the permittivity
inside the material.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.700
Permittivity is
actually-- they tell you

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:37.840
the resistance, the resistance
of forming electric field

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.420
in some place.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.600
So if you have a
large epsilon, that

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.080
means there'll be
large resistance coming

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.270
from the material.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.950
So this makes sense, right?

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.820
Because that means
you can easily

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:59.497
introduce, or say induce,
larger amount of polarization

00:26:59.497 --> 00:27:00.205
in your material.

00:27:00.205 --> 00:27:04.050
Then that means this
material is not happy.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.050
It's going to try to cancel
your electrical field.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.620
Therefore, if you
have a large P,

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.290
that will give you
a large epsilon.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:18.810
And therefore,
that means you have

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.710
a lot of resistance of forming
electric field, which is still

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.620
the E field here.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.535
in matter.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.850
On the other hand,
this mu is actually

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.120
permeability of
the, material, which

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.910
is the resistance of forming--

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:44.820
it's related to the resistance
of forming a magnetic field.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.470
And basically, these two
quantities are actually

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.910
telling you the D
field and the H field

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:58.380
are related to the electric
field and the magnetic field.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:04.410
So if we assume a linear
relation between D and E,

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.380
and elsewhere at
H and B, then we

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:12.360
can actually immediately
rewrite our Maxwell's equation

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.550
in matter in the following way.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.920
So you can see that the
resulting Maxwell's equation

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.930
in matter considering
a linear material

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.300
is really remarkably
similar to what

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.740
we have in the vacuum case.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.040
Where is that difference?

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.050
Can you see that?

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.600
The only difference is in the
last three equations, which

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.870
essentially, in the lower
right part of the equation,

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:49.680
instead of mu0 epsilon0, you
now get mu times epsilon.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.340
So what does that mean?

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:57.760
This means that the
speed of the propagation

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.770
of the electromagnetic
field is changed.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.260
It's now changed to--

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.820
instead of 1 over--

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.050
in the vacuum case,
you have c equal to 1

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:15.370
over the square root
of mu0 epsilon0.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.010
Instead of c, we
are going to get

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:22.570
c over n, which n is
the refractive index.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.965
And that is actually equal
to 1 over the square root

00:29:25.965 --> 00:29:28.780
of mu and epsilon.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.890
It's as simple as that.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.710
So based on what
we have prepared

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.860
in the last few lectures,
we can now immediately make

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.995
sense of this equation.

00:29:38.995 --> 00:29:43.270
And now that we know that almost
everything is the same, what

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.645
is different is that
now we have a difference

00:29:46.645 --> 00:29:49.390
speed of propagation,
which is actually

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.870
related to the refractive
index we discussed last time.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.610
And now we understand what is
actually this refractive index.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:03.400
n is actually equal to square
root of mu epsilon divided

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.364
by square root of mu0 epsilon0.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.560
Any questions?

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.508
Yeah.

00:30:13.508 --> 00:30:16.352
AUDIENCE: What are the
D fields and H field?

00:30:16.352 --> 00:30:19.200
Are they just coefficients?

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.190
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.580
So the D field and
the H field are

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.580
the fields which
is actually related

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.430
to only the free charge.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:33.140
So you can see that
now the gradients--

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.490
sorry, now the
divergence of D field

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:46.440
is actually only equal to the
density of the free charge.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.990
So basically, in
short, the D field

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:54.870
absorbs the effect of the
bound charge into this field.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.810
And when you try to
actually understand

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.540
what would be the field
associated or induced

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.870
by the free charge, it
is actually the D field.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:09.370
But the D field is not the full
story of the electric field.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.490
How is that related
to the electric field

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.600
in the exact form?

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.510
This is actually defined here.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.670
And from the D
field, you will be

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:22.290
able to evaluate what would
be the corresponding E field.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.400
And in the linear
material, there's

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.490
a spatial relation between
D field and the E field,

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.890
because the induced
polarization is

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:36.930
proportional to electric field
in the linear material, which

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.350
is a special case.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:44.580
And in that sense, D field
is proportional to E field.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.210
And this factor is
actually so-called epsilon,

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.320
which is permittivity
of the material.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:32:00.480
Describing how large
is the resistance

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.410
of forming an electric
field inside a material.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.117
OK?

00:32:06.117 --> 00:32:07.430
Is that clear?

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:08.610
OK, good.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.850
And the H field is
similar argument.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.220
All right, so now
we have made sense

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.310
of the electric field
and magnetic field

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.950
and the Maxwell's
equations in matter.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.900
And in 8.03, we will only
discuss linear material.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.570
You can imagine
that the relation

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:32.220
between the polarization and
the external electric field

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.570
can be very complicated.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:39.720
So for example, it
depends on how large

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.390
is the wavelengths of
the external force.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:51.240
So if you have very slowly
varying electric field,

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.160
you can imagine
that you will not

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.660
be able to create a
polarization, which

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.830
is the inner electron
ground level.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:04.890
Because the variation of the
electric field is too slow.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:09.680
But instead, you will be able to
excite the polarization related

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.460
to ions inside this material,
or inside the plasma.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.360
So on the other hand, if
you have a very, very fast

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.580
oscillating electric
field, then you

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.650
will be able to
measure the shift

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.390
or create a polarization
which is actually

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:30.380
related to the displacement of
the electron cloud inside that.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.510
So it really depends
on many, many factors.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:37.680
But what we have been
discussing here and elsewhere

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.280
is highly idealized
linear materials.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.230
And a lot of interesting
things to explore in the future

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:49.350
beyond 8.03.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.860
So once we have
this relation, we

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:59.040
will be able to get
Maxwell's equation in matter.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:04.290
And we would like to
understand, just to remind you,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.470
why are we doing this?

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.600
So we have a physical question.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.150
We have a question
about a phenomenon

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:17.620
which we see in this slide.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:21.389
So when we use the
polarizer, very strange,

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:25.980
you will be able to filter
out the reflected light

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:30.750
from the sun and through--

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.409
when the sunlight hit the
window and got reflected,

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:40.110
this kind of contribution can be
filtered out almost completely

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.429
by polarizer.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.190
So that means the
reflected light is somehow

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.630
also polarized.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.690
And then why is that
the case is the question

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:52.520
we were trying to answer here.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.460
So therefore, what I
am going to do is to,

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:04.010
again, take a look at the
boundary between two materials.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:09.560
The one side is actually in the
air, which we call it number 1.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.060
And the other side is
actually the glass, which

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.820
I call it material number 2.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:24.960
And now I have, again,
some incident prime wave,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.270
which is coming from the sun.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:35.660
And actually, this incident
prime wave actually

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:42.050
goes into this surface which
is the boundary between air

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:48.610
and glass in the discussion
which I am trying to get into.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:53.360
I assume that this glass
is actually very wide.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.720
It's actually fielding
the whole universe.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.995
Therefore, this is actually
just a simple plane,

00:35:59.995 --> 00:36:02.410
a boundary which
actually divides

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.505
our world into air and glass.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.760
We know from the discussion
of previous lecture,

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.470
so there must be
a reflected light

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:21.710
and there must be
transmission into the glass.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:26.680
Because this is actually the
general property of waves.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.860
So OK, it has nothing to do
with electromagnetic wave yet,

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:35.180
but if you have wave, and
you have an incident wave,

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.240
you are going to
have a reflected wave

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.760
and the transmitted wave.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:45.620
We learned from the two
laws of geometrical optics,

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.910
we know that the
incident angle, theta i,

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:54.200
will be equal to the
reflective angle, theta r,

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.160
with respect to the normal
direction of this surface.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:04.420
And we also know
that the KI, which

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:10.570
is the wave number of
vector of the incident wave,

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:14.400
KR, which is the wave
number vector, the K vector,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.370
of the reflected
wave, and the K vector

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.040
for the transmitting wave, KT.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.270
And this is actually theta T.

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:28.850
These three K vectors
must have a fixed relation

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:35.210
so that the electromagnetic
field, or say all those three

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.570
wave equations-- the
sum of these three wave

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:40.790
equations in the left-hand
side world and right-hand side

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.220
world, they are
connected to each other.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.450
They don't break.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:50.290
There's no discontinuity between
the sum of the left-hand side

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:55.820
plane waves and the sum of the
right-hand side plane wave.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:02.060
So that means it has
to obey Snell's law.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.580
And there will be a fixed--

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.180
the size of the
projection of the K

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:16.590
vector onto the direction of
this surface will be the same.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:22.010
Otherwise, you will have
different wavelengths

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.200
in the vertical direction.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.320
Then the electromagnetic
wave will break, right?

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.610
Because you can-- as you
always change your position

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:37.600
when evaluating the total
contribution of the incident,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.390
reflected, and
transmitted waves.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:44.580
So once we have all this
information in hand,

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.120
we can actually write
down the expression

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.930
for the incident wave,
EI, which is actually

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:53.020
a function of r and t.

00:38:55.598 --> 00:39:00.230
And of course, I would like
to define my coordinate system

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.000
first.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.930
So this is the x direction.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:07.291
And this is y direction.

00:39:07.291 --> 00:39:07.790
OK, sorry.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.498
This is usually the
z direction actually.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.220
The x direction is going up.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.330
y direction is actually
pointing to you.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.030
And the z direction is
pointing to the right-hand side

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.410
of the board.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:29.580
And this is actually at z
equal to 0, this interface

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.340
between glass and air.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.000
And now I can
actually write down

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.900
what will be the incident
wave electric field.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:44.040
And that is actually equal
to E0I, which is a vector,

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.960
tell you about the polarization
of the incident wave.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:54.240
Cosine-- by now this should
look pretty familiar to you now.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.710
This is actually
just a KI dot r,

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:03.160
which describes the
direction of the propagation.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.860
Minus omega t.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.370
So this is actually
describing the incident wave,

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:14.540
which I call it EI.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.900
And I will assume
that since I know

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:23.540
what would be incident wave,
that E0I is a known quantity.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.990
So I say that this is
actually a known quantity.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.690
So now I can also
do the same thing

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:38.790
and write down what would
be the reflected wave.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:43.910
ER as a function of r and t.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.460
And this will be,
very similarly,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.460
E0R, which is
actually telling you

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.860
the magnitude and
the polarization

00:40:51.860 --> 00:41:01.310
of the reflected wave, cosine
KR dot r minus omega t.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:06.570
All right, and finally,
you have the ET, which

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.460
is a function of r and t again.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:16.520
And this will be E0T cosine
KT times r minus omega t.

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:25.380
Of course, they will have three
electric fields, therefore,

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.838
you must have three what field?

00:41:28.838 --> 00:41:29.779
AUDIENCE: Magnetic.

00:41:29.779 --> 00:41:31.070
PROFESSOR: Magnetic field, yes.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:34.820
So you must have the
corresponding magnetic field.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.660
So you, for example, BI.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.100
It's a function of r and t.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.200
Will be equal to
1 over V1, which

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.130
is the velocity in the air.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.940
V1 is actually equal to c.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:59.110
KI hat, the direction of
the propagation cross--

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:08.640
OK, so I'm not going to
write down BR and BT,

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.730
because this is actually
a very similar expression

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.230
as the corresponding associated
magnetic field for the incident

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:17.870
wave.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:22.170
All right, so basically,
we have actually

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.750
translated the
physical situation

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:29.100
into mathematics using the
coordinate system, which

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.822
we defined here.

00:42:31.822 --> 00:42:33.780
So one thing which is
actually very interesting

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.980
is that we have solved
half of the question

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.000
in the previous lecture.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.280
So in the previous
lecture when we discussed

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.660
two-dimensional or
three-dimensional waves,

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.290
we have concluded that
if you have a wave,

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:55.740
and it's continuous at
the surface, z equal to 0,

00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:05.400
you can immediately conclude
that basically KI dot

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:11.381
r will be equal to KR dot r.

00:43:11.381 --> 00:43:15.092
This will be equal to KT dot r.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.130
This is the first thing
which we actually conclude.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.400
That actually leads to what?

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.310
What law?

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.010
Snell's law.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.060
Yes, very good.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.610
Snell's law.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:33.370
If this expression doesn't
hold, then your left-hand side

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:38.300
and right-hand side total
electric field doesn't match

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.720
at the surface of z equal to 0.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.130
The second thing
which we learned

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:51.270
is that theta I will be
equal to theta R. OK,

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:55.320
so basically, that's
actually what we have learned

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.210
from the previous lecture.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:03.840
Therefore, this match in between
left-hand side electric field

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.440
and right-hand side electric
field becomes much simpler.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:14.220
Since that they are actually
just some E0 times cosine,

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.950
a functional formula
showing here.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:23.460
Since these three products
are identical, therefore,

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.870
what is going to happen is
that the location dependence

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:34.260
and the time dependence of this
relation completely cancels.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.700
Because you just have
the individual vector,

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:44.010
E0I, E0R, E0T, multiplied
by a cosine function which

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:48.730
is identical for
those three incident

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.030
transmitted and the
reflected waves.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.150
Therefore, in the discussion
of this kind of thing,

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:58.380
you can actually ignore
the location dependence

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.650
and the time dependence,
since they always cancel.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:08.400
So that's actually a pretty
useful thing to have.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.180
And don't forget what
is our goal, right?

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:17.295
So our goal is to know, OK,
so if I have a given incident

00:45:17.295 --> 00:45:22.290
prime wave, what would be the
resulting reflected wave, what

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:26.880
would be the resulting
transmitted wave?

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.430
And I would like to tell
you the conclusion first.

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:35.280
The relation between
the reflected wave,

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.370
transmitted wave,
and incident wave

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:42.750
depends on the
Maxwell simulation.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.460
You can see that this
relation have nothing

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.200
to do with Maxwell's
equation so far.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:56.100
It's actually really related
to the wave description

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.190
we are using.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:00.695
And also, the the match in
between the left-hand side

00:46:00.695 --> 00:46:03.010
and right-hand
side wave equation.

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:07.830
So you know, now we have learned
this is actually only related

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:12.630
to a generic property
wave equation.

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.590
So now we need to get the help
from the Maxwell's equation

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.800
in matter so that
I can make sense

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:25.100
about the relation between
E0R, E0T with respect

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.650
to what is given, E0I.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.800
So how do we do that?

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.530
So the first thing
which I would like to do

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.730
is that, as you see from here,
I divided the whole universe

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:39.660
into two parts.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.200
The left-hand side wall,
I call it 1, is air.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:48.300
The right-hand side wall is
glass, which is I call it 2.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.700
Therefore, I can
now calculate what

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:57.690
will be the sum of the electric
field in the world number 1,

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:05.650
which is actually
defined as E0I plus E0R.

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.670
So here you can see that I
already dropped the cosine,

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.230
because they always cancel.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:19.720
Therefore, I just write down
E0I and E0R without the cosine.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.230
And of course, I
can also calculate

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:26.370
what will be the total electric
field in the right-hand side

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:28.110
world, inside the glass.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:30.870
And that is actually
equal to E0T.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:41.090
The question is how
to relate E1 and E2.

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.640
And for that, as I
mentioned, I need

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.270
the help of Maxwell's
equation in matter.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.780
How do we actually do that?

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.560
So what we could
do is that since we

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.520
have Maxwell's equation, the
first thing which we can do

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:04.650
is that we can look at the
perpendicular direction.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:09.860
The perpendicular direction
means the projection

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:15.530
of the electric field in
the perpendicular direction

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.420
to the surface.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.585
That's what I mean by
perpendicular direction.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:32.195
So for that, I can make use of
the first Maxwell's equation

00:48:32.195 --> 00:48:38.000
in matter, which is actually
del dot D equal to 0.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.250
We are considering the case
without any free charge.

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:48.500
So that means I have Gauss' law,
which is actually D times da.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.960
I do a surface integral.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.220
And that will be equal to 0.

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:05.310
So this means that I can have
a pillbox again, like this.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.970
I arrange this
pillbox like this.

00:49:11.335 --> 00:49:12.710
And this is actually
the surface.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.400
The size of one
side perpendicular

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:31.900
to the direction of the surface
is actually called D here.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.150
And I have this box here.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:46.920
And the left-hand side, D1, will
be equal to epsilon1 E perp--

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:53.360
D1 perp, actually, will be
equal to epsilon1 E perp 1.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:59.680
Epsilon1 is the permittivity
of the material number

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.360
1, which is actually equal
to epsilon0 in this case,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.510
because it is actually air.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:13.940
And the right-hand
side, you have D perp 2.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.850
This is actually equal
to epsilon2 E perp 2.

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.120
So now I have figured
out what would

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:30.120
be the field going into
this pillbox and the field

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.180
going out of this pillbox.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.560
What I can do now
is the following.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:46.020
I can now shrink the size of
the pillbox, having d goes to 0.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:50.310
And it becomes smaller,
smaller, and smaller.

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:54.630
So what is going to happen is
that when this d goes to 0,

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:58.500
this surface integral
will go to what?

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.590
Go to also 0.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:09.900
Therefore, I can immediately
conclude that epsilon1 E perp

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.630
1--

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:14.220
OK, so when I have
this d goes to 0,

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.820
the contribution from
the side goes to 0.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:22.270
I know already the sum of all
the contribution of the surface

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.930
integral will be
equal to 0, but I

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.870
don't know what is the
contribution from the side.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:33.981
But if I have that d goes to
0, then the area of the four--

00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:35.300
1, 2, 3, 4--

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:38.590
sides, it's actually
going to go to 0.

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.320
Therefore, you have
zero contribution

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.030
to this surface integral.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:47.250
Therefore, I can conclude
that epsilon1 E perp 1

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:55.244
will be equal to epsilon2 E perp
2, based on this discussion.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:00.820
All right, any questions so far?

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.760
I hope everybody is following.

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.660
Now, I can also use
the third equation,

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:16.270
which is actually del cross E--

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:22.270
the fourth equation--
which is actually the--

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:26.140
oh, sorry for that.

00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:28.370
I can actually use
the second equation,

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:34.880
which is the curl of E would
be equal to minus partial B

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.240
partial t.

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:42.280
So that means I can have
an integral E dot dl.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:50.672
And that is going to be equal
to minus d dt, B dot dx.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:58.520
All right, so if I
used the third equation

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.840
in Maxwell's
equation, basically, I

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:12.020
have an integral over a loop,
over some closed surface,

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:17.640
and that would be equal
to minus d dt, B dot--

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:25.670
this the actually the integral
looking at the flux going

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.290
through this little area.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.770
So what I can do
is now I, again,

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:38.500
zoom in to the surface which
connects the two worlds.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:45.460
And I can now define a
loop which is like this.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.160
With width equal to d.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.940
And there can be a contribution
from the magnetic field

00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:01.030
in the right-hand side integral
contributing to this equation.

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:07.850
I can immediately write
down the left-hand side

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:12.680
will be E parallel 1.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:13.366
Why?

00:54:13.366 --> 00:54:14.740
Because right now
we are actually

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:20.170
looking at the component of
the electric field parallel

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:22.240
to the surface.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:27.632
And I can also immediately
write down the right-hand side

00:54:27.632 --> 00:54:29.750
of this loop integral.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:35.120
You are going to
have E parallel 2.

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:38.500
And now I can do
exactly the same trick,

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:42.400
having this d goes to 0.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.230
The effect of this
is the following.

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:50.050
So if I have this
rectangular loop,

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:54.440
and now if I have
this side d goes to 0,

00:54:54.440 --> 00:55:01.050
that means you will have no area
to integrate the flux for the B

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:01.930
field.

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:06.400
So therefore, if I have d goes
to 0, this will be equal--

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.860
this also goes to 0.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.220
Therefore, I can
immediately conclude

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:18.640
that this means that
E parallel 1 will

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:30.000
have to be equal to E parallel
2, based on this discussion.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.490
So this means that,
well, we can immediately

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:37.480
conclude that first
of all, in order

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.690
to figure out the relation
between the incident wave,

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:43.900
reflected wave, and
transmitted wave,

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:48.820
we need the help not only
from the general property

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:55.300
of the wave equation, and
also some matching boundary

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.450
conditions, we also
need the help to provide

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:01.490
additional boundary
conditions to relay

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:03.225
the electric field
in the left-hand side

00:56:03.225 --> 00:56:04.400
and right-hand side.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.600
That is actually coming from
our understanding of Maxwell's

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.700
equation in matter.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:14.350
So you can see that
the second two boundary

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:19.770
conditions, epsilon1 E
perp 1, perpendicular,

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:23.780
will be equal to epsilon2
E 2 perpendicular.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:31.120
And that's essentially related
to this surface integral D.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:34.960
And the second
condition which tells

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:41.030
us, will relate the field
in the parallel direction

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:45.180
is actually also coming
from Maxwell's' equation.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:49.390
And we conclude that E
parallel in the left-hand side

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:53.410
will be equal to E parallel
in the right-hand side.

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:59.500
So we are almost there
to solve the puzzle.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:04.550
So now what I have to
do is the following.

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:09.340
So now I would like
to assume that we

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:13.390
have some kind of
polarization for the incident

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:15.180
and the transmitted waves.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:19.610
So I assume that
the polarization,

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:22.360
it should be the following.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:27.070
The polarization is
actually in parallel.

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:32.030
I assume that the polarization
is in parallel to the xz plane.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.930
So that's actually
my assumption.

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:37.520
So now I introduce
a new assumption,

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.800
which is that the
incident wave is actually

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.130
having a polarization.

00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:47.750
The electric field is actually
oscillating up and down

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:50.290
in this direction, which
is actually parallel

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:53.610
to the xz plane.

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:58.940
So I can write down the
corresponding E0R vector.

00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:02.710
And finally-- and this will be
perpendicular to the direction

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:04.490
of propagation.

00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:10.340
And finally, I will be
able to also write down

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:13.750
what will be the
corresponding polarization

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:16.690
for the transmitted wave,
which is also, again,

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:21.580
perpendicular to the
direction of propagation

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:29.020
So therefore I can now make use
of the boundary condition one

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:32.800
and boundary condition
two to actually figure out

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:39.550
what would be the relation
between E0I, E0R, and E0T.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:41.500
The first thing
which we consider

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:45.621
is to consider the
perpendicular direction.

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:52.120
For equation number
one, I will be

00:58:52.120 --> 00:59:01.750
able to conclude that epsilon1
minus E0I sine theta I.

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:04.880
So basically, that is
actually the contribution

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:09.645
from the first vector, E0I.

00:59:09.645 --> 00:59:14.320
You can see that now I am
trying to project everything

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.640
to the direction
perpendicular to the surface.

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.450
And you can see that
I have a minus sign.

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:26.530
And that this angle
is actually theta.

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:27.760
So therefore, I have--

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.200
So this angle is actually what?

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.350
This angle is actually
I minus theta.

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:42.130
So therefore, I have
the cosine theta I.

00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:44.110
And I have this minus
sign, because it's

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:48.580
pointing to the left-hand
side of the board.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:50.320
So that's actually
the contribution

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.540
of the incident wave.

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.550
And I have a second
term, which is

00:59:54.550 --> 01:00:01.000
the contribution of the
reflected wave, E0R sine theta

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:10.950
I. So E0I, E0R with all vector
is actually just the length

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:15.010
of the vector in my definition.

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:19.480
And based on the first
boundary condition,

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.570
I have the left-hand
side looks like this.

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:29.910
On the right-hand side, I will
have minus epsilon2 E0T sine

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:31.630
theta T.

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:38.390
Again, I am looking at the
projection of this E0T vector

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:40.990
in the direction
which is actually

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:44.260
perpendicular to the surface.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:47.220
So that's the first
expression I can get.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:53.230
And then from the expression
number two, I can now--

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:59.900
taking the projection, which
is parallel to the surface,

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.370
so now this is actually
the parallel direction.

01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:05.110
And basically, what
I'm going to get

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:17.925
is E0I cosine theta I
plus E0R cosine theta I--

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:23.120
oh sorry, theta R. Theta R
is actually equal to theta I,

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.280
so therefore, I actually
replaced that by the I already.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:35.820
And that will be equal to E0T
cosine theta T. Any questions

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.650
so Far so I was pretty fast.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:42.010
So here, I already
immediately write down

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:45.470
this is actually theta R.
Theta R is equal to theta I,

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:48.250
so therefore, I already
replaced that by theta I.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:51.040
Do you have any questions?

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:58.360
So the painful period is going
to end in like 3 minutes, OK?

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.330
So we are almost there.

01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:01.930
And look what we
have been doing.

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:04.240
We basically figured out
the boundary condition

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.950
from Maxwell's equation.

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:07.300
Then we are plugging in that.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.220
So we assume that the
polarization is actually

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.840
parallel on the
plane of xz plane.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.540
And now we are actually
just evaluating

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:20.620
the parallel component and
the perpendicular component.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.270
So that's actually
what we've got.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:36.670
The goal, as a reminder,
is to write E0R and E0T

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:41.170
in terms of the known
part, which is the E0I.

01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:44.140
I would like to
relate these three--

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:47.000
the magnitude of
these three vectors.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.640
So from equation number one,
I can actually rewrite that.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.800
Basically, I can
actually conclude

01:02:53.800 --> 01:03:00.080
that I can divide everything
by epsilon1 sine theta I.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:06.920
So what I'm going to
get is E0I minus E0R.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:15.930
And this will be equal
to epsilon2 sine theta

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:26.610
T divided by epsilon1 sine theta
R. And this is actually E0T.

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:29.010
So basically, I'm
dividing everything

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:33.400
by minus epsilon1 sine theta I.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.130
Then basically, what
you are going to get

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:37.073
is this expression.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:45.630
And this actually can be related
to another expression, which

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:52.530
is epsilon2 n1 divided
by epsilon1 n2.

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.560
Because I can use Snell's law.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:01.950
n1 sine theta I will be equal
to n2 sine theta T. Therefore,

01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:08.070
I can replace this ratio of
sine angle by refractive index.

01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:09.640
Everybody's following?

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.130
OK, very good.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:16.680
And this will be
multiplied by E0T.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.140
I can now define this.

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.206
This is actually
defined as theta E0T

01:04:24.206 --> 01:04:28.140
to make our life easier.

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.480
The same thing can be done
for the second expression.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:38.310
What I'm going to
get is E0I plus E0R.

01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:41.670
Basically, what I'm doing
is to divide everything

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:45.810
by cosine theta I. So
what is going to happen

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:50.610
is that you are going to
get cosine theta T divided

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:56.710
by cosine theta I E0T.

01:04:56.710 --> 01:05:03.240
And that is actually
defined as alpha E0T.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:10.410
So alpha is defined as cosine
theta T divided by cosine

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.240
theta I.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.040
Therefore, I can
already immediately,

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:21.240
based on these two expressions,
to solve what would be the E0R.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.980
I can write down the solution.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:25.500
So basically, you can
actually quickly derive

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.210
what would be the E0R.

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:30.900
And that is actually going to
be my alpha minus beta divided

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.890
by alpha plus beta, E0I.

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:40.790
And you can also solve based
on these two equations what

01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:42.960
would be the E0T.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.880
And now we will
conclude that this

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.330
will be equal to 2 divided
by alpha plus beta, E0I.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.120
So this means that the
refractive index will

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.690
be equal to alpha minus beta.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:05.080
Sorry, refraction
coefficient will

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:10.170
be equal to alpha minus beta
divided by alpha plus beta.

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:13.140
And the transmission
coefficient is actually

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:17.190
2 over alpha plus beta.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:22.740
So we will take maybe a
three minute break for you

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.720
to be able to ask
some questions.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.870
But you can see that we
have solved the relation

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:31.410
between E0I, E0R, and E0T.

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:34.050
And what we have to do
in the rest of the time

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:36.930
is to enjoy what we
actually already derived,

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:39.920
and what actually that
means, after the break.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.035
So we come back at 45.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.420
OK, so very good.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.400
So we have survived this.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.950
And now it's time to
enjoy what we have

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:56.620
learned from this equation.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:00.010
All right, so welcome
back everybody.

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:03.370
So we have actually
saw what would

01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:06.960
be the refraction coefficient
and the transmission

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.740
coefficient tau.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.560
And those are the functions
of alpha and beta.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.340
So that's considered three
different interesting cases.

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.422
So if I have normal incidence.

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:31.850
And that means alpha
will be equal to cosine

01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:37.950
theta T divided by cosine theta
I. This is the definition.

01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:40.190
If I have no more
incidence, that

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:45.330
means both theta T,
theta I, and theta R

01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:47.400
will be equal to 90 degrees.

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:57.560
And in this case, basically,
you will have the same cosine

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.650
theta--

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:03.090
I mean cosine I. Theta
T and cosine theta I.

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:11.820
And that means your alpha will
be equal to 1 in this case.

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:17.189
So in normal material, mu1
is roughly equal to mu2

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:21.630
and roughly equal to mu0.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.939
So therefore, this means
that if mu1, mu2, and mu0

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:31.910
are very close to each
other, then actually,

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:35.250
the refractive index based
on that equation which

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:40.340
is showing there, will
be basically, roughly

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:45.229
equal to square root of
epsilon divided by epsilon0.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.894
So therefore, beta would be
equal to epsilon2 divided

01:08:53.894 --> 01:08:58.540
by epsilon1, n1 divided by n2.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:02.399
This is actually the definition.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:07.229
And this will be
basically equal to--

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:10.180
since this is actually
proportional to epsilon2

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.545
divided by epsilon1.

01:09:13.545 --> 01:09:17.800
And n is actually proportional
to epsilon, square root

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.080
of epsilon.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.090
Therefore, you can
conclude that this actually

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:26.505
will be equal to n2 squared
divided by n1 squared,

01:09:26.505 --> 01:09:28.569
n1 divided by n2.

01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:32.275
And that will give
you n2 divided by n1.

01:09:32.275 --> 01:09:37.560
You can actually cancel one
of the n2 and one of the n1.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:42.540
So beta will be equal
to n2 divided by n1.

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:45.420
And therefore, you
can conclude that R

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:52.800
will be a function just related
to the refractive index, which

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.410
means that you are going to get
n1 minus n2 divided by n1 plus

01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:00.480
n2.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.230
Which means that the
amount of reflected light

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:10.140
is related to the difference
in the refractive index.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.570
Then the amount of
the transmitted light

01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:20.000
will be equal two n1
divided by n1 plus n2.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.110
So what does that mean?

01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:26.770
This means that if you have some
material which is essentially

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:35.020
like diamond, diamond have an
n2 equal to something like 2.6,

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:39.770
that means a lot of
light will get reflected,

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:42.230
even if you have
no more incidence.

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.830
So that's actually why the
diamonds are so beautiful,

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:49.670
because a lot of light, pretty
bright, and a lot of things

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:52.380
are actually reflected.

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:57.950
The transmitted fraction
is actually pretty small.

01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:05.013
I can also assume that there
can be a grazing incidence.

01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:12.090
That happens-- this
means that I am

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:22.810
going to have theta I. This
theta I should be here.

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:27.420
This theta I is going to
be roughly 90 degrees.

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.610
In the case of no
more incidence, theta

01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:31.680
I should be equal to zero.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.950
Maybe I misspoke
in the beginning.

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:36.820
So what does that mean?

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:40.730
This means that alpha will
go to infinity, because theta

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:45.120
I is going to 90 degrees.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.120
Therefore, you have
R roughly equal

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.460
to 1, because R is
actually alpha minus beta

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:55.300
divided by alpha plus beta.

01:11:55.300 --> 01:12:00.420
If alpha goes to infinity,
then R will go to 1.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.265
And the tau will be--

01:12:04.265 --> 01:12:07.860
actually, roughly goes to 0.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.620
So that means if you
have a grazing incidence,

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.730
then basically, most of
the light are reflected.

01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:24.250
So that's actually
why when we see,

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:30.600
for example, reflected light
from the sun, which is actually

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.140
on the road, we see that a
lot of light are reflected.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:38.130
When we see a lake which is
actually very far away from me

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:41.390
and the sun in front of it,
you see a huge amount of lite

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.980
got reflected and
going to your eyes.

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:48.210
Looks really bright.

01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:52.800
So finally, there is a
very interesting angle,

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.654
which is actually
considering a situation when

01:12:57.654 --> 01:13:01.600
alpha is equal to beta.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.890
This is a very
interesting angle,

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:11.050
theta B. If we choose
this theta B such

01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:15.770
that alpha is equal to beta,
what is going to happen?

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:17.710
Somebody can tell me.

01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:19.215
If I make--

01:13:19.215 --> 01:13:20.277
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:20.277 --> 01:13:21.360
PROFESSOR: Exactly, right?

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.500
So if you choose an angle such
that alpha is equal to beta,

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.180
then R will be equal to 0.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.980
There will be no reflection.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:33.630
And everything goes
through the material.

01:13:33.630 --> 01:13:36.060
So that is actually
so-called Brewster's angle.

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:52.325
And this happens when theta B--

01:13:56.764 --> 01:13:58.680
which theta B is actually
the incident angle--

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:09.490
plus theta T is
equal to pi over 2.

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:13.310
There's a proof of this
Brewster's angle in the lecture

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.810
notes.

01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:15.700
But we are kind of
running out of time.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.050
But the conclusion
is that you will

01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:23.870
need to have theta B, which
is actually equal to theta I,

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:29.870
the incident angle, plus the
transmission light angle,

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:33.590
theta D. If that is
equal to 90 degrees,

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:35.960
then you can make
alpha equal to 0.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.540
And what is going to
happen is that there

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:43.820
will be no reflected light.

01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:49.430
So when this happens,
when the reflected light

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:54.430
and the transmitted light
have an angle of 90 degrees,

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:58.760
then the amplitude goes to 0.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.130
This is actually a very
interesting property

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:04.010
and it only works for
electromagnetic waves,

01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:07.060
because this is actually
coming from, really,

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:11.000
the effect of
Maxwell's equation.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.870
So now what I'm going to
say is that basically, we

01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:17.280
look at this demonstration.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:24.330
So if we have an incident light,
and the transmitted light.

01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:27.920
Originally, the incident
light is unpolarized.

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.920
So you can have all kinds
of different polarization.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.080
So we can become
post polarization

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.200
into a component which
is actually pointing

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.480
to you, which is the dot.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.610
And the component,
which is actually

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:45.170
the parallel to my slide, which
is actually what we have been

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:47.630
working on, that situation.

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:51.110
So what is going to happen
is that the component which

01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:53.930
is pointing you
is actually never

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:57.950
gets suppressed, because
there will be no perpendicular

01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:58.490
component.

01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:05.990
So therefore, even if
you add Brewster's angle,

01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:07.880
it should get reflected.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.490
On the other hand,
all the components

01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:12.890
which essentially
heavy polarization

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:16.500
parallel to this
slide is eliminated

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.350
because of this relation.

01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:25.650
So that means the reflected
light will be highly polarized.

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:27.790
Do you believe me?

01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:29.200
Maybe not.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.200
We can do an experiment
and really show you

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.690
that's the case.

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.740
So we are almost there.

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:43.180
So now I need to turn off
the light and hide the image.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:47.140
And you can see that there
is a setup here which

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:49.930
I produce unpolarized light.

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:54.360
And there's a glass
here, which actually I

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.930
reflect the unpolarized light.

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:02.350
So now you can see that if
I have some random angle,

01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:04.480
and I have a polarizer here--

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.860
I hope you can see it--

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:11.590
you can see that the polarizer
cannot eliminate all the light.

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:15.440
So basically, no matter
what kind of direction,

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:22.030
it will not be able to eliminate
all the reflected light.

01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:25.600
This means there's some
mixture of all kinds

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.635
of different polarization.

01:17:27.635 --> 01:17:33.790
But now, if I change the
direction to Brewster's angle,

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:39.070
it's roughly here, so you
can see that now, indeed,

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:43.090
I can actually eliminate
all the contribution

01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:44.080
of the reflected light.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.620
Because the reflected
light is highly polarized.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:56.390
As you can see from the
slide, all the component

01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:59.740
which is actually
parallel to the slides

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:03.430
is actually eliminated
due to Brewster's angle.

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:06.400
And that produces
a polarized light.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.640
And that can be filtered
out by the polarizer.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.930
So coming back to the
question which we had before,

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.310
so why can we take
such a good photo?

01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:27.250
That is because of
Brewster's angle.

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:30.650
So once the sunlight gets
reflected by the window,

01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:33.880
it becomes linearly polarized,
and therefore, you can actually

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.170
filter out the majority
of the contribution

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:41.580
by using polarization filter.

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.760
OK, thank you very much.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.310
And I hope you enjoyed
the lecture today.

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:51.220
And hope this will improve
your technique, your skill,

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:53.370
for taking good photos.

01:18:53.370 --> 01:18:56.045
If you have any questions,
please let me know.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.420
Hello, everybody.

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:09.840
So today I'm going to show you
a demonstration of Brewster's

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.250
angle.

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:13.710
So during the class,
we were discussing

01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:16.260
about how to make
very good photos, how

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:21.420
to use polarizer to filter
out the reflected light

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.430
from the sun.

01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:30.090
Usually, when you actually
take a photo of water or a car,

01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:33.060
there are refracted light
from the sun on the window

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.190
or on the water.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:38.970
And then you can actually use
polarizer to filter them out.

01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:42.030
And that has to do
with the property

01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:45.690
of the electromagnetic wave
and the Brewster's angle.

01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:49.930
So here I have an
experimental setup here,

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:52.210
which consists of
three components.

01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:56.580
The first component is a
polarized light source.

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:59.180
And it meets unpolarized light.

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:04.050
And those light are getting
refracted by glass here.

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:08.670
And the unrefracted
light will actually

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:12.730
be shown on the screen
as a spot there.

01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:21.900
So at first, if I have my
glass, which essentially--

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.030
the position of the
glass is in a way such

01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:26.880
that it's actually not
on Brewster's angle.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.800
And now I can actually check
if this light is actually

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:33.030
polarized by using
a polarizer here.

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:37.950
And if I put this polarizer
between the screen

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:40.590
and the glass, you
can see that, huh,

01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:47.430
as a function of the angle which
I am rotating this polarizer,

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:53.430
you can see that no angle can
actually completely eliminate

01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:55.380
the reflected light.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:59.880
So that means that the
reflected light is actually not

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.070
perfectly polarized.

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:05.570
But on the other hand, you can
also see that in some angles,

01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:09.330
you can actually significantly
lower the intensity.

01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:13.560
And that, essentially, is
also pretty good for photo

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:18.190
taking, because that means
all the reflected light,

01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:20.310
although now the
angle is actually not

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:25.800
at Brewster's angle, you
still have the reflected light

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.370
slightly polarized.

01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:30.770
So that actually your polarizer
in front of the camera

01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:33.380
will still do some work.

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:36.500
Now what I'm going to do is
to change the angle so that it

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:40.590
matches with Brewster's angle.

01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:43.792
So now you can see
that if I insert

01:21:43.792 --> 01:21:50.220
a polarizer between the
glass and the screen,

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:54.060
you can see that at some
angle, for example, now

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:58.366
we can actually filter out
or completely eliminate

01:21:58.366 --> 01:22:00.390
the spot on the screen.

01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:04.440
So that means at
Brewster's angle,

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.430
basically, the reflected
light is actually

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:10.320
completely polarized,
as we actually

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.290
predicted from the lecture.

01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:14.700
And the reason is the following.

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.820
There's only one direction
of the polarized light

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:22.050
from the unpolarized
source can get reflected

01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:26.940
due to the boundary condition
of the electromagnetic wave.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:30.810
And therefore, we see
this very unique phenomena

01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:35.050
which we can only see in
electromagnetic waves.

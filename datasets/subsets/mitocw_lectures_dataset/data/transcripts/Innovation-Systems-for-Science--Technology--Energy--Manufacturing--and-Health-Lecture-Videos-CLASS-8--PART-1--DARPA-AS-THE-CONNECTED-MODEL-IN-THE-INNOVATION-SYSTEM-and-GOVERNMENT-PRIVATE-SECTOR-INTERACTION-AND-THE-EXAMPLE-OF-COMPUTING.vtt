00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.570
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Tonight is
a deep dive into DARPA, which

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.880
is a very different model.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.190
And we've talked
around DARPA, but--

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.130
we talked about snippets
of some of the stuff

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.350
that we're going to
be going through,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.480
but tonight will be
kind of a deep dive

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.600
into looking this model.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.250
And the model is
an important one

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.020
because we've gotten
so much out of DARPA.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.900
It's been a remarkable run.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.620
And so we'll look at
the foundational period.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.620
And there are a lot of
good MIT stories in here,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.820
which we'll get on the table.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.020
But we'll also try
to frame really

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.580
how this organization,
institution functions.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.440
So this is a JCR
Licklider story--

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.610
one of MIT's all-time greats.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.530
And he doesn't get talked
about that much at MIT,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.020
but he really is foundational.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:40.870
And he comes in at a time when
computing is really completely

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.670
different than it
is today, and is

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.240
able, with his team at DARPA,
to really work through--

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.840
really in an intergenerational
between DARPA program manager

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.390
and office director
generations--

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.070
really rework the entire sector.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.100
So we've talked a little about
Whirlwind and SAGE earlier.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.000
And just to remind
you, this was one

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.220
of the foundational
early computer systems.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.790
This was MIT's at
Whirlwind and SAGE.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.960
And this is Jay Forrester, and
he's holding the magnetic core

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.290
memory that he and one
of his graduate students

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.840
came up with, which enabled
real-time computing,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.210
a really critical advance.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.970
And you start to see at
Whirlwind, in the upper-left--

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.700
which merges into
the SAGE system--

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.400
you start to see where
computing is going.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.230
So that picture of
this computer operator,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.960
this lady sitting in front of a
keyboard in front of a cathode

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.480
ray screen.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.600
That's this, and there it is.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.480
There it is at late '40s, early
'50s when this is going on.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.530
And how did this all evolve?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.080
So on the lower left
is George Valley,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.870
who was an MIT faculty member.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.520
He was part of the Rad Lab.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.120
And Valley is on a scientific
advisory board to the Air

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.620
Force, and he sounds the
alarm, essentially alerting

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.820
the Air Force and frankly,
the military in general,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.280
that the Soviet Union has
developed a long-range bombing

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.820
aircraft.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.340
They have nuclear weapons,
and they have, therefore,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.140
first strike capability.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.440
There is absolutely
nothing in their way

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.140
of reaching the northern
part of the United States.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.620
And that's a terrifying
realization moment.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.100
So Valley gets the Air Force
mobilized around an air defense

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.140
mission.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.440
And computers are going
to be at the heart of it.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.060
And he goes to
Jay Forrester, who

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.560
was developing this Whirlwind
system for the Navy.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.590
The Navy's is
canceling Whirlwind,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.500
so Valley just moves
Forrester and the team,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.980
and the Whirlwind system over to
the SAGE project of developing

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.410
an air defense and controllers.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.380
And the picture here is what--

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.940
essentially what
the picture looks

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.010
like of all these
different defense

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.350
systems, from early missiles,
and artillery, and fighter

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.120
aircraft, all being linked into
a communications and computer

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.620
system.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.490
And then fascinatingly,
the communications lines

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.310
are across phone lines.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.430
So the computers are running a
communication system that comes

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.040
into them across phone lines.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.930
The picture of those
Air Force airmen

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.910
sitting in front of
cathode ray screens,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.030
they're holding
this peculiar thing.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.930
It's a light gun.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.910
It's the mouse.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.940
So you start to see these iconic
pictures of where all this

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.120
stuff that we just live with--

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.920
where it all starts-- come from.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.530
And a lot of it came from the
Whirlwind and SAGE systems.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.960
MIT doesn't want to go into
the business of manufacturing

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.560
computers.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.000
They make the initial
computers for the SAGE system,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.370
but they don't want to be in
the computer manufacturing

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.540
business.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.710
So the SAGE system becomes
the IBM 700 series.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.580
This is how IBM really
starts to scale up

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.380
in mainframe
computing, and starts

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.810
building the computing systems
for this air defense system.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.100
So again, it's an example of
long-term patient military

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.200
support for
technology development

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.760
that we've seen before.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.010
And here it is again,
only this time,

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.240
it's sponsoring computing.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.830
So Mitch Waldrop's book
The Dream Machine I think

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.780
is really the classic on the
evolution of the Information

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.860
Age.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.370
It is full of wonderful
stories, and I

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.880
feel that it's
really well written,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.160
and I couldn't resist
giving you a big dose of it.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.127
But there's a lot of great
MIT stories in here, but lots

00:06:10.127 --> 00:06:12.460
of great stories about the
foundation of where computing

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.470
came from and how it arrived--

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.860
that fits with the material that
we've been covering in class.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.170
So we'll go through
some of this key stuff,

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.310
and then stuff will
lead us in some Q and A.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.910
Computing before Licklider, it's
non-interactive, it's not fun,

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.500
it's not exciting.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.040
It's behind glass
walls, and you'd

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.330
be met by like these high
priests and priestesses who are

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.380
wearing white coats and gloves.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.260
And you'd carry your
stack of punch cards in,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.100
and you'd hand over this
offering of punch cards.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.527
Maybe the high
priest or priestess

00:06:55.527 --> 00:06:57.610
paid attention to you, and
took the cards from you

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.570
in a few minutes.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.040
Maybe that happened.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.430
And then they would
tell you, fine.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.060
You're 479th on line,
come back in a week

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.100
and we'll have run this for you.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.520
This is not real-time computing.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.990
That's literally
the way was like.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.490
It was just very forbidding.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.360
It was very distant.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.240
It's definitely not
what we have now.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.050
And it's built for a number
of processing bureaucracies,

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.432
and initially in government,
but then in business.

00:07:31.432 --> 00:07:32.890
And that's not to
knock mainframes.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.600
They're a huge remarkable
technical advance.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.110
IBM starts to
dominate that sector,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.230
and they incorporate
the machinery

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.680
that they're familiar with.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.750
They're building
business machines that

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.120
are punch card-run
with batch processing,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:59.050
so they carry those technologies
into the mainframe computers

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.190
that they're building.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.960
Now, look, you come
back after a week,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.570
and you get handed a stack
of this weird green and white

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.288
paper with holes
punched in the side.

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:11.080
You probably don't have
any memory of this,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.910
but I remember it deeply.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.088
And you'd get handed
this stack of paper,

00:08:15.088 --> 00:08:16.630
and then you'd go
back to your office

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.510
and you sit down and
start go through.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.680
And then you realize
that, after page 39,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.680
it's all gibberish, because
one of your punch cards

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.010
was out of order or upside-down,
or something like that.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.012
So then you'd have to go
back and stand in line

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.429
with the high
priest or priestess,

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.740
and start the whole
process all over again.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.559
That's really what it's like.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:43.090
And the emphasis was on
bigger and bigger computers

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:50.450
able to handle more and more
large number batch processing.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.960
So Licklider comes
along more than a decade

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:03.610
before personal computing and
30 years before the internet.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.400
And the word computer
still has this kind

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.170
of ominous tone of a
intimidating device that's

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.190
kind of hidden away in
this over-lit, super air

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.750
conditioned, noisy,
fan-ridden space.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:25.570
And it's about as far away
from this as we can imagine.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:30.550
And this is really what that
team at DARPA, that Licklider

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.250
led, drives us to.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.070
So we'll talk about
the film in a bit,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.040
but a lot of the
leadership of that team

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.480
goes on to do amazing stuff.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.930
So here's some
Licklider photographs.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:52.210
This is DEC's PDP-8 that
was the first mini-computer,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:57.340
an entire movement away
from mainframe computing

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.800
that really was key to
spawning the revolution.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.010
So Licklider is playing
with this machine.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.170
It came from Digital
Equipment Corporation,

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.010
which is an MIT spin-off,
Lincoln Labs spin-off.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.630
And they're trying
to start to pursue

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.060
a more personalized
kind of computing

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.330
with these mini-computers.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:23.260
On the lower left is the
team that does the internet.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.400
And the only book
that Licklider wrote

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.520
is called libraries
of the future,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.900
and he essentially envisions
digital storage of everything.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.082
It's amazing work.

00:10:42.082 --> 00:10:43.540
The librarians are
trying to wonder

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.430
what to do with computers,
and he essentially

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.000
gives them the entire picture.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.430
So a very innovative character.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.900
He grows up in St. Louis.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:04.840
Both his parents are ministers,
and he's an only child.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.740
Responsible kid,
but his parents let

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:14.740
him do things like assemble
automobiles in the living room.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.920
For most of his life, he never
spent more than $50 on a car

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.760
because he would essentially
by junkers and parts

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.120
and put them together himself.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.330
That's the way the
family drove around.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.630
So he has a tremendous
facility for--

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.780
remember we talked
about mind in hand,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.200
when we talked about the
Industrial Revolution.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.730
Licklider has got that
tactile knowledge facility,

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.130
and it's part of why
he loves computers.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.270
He falls in love with
psychology and becomes actually

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.420
quite a significant early
thinker about psychology,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.930
when that whole field
is starting to change.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.750
His World War II
experience is spent up

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:01.030
at Memorial Hall at
Harvard in the basement

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.860
with acoustics
researchers, studying

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:12.280
how pilots and the crew of
airplanes-- how they react

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.320
to this unbelievable
noise that they've

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.580
got in the pre-pressurized
cabins in World War II aircraft

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.770
with these huge propeller
engines next to their ears,

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.660
trying to hear radio signals.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.440
And this is before there's
any kind of navigation system.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.520
It's pre-LORAN.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.320
It's obviously long before GPS.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.630
So there's a terrible problem--
the communication systems

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.387
and the way in which
you navigate a lot--

00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:35.970
typically, if you
can't see the stars.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.280
So all kinds of plans
get lost over oceans

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.720
because the radio communications
don't get picked up.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.580
So he's working on how can
we improve the man machine

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.840
interface around acoustics
in the cabin of airplanes?

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:58.360
So he's thinking a lot about
how people and machines work

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.900
together.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.370
And that's what he contributes.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.740
He's not a computer-- early
computer scientists really,

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.640
although he loves computing.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.960
He plays with them all
the time, knows them

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.280
backwards and forwards.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:15.520
He's bringing the ideas of
a psychologist to computing,

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.260
and that's what,
in many ways, makes

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.690
him a complete
breakthrough thinker.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.120
He's able to take
ideas from psychology

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.673
and bring them into this early
computing field, not just

00:13:25.673 --> 00:13:27.340
an engineering
perspective-- although he

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.730
has very good engineering
and physics capability.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:38.710
And he writes an absolutely
seminal article in 1960

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.440
that essentially was still
working through his agenda

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.480
of what needs to happen.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.970
It's an amazing vision.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.210
He, for example, realizes
that 85% of human time

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.750
is spent getting
into a position to be

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.550
able to think about a problem--
arranging all the stuff,

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.967
pulling all the
material together,

00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:01.460
and then you can think.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.550
Suppose you could reduce that
85% by having the computer

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.470
do it for you, by having
the computer arrange

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.480
a lot of that stuff for you.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.490
That's part of his concept.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.010
The central concept
he has is the hope

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.590
is that human
brains and computing

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.350
machines will be coupled
together very tightly,

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.660
and that the resulting
partnership will

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.990
think as no human is
ever thought and process

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.690
data in a way not approached
by the information handling

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.270
machines we have today.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.860
In other words,
he has this vision

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.100
of people and machines in this
collaborative relationship.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.167
It's going to be a symbiotic
kind of relationship.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.750
And let's think for
a minute about how

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.940
people thought about computing.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.150
Now, we're all sitting around
wondering when the robots are

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.800
going to take our jobs.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.010
That's the obsession
of the moment.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.690
Licklider's coming
out of a time period

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.580
where there was a
similar obsession.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.190
And Norbert Wiener-- who
pops up in this book,

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.500
and is another one of
MIT's absolute greats,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.200
a brilliant mathematician--

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.530
Wiener is the one who
invents the term cybernetics.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.407
And Wiener has this
vision saying, look out--

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:09.740
and he writes in the late '40s--

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.380
the computers are
coming, and they're

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.110
going to be smarter than we are.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.550
It's a very dark picture of
what computing is going to be.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.760
And you all seen
2001-- the Hal computer

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.310
in 2001, Space Odyssey?

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.300
AUDIENCE: I know of it.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.758
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
You know of it.

00:15:27.758 --> 00:15:29.480
Well, shows my age.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.290
But that's the kind of vision,
this dark vision of computers

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.390
taking over our lives.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.390
And that was alive and
well as early computing

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.570
started to take off.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.810
And actually one of
the conceptualizers

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.080
who got people worrying about
computing was Norbert Wiener.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.500
But along comes Licklider with
his background in psychology,

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.130
and he has a completely
different vision.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:58.580
And his vision
wins, thank heavens.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.260
So he understands that
things like human perception,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.840
and goal-setting, and judgment,
and insight, and intuition--

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.240
machines can't do
that, that these are

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.735
incredible human attributes.

00:16:13.735 --> 00:16:15.110
And the machine's
just not can be

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.590
able to equal us on that stuff,
that certain kind of feel

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:23.460
we have about how things fall
together and shape up in place.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.820
So those qualities are
going to surpass machines,

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.730
but then machines are going
to be able to do stuff

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.220
that we can't do, that we're
not particularly good at,

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.480
and don't want to
spend a lot of time on.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.510
So there's going to
be a relationship.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.740
So Licklider is spending a
lot of time at Lincoln Lab,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.940
playing on computers
up at Lincoln Lab.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.370
He starts to master all
those early machines,

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:53.240
including the DEC PDP-8,
the first mini-computer--

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.180
real mini-computer.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.830
He leads the MIT
Psychology Department,

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:08.119
and joins BBN, which is the
premier acoustics consulting

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.790
firm.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.520
And they do things like
design the acoustics

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.910
for Lincoln Center, the
famous acoustics firm.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.160
And they had this
idea, gee, maybe

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.770
we ought to get in the
computing business.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.710
Maybe these computers are
actually here to stay.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.630
So Licklider is hired
at BBN to bring them

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.055
into the early computing age.

00:17:33.055 --> 00:17:34.055
And that's what he does.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.570
In this 1960 article,
his key image

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.170
is a fig tree
pollinated by a wasp--

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.390
in other words, the relationship
between the fig tree

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.400
and the wasp is
complete symbiotic,

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.860
they're mutually supporting.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.510
And that's the
vision that he has

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.490
of what computing
is going to be.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.350
So it's this partnership
between computers and people

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.440
with a complementary
set of functions.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.960
And the partnership
has to be in real time.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.270
We have to get rid of all
this batch processing stuff.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.250
That has to go.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.190
It's got to be real time.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.020
The computer is
to relieve people

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.470
of that drudgery factor,
the 85% of the set up time

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.470
we spend getting ready to think.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:26.600
It is a time of what is being
talked about as time-sharing.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.930
These big massive mainframes
behind glass with the priests

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.900
and priestesses dressed
in white lab coats,

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.780
people don't get access to them.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.290
It's like going to
the Oracle of Delphi.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.640
You just can't get in there.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.010
And he has a vision of
could we, in effect,

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.820
take that computer back
from the Oracle of Delphi

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.380
and get people on this thing.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.790
And how are we going to
do that with mainframes?

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.123
We're going to do it through
what's called, at the time,

00:18:52.123 --> 00:18:52.790
time-sharing.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.420
Let people have access
to a share of time.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.000
And he has a vision of
central computers, and then--

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.080
as a competing center
with interconnected users

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.300
tying into that central
computing system.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.920
He understands
things like building

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:21.170
a network of people
aided by computers

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.370
that become in effect a
network of thinking centers.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.660
And that network concept
really is a core idea

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.460
that is what his team at
DARPA later establishes

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.750
BBN as the internet.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.980
He understands that
artificial intelligence

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.320
isn't an analogous way of
thinking about thinking--

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.640
that it can help us understand
intellectual processes.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.320
He has a vision of a computer
being a desk console, not

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.400
a mainframe--

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.978
in other words,
radically smaller

00:19:56.978 --> 00:19:58.520
than even the
mini-computer that he's

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.370
starting to play with from DEC.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:10.160
He just has a series of these
concepts in this 1960 article

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.910
that lays out what's
going to be happening.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.150
He envisions
interactive computing.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.900
He envisions programming
is not just programming.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.590
He starts to understand
that this is a science--

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.410
in a way, a linguistic
kind of science in itself,

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.320
and is deserving full respect--

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.370
that computer science is a true
science like other sciences,

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.100
that it's not just
a new tool set.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.190
It's something organized
around one of the fundamentals.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.467
Information is one
of the fundamentals,

00:20:43.467 --> 00:20:45.800
one of the foundational
building blocks of the universe.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.230
And you're organizing a whole
field around information.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.030
Computing is going
to be a science,

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.420
and he recognizes that
very, very early on,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.220
long before others.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.930
It'll have practical
applications,

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:03.920
but it's worthy of a whole
intellectual field on its own.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.630
And he sees how
closely tied computing

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:09.922
can be to cognitive science.

00:21:09.922 --> 00:21:12.380
So he has a whole vision of
what he calls dynamic modeling.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.100
In other words,
this is an era where

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.010
you get statistics on paper.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.220
But he has the vision that, if
you put them on your computer,

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.910
you can start to play
with each element

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:32.040
and begin to turn them
into graphs and designs,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.540
and get a much more realistic
feel for how the data is

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.260
related, and start to play
with the different variables.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.070
And you're going to be able
to feed hundreds and thousands

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.470
of variables into
your computer in a way

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.200
that you can never
even think of,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.830
when people are doing
statistics by pencil and paper.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.910
So he has a whole vision
of this whole-- what

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.830
he calls dynamic
modeling, the modeling

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:03.750
role that computing effect plays
in a very dramatic way now.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:09.960
It's that computing can handle
this problem of complexity

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.210
because of its
relentless ability

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.170
to deal with thousands and
now millions of variables.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.700
So economics is
a profession that

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.190
was organized around
essentially you couldn't really

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.280
handle much more than
three, four, five variables

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.140
operating at the same time.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.870
Computing would
enable science to cope

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:32.340
with a profound issue
like climate change,

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.010
and actually start to
be able to model that.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.750
So he understands
all this stuff,

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.740
and he starts to lay this out
piece after piece after piece

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.280
for people to think about.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.510
I mentioned earlier
the electronic library.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.490
He understands that
all information

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.217
is going to be online
and stored online,

00:22:52.217 --> 00:22:54.300
and is going to be accessible
to everybody who can

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.170
get onto one of these things.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.480
And it will be
the library and it

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.328
will be the reference
librarian for you.

00:23:03.328 --> 00:23:05.370
In other words, it's going
to be able to organize

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.220
your information in ways
that could never have

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.960
been previously anticipated.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:19.950
15 years before the PC and
30 years before the internet,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:24.510
he's seeing graphics,
computing graphics, computer

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:29.220
rich personal workstations,
human computer symbiosis,

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.220
interactive computing,
networks, the idea

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.920
of an online community,
a thinking community,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:40.170
online libraries, instant
retrieval, data organization,

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.800
computing language,
programming that's

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:51.330
elevated from a tool
set to a true science--

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.260
a whole digital
medium of expression.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.970
So he is a visionary.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:55.950
He has this vision.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.180
He starts writing about
the intergalactic network.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:08.940
It's the worldwide web decades
before Tim Berners-Lee here

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.770
pulls it off.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:17.500
He's a visionary, and
of a remarkable degree.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.950
And there's no vision
champion at the time,

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:27.990
but then DARPA
hires him out of BBN

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.740
to lead essentially
this whole development

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.330
of personal computing.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:39.240
So it's a completely rare
moment where a visionary becomes

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.290
the vision enabler.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.450
What happens here?

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.940
So 1957 is the Shock of Sputnik.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.340
So DARPA gets created.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.110
DARPA's originally given
the space mission, because.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:55.950
Eisenhower's angry
at the services

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.010
because they weren't
talking to each other,

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.460
and Russians got the
first satellite up.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.380
And it wasn't about a
nice blinking thing,

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.002
it was about first strike
ballistic missile capability.

00:25:08.002 --> 00:25:08.835
It was very serious.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.570
But then he took space
away and gave it to NASA,

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.910
so DARPA had to start
thinking of things to do.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.790
And they come up with a
lot of creative stuff,

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:25.050
but the big early DARPA
set of accomplishments

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.770
is really Licklider
and his team.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:35.040
And so Jack Kennedy
and Secretary

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.410
of Defense Robert McNamara
go through the Cuban Missile

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.600
Crisis, which is a
complete nightmare.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.230
And we do things like get
within 20 minutes of launching

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.818
a first strike by mistake.

00:25:48.818 --> 00:25:50.610
And they realize that
they've got something

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.780
that they call a really serious
command and control problem.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.720
And Jack Ruina, who's head
of DARPA, who's another MIT

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:03.948
faculty member, hires
Licklider to come in and deal

00:26:03.948 --> 00:26:05.490
with the command
and control problem.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.030
And Licklider's response to
Jack Ruina is, wait a minute,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:15.270
I'm working on computing and
making computing personal.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.150
What do I know about the
command and control problem?

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.940
But they have a
conversation, and Ruina

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.640
starts to see that what
Licklider is working on

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.650
is exactly what he is concerned
about the command and control

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.150
problem.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.540
With all these capabilities that
Licklider is thinking about,

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.510
they need to tackle this
command and control problem.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.930
So Licklider comes to
DARPA, and because he's

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.540
working on what DARPA
calls a presidential--

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.870
in other words, this is the
problem the president himself--

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.090
President Kennedy
himself has posed--

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.700
fix the command and
control problem.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.130
He has resources.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.400
So it's a very powerful moment.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.440
Ruina hadn't really
thought about the linkage

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.600
between behavior and
computing and the kind of way

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.240
that Licklider has
really thought through,

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.370
but begins to see what
the possibilities are.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.330
So this is really when
DARPA becomes DARPA.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:17.307
Some of the culture of DARPA--
we've talked a bit about they--

00:27:17.307 --> 00:27:19.140
I'll just summarize
some of the rules sets--

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.870
hire great program managers
that are world-class,

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.880
give them an enormous
amount of power.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.430
They have the
authority at DARPA.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.340
Unleash them.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.400
Let them develop a
vision, and then find

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.250
the best people in
the country to do it,

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.500
and they're on the problem.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.590
That is not the way
R&D organizations are

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.370
organized in the United States.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.220
That's not the way we do it.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.960
We have NSF.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.930
It has a program manager.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:04.820
The program manager is overseen
by a peer review system.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.670
They wait for applications to
come in from the scientists

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:08.960
saying what they'd like to do.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.400
They review the applications.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.000
The peer review team makes a
decision on who gets funded.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.830
The project manager
is essentially

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.530
doing the arranging
here, but peer review

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.880
makes the core decision.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.830
It's a much more
bureaucratic process,

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.490
and it's a bottom-up system.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.490
Look, there's a lot of
strengths in that system.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.380
I don't want to
knock that system.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.600
It's an important function
to have for science

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.480
so that scientists themselves
can originate ideas.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.880
That's not what DARPA does.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.540
DARPA has strong
program managers.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.610
They develop the ideas, and they
go out and make them happen.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.670
And program managers don't
last much more than four years

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.200
at DARPA--

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.530
three to five years--

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.520
so they've got
that period of time

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.720
to get done with their project.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.150
They've got to get something
happening within a relatively

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.060
short period of time.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.330
So that's going to affect
what they try to do.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.120
They're not working on
25-year projects at DARPA.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.670
They're working on stuff that
can be stood up in a relatively

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.410
short period of time.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:12.110
And it's just a very
different organizational model

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.060
for a science organization--

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.633
no peer review, two sign offs.

00:29:17.633 --> 00:29:20.300
If you're a program manager, you
figure out what you want to do,

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.470
what direction
you want to go to.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.887
You sell that to your office
director and to the director,

00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:24.530
and that's it.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.710
And it could be funded that day.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:31.520
Can move very, very fast.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.990
So they're organized around this
whole grand challenge concept.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.090
DARPA doesn't want to
do incremental advance.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.210
It only wants to do technology
revolutionary breakthroughs

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.940
that will change everything.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.160
So it doesn't want to waste--

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.910
let other people do
the incremental stuff.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.800
That's not DARPA's job.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.332
And it's a right
left model, so it

00:29:50.332 --> 00:29:52.040
wants to look at what's
going to come out

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.270
of the pipeline, what the
technology is that it wants--

00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:00.950
personal computing-- and then
go back into the pipeline

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.830
and figure out the research
that's going to get this

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.210
outcome, again, within the
life of the program manager--

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.990
in this, say, four
or five-year period.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:16.270
So it's just it's
really different.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:20.300
Licklider pulls together
different teams.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.290
So the other thing
about DARPA is

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.390
that essentially the role
of the program manager

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.690
is to find great groups
and to support them.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.730
And that's what Licklider does.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.470
So DARPA's different
because it's

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:37.670
working as an institutional
entity in the R&D space.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.610
It's another
institutional R&D entity,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:47.420
but it is also organized around
personal face-to-face great

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.340
group creation.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.800
So it takes the two
sides of the equation

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.740
that we treated as two
entirely different classes--

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.270
it is putting them together.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.640
That's why DARPA follows
after our discussion

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.930
in the great group class.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.540
That's who Licklider is finding.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.000
He's finding these
amazing, great groups.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.400
And we've seen some
of them before.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:13.040
These are all who's who of the
history of computer science.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.610
We talked about Doug Engelbart.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.040
There he is.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.520
He's someone that Lick
finds and supports,

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.710
even though the Stanford
Research Institute

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.040
doesn't know what he's doing.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.623
They don't know what
he's doing there.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.440
He does this you know
unbelievable demonstration

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.620
with all this
breakthrough material.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.350
At MIT, project MAC is right
there at Technology Square.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.190
You can kind of recognize that
building on the lower left.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:49.130
So after Licklider leaves DARPA,
he goes to join Project MAC.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:53.780
But meanwhile, he gets stood
up by Ferdinand Corbato and Bob

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.863
Fano.

00:31:55.863 --> 00:31:58.280
The history of what comes out
of that place-- and it's all

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.400
DARPA-funded-- is
just breathtaking.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.780
So when you go buy that
building at Technology Square--

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.060
I think it's 500
Technology Square--

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.900
take off your hat,
because amazing stuff.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.450
Absolutely amazing
stuff occurred there.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.390
Within MIT, there's this
fascinating conflict.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:22.580
There are two competing
visions of computer science

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.910
fighting for the
same DARPA money.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:29.990
So Marvin Minsky,
great roboticist--

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.380
great, one of the all-time
greats-- just died recently.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.630
Amazing figure.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.120
Minsky had this vision that
computer thinking would be

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.370
superior to people's thinking.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:44.420
So he has the Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.180
and he's running
that vision, and then

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.820
Licklider and
Corbato and Fano are

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.240
running the computer
is our friend,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.990
it's going to be a
symbiotic relationship,

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.540
we're going to do
personal computing--

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.650
very different ideas battling
each other for funding.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:05.000
It took years of negotiation
to put together CSAIL

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.810
because you had these two
different visions that

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.010
competed with each other.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:16.850
Just like we talked about the
competition over the genome

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.040
last week in the
great groups session,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.020
this was one of those
great competitions.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.130
Each side is pushing each other.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:28.040
And Minsky and team would do
unbelievable robotics stuff

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.680
and they would say, top this.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.680
And the MAC team would come
back with the responses.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.470
So it was a wonderful
competition going on here.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:42.390
But creating CSAIL required two
co-directors at the outset--

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.400
somebody from computer
science and somebody

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.977
from artificial intelligence.

00:33:46.977 --> 00:33:48.060
It's kind of settled down.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.560
They're all on the
same project now.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.720
But that was a 20-year or
longer project to get there.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:01.500
So it's a remarkable
set of communities,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.310
including project MAC at MIT,
but that's just one of them

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.160
that gets created.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.070
So all the early computer
science departments

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.330
are funded by DARPA.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.679
DARPA really creates them.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.659
That's why there is
computer science that's

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.242
so deep and rich in
the United States.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:25.489
Licklider's three research
priorities at DARPA are

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:29.600
time-sharing-- which is
really interactive computing,

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.370
and that's like
personal computing--

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.800
and then graphics and modeling--

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.540
and another great
name, Ivan Sullivan

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.139
ran that piece, and that's
early computing graphics--

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.420
and then networking.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.730
And Bob Taylor, who we
talked about last week,

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.870
who goes to Xerox PARC, comes
out of DARPA to do that.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.940
And that's where
he gets his stuff.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.429
And he and Larry
Roberts, as well,

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:56.900
are the ones that lead the
effort to stand up computing.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.480
And Luyao told us
about him last week.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.240
We sent around his obit, because
he just died this past week.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.410
It's a wonderful obit--

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:04.910
if you all get a
chance to read it--

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.790
that appeared in New York Times.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:11.730
The ARPANET gets created.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.270
So Licklider creates
this thing at DARPA.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.430
He has two different
stints at DARPA.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.890
He's there for several
years in each stint.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.948
But he creates a community that
keeps carrying on the projects.

00:35:21.948 --> 00:35:23.990
In other words, they agree
on what the agenda is,

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.540
and they keep working
down the list together.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.110
So DARPA doesn't-- isn't
always able to do this.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.460
Often there's a real problem--

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.470
when a program manager
leaves after their three

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:36.950
to five-year stint, what
happens to their work?

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.360
Who does the follow one?

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.180
But Licklider builds
this community

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:47.270
that keeps the project going for
way over a decade and a half.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:54.350
And Taylor and Larry
Roberts, out of Lincoln Lab,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.350
really lead the effort
to do the internet.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:05.160
They hire BBN, Licklider's old
firm, to actually carry it out.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.210
And that's done right
here in Cambridge.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.240
So the internet gets
done just up the road.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.420
I won't go into the whole
story about it, but it's--

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.010
two great things occur in 1969--

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:31.670
we go to the Moon and
we do the internet.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:37.430
And in 1969, nobody had
ever heard of the internet.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:42.830
But in the end, which
is the more significant?

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:47.780
And that's going on
just up the street here.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.250
It's a pretty
breathtaking moment.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.290
These are some of the figures.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:57.110
This is Vint Cerf and
Bob Kahn, who were--

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.580
lead the whole protocol effort--

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.092
TCPIP, the whole
internet protocol system

00:37:02.092 --> 00:37:04.175
that's really at the heart
of the internet system.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.670
Larry Roberts, who came
out of Lincoln Lab,

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:18.050
persuades the DARPA
director to use email.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.290
So DARPA's like an
early email user.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.340
So everybody in
DARPA goes on email.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.430
They nurture this thing along.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:29.990
They're one of the
early user bases.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.830
It becomes this system
of communication,

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:36.080
because DARPA's using it for
the entire ARPANET community.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:45.110
It's originally stood up with
about five universities linked.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:49.480
The real problem they've
got is that, because DARPA's

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.980
trying to stand up these early
computer science departments,

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.830
and lots of breakthroughs
are happening in computing,

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.690
DARPA's having to
spend a fortune buying

00:37:56.690 --> 00:38:00.710
new computers for each one
of its university research

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.220
centers.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.553
And it's costing them a fortune.

00:38:02.553 --> 00:38:06.050
They're spending their
money on the next generation

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.910
of computer advance.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.140
And one of the reasons they
have to do the internet

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.020
is that, gee, if they only
had to buy one computer

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.698
and everybody
could get on it, it

00:38:17.698 --> 00:38:19.490
would be a gigantic
money saver, and they'd

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.140
be able to do much more stuff.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.572
So they have this
internal reason.

00:38:23.572 --> 00:38:25.280
Now, the external
reason for the internet

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.560
is much more complicated.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.260
One of the reasons
is that it's going

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.840
to be a secure communications
system at the time

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.890
of terrible threats.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:37.478
Now, you all are--

00:38:37.478 --> 00:38:39.020
probably don't have
much recollection

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.720
of 9/11, but sure
enough, the only way

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.080
we knew about each other on 9/11
was because the internet still

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:46.580
worked.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:50.990
The phone system in New York
City went down in a flash.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.490
And it worked.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:55.700
It turned out to be an
enormously important

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.630
fallback communications system,
because it is so resilient.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.810
In other word, you can establish
those network lines essentially

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:07.610
through any connection, not
just a straight one-to-one

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.750
connection like
the phone system.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:13.670
So that was part of the
rationale for developing

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:17.950
the internet, but
frankly, Licklider

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.577
had a vision of what the
internet was going to be,

00:39:20.577 --> 00:39:21.910
which is really why they did it.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.150
And then they had this excuse of
trying to reduce their computer

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.592
budget for buying
fancy computers for all

00:39:27.592 --> 00:39:29.800
their computer science
departments around the country

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.420
at universities.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:36.260
So it's an amazing story.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.530
We heard the story
from Luyao last week

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.375
about how personal
computing comes about.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.480
A lot of that
community is being--

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.070
came right out of Licklider's
support of university research

00:39:51.070 --> 00:40:02.560
groups, and then moves over
to carry it out at Xerox PARC.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.690
And then, of course, Xerox
PARC is unable to do it,

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.210
as you explained.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.120
But luckily, Steve
Jobs buys the rights

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.770
to walk through
and see the stuff.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.790
And he's a great implementer.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.130
All right.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.383
Steph, what did I miss?

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:20.800
STEPH: The one
point that I really

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.420
emphasize to set up the
questions is something

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.000
that Bill touched on,
which is that there

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.220
was a very significant
dispute between the scientists

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.470
and engineers who were trying
to create the integrated

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:44.140
system versus the
isolated, siloed systems.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.300
And that ends up playing
a big role in, I think,

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.467
how many of you perceived
the readings and the kinds

00:40:48.467 --> 00:40:50.320
of questions that you asked.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.800
I think the place where I'd
like to start our conversation

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.280
is about the mechanisms by which
the computing revolution was

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.390
created.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:00.820
We have a question from
Beth, and she poses,

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.130
how much of a
technological revolution

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.920
is the scientific
breakthrough versus the vision

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.940
of how to use it?

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.570
So I think that really
gets at the heart of

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.590
whether or not a technology can
be disruptive or revolutionary

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.600
versus whether the
implementation is

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.328
what actually matters, as you
just noted with Steve Jobs.

00:41:24.167 --> 00:41:26.250
AUDIENCE: Just to clarify,
when you vision, do you

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:30.390
mean JCR's vision, or do you
mean the visionary who comes

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:32.865
after, which is Steve Jobs?

00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:34.590
Which vision are
you talking about?

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.530
STEPH: Well, I think
we'll let Beth clarify.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.320
BETH: I think it is kind
of a cumulative process.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.760
The reason that Steve Jobs
was able to have a vision

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.080
was because JCR had his vision.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.470
So it's kind of like at each
step in the road, the reason

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.780
we were able to progress,
was it because of the vision,

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.380
or was it because of
technology, or was it

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.767
this guy was at the right
place at the right time?

00:41:56.767 --> 00:41:58.350
How else could things
have progressed,

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:01.290
if it had been under
different circumstance?

00:42:04.842 --> 00:42:06.300
STEPH: So how much
weight, I guess,

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.480
are we giving the invention,
the mechanism by which this

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.111
was achieved on its own?

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.580
AUDIENCE: Well, I think a good
way to think about it is--

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.550
you know ancient dynasties?

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.260
There's one that was--

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.120
took a while and
didn't do anything

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.340
that was that significant.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.930
But they built up
the infrastructure

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.555
so that a dynasty
comes in right after,

00:42:28.555 --> 00:42:31.055
and they end up doing all these
awesome things, and everyone

00:42:31.055 --> 00:42:32.330
talks about that one.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.160
So I think it's kind
of like Steve Jobs,

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.785
Bill Gates have a voice because,
again, billionaires-- everyone

00:42:36.785 --> 00:42:38.060
is like, oh.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.760
There's a saying where, I
wish I was rich so then people

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.930
would listen to me.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.980
So people pay attention
because they became wealthy.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.230
And they kind of popularized
the idea of the engineer,

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.690
and they gave a lot of
respect to the engineer,

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.230
because now they make money.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:55.190
But in the past, like in the
'70s, there's a couple series

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.710
and a couple of biographies
where there's really,

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.750
really brilliant
people that might be--

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.120
I would even say more brilliant
than some people today--

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.480
in those technologies.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:08.690
But they just weren't valued
economically or socially.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.238
In the '70s, being a
nerd was being a nerd.

00:43:12.238 --> 00:43:13.780
Nowadays, being a
nerd is like, damn,

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.385
he might be a billionaire--

00:43:14.385 --> 00:43:15.552
I'm going to be nice to him.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.020
Now it's cool to be
a nerd-- to be smart.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.270
STEPH: I think we'll hit
that point again in a second,

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.245
so keep that thought process.

00:43:27.245 --> 00:43:29.718
RASHEED: I think Steve and Bill
Gates had a vision socially

00:43:29.718 --> 00:43:31.510
like, we're going to
make being a nerd cool

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:34.540
again because we can't make
a whole bunch of money.

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.280
You think they had
that vision when

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.510
they were being nerds
and making money,

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.532
that we're going to make--

00:43:40.532 --> 00:43:42.490
basically being a nerd
cool because [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.530
AUDIENCE: What I'm saying
is-- so it's the difference

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.030
between--

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.700
like somebody gets a car--
somebody has a Rolls Royce

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.270
and somebody has a Toyota.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:56.667
This first wave--

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:58.750
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Licklider
would have a junker.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.680
AUDIENCE: Hm?

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.050
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Licklider
would have a junker--

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:01.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:02.660
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: --that
he personally would build.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.243
AUDIENCE: Well, what
I'm trying to say

00:44:04.243 --> 00:44:05.620
is that it's an
item that doesn't

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.340
touch the hands of
a lot of people,

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.358
so it's not valued, versus--

00:44:09.358 --> 00:44:10.900
the personal computer
was a big thing

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.525
because everyone
could interact with it

00:44:12.525 --> 00:44:14.485
and would be able to
communicate with it.

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.110
These big computers,
it was only if you

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.660
were in the institution, if you
were probably a grad student

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.700
or more brilliant--
that you've got

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.460
to interact with the computer.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.880
And what they
really did was just

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.940
make it common for
everybody to use.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.770
Really that's what the
entrepreneur-- the Gates,

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:31.333
Ford--

00:44:31.333 --> 00:44:33.250
is somebody who takes a
complicated technology

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:34.750
and simplifies it
to the point where

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:36.930
[INAUDIBLE] a large
subset of consumers,

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.591
if not all consumers.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:48.068
Any other questions?

00:44:48.068 --> 00:44:49.860
STEPH: Sorry, I'm
comfortable with silence,

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.752
so I like it when people think.

00:44:51.752 --> 00:44:53.460
AUDIENCE: What was
interesting about this

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.980
though, that I
connected, is when you

00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:00.120
think about startups or any--

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.880
I guess vision organization,
it always starts--

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.710
Reid Hoffman talks
about this, which is you

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:09.740
want to have a key
insight about society.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.740
So not all people know
this, but Mark Zuckerberg

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.817
was a psychology major.

00:45:12.817 --> 00:45:14.900
He just happened to take
computer science classes,

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.360
and then would say that he
studied computer science

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.260
because it was easier when
he got into the marketplace

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.820
and he had to get investors.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.150
JCR was psychology, so
he had a main insight

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.970
into how the human
brain worked, and also

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.560
a secret about human nature--

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.170
that it seemed that he used
that to his advantage in order

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:35.170
to create computer
systems, which I thought

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.498
was really, really interesting.

00:45:36.498 --> 00:45:39.040
RASHEED: Yeah, I think I'm going
to echo Martin's point here.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:43.095
I think a lot of this
kind of visionary insight

00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:44.970
was built off of a lot
of things that he did.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.870
So he had all this
tactile knowledge,

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:49.870
skill to build cars and things
like that, but as you can see,

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:54.100
probably used that
psychology background

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.210
a lot more when he was trying
to figure out how are we

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.920
going to put together
and really move

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.420
personal computing forward.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.920
And I think another
understated point here was,

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.440
in this great groups
model, I think he

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.410
and Licklider definitely
not only underscores,

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:14.410
but kind of creates that
great groups model for DARPA.

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:16.420
But not only
bringing it together

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.657
and finding these people, but--

00:46:18.657 --> 00:46:20.740
I think you mentioned like
a lot of these projects

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.120
weren't on the normal
three to five years.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.660
But he took maybe four or
five different collaborators

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.460
and said, we're
going to build out

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.125
10 years, 15 years,
and then just

00:46:31.125 --> 00:46:32.500
stay working on
the same projects

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.030
and solve all these
five different problems

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.738
so he could move the
whole field forward,

00:46:35.738 --> 00:46:40.060
instead of just focusing
on one or two problems.

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.610
In this great groups
model, he creates

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:46.030
great groups within DARPA, and
then that leadership, as well,

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.420
and moves that forward.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:52.540
And so he's obviously using his
psychology insight and research

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.790
maybe a little bit more
than his computing aptitude.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:59.716
AUDIENCE: I think
[INAUDIBLE] I remember

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:02.091
in the reading we talked about
the cool think about being

00:47:02.091 --> 00:47:03.870
an entrepreneur in
DARPA is that you

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.310
get to be an entrepreneur
in multiple things at once.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:08.685
So if you're an entrepreneur,
you only have your business

00:47:08.685 --> 00:47:10.590
and you can only
really focus on that.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.410
But an entrepreneur in
DARPA who leads a vision,

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.640
gets to touch multiple
products at once-- you

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:20.220
can see that with JCR, where
do you have the three sections.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.070
But what I find is interesting
is why isn't he more famous?

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.930
Because this is the first
time I heard of him, honestly.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.650
He probably should
get more credit

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:32.400
than a jobs or Bill Gates.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.060
And even in the papers about
Bill Gates, he was like, well,

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.650
yeah, we really did this
revolution in the '70s.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:42.890
And it's like, you
did the last 2%.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.440
So it was pretty interesting.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.110
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: He is an
absolutely remarkable figure.

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:54.350
And the core was this vision
that he had, and that--

00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:00.900
and this image of a crossover.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.080
Often, great technologies
are crossover technologies.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:11.790
When Jobs creates the iPod,
he's taking an MP3 player

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:14.670
of high quality and
certain new attributes,

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.460
but he's joining with
something entirely different--

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.790
a remarkable way of
organizing the music industry.

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:22.860
And it's two pieces that
get joined together,

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.530
and that's at the
heart, I think,

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.150
of what Licklider is able to do.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:30.390
He's able to take his
capability at computing

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.460
and his engineering and
computing capabilities,

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.965
but he crosses it with
his whole background

00:48:34.965 --> 00:48:37.620
and set of understandings that
he comes to with psychology.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.200
And it's that crossover
that makes him

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.380
an absolutely unique figure.

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.540
So when you all are thinking
about how to do great stuff,

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.300
just keep that crossover idea.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.840
Bringing something from
here and moving it over here

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.600
is really at the heart
of a tremendous amount

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.290
of creativity.

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:59.700
It may be the definition
of creativity.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.250
It's what he pulls off.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.880
By the time Licklider
finishes his second stint--

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.332
which he's not as happy at
DARPA the second time around.

00:49:10.332 --> 00:49:12.540
He has a director that
doesn't get along with as well

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:15.180
as he did with Jack Ruina and
another famous DARPA director,

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.020
named Heilmeier--

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.890
Heilmeier, excuse me.

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.150
That team of has worked
their way through those three

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:30.270
critical projects.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.880
They've done the
internet by '69.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.690
They've done desktop
computing, carried out

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:41.580
with some DARPA support by
largely ex-DARPA funded folks

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.020
at Xerox PARC.

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.870
And then they've done computer
graphics, and a lot of that

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:49.050
moves over to Xerox PARC,
as well, and then from there

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.340
to Apple.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:54.155
But they've worked their
way through those pieces.

00:49:54.155 --> 00:49:55.905
Let me just mention
the film here briefly.

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.590
Rasheed, you can-- we'll
get to this in a second,

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:06.800
although we'll let Steph
do a couple more questions.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.890
The film was this
desperate attempt

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:11.870
by these people who have
created the internet.

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.250
And you saw them.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.200
This is an amazing collection.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.850
A lot of on the film.

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:19.380
Larry Roberts is there;
and Frank Hart, who

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:23.010
led the BBN team; and Bob
Kahn, who's on the BBN team,

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:26.720
then goes to DARPA and works
with Vint Cerf on the TCPIP

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:31.610
internet protocol system;
and Paul Baran who

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:33.620
has a vision for what--
how to put together

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.350
the whole packet switching
system to begin with,

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:38.750
that's at the core
of the internet.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.690
All these famous
internet pioneers

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:45.480
are all put together on the
film, and they're desperate.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:49.340
They are desperate because
the internet has only

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.530
gone to about 50 different
university computer science

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:53.030
departments.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.370
And they realize that they've
got this earth-shattering

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:58.550
communication system, and
they're trying to explain

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:01.220
desperately to--

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.760
on a 16-millimeter film
what they've accomplished.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.270
I think it's '72
they do the film.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:15.860
It's not until really 1993, 1994
that the internet completely

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:16.730
scales up.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:20.330
So it's a long hiatus.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:23.850
And NSF actually plays a
very, very important role

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:28.760
in the scale up, because it gets
turned over by DARPA and NSF--

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.650
and NSF under Erich Bloch, who
is the only NSF director who

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:34.850
came out of industry.

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:41.180
So Erich Bloch was one of the
leaders of the IBM 360 project

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.127
and was a winner
of the president's

00:51:43.127 --> 00:51:45.210
Medal of Technology, but
he was an IBM officially.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:46.760
Wasn't a scientist.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.790
So he gets leadership
of NSF, and he

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:55.160
creates NSF's very strong
computing organization,

00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:00.320
pulls one of the leaders
of deck to run it.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.110
And they treat computing
as a full science.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.650
That's another moment
in Licklider's vision

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:07.460
is when NSF starts
to treat computer

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.500
science as a true
science, not just

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.945
a nice tool for other
scientists to play with.

00:52:12.945 --> 00:52:14.570
So that's a pretty
critical moment too.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:18.980
And Erich Bloch and some
others understand the power

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.570
of the internet
as a communication

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:23.240
system in science, and then
they spread it to universities

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.320
all over the place.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.950
That creates a fabulous early
audience, and then it scales.

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:30.500
So that's kind of
what plays out there.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.530
But it's a remarkable--

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.770
another remarkable is
part of the story here.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.085
Steph, let's go to a
question or two more.

00:52:39.085 --> 00:52:39.627
STEPH: Great.

00:52:39.627 --> 00:52:43.260
I have precisely
two more questions,

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:49.590
the first is with
a sentiment that

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:52.767
was shared in the last couple
of pages in the reading.

00:52:52.767 --> 00:52:53.850
And I'll read a quote now.

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:56.040
It says, "Technology
isn't destiny,

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.830
no matter how inexorable
its evolution may seem.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.300
The way its
capabilities are used

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.120
is much a matter of cultural
choice and historical accident

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.620
as it's politics or fashion."

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:10.050
And I think back to maybe the
first or the second course

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.080
where we began to reflect
about the role of culture

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.780
and technology transfer
and technology adoption,

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:19.200
and in thinking about the sort
of functionalist ethics that we

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.300
might have-- this
is by Amartya Sen--

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.520
he's a very famous economists
who came out of India

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.370
in developmental economics--

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:31.380
and thinking about the ways in
which we're evaluating vision.

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.530
And it seems-- and I have a
couple of notes here from which

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:37.120
I will read--

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.440
that many of the people
who we have truly

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.130
regarded as innovators and
as transformative members

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:47.650
of society have
created things that

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:49.390
are effectively public goods.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:51.760
They've really approached
technology and engineering

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:54.400
from a utility ethics
framework-- not so

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.830
much about having that
bias to commercialization,

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:58.600
like maybe Steve
Jobs did, but it

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.450
was the Lickliders and the
Edisons who really thought

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.940
about how they could
create a product that

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.445
was going to transform
society for everyone.

00:54:06.445 --> 00:54:09.070
It wasn't going to be a product
that was going to be accessible

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:10.570
only to the few.

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:14.530
And so in thinking about our
ethics of commercialization

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:18.520
today, perhaps I
thought it would

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.070
be worth it to become a little
philosophical, in the sense

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:23.860
that Licklider was very
philosophical about the role

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.650
that technology played in
the development of society--

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:29.440
and ask ourselves about the ways
in which our commercialization

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.990
bias may be precluding
us from creating

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:33.610
the so-called
disruptive inventions

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:34.887
that we still wish to pursue.

00:54:39.408 --> 00:54:41.200
RASHEED: So I think
this is a cool question

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.650
because you get to do both--

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:47.260
bring in, just like you said,
a lot of the cultural aspects

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:50.810
that might be overlooked when
you have this commercialization

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.570
bias.

00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:54.460
But I'm not sure--

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.210
or in this context, I think
Licklider's got a head up

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.768
because the field is wide open.

00:54:58.768 --> 00:55:01.060
And so nobody's really thought
about personal computing

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.935
before, so he gets to
really define the field

00:55:02.935 --> 00:55:05.340
and make it general enough
so that it can be applicable

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:05.840
everywhere.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.913
But in every sense, you get
the idea that-- time-sharing

00:55:08.913 --> 00:55:10.330
and all these
things-- he's trying

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:14.020
to make computing a
lot more accessible.

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.690
And so I think that's a really
cool and seminal thought

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:18.880
to make things more
accessible, and that'll

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.570
give you the innovative,
transformative, and really

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:26.470
disruptive ideals-- to bring
this technology from one

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:28.570
and spread it around.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:30.550
And so the spreading
effect, I'm not

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:34.500
sure how to quantify
it like Licklider

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:38.320
did, but I'm interested in what
projects that DARPA might be

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.910
running now or
might be looking at,

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:42.760
to see if there's still those
people within the organization

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:46.090
that are looking at bringing
technologies that might exist

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:49.480
now that might just be
[INAUDIBLE] or high risk,

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.570
and spreading that to
a more normative phase,

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.692
maybe like Licklider did.

00:55:54.692 --> 00:55:56.900
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It's an
interesting point, Steph,

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:59.270
that you raise, and Rasheed,
that you comment on,

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:02.840
because there's a very strong
culture in computing, including

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.050
a very strong culture
in MIT computing,

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:08.510
that computing should
be free, and computing

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:11.630
should be in the commons, and
computing should serve us all.

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:16.430
And that's actually a very
strong ethos that, in a way--

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.620
and I think it's your point--

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:22.610
comes out of the way
in which Licklider

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:25.700
and that remarkable team
evolved this technology.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:29.840
Because this is not a
for-profit operation.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.470
They are essentially
trying to spring

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:38.920
a transformative
technology onto the world

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.565
by building it in the
commons, and creating it

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:45.340
into the commons, and making
it universally accessible.

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.350
That's a remarkable project.

00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:48.820
That's not normally
the way we do

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:53.350
stuff in a capitalist country.

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.410
You've identified an
interesting kind of strand

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:58.990
here that's a different kind of
technology development story.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.750
And it's a different story
than the Edison story.

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.640
It enables, Martin,
as you point out,

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.940
Gates and Jobs to
get extremely rich.

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:16.000
But all the
foundational stuff was

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.920
thrown into the commons
long ahead of them,

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.580
which was an enabler
for them, as well.

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:22.720
So interesting.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.310
Thanks for bringing
the philosophy in.

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:29.140
STEPH: [INAUDIBLE] for
what it's worth, I find--

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.940
or I personally
think that doing good

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:35.290
is not exclusive
mutually with doing well

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:36.832
for yourself and
for other people.

00:57:36.832 --> 00:57:38.290
I think that there's
a lot of value

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:40.480
in thinking about
the ways in which you

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.450
can reach a wide audience
and transform society, and at

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:45.310
the same time, do
well for yourself,

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:49.000
and then return that
value onto society.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.240
But to what extent?

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.080
The kinds of people
who are capitalizing

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.140
on the gains of
the Lickliders is--

00:57:56.140 --> 00:58:00.292
I'm not sure that they may all
share my vision for the world.

00:58:00.292 --> 00:58:01.750
AUDIENCE: I'll add
a point to that.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:06.280
I think a lot of it matters-- it
matters how you define success.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.120
What channel's creating wealth?

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.040
Because you'd say, yeah,
these innovators didn't become

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.850
wealthy, or the US
did become wealthy,

00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:19.780
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs became
wealthy, and their employees.

00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:22.780
But at the same time, how much
the net worth was increased

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.290
in the US based on the economic
output, based on these people,

00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:27.250
and also their legacy?

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:29.888
Because most likely in the
future, we'll re-look into this

00:58:29.888 --> 00:58:31.680
and say, actually,
these were the pioneers.

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.013
And they get even more traction.

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.610
Bob Metcalfe, who
made the internet,

00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:39.230
made the original one.

00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:41.157
And then other people
implemented it and made

00:58:41.157 --> 00:58:43.240
it better and better and
better, so he's like, oh,

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.290
it's awesome,
because I get credit

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:46.690
for all these brilliant
things people did after me.

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.640
So I wouldn't have been
able to do any of this,

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.750
but I get all this credit.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.990
And I think that another
sector that I could compare to,

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:57.620
which is space.

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:04.760
So NASA went very fast and used
a lot of resources in order

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.262
to go into space, and they
really set the framework.

00:59:09.262 --> 00:59:10.970
I listened to an
astronaut talk about it,

00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:14.270
and he'd said, our job
is to widen the horizons,

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:16.910
because it's going to be a
while until it's commercially

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:20.270
viable for other people to do.

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:22.280
But that's our job, to
really go into the places

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.080
where a capitalist can't go.

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.902
But there is a net positive
on our society because of it.

00:59:26.902 --> 00:59:28.610
And that's kind of
the job of government,

00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:30.560
to do the stuff that
individuals can't

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.120
do for the net positive
of the society.

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.610
So I think there is a lot of--

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:36.530
there is a wealth
creation there.

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:38.000
They create a
wealth of knowledge.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.920
They get respected and
honored much higher maybe.

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.250
So I think it really
depends how you define it.

00:59:47.718 --> 00:59:50.010
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: How about
a closing thought, Steph?

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:52.590
STEPH: Yeah, that sets us
up for the closing thought,

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:55.103
which is really about
Licklider's legacy.

00:59:55.103 --> 00:59:56.520
I really appreciated
that Bill had

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.790
us read the component in
which the author is having

00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:05.550
his wife Linda reflect on Lick
and the ways in which he passed

01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:11.550
away, and the reaction from
the computing community about

01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:15.402
not only his legacy, but the
ways in which he had been

01:00:15.402 --> 01:00:16.860
such an incredible
not only mentor,

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:20.070
but champion-- which was
a word that you used today

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:21.790
maybe for the first time.

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:23.790
The kinds of mentors that
one can have-- there's

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.830
the people who will
help you learn things,

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.080
and then there's the people
who will advocate for you.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.390
And Lick was really the
champion of computing,

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:34.110
not only for so many people,
but for the field itself,

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:36.540
with ARPA being his champion.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.050
And I think there's a lot to be
said for finding those mentors,

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:43.380
and I hope that we in this
room have found those mentors

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:46.080
in our own lives, or on the
path to finding those people,

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.730
and that MIT and
our institutions

01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:50.340
generally help to connect
us with the people who

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.860
will help us make
the revolutions

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.472
that we want to see happen.

01:00:54.472 --> 01:00:57.600
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Great, thank you.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.720
Rasheed, a couple of
thoughts about the film clip?

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.980
RASHEED: Yeah.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.580
So I think the film clip is
really a little bit weird

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.290
to watch, because it was really
putting a face, and a name,

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:14.580
and a voice to all these
people that we just read about.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:17.402
And they came out about as I
expected, especially because I

01:01:17.402 --> 01:01:19.110
think the audience of
the film was really

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.947
trying to make
the internet ideas

01:01:20.947 --> 01:01:23.130
and computing a
lot more palatable

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:25.780
for the general audience.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.900
And so it was nice to
see them kind of struggle

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.165
with translating what
they do on the daily basis

01:01:30.165 --> 01:01:32.040
in their research, which
is highly technical,

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.680
to general population.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.390
And I think it's why
be needed time to ask,

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:40.200
are these sort of efforts
that DARPA should be doing

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.100
normally-- to take these
high, very technical,

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.510
research-based--

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:47.280
you might need a
PhD to understand

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.680
what's going on on a project.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.410
And then really translating
it for that public good

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.644
of disseminating
scientific information.

01:01:57.307 --> 01:01:58.890
AUDIENCE: So to
rephrase the question,

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:01.410
you're asking basically
should DARPA be engaging in

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:02.410
high risk, high rewards?

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:04.330
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Little bit louder.

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:05.967
AUDIENCE: I'm trying
to figure out--

01:02:05.967 --> 01:02:08.050
so I was thinking, is the
question basically that,

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:14.350
should DARPA be engaging in
relatively technical projects

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:18.250
that might have really
huge impacts to society?

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.048
RASHEED: I think more
so, should DARPA,

01:02:20.048 --> 01:02:22.090
with each project that
they take on-- should they

01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:24.687
be advocating to the general
public as much as possible?

01:02:24.687 --> 01:02:26.770
STEPH: Should there be a
communication component--

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:27.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.120
STEPH: --to the
research that they do,

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.980
much like they'll be doing
this weekend at the Science

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.990
March or the Climate
March next weekend.

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.840
AUDIENCE: Is DARPA
going to be there?

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.673
STEPH: I don't know.

01:02:33.673 --> 01:02:36.740
Will they?

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.370
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It's an
interesting point about DARPA,

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:42.745
because in the IT
revolution, DARPA

01:02:42.745 --> 01:02:45.940
is working to stand up
that revolution essentially

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:50.530
in the civilian economy, not
in a closed-system defense

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:53.320
economy.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.600
And there were
conscious decisions

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.620
that DARPA made there.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.640
So the military is often
pretty good at getting

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.830
that first prototype out, the
initial breakthrough prototype.

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:09.010
What it doesn't really
have the resources to do

01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:13.660
are the relentless series of
follow-on incremental advances.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:18.190
And clearly, the IT revolution
that we've been living through

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:23.560
for the last 25 years
is predominantly

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.900
incremental advances,
some of which

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.270
can be obviously
quite significant.

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:32.320
But the basic framework
was kind of in place

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.410
more than 20 years ago, and
we'd been in effect building

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:36.700
on that.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.550
And DARPA understood that
the military would never

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.440
have the resources--
that it can really

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.920
use this personal
computing system

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.190
and the internet system--
they would be incredible tools

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:51.070
to create a whole new
organizational set

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:52.840
of mechanisms for the military.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.580
But it was going to stand it
up in the civilian sector,

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.670
and then the military
could buy it back

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:00.640
from the civilian sector
after the civilian sector

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.160
did all the incremental
work and flooded

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.690
the sector with investment.

01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:09.040
So for a long period
of time, the military

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.870
was the principal spender on
computing and on software.

01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:16.088
It dominated as the big
buyer in that sector

01:04:16.088 --> 01:04:18.130
for actually a fairly
significant period of time.

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:19.835
That era is long gone.

01:04:19.835 --> 01:04:21.460
The military's control
of these sectors

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:26.740
is infinitesimally small now,
because they've been stood up,

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.270
and the military buys them back.

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:31.210
So that's a different kind
of way for DARPA to operate.

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.630
In the next piece we're
going to do in a second,

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.380
we're going to talk
about DARPA developing

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.710
technologies within
the military and how

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:42.820
it operated in that way,
which is, in some ways,

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:46.030
quite challenging.

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.620
Closing thought on the film?

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.095
Question?

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:51.220
AUDIENCE: Just very short--

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:55.205
I do think there is stuff for
DARPA to do, at the very least,

01:04:55.205 --> 01:04:56.940
in today's society.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.880
I worked on a
DARPA-funded project.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.970
People I generally
talked to-- oh yeah,

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:04.220
DARPA is just a money sinkhole.

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.630
They just have a ton of money.

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:07.560
A lot of people
don't necessarily

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.150
see how a defense agency's
research comes down

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:11.150
to benefit them.

01:05:18.645 --> 01:05:20.020
RASHEED: So as a
closing thought,

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.630
I think DARPA has the
advantage where they can

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:25.475
do this high risk, high reward.

01:05:25.475 --> 01:05:27.850
Under the guise of defense,
I think they kind of get away

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.100
with not being able to say--

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.465
or being able to be
like, it's classified,

01:05:32.465 --> 01:05:35.865
or we don't really have to tell
you under defense parameters

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:37.570
or protocols, or
the reasons why we

01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:40.420
want to look into
these projects can

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:41.890
be a little more complicated.

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:43.530
But I do see--

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:45.940
and in cases like this,
where to have ARPANET,

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.323
which obviously has
great potential,

01:05:48.323 --> 01:05:49.990
if you do that type
transfer and move it

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.573
into the civilian
sector, and then you

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:54.470
get this IT revolution
that follows on after.

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:56.740
s so I think it's
important for DARPA

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:59.920
to keep initiatives like this
for maybe bigger projects that

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.770
are a lot easier to stand
up in civilian sectors.

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:06.220
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
an important point, Rasheed.

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.410
DARPA gets a lot of
slack because it's

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:11.320
under that national
security mission banner.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.410
So it's able to take the
kind of risks and aim

01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:15.910
for a set of
breakthroughs that's

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:20.110
harder for a civilian
agency to undertake.

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.570
This is wild stuff.

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:25.630
Think about coming up with
this stuff in the 1960s.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:28.390
It's pretty amazing.

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:31.108
And that national security
justification was pretty key.

01:06:31.108 --> 01:06:32.650
All right, so now
we're going to look

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:35.110
at a different side of DARPA.

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:38.470
This is a chapter
from our textbook.

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:41.590
And there's a couple
of topics here.

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:43.623
DARPA's a very unique
institutional model

01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:45.790
that operates at both the
personal and institutional

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:46.980
levels, as we talked about.

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.565
And then secondly, DARPA's
organizational rule set.

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:58.050
DARPA also creates lots of
the foundational technologies

01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:02.480
behind what is called the
revolution in military affairs.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.155
So here's the setting.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:11.910
Harold Brown And Bill Perry are
running Jimmy Carter's Defense

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:12.440
Department.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.090
So Harold Brown's
Secretary of Defense.

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:15.173
He's president of Caltech.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:19.980
And Perry is out of Stanford.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.930
They are great technologists.

01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:25.110
Imagine the top leadership
of the Defense Department

01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:28.170
and the hands of really
hot-shot technologists.

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.970
Doesn't usually happen.

01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:32.940
And they've got a big
problem on their hands.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:37.170
The problem is the American
army, in particular,

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:39.840
has been completely
demoralized by the Vietnam War,

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.360
and has largely disintegrated.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:47.340
It is not, in many ways,
a truly functioning force.

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:50.010
And the Cold War is
heating up, and there's

01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:53.970
a monster presence of
Soviet and Allied armies

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:55.410
in Eastern Europe.

01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:58.860
And the problem that
Brown and Perry have got

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:02.730
is that, because the US Army
is weak and perceived as weak,

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:07.860
there's kind of nothing in the
way of that Soviet army having

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:12.060
the capability of moving
right into Western Europe.

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:17.080
And that's not a good
situation because then you

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:22.130
have to decide whether to use
nuclear weapons very quickly.

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:23.410
You don't have a lot of time.

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:24.910
You've got to decide
whether you use

01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:26.890
nuclear weapons,
which essentially

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:29.290
means ending the world.

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:32.770
It's not the kind of decision
you want to have to make.

01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:38.330
So Perry and Brown started
thinking about what

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:40.130
they call an offset strategy.

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:43.850
Can we start to
restore the strength

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:45.649
of the American military?

01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:49.160
They're not going to do it
with a mass army, and a citizen

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:54.680
army, and building
thousands of tanks,

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.950
and adding millions
to the military.

01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:00.140
That's unaffordable
and they're just not--

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.180
it's not going to happen.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.740
And they'd be
putting those people

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.870
into a broken
institution anyway.

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:08.021
So the Army's in the
process of restoring itself

01:09:08.021 --> 01:09:09.979
through leadership of
people like Colin Powell,

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.160
and a whole generation
of new army leaders

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.500
that really restore
that operation

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.600
in a remarkable kind of way.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.740
It restores itself.

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:22.760
But that is an underway
project at that time.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:27.020
And what Perry and Brown
start is a whole set

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:31.220
of thinking about can we get
a significant on-the-ground

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.810
conventional warfare superiority
so that the Soviet Union won't

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:39.470
even think about coming
through the Fulda Gap

01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:41.990
and moving on Western Europe.

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:47.330
And that's what they embark on,
and that becomes DARPA's job.

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:56.060
So DARPA develops precision
strike, they develop stealth,

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.090
and they develop UAVs
or drones as core.

01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:02.030
And then they're also doing a
lot of stuff with submarines

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.380
that nobody ever talks about.

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.150
So I don't know what that is.

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:08.510
Something's going on there with
submarines, undersea warfare.

01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:10.170
But we know about
the other three.

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:12.530
We have a pretty good
idea what those look like.

01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:20.690
And these are not technologies
that the services want.

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:23.180
The Air Force is
dominated by pilots.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.160
They don't want drones.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.970
That's like the last
thing they want.

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:31.150
The Air Force wants airplanes
that can actually fly.

01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:33.340
They don't want
these stealth things

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.742
that, if the computers
weren't continually adjusting

01:10:36.742 --> 01:10:38.200
the exact movement
of the aircraft,

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.030
it would fall like a rock.

01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:41.440
It's completely maneuverable.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.740
It's like flying a bus.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.965
No, really.

01:10:44.965 --> 01:10:46.090
These are not maneuverable.

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:48.940
Nobody can see them,
but it's still a bus.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.420
So the Air Force
doesn't want this thing.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:55.480
But DARPA, in the
case of stealth,

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.270
working with Lockheed--
which does some fascinating

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:01.150
translation of actually
Russian scientific literature

01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:02.830
and develops the
concept of stealth--

01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:07.450
and then DARPA jumps on it with
Lockheed and his Skunk Works--

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:10.900
works on developing stealth.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.750
It's working on
precision strike.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:15.430
Completely changes warfare.

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:18.400
Completely changes warfare.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.980
In the Gulf War--

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.862
which was where all this stuff
got shown and demonstrated,

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:26.320
and that's where this phrase
revolution in military affairs

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.220
comes from--

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.720
the Russians saw this stuff.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.670
Revolution in military
affairs is their term

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:33.370
for what we pulled off.

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:37.540
They were stunned that
these technologies created

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:41.020
a whole new kind of capability
on the ground for the US

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.133
military that was just--

01:11:42.133 --> 01:11:43.300
they had no defense against.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:47.560
We were essentially up against
a Soviet-trained and style army

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.310
in the Gulf War in Iraq,
and their air defense system

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:53.865
fell apart in a very
short period of time.

01:11:53.865 --> 01:11:55.240
They could not
deal with stealth.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:57.640
They could not deal with drones.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.820
This continuous battlefield
awareness, the airline battle

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.460
doctrine that was enabled by
these different technologies

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:07.360
created an entirely different
kind of military force.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.510
So DARPA's doing this
stuff, but this stuff

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:13.667
gets stood up
within the military.

01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:15.750
It's hard to think what
the civilian application--

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.520
we're now working away
in civilian applications

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.830
on drones, so that's
transferring over.

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:22.790
That could be
pretty interesting.

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:24.790
It's already starting
to get interesting.

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:27.070
GPS is another part of
that story that's already

01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:30.580
long since transferred
over, that DARPA

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.910
works on helping to nurture.

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:38.260
Maybe stealth will
transfer over,

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:43.510
because if we do something
resembling autonomous vehicles,

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:47.710
you really want inverse stealth
so that the radar systems can

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:49.690
really see your vehicle,
that they're not

01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:53.200
going to miss you in the noise.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:57.130
Cars could look a lot weirder
if they go stealth, but--

01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:58.720
inverse stealth,
but that may be what

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.540
we need to do in order to
make these autonomous vehicle

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.427
systems really operable.

01:13:03.427 --> 01:13:05.320
AUDIENCE: Oh, you're
saying autonomous cars.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, autonomous cars.

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:07.480
I'm sorry.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.990
Not drones-- cars.

01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.746
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking, why would you

01:13:09.746 --> 01:13:10.720
want your drones to be visible?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.137
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, so you'd

01:13:12.137 --> 01:13:14.365
have a car that looks like
the other side of stealth.

01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:24.175
The military is a legacy sector.

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.440
It's been around since 1787.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.570
It's extremely
resistant to change.

01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:32.880
It has its routines
and doctrines,

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.190
and it has its doctrines
that govern how it fights

01:13:38.190 --> 01:13:39.040
and so forth.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.470
And then here are Perry,
and Brown, and DARPA

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:45.360
landing in the
middle, forcing them

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.480
to adopt completely
disruptive technologies

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.910
from what they've been doing.

01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:55.050
So DARPA's operating here as
a change agent within a legacy

01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:56.490
sector military.

01:13:56.490 --> 01:14:01.080
It's able to do the change
agent role because of the island

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.630
bridge model.

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:06.180
Remember, we talked
about this at Xerox PARC.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:11.700
DARPA's got a bridge to
the Secretary of Defense,

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.650
and the Secretary of
Defense is able to make

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:16.950
it stick with the military.

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:20.460
And that's a really
key DARPA capability.

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.520
That's also a lesson
about how to bring change

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.620
into legacy sectors.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:30.570
So DARPA rules of
small and flexible,

01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:32.550
and it's a flat
organization, and it

01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:34.620
allows a lot of
freedom and autonomy

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.800
outside bureaucratic impediments
to its program managers.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.400
And it has an incredibly
talented technical staff,

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:44.490
and it works off
the challenge model.

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:46.830
The end of a project is
the end of the project.

01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.490
DARPA shuts things down.

01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:50.460
It just doesn't
persevere forever.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:54.870
If it doesn't seem to be
working, it'll close it down.

01:14:54.870 --> 01:15:02.380
It's got all those rules
sets, but in addition, it's

01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.510
got some other
capabilities that I

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:07.120
think are important to
understanding how to bring

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.920
change into legacy sectors.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:15.520
Form critical innovation
institutions--

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.920
that's a lesson that
we're seeing here.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.870
The Defense Department
would not have

01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:22.540
done the revolution
in military affairs

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.420
if there wasn't a critical
innovation system there

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.970
to do the innovation, ie DARPA.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:31.450
So that's kind of a new rule
for us to think about right.

01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:33.760
What's going to be that
critical innovation system that

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.700
can operate as a change agent?

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.750
Because most of the
economy is legacy sectors.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:43.600
Point two, use this
island-bridge model.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.980
It's really critical.

01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:47.860
Remember, Edison can
call up JP Morgan

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:51.880
and get JP Morgan to fund
the electrical system.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.960
That island-bridge thing
is absolutely critical.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.015
Get your innovation team
on a protected island,

01:15:57.015 --> 01:15:58.390
make sure they
have a route back.

01:15:58.390 --> 01:16:01.330
And DARPA's a great
example of that.

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:03.400
Build a thinking community--

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.100
that's what the
Licklider story is about.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.420
This is not just
Licklider having a vision.

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:12.430
He's able to create a whole
thought community within DARPA

01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:14.710
and then by all the people
that are working for DARPA,

01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:18.850
like Doug angle and that
whole world out there.

01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:21.225
So they're able to scale
up this community so

01:16:21.225 --> 01:16:22.850
that it reaches a
certain kind of mass,

01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:25.183
and it can get a lot of stuff
done and a lot of thinking

01:16:25.183 --> 01:16:27.408
done, and develop a lot
and nurture a lot of ideas.

01:16:27.408 --> 01:16:29.950
So when you're thinking about
implementing your technologies,

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:32.830
think about building
that thinking community.

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:35.980
And then another key piece here
is linking the technologies

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:38.690
to the operators.

01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:41.717
So if the technologists are
only talking to themselves

01:16:41.717 --> 01:16:43.300
and they are not
talking to the people

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.790
actually operating the
system, nothing will happen.

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:48.460
So you've got to
make sure, as you're

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:50.770
working on bringing
your technologies about,

01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:54.110
that you've got linkages
to the actual operators.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.418
So these are a few more
lessons from DARPA.

01:16:57.418 --> 01:16:59.710
And look, I'm going to go
ahead and do Glenn Fong here,

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:04.650
because he's got
some pieces about.

01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:06.140
And Max, you've
got Glenn, right?

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:06.640
OK.

01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:13.600
Glenn just kind of tells us
what we talked about earlier,

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.940
that so much of
the IT revolution

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:18.760
really came out of this
DARPA-supported thinking

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.080
community.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.670
So Glenn argues that the
Apple Lisa, and then its Mac

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:28.210
really came from Xerox PARC's
Alto, as we've discussed.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:31.360
And then in turn,
Microsoft's Windows really

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.420
came from Apple's Mac,
which in turn, came back

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.920
from Xerox PARC, which in turn
came from this DARPA community.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.510
So the key staff
from PARC go to Apple

01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:49.150
and to Microsoft as implementers
on the pieces of the vision

01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:52.330
that they're pursuing.

01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:55.720
And it's all Lick's kids.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.310
It's this community that
Licklider starts to establish.

01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:02.620
So Bob Taylor, as Luyao
led us through last week,

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:05.260
he leads PARC.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.150
The DARPA-funded
university research

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:09.820
centers at places like MIT,
and Berkeley, and Stanford,

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:15.370
and Carnegie Mellon,
and SRI, and Utah,

01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:19.990
they support and train a lot
of that Xerox PARC staff.

01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:22.420
So by creating the early
computer science departments

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:26.410
and funding them, DARPA's
training a whole thinking

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:29.080
community here.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:34.930
And this is just a list of
famous computer scientists

01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:37.780
that got their
support from DARPA.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.830
And this is who did it.

01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:43.810
This is that community.

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:46.810
And it's a stunning
set of realizations

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:50.980
as to just how central DARPA
is at the whole follow-on

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.660
to the IT revolution.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:58.930
So Glenn Fong brings us to
this set of realizations.

01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:06.250
Things like Ed Catmull at Lucas
Films, it's a remarkable--

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.470
you see where the strands
lead in off and all kinds

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:09.880
of directions.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.520
So you get a sense
for just how--

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.130
what a great foundational
institution this is.

01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:19.390
So let's do some questions
and points about these two

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:20.890
readings.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:22.660
And Rasheed, do you
want to lead us off

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.720
on that chapter
from the textbook?

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.920
And then we'll go to Max.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.500
RASHEED: Yeah.

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.330
So I think it's really
important in this chapter.

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:33.490
as it highlights the
elements of DARPA that

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:37.200
make it so fantastic and able
to do all the things it's

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.518
been able to do.

01:19:38.518 --> 01:19:40.060
So we talked about
the island-bridge,

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.030
and things like that--

01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:46.450
but really the success of
also the program managers

01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:48.552
acting as sort of
mini change agents

01:19:48.552 --> 01:19:50.260
to be able to be that
small and flexible.

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:57.460
I think somebody asked actually
a pretty good question, which

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:03.520
was, is there a way to bring
these elements of DARPA--

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.835
giving these dynamic
program managers

01:20:05.835 --> 01:20:07.960
the freedom to do the things
that they want to do--

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:11.280
is there a way to do that
outside of this DARPA model,

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.710
maybe enterprise to this model?

01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:15.586
I think Martin
asked that question.

01:20:15.586 --> 01:20:16.584
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:16.584 --> 01:20:18.038
RASHEED: Yeah.

01:20:18.038 --> 01:20:18.580
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:21.020
Yeah, I just thought it was
really interesting, because

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.520
in business, a lot
of time, you talk

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.978
about focusing on the alphas
and getting rid of your betas.

01:20:24.978 --> 01:20:26.853
The stuff that you're
really, really good at,

01:20:26.853 --> 01:20:29.420
focus on doing that, so if
you're not good don't do it.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:31.220
So you try to
outsource everything.

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:35.485
So it'd be an interesting model
because you might move faster.

01:20:35.485 --> 01:20:36.860
And so that's what
I was thinking

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:38.895
about-- a way of people
with good ideas that

01:20:38.895 --> 01:20:41.870
are very capable being
linked with resources

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:45.560
in a much better manner to
maybe being able to do more.

01:20:51.162 --> 01:20:52.745
AUDIENCE: So I just
want to interject.

01:20:52.745 --> 01:20:56.098
I think you just
described the MIT faculty.

01:20:56.098 --> 01:20:58.750
We can hire postdocs
and students

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:03.930
to do things that might not
want to do, and they specialize.

01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:06.553
AUDIENCE: The way I would
think about it differently is--

01:21:06.553 --> 01:21:08.220
that would mean they're
very book smart.

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:10.780
And like what kind of
person would come into--

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:14.560
through MIT faculty versus
like people that might be--

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.430
look at the people--

01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:17.170
Apple-- Steve Jobs--

01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:18.730
drop out-- Bill Gates--

01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:21.290
drop out.

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:23.200
You're definitely right,
but I guess the way

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.010
I was trying to say it is more--

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:25.552
AUDIENCE: You don't
have to say that.

01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:27.370
AUDIENCE: Well, you are right.

01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:31.575
I meant more of a spectrum
of personality types.

01:21:31.575 --> 01:21:32.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's interesting,

01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:35.050
because I don't know--

01:21:35.050 --> 01:21:37.030
you guys see the
research that they do.

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:39.250
A lot of these faculty
that I come across

01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:40.930
have spin out companies.

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:44.500
And no, they're not all
becoming Bill Gates overnight,

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:49.923
but they're all very much
into their own specialty.

01:21:49.923 --> 01:21:51.340
AUDIENCE: Well,
the research model

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:53.560
is a very productive model
because you have somebody

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.060
who has key insights but didn't
have the time to go and make

01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:58.160
a company off of it,
so you get somebody

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.930
from-- who's one of
their grad students.

01:21:59.930 --> 01:22:00.710
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

01:22:00.710 --> 01:22:03.893
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the professor [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:03.893 --> 01:22:05.060
AUDIENCE: Oh god, which one?

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:06.300
Langer?

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:10.740
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:14.030
AUDIENCE: But also,
research institutions

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:15.880
try to focus more on--

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:20.370
they're called frog innovations,
[INAUDIBLE] you move forward.

01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:23.040
And so I was thinking more
of hawk innovations, which

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.900
is a completely different field
that no one's looking into,

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.817
because it doesn't seem
to be that productive.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:28.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.420
There are a bunch of frogs,
is that what you're saying?

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.128
AUDIENCE: No, no.

01:22:31.128 --> 01:22:33.630
Just in general the type of
research that goes through.

01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:36.410
Or it has to have a purpose
that's already defined

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.675
based on a current paradigm.

01:22:37.675 --> 01:22:38.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.860
AUDIENCE: So it's very risky
to do anything different

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:41.480
because you're kind of ruining
your thesis [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:41.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:43.815
And have to get money
from somebody to do it,

01:22:43.815 --> 01:22:45.440
and convince them
it's going somewhere.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.120
Yeah, OK.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:47.840
Got it.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.833
RASHEED: How does
that fit in with what

01:22:48.833 --> 01:22:50.583
you were saying with
the alphas and betas,

01:22:50.583 --> 01:23:00.310
where focus in on what
you're good at [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:01.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:04.530
AUDIENCE: I think the idea
that he's trying to get at

01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:06.802
is that you focus on
what you're good at,

01:23:06.802 --> 01:23:08.760
but in order to figure
out what you're good at,

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.460
you have to have some
failures along the way.

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.620
So you have to try and
do different things,

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:17.250
and then maybe you find out, oh,
this idea's really amazing he.

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:19.760
It'll make lots
of money, and it--

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.960
and we happen to know
what we're doing.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.370
But you might have
a dozen things

01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:26.203
that don't go so well before
that, so it's a process.

01:23:26.203 --> 01:23:28.620
AUDIENCE: You might come up
with the key insight, in terms

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:30.150
of manufacturing,
but you haven't

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:31.500
done large-scale manufacturing.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.570
So how are you going to
connect to a firm that already

01:23:33.570 --> 01:23:36.112
understands that really well so
that you can execute quickly?

01:23:36.112 --> 01:23:37.330
So you try to figure it out.

01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:38.250
But it'll take you
a lot of capital,

01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:40.620
will take you two to three
years and you're screwed.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.750
I was thinking more of like--

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:45.060
in software, you have
Amazon Web Services,

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.550
you have databases that are
already huge that you can just

01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:49.708
go port and you're through.

01:23:49.708 --> 01:23:52.000
And it'd be interesting for
that for like manufacturing

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:52.570
or biology.

01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:54.195
Because also biology's
super difficult,

01:23:54.195 --> 01:24:00.630
because say you want to
do a startup [INAUDIBLE]

01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:01.350
RASHEED: Yeah.

01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:05.120
So I guess obviously it's going
to vary along different fields,

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.960
but I think manufacturing might
be an interesting one, or even

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.660
biology and the
intricacies there.

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.780
But I think this brings
up a larger point, which

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.535
is an even bigger
abstract question,

01:24:16.535 --> 01:24:18.910
but follows along with this
idea of creating these change

01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:19.740
agents.

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:23.530
And so somebody asked, is there
this sense that these change

01:24:23.530 --> 01:24:26.050
agents, like the ones
that are found in DARPA--

01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:27.760
is it important to
create these change

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:33.070
agents by giving you a whole
bunch of money and letting do

01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:35.020
you do--

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.950
use your own discretion,
as product managers,

01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:39.970
to figure out what you
want to do, or to find

01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:43.667
these people that are
doing these fringe research

01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:45.250
opportunities that
might be high risk,

01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:47.750
and they might not just have
the funding, and go from there?

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:50.830
And so it's the do you
want to create these change

01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:52.990
agents by giving
it to the people

01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:55.990
that you think are capable, or
do you want to go out and find

01:24:55.990 --> 01:25:00.730
these people who may not be
proven in their field yet,

01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:04.853
or might not have research
that is still at this high risk

01:25:04.853 --> 01:25:05.353
phase?

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.300
STEPH: Could I ask
clarifying question?

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:11.980
Do you mean in the
context of DARPA,

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.370
or do you mean generally?

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:18.037
RASHEED: I would say
generally, because DARPA--

01:25:18.037 --> 01:25:19.870
you have a model that's
established already.

01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:20.620
STEPH: OK.

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.215
The reason I ask that
is because in one

01:25:23.215 --> 01:25:24.340
of the readings for today--

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:27.430
I believe it was the--

01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:29.460
it might have been the
Fong reading actually--

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.210
there's a quote from
that technologist who

01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:32.627
said that he wanted
the government

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:34.390
to not touch engineers at all.

01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:38.252
He said, "If the US wants
[INAUDIBLE] jobs, better lives,

01:25:38.252 --> 01:25:40.210
and a stronger economy,
the best thing lobbyist

01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:42.943
bureaucrats and politicians
can do is leave us alone."

01:25:42.943 --> 01:25:44.860
And so that's why I
thought it was interesting

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.660
if you were asking in
the context of DARPA

01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:49.030
or in the context of an
organization that was funded

01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:50.470
by government dollars.

01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:53.860
Because maybe what
the implication

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:55.900
is, in this instance,
for this person who

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:58.000
is rejecting the notion
that government played

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.370
any role in the computational
revolution of all,

01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:02.740
is we don't want
government help.

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.590
But maybe the model
that they actually want

01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:09.910
is give us the money, and then
don't mess with us at all.

01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:11.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:13.535
STEPH: Yeah, exactly.

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:14.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:15.785
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's spoken

01:26:15.785 --> 01:26:18.970
like someone who's done
some annual reports before.

01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:20.320
AUDIENCE: Is that the VC?

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.750
Is that from [INAUDIBLE]?

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:23.960
STEPH: This is from Draper.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.668
AUDIENCE: Draper?

01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:29.230
STEPH: It's on
page 234, if you're

01:26:29.230 --> 01:26:30.400
interested in looking at it.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I think what

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.268
he meant is more like
please don't put more

01:26:38.268 --> 01:26:39.810
regulations that I
have to deal with,

01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:40.977
when I'm trying to innovate.

01:26:40.977 --> 01:26:42.730
It keeps getting in the way.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.331
STEPH: I like Beth's
point too, though.

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.410
I'm so sorry, Lily.

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.100
I like your point too.

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.650
Could you maybe elaborate
in your experience

01:26:58.650 --> 01:27:02.790
what it's like to innovate
under the auspices of working

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:04.800
in a team with other people?

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
I've had experience

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:10.110
with National Science
Foundation grants,

01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:13.890
huge NASA Astrobiology
Institute grants.

01:27:13.890 --> 01:27:18.390
And their reporting
requirements are intensive.

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:20.400
Usually they're on
an annual basis.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.250
And I think that the intention
behind the annual reporting

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:30.490
is necessary and good.

01:27:30.490 --> 01:27:35.000
But often, they're
extremely cumbersome,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.040
and the first year, really
people are just making--

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.930
including stuff that
they've already done,

01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:46.480
or even inflating what
they've accomplished

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.620
to look good on the report.

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.630
So those are the
only experiences

01:27:49.630 --> 01:27:53.550
that I've had is with
those two funding agencies.

01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:57.012
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think DARPA
has the more [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:57.012 --> 01:27:59.220
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
DARPA runs a different kind

01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:00.970
of opposite operation.

01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:05.970
There's there's, frankly, less
paper, but the DARPA program

01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:08.730
manager--

01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:12.970
at a traditional science agency,
the whole decision process

01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:16.940
is organized around whether or
not you get the grant award.

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:19.958
And it's getting that
award out the door.

01:28:19.958 --> 01:28:22.250
That's how these organizations
are really put together.

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:24.470
That's what the peer review
process and selection

01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:26.720
process is built around.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.840
In DARPA, and in the--

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.750
excuse me-- in some
of the DARPA clones,

01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:36.260
the program manager, that's like
just getting the grant award.

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.700
That's only stage one.

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:40.970
Then the program manager
moves into your home.

01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:43.250
They're going to be
on you all the time.

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:46.670
Someone has described
DARPA as a set of geniuses

01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:48.350
connected by a travel agent.

01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:50.960
They spend at least 1/3
of their time on the road

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:57.080
out meeting with their
teams, bringing ideas around.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.840
They'll typically have a
number of teams standing up

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.690
working on a portfolio
of related projects,

01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:05.330
and they're going to bring ideas
from those different teams.

01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:07.997
They're going to put those teams
together to talk to each other,

01:29:07.997 --> 01:29:10.310
and sometimes that's not
easy, because they don't want

01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:12.380
to really share their secrets.

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.370
So it's a complicated
process to manage,

01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:18.200
but the DARPA manager
is there to help

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.960
the awardee get
through the process

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.690
and work in any way possible
to expedite things and move

01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:24.540
things along.

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:27.800
So it's a completely
different organizational model

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:31.100
for the program manager compared
to most science agencies.

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:33.380
And the DARPA clones,
like ARPA-E or IARPA

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.690
do the same thing.

01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:38.420
And we'll talk about
ARPA-E at a later class.

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:41.280
But it's just a different model.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:47.210
And there's another capability--
we talked earlier about DARPA

01:29:47.210 --> 01:29:50.750
capability of working at
both the institutional level

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:53.690
and at the great groups level.

01:29:53.690 --> 01:29:56.600
The purpose of this
reading about its work

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.720
within the defense
legacy sector is

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.510
to say that DARPA has
been able to do innovation

01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:06.360
within a legacy sector
to a remarkable degree,

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.830
as well as do
innovation, like in IT,

01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:12.770
on a complete
technology frontier.

01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:16.700
That's a remarkable
set of capabilities

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:20.330
to build into one
place, and yet its model

01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:22.730
has been able to fit both.

01:30:22.730 --> 01:30:25.820
So it's another
interesting achievement

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.170
that it's been able to pull off.

01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:29.420
AUDIENCE: Just to go back to--

01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:31.030
I know in your book,
you talk about how,

01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:32.189
when you go to a
legacy sector, it's

01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:34.564
like you're parachuting down
and they're shooting at you.

01:30:34.564 --> 01:30:37.670
I think, for the military
[INAUDIBLE] fields

01:30:37.670 --> 01:30:40.600
and new areas, it might easier,
and so it's easier to form.

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:45.660
But I think for energy, how
do you make that distinction?

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.992
Because I feel
other legacy sectors

01:30:47.992 --> 01:30:49.863
would be a lot
harder to come in.

01:30:49.863 --> 01:30:51.530
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, the military's

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:53.180
a hard legacy sector,
because remember,

01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.800
the services have the money.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.750
They have their
procurement budgets.

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.330
And if they don't want to
do it, it's really hard

01:30:59.330 --> 01:31:00.210
to get them to do it.

01:31:00.210 --> 01:31:03.620
So that's why that island-bridge
model's so crucial for DARPA

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:06.020
being able to rely on
the Secretary of Defense

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:08.580
to kind of override
some of the directions

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.830
where the services want to go.

01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:14.900
It's still not easy, but all of
these three technology areas--

01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:17.420
position strike,
UAVs, and stealth--

01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:20.930
were all stood up despite some
pretty significant service

01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:22.250
opposition.

01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:25.220
Not uniformly-- different
parts of the services

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:27.980
saw what the possibilities were,
so I want to make that uniform.

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:29.600
But it was still tough.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.950
These were not
easy to implement.

01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:35.790
AUDIENCE: So
[INAUDIBLE] so would you

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:38.370
say that ARPA-E has been
as successful [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:38.370 --> 01:31:41.340
DARPA did, or how do
you think about it?

01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:44.600
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
we'll go through ARPA-E

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:49.310
when we get to that class, but
I think ARPA-E is very young.

01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:50.390
It's still very new.

01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:51.930
AUDIENCE: Like 2009, right?

01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:54.410
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
it's like seven years old.

01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:56.870
So in some ways, the
jury's still out,

01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:59.600
and we'll see if they survive.

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.240
But looks very interesting.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.330
So Max, let's do some
of Glenn Fong's work.

01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:06.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:08.870
OK, so basically,
Fong was talking

01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:12.438
a lot about PARC,
and Xerox, and how

01:32:12.438 --> 01:32:14.480
a lot of the concepts that
were developed at PARC

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.750
were eventually taken
by Microsoft and Apple,

01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:21.620
and basically created the
PC revolution that we all

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:24.620
know and love.

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:28.430
Yeah, Apple fanboy.

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:31.580
So one of the questions
that I had while I

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:34.400
was reading the Fong reading--

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.020
maybe someone can clarify this--

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:38.660
I didn't really
understand-- so PARC's--

01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:41.000
a lot of their
ideas were taken--

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.850
virtually everything--
so how did PARC not

01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:48.320
respond in any
sort of legal way?

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.473
They could have sued.

01:32:50.473 --> 01:32:52.640
Was it possibly because
they didn't patent anything?

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.880
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: [INAUDIBLE]
Jobs bought the rights--

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.220
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:56.870
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
--to go through.

01:32:56.870 --> 01:33:00.380
So he acquired those rights.

01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.922
AUDIENCE: I thought it was just
the rights to visit, or the--

01:33:02.922 --> 01:33:04.255
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Do you know?

01:33:04.255 --> 01:33:05.160
Go ahead.

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.535
AUDIENCE: So I don't know if
it was he bought the rights.

01:33:07.535 --> 01:33:09.330
I know he funded them somehow.

01:33:09.330 --> 01:33:11.000
And part of that
funding was that, oh,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.740
I get to check
out your projects,

01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:16.178
and I get to see [INAUDIBLE]
and take those ideas how it is.

01:33:16.178 --> 01:33:16.720
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:33:19.823 --> 01:33:21.240
AUDIENCE: I'll
clarify this later.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.330
But he can do that
because of the rights.

01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:26.660
And then Gates could
do it because--

01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:29.885
Jobs and Gates were friends,
so Jobs showed Gates.

01:33:29.885 --> 01:33:31.760
He's like, look at this
cool thing I'm doing.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.718
Because they're kind of
in a different sectors.

01:33:33.718 --> 01:33:35.780
So he's like, check it out.

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:36.530
What do you think?

01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:37.560
Because he's trying
to impress his friend,

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.170
who's also very successful.

01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:43.387
And Gates is like, whoa,
this is pretty great.

01:33:43.387 --> 01:33:45.470
And then he goes and he
copies, and he [INAUDIBLE]

01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:46.690
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You're
talking about Windows?

01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:47.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:33:47.315 --> 01:33:48.570
So he comes out with--

01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:49.375
was it Windows DOS?

01:33:49.375 --> 01:33:51.500
He comes out with that
right before [INAUDIBLE]----

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.530
because this is going to be
part of the new Apple Computer.

01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:55.113
And he comes out
with it right before,

01:33:55.113 --> 01:33:57.780
so it looks like Gates
did it, instead of Jobs.

01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:59.810
And then Jobs literally
goes like, we're done.

01:34:02.690 --> 01:34:04.717
This is the reason Apple
became so secretive.

01:34:04.717 --> 01:34:06.050
They used to be a lot more open.

01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:08.840
They became secretive because
after that, he's like--

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:11.412
any little thing can go
out if somebody finds out,

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:12.620
we're not doing this anymore.

01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:15.380
So it completely
switched the hierarchy.

01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.410
So that's the rights
part, in terms of the--

01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:21.640
Jobs does it, and then
when Gates copies--

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.470
when Jobs takes
Gates to court, Gates

01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:28.130
can say, actually, we both
stole it, but it's OK for him,

01:34:28.130 --> 01:34:29.750
so it's OK for me.

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:30.320
[INAUDIBLE]

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.570
RASHEED: But like you just
said, Jobs didn't steal it.

01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:34.560
He paid for it.

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.380
He paid for the rights.

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:38.060
AUDIENCE: When they
go to court, Gates

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.910
says, yeah, we both just
took it from the same source.

01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:42.590
It's not like it was
originally Apple's.

01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:45.350
So that's the element
of the legality.

01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:46.940
The second part--
the reason PARC

01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:49.107
wouldn't do it is because
you have this thing called

01:34:49.107 --> 01:34:52.640
the innovator's dilemma,
which is, in any company,

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.910
you can have a product line--
a great example's Kodak.

01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:58.250
They came out with the
first digital camera,

01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:00.650
but you're already
making so much money,

01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:05.180
and you probably have a
large revenue streams doing--

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.860
taking pictures of Polaroids.

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:08.860
So this is like, if you're
an Ethernet company--

01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:11.510
if you're 3Com, and
you have these--

01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:13.010
you're putting wires everywhere.

01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:15.430
It's not the next
day it's like, yo, we

01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:16.640
got to take all this out.

01:35:19.658 --> 01:35:21.950
Another thing too is, once
you become a public company,

01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:23.600
every single quarter matters.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.770
So you can never go back.

01:35:27.282 --> 01:35:29.490
You can know you're wrong
but you have to go forward,

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:30.620
or else you're just
going to get kicked off

01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:32.900
or you're going to get
sued by shareholders.

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.320
It's a very complicated
thing to do.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.985
RASHEED: Also, I wonder how
much PARC staff or Xerox staff

01:35:37.985 --> 01:35:40.610
there is left to really benefit
after all the staff is actually

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:43.190
just going to Apple and
Microsoft afterward.

01:35:43.190 --> 01:35:47.673
It's not that I didn't
benefit because I was at Xerox

01:35:47.673 --> 01:35:48.590
and I missed the wave.

01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:49.090
It's like.

01:35:49.090 --> 01:35:51.547
I just left Xerox to go
work at Apple or Microsoft,

01:35:51.547 --> 01:35:52.880
and then got the benefits later.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.338
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So Luyao,
you led us through Xerox PARC

01:35:55.338 --> 01:35:56.390
very nicely last week.

01:35:56.390 --> 01:36:00.680
Do you have thoughts on
how come Xerox didn't

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.470
get the Alto, and
personal computing,

01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:07.520
and graphic interfaces,
and the mouse out the door?

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:08.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.390
[INAUDIBLE] last
week that they were

01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:13.800
so much into the research
they're doing, and so

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.080
passion that they
didn't consider

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:21.940
commercializing or bringing it
to the general audience at all.

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:29.110
One of the investors came
to their meeting room

01:36:29.110 --> 01:36:34.060
and sat on a beanbag saying,
OK, I'm the person [INAUDIBLE]

01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:39.353
Can you guys show me more, and
I will commercialize all this

01:36:39.353 --> 01:36:40.270
by making it possible?

01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:41.440
But they didn't.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.300
They totally ignored him.

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.390
So I think they had a
chance, but they just

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:47.830
didn't the awareness, I think.

01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:48.913
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:36:48.913 --> 01:36:51.000
It was a really serious
island-bridge connection

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:51.815
problem.

01:36:51.815 --> 01:36:55.780
AUDIENCE: They were probably
missing one or two [INAUDIBLE]

01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:59.500
in their group that
were able to connect

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.752
with the market with
their innovations.

01:37:01.752 --> 01:37:03.210
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Part of this is

01:37:03.210 --> 01:37:04.690
something Martin
mentioned earlier,

01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:07.440
which is Xerox was focused
on its core competency, which

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.960
is photocopies.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:15.180
And they didn't understand this
explosion of personal computing

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:17.550
capability, because it didn't
fit their core competency

01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:18.750
model.

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:26.130
So they missed a
staggering opportunity.

01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:29.100
But fortunately, Jobs saved
us, so it all worked out.

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:32.513
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] call
it the beanbag effect.

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:34.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Too
much time in those beanbags,

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.930
is that your point, Lily?

01:37:36.930 --> 01:37:38.490
Right, that was a
great photograph

01:37:38.490 --> 01:37:39.900
of the crowd on beanbags.

01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:44.370
You had a great
picture for us, Luyao.

01:37:44.370 --> 01:37:47.230
How about a closing
thought, Max, on Fong--

01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:49.390
or a couple of closing thoughts?

01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:52.390
AUDIENCE: Let's see.

01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:53.850
How about a closing question?

01:37:53.850 --> 01:37:54.420
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Sure.

01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:54.770
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:56.445
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's fine.

01:37:56.445 --> 01:37:58.415
I only let you get one
out, so it's all yours.

01:37:58.415 --> 01:37:59.790
AUDIENCE: So one
of the questions

01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:03.540
that someone had previously
mentioned this basically

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.790
there's this stereotype that
government bureaucracy is

01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:08.970
kind of slow, and sluggish,
and full of red tape,

01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:11.190
and it's horrible.

01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:13.860
And is it possible
that you could use--

01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:15.450
like DARPA as an
example-- to say

01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:19.920
that maybe this is unfounded,
maybe it's not as realistic

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.770
as people think?

01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:23.770
And to continue that--
there's a couple of parts

01:38:23.770 --> 01:38:26.490
to this question--
is it unfounded,

01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:32.880
and should the government
try to redo its image,

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.550
for lack of a better phrase?

01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:38.750
And is there really any
advantage they can get from it?

01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:40.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:41.400
AUDIENCE: What?

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.033
Can you repeat [INAUDIBLE]

01:38:43.033 --> 01:38:43.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry.

01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:45.617
I know, I started
rambling a little bit.

01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:51.600
Is the government slow?

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.240
AUDIENCE: Is DARPA an
instance where it's not slow?

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.040
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.410
And does the government
get any advantage

01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:02.490
from making itself
not look slow?

01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:04.880
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's a
really important point, Max.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:10.350
DARPA is stuck in one of the
most notorious bureaucracies

01:39:10.350 --> 01:39:15.540
on the planet, that
dates back to like 1787.

01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:18.480
So how is it able
to do this stuff?

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.110
It has some very interesting
rules and some capabilities

01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:22.650
that it got.

01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:27.600
One of its key rules is that--

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.020
it's called other
transactions authority.

01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:37.260
And DARPA's argument is, look,
we're not buying jet aircraft.

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.823
We're just buying what's in
people's heads to do research.

01:39:40.823 --> 01:39:42.240
So we don't have
to go through all

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.980
that elaborate
procurement process

01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:46.140
to protect the taxpayers.

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.780
We're out of the Federal
Procurement System.

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:52.320
So DARPA's able to contract
with enormous freedom,

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.540
and very quickly.

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:58.890
And then another DARPA
power that they've acquired

01:39:58.890 --> 01:40:00.010
is that they can--

01:40:00.010 --> 01:40:02.700
they have what's
called IPA authority--

01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:05.880
Intergovernmental
Personnel Act authority.

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.580
So ironically, at
one point, DARPA

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:12.750
was attempting to hire me.

01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:14.900
And I don't know
why they wanted me,

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:18.510
because I'm not a technologist,
but they seemed to want this.

01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:21.448
And I wasn't going
to go to DARPA,

01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:22.740
because I'm not a technologist.

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:25.080
I wouldn't be at the
heart of the operation.

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.000
So it wasn't going to work.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.580
But they said they
can hire me in a day.

01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:31.410
They said, you want to do this?

01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:32.820
You're on tomorrow.

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:36.870
This Intergovernmental
Personnel Act

01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:39.120
enables them
essentially to enter

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.720
into a contract with
whatever organization

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.270
you're working for--
maybe it's a university.

01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:49.890
They buy your services using
this other transactions

01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:52.380
authority, so that they
can put you on the job

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.640
almost immediately.

01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:59.550
The use this IPA authority with
companies or with universities

01:40:59.550 --> 01:41:03.060
to be able to hire in
lickety-split time.

01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:07.230
Corporations can't hire this
fast, much less universities,

01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:08.970
much less government.

01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:14.250
So they're outside of two
of the traditional banes

01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:16.680
of governmental
bureaucratic nightmares.

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.220
They got themselves
free of that authority.

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:25.590
And interestingly, both ARPA-E
and IARPA, the DARPA clones,

01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:29.200
have the same capabilities.

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.232
So that's part of why they're
able to act like this.

01:41:32.232 --> 01:41:33.690
I don't think it's
the whole story,

01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:35.250
but that's a couple
of pieces that they've

01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:36.210
been able to acquire.

01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:41.592
RASHEED: I would
answer and say, I

01:41:41.592 --> 01:41:43.050
guess, traditionally,
you would say

01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:45.980
government and bureaucracy
[INAUDIBLE] the highlight

01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:46.740
of what's slow is.

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:48.115
When you think of
something slow,

01:41:48.115 --> 01:41:51.330
you think of a congressional
session or something like that.

01:41:51.330 --> 01:41:52.680
STEPH: It's deliberate.

01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.097
RASHEED: And it's
deliberately so,

01:41:54.097 --> 01:41:56.347
and then there's an entire
argument that can get into.

01:41:56.347 --> 01:41:57.900
Is government
supposed to move slow

01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:00.540
because they need to be this
giant political machine that

01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:04.710
shouldn't be swayed by just
one charismatic convincing guy?

01:42:04.710 --> 01:42:07.080
But anyway, I think it's
important to understand

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.545
that DARPA doesn't move
slow because often it

01:42:09.545 --> 01:42:10.920
doesn't have this
opportunity to,

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.870
for national security reasons.

01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:17.340
It's just not prudent for
us to move slow to develop,

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.570
I guess, like drones
and things like that,

01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:23.075
which might have been drastic--

01:42:23.075 --> 01:42:24.700
things would look
drastically different

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.117
if someone else
had done it first,

01:42:26.117 --> 01:42:28.860
or if we went into the Gulf
War without these capabilities.

01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:31.430
STEPH: Transferring that example
to something like genomics,

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:33.360
could you imagine the
kinds of implications

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:39.210
that it could have on just
fundamental human ethics

01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:42.035
if they were able to create
genetic engineering overnight

01:42:42.035 --> 01:42:44.160
in the way that DARPA's
been able to create things?

01:42:46.002 --> 01:42:47.460
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, I do want

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:50.040
to tell you that DARPA
now has a very strong

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:52.920
biological technologies office.

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:55.800
So look out, Steph.

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:59.423
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:00.090
STEPH: Oh, yeah.

01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:02.460
Well, it was interesting,
because at the AAAS meeting

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:06.270
in February, one of the sessions
that I went to-- actually with

01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:09.570
Chuck Weiss, who is
Bill's co-author for many

01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:11.400
of the things--

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:14.760
was a panel that included this
guy named Gary Marchant who's

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:19.770
a lawyer ethicist and genomics
engineer, who was talking

01:43:19.770 --> 01:43:22.890
about the necessity to
include a participatory ethics

01:43:22.890 --> 01:43:25.770
in decision making for genomics.

01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:28.260
And one of his primary
arguments, as I recall it,

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:30.960
is truly that, if
we want to have--

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.690
if we want to do a good
job of implementing this

01:43:33.690 --> 01:43:36.000
at scale, nationally
or globally,

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.150
we also have to do a good
job of listening meaningfully

01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:41.280
to populations and
then, at the same time,

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.350
meaningfully incorporating their
feedback into their creation

01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.890
process.

01:43:46.890 --> 01:43:49.380
And that's very difficult. And
I think that's precisely why

01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:51.960
government is slow-- or the
word that I choose use--

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:55.530
deliberate-- but it obviously
does make innovation.

01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:59.070
So to Max's point, I don't
think that DARPA applies,

01:43:59.070 --> 01:44:01.550
unfortunately, to most things.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Welcome, everybody,
on this snowy Friday.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
At the end of last hour,
and I just want to take a

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
minute or two here to finish
this piece up,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we were talking about ways of
writing kinetics expressions for

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
a particular type of assumed
ligand substitution mechanism.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In particular,
we were looking at dissociative

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
substitution.
And now I would just like to

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
take you through what happens if
you don't make the major

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
assumption that we made last
time, which was that every time

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
our intermediate five coordinate
complex ML five was

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
formed, it would go onto
products.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That was our assumption last
time, one of them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And this steady state
approximation is one that allows

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
us to simplify the rate
expression.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If we don't make that
assumption, what we say is that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the change with time of the
concentration of the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
intermediate is approximately
zero.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We know that at the very
beginning of the reaction,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we have this ML five X
species.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
X is the ligand that
dissociates to give ML five,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so at time zero there
is zero ML five

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
concentration.
And let me just remind you of

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
this plot of what happens in a
reaction like this.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We have our initial ML five X
species that decays

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
away, and we have our product ML
five Y that grows in.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And if this reaction goes by
dissociative ligand

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
substitution,
which would certainly be

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
consistent with a d four
high spin electron count,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
as we saw last time,
then there may be some

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
intermediate ML five
that at time zero has zero

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
concentration.
And it may never really build

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
up very much concentration.
And then at the end,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it goes down to zero,
too, because when the reaction

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is over, all of our ML five has
a Y attached and is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
six-coordinate again.
If the concentration of the ML

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
five intermediate never
really builds up very much,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which is quite often the case,
it may not be observable,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the amount of which is produced
during the reaction,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
then this approximation is
pretty valid and allows us to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
derive equations for the change
with time of the species that we

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
can observe, namely the starting
material that is going away and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the product that is coming in.
And so this is our

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
concentration versus time plot
for the reaction.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And with this approximation,
we can then set equal to zero

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the expression for the formation
of the intermediate,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which is k1 times ML five X.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This quantity k1,
if you remember back to the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
diagram we were using last time,
k1 is the rate constant

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
associated with surmounting that
first energy barrier,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
k1 times ML five X.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That produces ML five,
so this is producing

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it, but when you are in the
middle of the well,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
where the intermediate lies,
there are two ways to destroy

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
ML five.
You can go minus k minus one ML

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
five times X.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This brings you,
then, back over to where you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
started.
And you can also lose it in a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
productive sense by k two times
ML five times our species Y,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
which brings us onto products.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And we are still making the
assumption that once you get to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
products, the reaction is done
and you never go back.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That assumption is built into
this analysis.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And if we look at this,
we have set it equal to zero,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
meaning that ML five is
not building up.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And so now, what we can do is
we can rearrange this expression

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and solve it for the
concentration of ML five.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And you will see that you can
do that here.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
ML five becomes equal to k1
times ML five X --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
That is the expression for the
formation.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
These two brackets should be
done.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
ML five X over k minus one
times Y plus.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Sorry.
That should be X,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
here.
Plus k2, times Y.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The expression

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
in the denominator here are
those two quantities that take

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
us out of the well.
And on the top,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we have the one quantity that
takes us into the well from the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
starting materials.
And so now, we have an

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
expression for ML five
that we can plug into our

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
expression for the rate.
The rate overall expressed as

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the appearance of the final
product is going to be equal to

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
k2 times ML five,
this is going over the final

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
barrier, times Y.
And so,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
if we take the expression here
for the rate,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
this is the value that we
expect for the appearance of

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
products.
We take that substitute in this

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
expression for the unobserved
intermediate,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
ML five,
into this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Then we have an expression for
the rate entirely in terms of

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
things that we can either
observe, namely the starting

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
material, the concentration we
would measure by some technique,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
like spectrophotometry as a
function of time,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
watching an absorbance band for
it decay away,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
for example.
And then also in terms of the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
concentration of Y which we were
talking about as the solvent,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
so it would have a large
invariant and known

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
concentration.
And then, of course,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
since X is being produced in
the reaction whenever it

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
dissociates from the starting
material, there is a

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
relationship between the
concentration of X at any time

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and the concentration of our
starting material at any time.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Now we get an expression that
we need to be able to integrate

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
in order to actually produce,
given these parameters,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
k1, k minus 1,
and k2, to produce a predicted

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
dataset to compare with the
experimental.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And what one normally does is
you take an experimental

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
dataset, you have the equations
that arise from your mechanistic

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
hypothesis, and you do a least
squares fitting procedure to

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
obtain the values of the
parameters, which are these

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
phenomenological rate constants
associated with each step in the

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
mechanism.
Extract the values of the

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
parameters, and see what you
get, see if the mechanism that

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you have assumed can give you a
good fit to the data or whether

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
it cannot.
That is the end of my

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
discussion of an introduction to
kinetic analysis of chemical

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
reactions, a really important
subject where differential

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
equations really become very
important.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Today, I want to get onto the
top of extended solids,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and so I am going to talk about
dimensionality,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
here.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And materials.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And I want you to keep in mind
the framework with which we have

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
been discussing chemical bonding
all throughout this semester

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
because we are going to extend
that today to try to understand

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
some of the properties of
systems that are not molecular,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
but extend infinity in some
number of dimensions.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
We talked about the H two
molecule.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
This is a very small molecular
system that we have described

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and talked about quite a bit.
This system has a radius,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
here, of about 0.64 angstroms,
or internuclear distance of

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
about 0.64 angstroms.
And then, we can also consider

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
molecules that become more
extended.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
There is an example of a
polyene.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And my use of a polyene,
here, should lead you to think

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that when we consider polymer
chemistry, in some cases,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
we will be talking about
systems that are extended,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
maybe not infinitely,
but very greatly in one

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
direction, or maybe more than
one direction.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But polyenes are interesting
species because if this thing

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
had all the double bonds,
trans, as I have drawn here,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
then what we have perpendicular
to the board would be a set of p

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
orbitals, one p orbital
perpendicular to the board on

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
each of these carbons.
And all of those p orbitals can

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
overlap.
And then, we can start talking

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
about the transport of electrons
down a chain like this in one

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
dimension.
So I put H two up here

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
as an example of what is
approximately a zero dimensional

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
system.
Here is a system that extends

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
somewhat in one dimension.
And then, as an example of a

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
two dimensional system,
let me just draw up here a

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
piece of one of the sheets of
the graphite structure.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Graphite is one of the
allotropes of carbon.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And graphite is a really nice
2d structure.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I can draw in some of the
unsaturation here.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And I don't mean to suggest
that this thing stops here.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
These carbons on the parameter
of the graphite system have

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
bonds, and the structure looks
very much like what I have drawn

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
here, if you repeat outward,
up, down, left,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
or right.
And what that leads to are

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
two-dimensional planar arrays of
carbon atoms that,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
as with the polyene structure,
here this polyene that I drew

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
with six bonds,
is about 13 angstroms long.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And then the problem that you
get to with graphite is that

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
these graphite sheets can have
dimensions of millimeters.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
You have gone from something
short to something very,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
very large.
And we are going infinitely.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I am going to show you a little
bit more about this.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I am going to let you look at
this website yourselves.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You are going to find that I
did put into the notes for today

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the website that we are going to
look at.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And it is for you to go ahead
and look at in three-dimensions

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
at the structure of the
graphite.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And also, in particular,
I want you to be able to look

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
at the structure of the diamond
framework.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
One of the things that I want
you to be thinking about in

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
association with today's lecture
are the way that atoms pack in

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
three dimensions when you make
up a solid material.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You will see why that is
important in just a moment.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And so we are going to have to
go from bonds to bands in order

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to make this transition.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And that means we are going to
have to talk about band

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
structure today and where bands
come from.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
This, by the way,
the title for this panel from

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
bonds to bands is actually the
inverse of a title that was

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
penned for a beautiful article
written by Professor Roald

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Hoffmann.
And he was actually one of my

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
teachers as an undergraduate at
Cornell University,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and he also won the Nobel Prize
for his contributions to theory.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And I refer you to his article
from bands to bonds if you want

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to learn more about this topic
because, although the concepts

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
of solid state physics are often
discussed with very different

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
terminology than the concepts of
electronic structure theory for

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
molecules, there are a lot of
very important parallelisms.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And one of the things that
Professor Hoffmann is very good

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
at is in bridging the gap
between different branches of

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
science that talk about the same
things but don't realize that

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
they are talking about the same
things.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And so here we have a system
with a single orbital.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
We are going to look at the
number of orbitals.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And here is a system with one.
And this is an energy level

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
diagram.
We have used energy level

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
diagrams for a lot of things.
Last lecture,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
we used them to discuss
potential energy surfaces of

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
chemical reactions,
in addition to all these other

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
properties.
Here is a system with one

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
orbital.
And then, as you know,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
when you have a system with two
orbitals, you can get bonding

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and antibonding.
This is the hydrogen problem.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
This might be a hydrogen atom,
for example.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Here is an H two
molecular orbital diagram.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And then we can consider a
system that might have three

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
orbitals populated,
like this.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And then, if we have a system
with four orbitals,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
it might be something like
that, four electrons and so on.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
We see that one of the features
is that the energy levels are

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
starting to come closer together
as we get more and more of them.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
There are five.
Here is six.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And then, onto seven.
And you start running out of

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
room to draw them.
And so, what people do then

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
with this problem,
we are only up to seven and we

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
have almost run out of space to
draw these things.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
So what do we do?
We draw them,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
when we get out to infinity
here, as a band.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
What the idea is,
is that we have here this band

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
diagram, as we are going to call
them, a type of diagram in which

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
we are representing field
orbitals down here as some kind

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
of continuum.
Because there are so many of

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
them, an infinite number of
orbitals that are all

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
interacting in some extended
solid material,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
we are going to be talking
today a little bit about silicon

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
and germanium and things like
gallium nitride,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
in which you have a lattice
that extends periodically in

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
three-dimensions.
And so these molecular orbitals

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
spread out and cover the whole
material.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Electrons can be anywhere at
once within this entire extended

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
solid by virtue of these
delocalized orbitals.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And then, just like in
molecules, there are empty

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
orbitals.
And they occur,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
also, in a continuum.
I would like you to get your

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
mind around going from both ends
to the same place in that type

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
of continuum.
And the idea that these band

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
structure diagrams that people
use to describe the electronic

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
structure properties of extended
materials are really molecular

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000
orbital diagrams.
And so let's take a typical

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
metal, where n equals three,
principle quantum number three.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
The atom has a 1s orbital.
It has a 2s and a set of 2p

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
orbitals.
It has a 3s orbital and a set

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
of 3p.
And so there is an atom,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
like a sodium atom,
for example.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
And here is our energy axis.
What happens is that each of

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
these orbitals,
that when you put all these

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
atoms together into a piece of
solid sodium metal,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
we talked about that earlier in
the semester,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
these orbitals overlap,
spread out and form bands.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And there is a band very low in
energy that is derived from the

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
1s electrons in a metal like
sodium.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And it is completely full.
And then there is a band from

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
the 2s and there is a band,
accordingly,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
from the 2p.
And then there will be a band

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
from the 3s, and a band from the
3p that I have run out of room

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
to draw there.
And notice that the bands that

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
originate from atomic orbitals
having the same principle

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
quantum number here,
2s and 2p, are overlapping.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
In the case of a sodium atom,
this 2s band is completely full

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
with electrons and the 2p band
is completely full.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And this 3s band here,
in the case of sodium,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
is half full.
Furthermore,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
we are going to call these
filled bands that are at the

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
highest energy.
This corresponds to our highest

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
occupied molecular orbital.
That will be called the valance

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
band.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And then up here,
the lowest unoccupied band is

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
called the conduction band.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And so, in the case of sodium
metal, this 3s band is half

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
full.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000
And, if we go over to
magnesium, this same 3s band is

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
now full.
And if we go to aluminum,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:09.000
that 3s band is full,
and the 3p band is partly full.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
And it is a consequence of the
fact that the electrons in the

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
valance band are right here at
the same energy as the lowest

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
part of the conduction band in a
metal that gives metals their

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
luster.
It gives them their 100%

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
optical reflectivity,
--

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
-- these properties that we
very much associate with metals.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And so from analyzing band
structure diagrams,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
even simplified ones,
like the ones you will find

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
here and in your textbook today,
you can really say a lot about

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
the properties of different
materials.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
When you have a meeting of the
valance band and the conduction

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:16.000
band, then your material is a
conductor and is metallic.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000
And then, there are other
possibilities,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
of course.
You may have a valance band

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:40.000
that is separated by some energy
gap from the conduction band.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And if that is that is the
case, then you have a

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
semi-conductor,
such as silicon.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
And then, finally,
you can have a large gap

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
between your valance band and
your conduction band.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And, in all cases,
like with an MO diagram,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
we are putting these things on
an energy axis.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
We are filling up electrons
from the bottom in this material

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
from the standpoint of energy,
and so you have a large gap,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
here.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
And you have a material that is
an insulator.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And I think you will appreciate
why that is in a moment,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
but I want to bring Boltzmann's
law to bear on the issue of

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
electronic structure in extended
networks, like we are talking

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
about today.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
In materials like the ones I
have drawn over here,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
the ability to conduct
electricity is related to the

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
probability of electrons being
in the conduction band.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000
So we need to know something
about electrons in the

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
conduction band.
And, using a Boltzmann

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
distribution,
we can write that probability

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:33.000
as being related to one over (e
to the (delta E over RT)) plus

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000
one.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
And, with an expression like
this, this delta E here

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
corresponds to our gap.
And so it is possible,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
then, to go ahead and estimate
the number of electrons that

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
would be present in a cubic
centimeter of your material in

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
the condition band as a function
of this energy gap.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
And so we can consider that for
materials like carbon or silicon

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
or elemental germanium.
In the case of carbon,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
I am talking about diamond.
And you should definitely go to

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
that specified website and look
at the diamond structure and try

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
to get an appreciation for how
the carbon atoms in diamond pack

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
in three dimensions.
From a hybridization

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
standpoint, all the carbons in
graphite are sp two.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Whereas, in diamond all the
carbons are sp three

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
and tetrahedral.
And completing this table,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
--

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
-- we can write down delta E in
kilojoules per mole.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
The gap for diamond is
kilojoules per mole,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
for silicon,
117 kilojoules per mole,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
and for germanium,
66 kilojoules per mole.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And here is the number of
electrons per centimeter cubed

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000
in the material in the
conduction band.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And, based on this large energy
gap in the diamond structure,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
this value is on the order of
10^-27.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Very small.
This is an insulator.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Diamond is an insulator.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
And, on the other hand,
silicon, the number of

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
electrons per cubic centimeter
that are in the conduction band

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
are on the order of 10^9.
This much smaller gap in the

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
case of silicon,
despite the fact that the

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
silicon atoms also are
tetrahedrally disposed with

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
respect to their bonding,
just as in the diamond case,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
we have a much smaller gap,
10^9.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
And that makes silicon,
as you know,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
a semiconductor.
And then germanium,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
10^13, so even more.
It is getting closer and closer

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
to being metallic as the gap
shrinks as we compare these

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
materials.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
And, having said that,
we need to talk about the

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
different types of materials
that we can have.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000
I want you to understand the
difference between intrinsic and

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
extrinsic semiconductors.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
If a semiconductor material is
an intrinsic semiconductor,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
that means that it is a
semiconductor in its pure state.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And why would we make that
reference?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
I mean normally,
we are always talking about

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
pure things.
But, actually,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
you will see in a moment that
people do purposely make impure

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
semiconductors for very good
reasons.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And we will discuss
semiconductor when pure.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And what that means is you have
a system like this with some

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
kind of a small band gap,
as we have suggested.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Here is our energy axis.
And what can happen is that,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
either thermally or upon
absorption of light energy,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
we can have promotion of an
electron from the valance band

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.000
into the conduction band.
And so I will draw that new

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
situation over here.
In other words,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
we may have thermal population
of our conduction band.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
And we generate,
accordingly,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
a hole.
In this intrinsic

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
semiconductor,
for every electron that jumps

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
up into the conduction band and
can then provide conductivity by

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
electron transport --

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Down here, in the valance band,
the missing electron generates

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
a hole.
And that hole can move around

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
freely in the valance band.
How does it do that?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Well, it is a little bit like
the mechanism that we studied

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
earlier for translocation of
protons in acidic water.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
If an electron that is nearby
the hole jumps into the hole,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
it creates another hole.
The hole thereby moves.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And so here,
we can have hole transport in

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
our valance band.
You can have conductivity

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
occurring freely both in the
valance band and in the

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
conduction band for an intrinsic
semiconductor of this type,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
where the number of holes is
equal to the number of

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
electrons.
And you might begin to suspect

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
that for an extrinsic
semiconductor,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000
the number of holes does not
equal the number of electrons.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
How does that work?
In these extrinsic

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
semiconductors wherein you have
differing numbers of holes and

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
electrons, you are purposely
adding a small percentage of

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000
impurities to your material.
Let me draw two pictures to

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
represent this.
Here, I would like to draw just

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000
a simple tetrahedron.
We are looking at a very small

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
part of the silicon structure.
Let me put the silicons in here

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
in color.
Each silicon is coordinated to

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
four other silicons in elemental
silicon.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
It is tetrahedral silicon all
through this three-dimensional

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
material in which these bands
have been created,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
and in which we have valance
and conduction bands.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
But what if we have synthesized
our silicon with a little bit of

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
boron impurity?
If we do that,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
then boron goes into a position
in the crystal lattice that is

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
normally occupied by silicon,
so boron finds itself

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
surrounded by four silicons,
each of which wishes to donate

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
an electron to the boron to form
an electron pair bond.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
But boron only has three of the
needed four electrons to make

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
those four two-electron bonds
and to generate the octet.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
And so what happens is it wants
to get an electron.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
And where can it get an
electron from?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
It can get an electron from the
valance band,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
from the HOMO of the system,
from what would be able to

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
donate an electron in the
system.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
The way this then works is as
follows.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
You should think about the
structure of elemental silicon

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
with a small number of boron
atoms dispersed throughout that

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
structure as creating localized
negative charges that cannot

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
move because they are localized
on these borons.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
And that generates for you a
band structure diagram like

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
this.
You have bands,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
but then you have slipped in
there a little orbital from the

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
boron, a little electronic state
here, an intermediate between

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
the valance band and the
conduction band.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
So you have to choose your
impurity correctly,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
so that it has the right energy
with respect to the valance band

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
and the conduction band in order
for the process that you want to

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
occur.
Here is our boron-derived

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
state, here, and it needs that
extra electron because it is

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
electron deficient when you put
it in there.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
And so an electron jumps onto
the boron, we will represent

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
that this way,
in the material like that.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And this electron is fixed in
position --

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
-- because it is associated
with a negative charge that has

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
formed on the boron.
And a corresponding hole is

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
formed down in the conduction
band, and this hole transport

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
can give rise to conductivity.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And so notice that in this type
of semiconductor,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
and this, by the way,
is a p-type semiconductor.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
P for positive.
You are putting in a hole on

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
that boron, so this is a p-type
of semiconductor.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
This thing is stuck on the
boron, and it generates a hole

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
that is free to move in the
valance band and give rise to

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
conductivity.
And so in this extrinsic-type

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
of semiconductor,
you are not necessarily getting

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
any conductivity up here in the
normal conduction band but down

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
in the valance band due to the
creation of the hole.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
And then the parallel situation
to that would be where you have

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
something that you dope into the
structure that has one more

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
electron than what is normally
in the structure.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Normally, you are putting in
silicon atoms each of which has

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
four valance electrons.
You put in a phosphorus atom,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
which isn't nearly the same
size as silicon,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
but has five valance electrons.
So you have this phosphorus in

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
here, and it is tetrahedrally
coordinated to four silicons.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
And there is only a few
percentage of phosphorous atoms

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
doped into this silicon
semiconductor.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
And the phosphorus,
what happens is it goes in

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
there.
It has an extra electron.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
It wants to give it up so that
it can have just an octet and

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
form these four bonds to the
four silicons.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
And when it gives up that
electron, the electron goes out

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
and that forms a positive charge
that is localized and fixed on

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
the phosphorous center in the
structure.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And so, we can represent that
as follows.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Where we have a phosphorus
state that we had chosen

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
appropriately in energy to go
ahead and give up that electron,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
it gives up the electron to the
lowest unoccupied orbitals in

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
the system, which is the bottom
part of your conduction band.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
This electron jumps up off the
phosphorus and into the

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
conduction band,
and that leaves behind a hole.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
So you have a hole or a
positive charge,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
there, fixed in position.
And now you can have electron

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
transport as your mechanism of
conductivity,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
up in the conduction band.
It is really,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
I think, quite fascinating to
think about the way in which the

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
concept of the octet rule and
our understanding of bonding in

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
tetrahedral centers can actually
lead us to understand the

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
mechanism of conductivity in
solid materials that are either

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
n-doped or p-doped.
Here, it is quite clear.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
And then, finally,
I just want to take you through

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000
the way in which you can put the
positive and negative doped

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
materials together to create a
device like a light-emitting

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
diode.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
LED materials,
these are obviously great

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
things because you can generate
light with a lot more efficiency

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
in terms of energy than you can
with incandescent bulbs.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
You can get them in all
different colors.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
These are finding application
in so many different ways.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
One of the challenges that
chemists have taken on is the

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
discovery of light-emitting
diode materials that are made of

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
organic molecules,
actually, conducting organic

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
molecules that have properties
correct for giving you very

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
narrow emissions in the part of
the spectrum that you want to

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
have coming out of your
light-emitting diode material.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
So chemistry is really very
strongly involved in making

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
next-generation LED materials.
But I just want to tell you a

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
little bit about how these
things work.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
The idea is that you have these
two types of semiconductors,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
and you juxtapose them at an
interface.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Let me make the interface with
blue.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
You have a solid chunk of
material, here.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
This will be our N-type
semiconductor.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
And over here,
they have a continuous,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
possibly two dimensional
interface here in this

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
three-dimensional chunk of
material.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
And you have a P-type doped
part of the system over here.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And, in fact,
normally this would be the same

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
basic semiconductor material on
both sides of the interface.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And it would be just the doping
that changes on the left versus

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
the right.
This material might be

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
something like gallium nitride.
Now, notice that this is a 3/5

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
type of material.
And this is gallium in Group 13

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
and nitrogen in Group 15 of the
Periodic Table.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
You add three and five together
and you get eight,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
just the same number of valance
electrons you would if you had

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
silicon and silicon.
But these materials have the

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
property that they are a direct
band gap material.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
And, as direct band gap
materials, when the process that

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
we are going to talk about here
takes place at the interface,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
then out of this interface
comes the light.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
And if your semiconductor
material is an indirect band gap

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
material like silicone is,
then that is not the case.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
And that has to do with the
solid state physics of

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
electronically,
where is the conduction band

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
located relative to that valance
band?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Has it shifted horizontally in
solid physics-speak relative to

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
the valance band?
That's what makes a

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
semiconductor an indirect band
gap material.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
If the conduction band is
vertically situated above the

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
valance band,
then you get a direct band

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
material.
And so solid state chemists are

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
interested in designing new
materials that have a direct

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
band gap and that can release
light when this process takes

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
place at the interface.
And on both sides,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
I just want to sketch the band
structure for the materials.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
And I mean the gap,
actually, to be the same on

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
both sides here.
And the difference is what we

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
have doped it with.
In the case of the negative

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
material, we have an electron up
here in the conduction band that

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
came in with,
for example,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
our phosphorus atom and left
behind a hole there that is

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
fixed in space.
And down here we have our

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
valance band all full.
Over here similar,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
except our material starts out
with a hole down there because

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
the electron has jumped up onto
the doped atom and become fixed

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
in space as a negative charge.
And that left behind a hole in

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
the valance band down there like
that.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
What you have is your N-doped
material here on the left,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
your P-doped material on the
right.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
And, of course,
what do you do then?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
You attach leads so that you
can connect it to a potential

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
difference.
And, when you do that,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
you want your anode to be over
here, so that the electrons can

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
flow that way up to the N part
of the device.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And then electrons can flow
this way, which means,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
of course, that holes go that
way.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
And here is your cathode.
And so you can think of putting

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
on your potential difference in
a system like this.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.000
And that has the effect of
ripping electrons out over here.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
And, if you rip an electron
out, let's say you take that

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
negative charge back off of that
boron atom, you pull an electron

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
out to go ahead and reduce
something down here in solution,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
if you are using a battery for
this sort of process,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
well, then another electron can
jump up here to take its place.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
But you are building up a
potential, here.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
And so, what happens?
The highest lying electron in

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
the system over here in the
N-type semiconductor is sitting

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
there right at the junction
right next to where electrons

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
are needed.
It jumps across.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Electrons flow downhill,
here.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
And you can look at it like
this, electrons flow down there,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
across the interface.
And when you hook this LED up

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
to your potential difference
supply, the electron flow is

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
unidirectional.
As the electrons jump across

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
the interface,
they are going from the

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
conduction band of the N-type
semiconductor,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
they are going down in here,
holes are being created,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
maybe electrons are being
pulled right off of that boron,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
and they are moving right
across here in a process that

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000
leads to the emission of light
right at the interface.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
It is like a waterfall of
electrons taking place all along

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
this 2D interface.
Electrons are just moving

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
across this interface and
dropping down in energy.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
As they drop down in energy,
a photon that is the energy of

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
this energy difference between
the gap of this material,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
those photons are released for
each electron that transits this

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
barrier.
And that is the principle of an

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
LED.
And I hope you are enjoying

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
seeing this connection between
molecular orbital theory for

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
molecules being taken all the
way to solid state physics.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Have a nice weekend and we will
see you on Monday.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.800
So I will begin
with phase shifts

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.920
and do the introduction of how
to make sure we can really--

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.450
so this is the
important part of this.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.050
Just like when we added the
reflected and transmitted wave

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.570
we could find the
solution I'm going

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.760
to try to explain
why with this things

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.740
we can find
solutions in general.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.840
So this is the subject
of partial waves,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.130
and it's a nice subject,
a little technical.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.480
There might seem to be
a lot of formulas here,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.590
but the ideas are relatively
simple once one keeps in mind

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.020
the one dimensional analogies.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.950
The one dimensional analogies
are very valuable here,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.269
and we will
emphasize them a lot.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.640
So we will discuss partial
waves and face shifts.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.635
So it's time to simplify
this matters a little bit.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.550
And to do that I
will assume from now

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:55.830
on that the potential is central
so v of r is equal to v of r.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.330
That will simplify the
azimuthal dependence.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.510
There will be no
azimuthal dependencies.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.210
You see, the thing is
spherical is symmetric,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.680
but still you're coming from
a particular direction, the z.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.520
So you can expect now that
the scatter wave depends

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.540
on the angle of the
particle with respect

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.610
to z because it's
spherically symmetrical.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.790
But it shouldn't depend
on five, the angle five,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.160
should just depend on theta.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.710
So expect f of theta.

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:45.430
Now, a free particle
is something

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.380
we all know how to
solve, e to the ikx.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.390
Why do we bother with the
free particle in so many ways?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.900
Because free particle
is very important.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.810
Part of the solution
is free particles.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.470
To some degree far away it
is free particles as well.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.800
And we need to
understand free particles

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.540
in spherical coordinates.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.360
So it's something we've done
in 805 and sometimes in 804,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.570
and we look at the
radial equation which

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.330
is associated to
spherical coordinates

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.770
for a free particle.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.400
So we'll consider free
particle and we'd say, well,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.040
that's very simple
but it's not all that

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.250
simple in spherical
coordinates, and you'd say, OK,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.530
if it's not simple, it's
spherical coordinates,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.020
why do we bother?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.250
We bother because
scattering is happening

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.450
in spherical coordinates.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.040
So we can't escape having
to do the free particle

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.140
in spherical coordinates.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.670
It is something you have to do.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.550
So what are solutions in
spherical coordinates?

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.940
We'll have solution SI of r.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.280
Remember the language
with coordinates

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:11.710
was a U of r divided by
r and of Ylm of omega.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.540
That was a typical solution, a
single solution of the showing

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.550
our equation will--

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:26.080
the U only depends on l, the
m disappears, so this is r.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.250
This r's are r's without the
vector because you're already

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.150
talking about the
radial equations,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.690
and depend on the
energy and depend

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.040
on the value of the
l quantum number.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.920
So what is the
Schrodinger equation?

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.060
The radial equation is
minus h squared over 2m,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.220
the second the r squared plus.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.660
h squared over 2m l times
l plus 1 over r squared.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.750
Remember the potential
centrifugal barrier

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.950
in the effective potential,
then you would have v of r here,

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.960
but it's free particle,
so v of r is equal to 0.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.305
So if nothing else,
U of El of little r

00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:22.820
is equal to the
energy, which is h

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.290
squared k squared over 2m UEl.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.720
And that's a
parliamentary session

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:40.040
of the energy in terms of
the k squared, like that.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.370
Well, there's lots of
h squared, k squared,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.150
and 2m's, so we can
get rid of them.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.310
Cancel the h squared over 2m.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.640
You get minus d second
dr squared plus l times l

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.270
plus 1 over r.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:10.170
UEl is equal to k squared UEl.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.130
It's a nice equation.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.860
It's the equation
of the free particle

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.770
in spherical coordinates.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.140
Now, this is like the
Schrodinger equation.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:39.110
And I think when you look at
that you could get puzzled

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.280
whether or not the value
of k squared or the energy

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.020
might end up being quantized.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.420
With the Schrodinger
equation many times

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.170
quantized is the energy, but
here it shouldn't happen.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.420
This is a free particle.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.040
All values of k
should be allowed,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.970
so there should be
no quantization.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.800
This is an r squared here.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.380
You can see one reason,
at least analytically,

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.750
that there is no quantization
is that you can define

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.360
a new variable row
equal kr and then

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.700
this whole differential
equation becomes

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:33.200
minus the second the row
squared plus l times l

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.030
plus 1 over row squared.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.180
Well, I can put the other
number in there as well,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.120
or should I not?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.780
No, it's not done here.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:58.880
UEl is equal to UEl, and the k
squared disappeared completely.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.120
That tells you that the case
will kind of get quantized.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.340
If there is a solution of
this differential equation

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.500
it holds for all values of k.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.960
And these are going to
be like plane waves,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.180
and maybe that's
another reason you

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.030
can think that k
doesn't get quantized

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.500
because these solutions are
not normalizable anyway,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.160
so it shouldn't get quantized.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:34.049
So with this equation in here
we get the two main solutions.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.630
The solutions of this
differential equation

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.299
are vessel functions,
spherical vessel functions.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:50.940
UEl is equal to a constant
Al times row times the vessel

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:57.710
function lowercase j of row.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.840
There's a row times
that function.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.350
That's the way it shows up.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.770
It's kind of interesting.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.440
It's because in fact you
have to divide U by r,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.980
so that would mean
dividing U by row,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.100
and it means that the radial
function is just the vessel

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.890
function without anything else.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.980
And then there's the
other vessel function,

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:30.790
the n of l a row times
of n of l of row.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.110
So those are spherical
vessel functions.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.250
As you're familiar
from the notation

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.490
that j is the one that
this healthy at row

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:49.020
equals 0 doesn't diverge
the n is the solution

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.440
that diverges at the origin.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.690
And both of them
behave nicely far away.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:11.850
So Jl of x goes like 1 over x
sine of x minus l pi over 2,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:17.250
and ADA l of x
behaves like minus 1

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:25.060
over x cosine of x
minus l pi over 2.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:32.220
This is for x big, x
much greater than 1,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.195
you have this behavior.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.610
So these are our
solutions, and here is

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.790
the thing that we have to do.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:56.520
We have to rewrite our solutions
in terms of spherical waves

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.020
because this was the spherical
wave so we should even write

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.060
this part as a spherical wave.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.160
And this is a very
interesting and in some way

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:15.840
strange representation of E to
the ikz You have E to the ikz

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.270
that you have an
intuition for it

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.710
as a plane wave
in the z direction

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:26.250
represent it as an infinite
sum of incoming and outgoing

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.610
spherical waves.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.860
That's what's going to happen.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.515
So this is the last
thing we need do here.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:55.690
We have that e to the ikz
is a plane wave solution,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.510
so it's a solution
of a free particle,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.970
so I should be able to write the
superpositions of the solutions

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.460
that we have found.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:16.370
So it should be a superposition
of solutions of this type.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:28.000
So it could be a sum of
coefficients al times,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:37.700
well, alm you think of
some a's times solutions.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.130
Remember, we're writing
a full solution,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.140
so a full solution
you divide by r.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.370
So you divide by this quantity.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:54.160
So you could have
an alm Jl of row

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:01.270
plus Blm ATA l of row times Ylm.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.240
So this should be
a general solution,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.060
and that would be a sum
over l's and m's of all

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.130
those quantities.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.400
But that's a lot more
than what you need.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:24.270
First, this does not
diverge near r equals 0.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:30.460
It has no divergence anywhere
and the ATAs or the n's, I

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.530
think they're n such and not
ATAs, the n's diverge for row

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.360
equal to 0.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:42.600
So none of this are necessary,
so I can erase those.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.600
l and m.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.920
But there is more.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.630
This function is
invariant and there

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.120
are some beautiful rotations.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.950
If you have your axis
here, here's the z,

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.130
and you have a point here and
you rotate that the value of z

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.090
doesn't change.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.210
It's independent of
phi for a given theta,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.110
z just depends on
r of cosine theta.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.860
So there's no phi dependence
but all the Ylm's with m

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.220
difference from 0
have phi dependent.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.040
So m cannot be here either.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.640
m must be 0.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.950
So you must be
down to sum over l,

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:41.450
al some coefficient,
Jl of row, Yl0.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:53.960
And all of those would be
perfectly good plane wave

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.820
solutions.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.820
Whatever numbers you
choose for the little al's,

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.540
those are good solutions
because we've build them

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.770
by taking linear combinations
of exact solutions

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.960
of this equation.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.060
But to represent this
quantity the al's

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.160
must take particular values.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.770
So what is that formula?

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:24.140
That formula is quite
famous, and perhaps even you

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.310
could discuss this
in recitation.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:36.770
e to the ikz, which is e
to the ikr cosine theta,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.490
is the sum 4 pi.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.070
Now you have to get all
the constants right.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.700
Square root of 4 pi,
sum from l equals 0

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:52.430
to infinity, square
root of 2l plus 1.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.070
Coefficients are pretty funny.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.500
They get worse very fast.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:10.780
Now you have of i to the
I, i to the l, Yl0 of theta

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:14.810
doesn't depend on phi, Jl of kr.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.880
This is the expansion
that we need.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.470
There's no way we can make
problems with this problem

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.500
unless we have this expansion.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.240
But now if Y the intuition
that I was telling you

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.270
of these waves
coming in and out,

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:42.370
well, you have e to the
ikz, you sum an infinite sum

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.620
over partial waves.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.400
A partial wave is a
different value of l.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.960
These are partial waves.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.730
As I was saying, any solution
is a sum of partial waves

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.530
is a sum over l.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.120
And where are the waves?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:10.569
Well, the Jl of kr far away
is a sine, and the sine of x

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:17.050
is an exponential ix minus
e to the minus ix over 2.

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.250
So here you have
exponentials of e to the ikr

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.849
and exponentials of
e to the minus ikr,

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:31.060
which are waves that are
here like outgoing waves

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.360
and incoming waves.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:38.080
So the E to the ikz's are sum of
ingoing and outgoing spherical

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.740
waves.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.790
And that's an intuition that
we will exploit very clearly

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.920
to solve this problem.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.580
So we will do that next.

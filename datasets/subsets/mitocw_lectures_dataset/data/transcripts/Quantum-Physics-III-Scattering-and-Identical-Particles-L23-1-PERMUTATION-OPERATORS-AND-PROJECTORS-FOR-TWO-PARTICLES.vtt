00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.170
PROFESSOR: So I'm going to do
today this identical particles.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.330
We'll continue with
identical particles.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.020
We'll get almost to the
resolution of the issue

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.330
of exchange degeneracy.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.970
In order to do this
identical particles properly,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.810
you have to do a bit of
group theory or understanding

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.090
what permutation
operators are well.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.470
So it allows you to think about
these matters more clearly.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.110
So that's what we
have to do today.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.020
So let me review.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.480
So we were doing
identical particles.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.130
And we spoke of
exchange degeneracy.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.500
We had, say, for the
state of two spins--

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.480
identical spins-- we said could
be represented by this state

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.300
or by this state in which
you exchange the pluses

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.925
and minuses.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.150
So the problem of
exchange degeneracy

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.520
is that, for
identical particles,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.190
you would almost say that these
two states are equivalent.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.030
One particle is in plus
1 particle, is in minus.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.240
They're identical.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.910
So you cannot tell whether
it's the first or the second.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.770
So you would say these
two states are equivalent.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.450
But we saw that that
leads to a contradiction.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.630
If these two states
are equivalent,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.140
any linear superposition of
them should be equivalent.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.320
And then when we
ask the question

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.500
of the probability of
finding these states

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.630
in a particular state that was
along the x direction-- both

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.480
spins along the x
direction-- we found

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.620
that it depended on what linear
combination you took here.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.220
So it's just not consistent
with the principles

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.860
of quantum mechanics
to say that these two

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.990
states are equivalent.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.570
So they're not.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.590
And we better understand how
we can solve this problem.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.750
Now, I think the solution, in
a sense, you've heard before.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.230
And you know how
you're supposed to work

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.700
with identical particles.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.110
But I think going
through this in detail

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.540
and seeing what is the structure
of operators and Hilbert spaces

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.820
that leads to that
solution or why

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.820
that solution is the unique
solution to this problem,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.250
it's interesting.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.660
So we begin with
permutation operators.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.760
Operators.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.980
So we consider a
two-particle system.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.750
We'll begin with two particles.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.290
And then we'll eventually
generalize to n particles.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.930
We'll do everything for
two particles first.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.320
So the particles, they will
live on a vector space, V,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:30.420
each one so that the set of two
particles lives on V tensor V.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.080
So each particle has a
set of possible states

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.860
that are the vectors in V.
And the two particles have

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.410
a set of possible states that
are the vectors in V tensor V.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.700
Now, for the moment, whether
they're identical or not

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.545
identical will play no role.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:53.220
It will play no role
throughout this lecture,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.860
where we understand those
operators in Hilbert spaces.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.600
So it will not matter.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.230
So the particles may
be distinguishable,

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.420
may not be distinguishable.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:16.829
And we will write states here
in V tensor V, based as states,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.255
for example, as ui1 tensor u2--

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.750
I'm sorry, uj2.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.240
So with little i and
little j, they're

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.450
noting different integers.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.760
Those are different
basis vectors.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.460
And this is a set of basis
vectors in V tensor V--

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:53.630
so basis vectors
for all i and j.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.350
Now, sometimes we
get a little lazy,

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.560
and we stop writing the 1 and 2.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.710
And we write it as ui tensor uj.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.160
Or even we can get more
lazy and just write ui uj.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.950
So if we do that, you
should know you really

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.070
mean this whole thing.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.470
So is a permutation operator?

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.140
It's a linear operator that does
some funny thing on the state.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.610
So let's look into it.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.590
So a permutation operator, P2,1
That's a name I will give it.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:54.880
P2,1 is a linear operator
acting on the space V tensor V--

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.010
so linear operator.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.500
And this is called the
permutation operator.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.630
So to know what this
permutation operator is,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.740
you need to know how it
acts on a basis state.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:16.510
So let's put one of these
basis states, ui1 tensor uj2.

00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:25.720
And this permutation
operator, you just

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.420
need to know how it
acts in the basis state.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.370
That's the safest way
always to know that you

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.050
have a linear operator.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.010
If you know how it
acts on a basis state,

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.290
then on any sum of basis states,
you know, because it's linear.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.750
On the other hand, if
somebody tells you,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.090
this operator does
this to all vectors--

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.060
something-- maybe it's
not a linear operator.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.220
It may be a more
complicated thing.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.630
So here, what it
will do, it will

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.400
put the state that was
in 2 in position 1,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.350
and put the state that
was in 1 in position 2.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:16.210
So it will take
you j1 tensor ui2.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.640
So the state in 2--

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.550
this first thing that
says that the state in 2--

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.800
should be put in position 1.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.400
So the j label--

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.320
it was uj.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.630
Now it's in position 1.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.350
And the state that was in
1 should go to position 2.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.050
The one thing we never
do is flip these things.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.890
The first particle goes
before the second particle.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.810
That's our order of things.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.390
But the state has moved.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.890
OK.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:56.420
So this is the prescription
of what this does.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.920
And then you realize
already one property--

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:07.540
that P2,1, if you let
it act twice in a state,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.380
it will flip the
ij the first time.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.240
And it will flip them
again the second time.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.910
So this is the unit operator.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.860
So it's inverse.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.170
So that's a nice thing.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.490
Now, perhaps a
little less obvious,

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:38.059
but kind of still simple,
is that P2,1 is Hermition.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.640
How do you check that an
operator is Hermition?

00:08:51.640 --> 00:09:01.470
An operator, M, is hermission if
you have, for example, M alpha

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.880
beta is equal to alpha and beta.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.080
The M operator moves
from this position

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.950
to the other with an M dagger.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.840
But if M is Hermition,
it will work like that.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.130
So let's try this with
the operator P2,1.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:29.460
So we'll try a P2,1
on the state alpha,

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.890
and then [INAUDIBLE]
with a state beta.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.840
So we need a number of letters.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.030
So let's do it here.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:51.180
P2,1 on a state alpha,
which will be ui1 uj2,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:58.130
[INAUDIBLE] with a
state beta uk1 ul2.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.050
OK.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.180
Here it is.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.300
P2,1 acting on
some state, alpha,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.410
[INAUDIBLE] with a state beta.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.640
We'll evaluate it.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.630
Well, we can never write
it quickly, I think.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.770
This flips the j and
i so the j is now

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.230
on the first particle and the
case in the first particle.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:28.250
So the inner product, assuming
this is an orthonormal basis,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.560
is just delta jk.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:40.830
And here, this operator moves
the i label to position 2.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.110
And here you have
an l in position 2.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.050
Therefore, it's a delta il.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:57.305
On the other hand, we can
calculate this ui1 uj2,

00:10:57.305 --> 00:11:05.730
and now put the P2,1
operator here between the uk1

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.305
and the ul2.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.650
This time you flip the k
and l, so the l ends up

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.455
being the first Hilbert
space, where there's an i.

00:11:21.455 --> 00:11:26.410
So you get delta li.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.720
And the key, ends up
in the second Hilbert

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.100
space, where you have a j here.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.990
So you have a j with a k.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.680
And these two are the same.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.730
And intuition-- of course, I've
written all these equations.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.880
But intuition is, if you
have an inner product--

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.210
this chronicle delta sign--
you exchange two here.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.950
The result is the same as
if you exchange two here.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.700
It will do the same thing.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.760
So it's a Hermitian operator.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.360
So operator P2,1 is Hermitian.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:18.320
That means that the
relation P2,1 P2,1 equal 1.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.330
Since this is Hermitian--

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.210
this P2,1 dagger--

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.950
P2,1 equal 1.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.450
So we learn that also
the operator is unitary.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.840
P2,1 is unitary.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.320
That's nice, because
that means that could

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.230
be a symmetry in
quantum mechanics.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.060
Operators in quantum
mechanics that

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.990
preserve the norm of
states can be symmetries.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.580
And P2,1 is unitary.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.080
OK.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.040
So we have our operator P2,1.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.690
Let's do things with it.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.920
So we can define two
things with P2,1.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:23.520
Define this operator, S,
which will be 1/2 1 plus P2,1,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:32.930
and the operator, A,
which is 1/2 1 minus P2,1.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.780
And here comes the claim.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:42.236
These two operators are
orthogonal projectors.

00:13:42.236 --> 00:13:44.150
They're orthogonal projectors.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.520
Projectors.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.555
So let's review what that means.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:12.800
So basically, let me
say what it means.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.020
An operator is an
orthogonal projector.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.160
The test is that the operator
squared is equal to itself.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.710
That's the name of a projector.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.880
And the other thing is
that it must be Hermitian.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.400
These two things must
happen for something

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.330
to be an orthogonal projector.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.580
Basically, what does it mean
to be an orthogonal projector?

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:44.180
It's an operator that
projects to some space.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.030
So an operator has
a set of states

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.930
that are in its image in
the range of the operator.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.420
That's what it projects into.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.670
And it has a null space--

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.730
the things that are
killed by the projector.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.700
A projector has precisely
that kind of thing.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.310
So the thing that makes it an
orthogonal projector is that

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.270
the range of the projector--
the vectors that you get--

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.790
are orthogonal to
the vectors that

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.650
are killed by the projector.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.310
The whole vector space
splits into two parts--

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:27.340
what do you get from the
projector and the rest.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.210
And the rest is things that
are killed by the projector.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.070
And they're orthogonal to it.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.590
So let me say it here.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:50.540
A projector P sub U to U
subset of V is orthogonal--

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.900
so this is 805 type stuff--

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:58.040
if the vector space
can be written

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.680
as the null space of PU.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:18.880
Plus the range of
PU with null or PU

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.653
perpendicular, or
orthogonal, to range of PU.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:35.870
So this is the definition
of an orthogonal projector.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.260
And here is, of
course, a simple claim.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:56.370
A Hermitian operator, P such
that P squared is equal to P,

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.610
is an orthogonal projector.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.900
Projector.

00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:07.890
OK.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:14.240
So that's second claim.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.069
So let's see again.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:19.339
What we want to show is
that these are projectors,

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.330
and they're
orthogonal projectors.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.240
And this is what it means.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.570
But practically speaking,
all we have to do

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.930
is check that this
operator satisfies

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.250
this and our Hermitian.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.730
That's all you need to do.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:42.350
Let me explain why
this is the case.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.070
So whenever you have--

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.620
let's do a little proof.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.740
So if you have a
vector, a vector

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:57.260
can be written as the projector
times the vector plus 1

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.215
minus the projector
acting on the vector.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.830
This-- the projector
on the vector--

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:14.595
is in the range of P,
because the range of P

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:23.380
are the vectors obtained
by acting with P. Moreover,

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:29.530
this is in the null of P. Why?

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.170
Because P kills these vectors.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.530
How do you check that?

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:38.950
P, acting on that vector--

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:46.930
P with this is P. But P squared
is equal to P. So you get 0.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.940
So here it is.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:56.290
The vector space decomposes into
the range of P plus the null

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:03.340
of P. So that's the first claim
for a orthogonal projector.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.370
The second claim is that
these are orthogonal.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:10.510
So if I take PV--

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:14.650
something in the range of P--

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:20.290
and 1 minus PV tilde--

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:25.330
something in the
null space of P--

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.930
this should be orthogonal.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.660
And this is clear,
because I can move now

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.220
this operator to the other side.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:43.600
And it will be V P
dagger 1 minus P V tilde.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.780
And since P is Hermitian--
that's where you use that P is

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.620
Hermitian--

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:56.600
this is V P1 minus P V tilde.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.720
And that's equal to 0, because
P times 1 minus P already is 0.

00:20:04.306 --> 00:20:07.600
So OK.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.580
These are our conditions.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.190
Orthogonal projectors
are very nice.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:23.560
These are the
really good things.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:29.470
You have a projector that
decomposes into two parts,

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.930
just by having P
squared equal P.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:36.370
But to have orthogonal, you
need that they'd be Hermitian.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:41.680
So what is our situation
with those operators?

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.115
They are Hermitian.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:57.460
So S and A are Hermitian,
because one is Hermitian,

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.600
and P2,1 is Hermitian.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.750
So the operators are Hermitian.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:09.220
And they are projectors,
because, well, you check them.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.780
You multiply them by themselves.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.170
So we can do the two
of them simultaneously.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.940
This is with a plus sign.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.260
That's S. With a
minus sign, it's A.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.940
So we need to show that
S squared is equal to S

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:31.915
and A squared is equal to A.
So here we have both cases.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:45.020
So the product is 1/4,
then plus minus 2 P2,1,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.860
and then the product of these
operators with themselves.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.390
Plus minus and plus minus
always gives you a plus.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:59.860
And P2,1 times P2,1, we
showed that that's equal to 1.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.770
So happily, this
1 and 1 give a 2.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.760
There's another 2.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:09.850
Divides here-- this is
1/2 1 plus minus P2,1.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:14.530
So that's what we wanted
to show with a top sign,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:19.050
S times S is equal to
S, with a bottom sign,

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.240
A times A is equal to A.

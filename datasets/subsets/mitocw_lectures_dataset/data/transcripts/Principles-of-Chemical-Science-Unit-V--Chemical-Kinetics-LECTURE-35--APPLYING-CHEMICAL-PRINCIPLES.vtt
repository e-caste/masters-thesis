00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.970
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So if we
switch to today's lecture

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.910
notes, we're going to
talk today about applying

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.700
some of the chemistry knowledge,
with clicker questions

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.880
and a clicker
championship, to the issue

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.200
of using CO2 to make biofuels.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.980
So first I just want
to briefly review

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.440
the course objectives, what I
was hoping people would get out

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.170
of this course.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.379
So I was hoping that you
would know enough chemistry,

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.920
have enough basic
chemistry knowledge

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.586
to do a UROP in the
Chemistry Department

00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:00.700
without taking any other
chemistry classes; that in UROP

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.790
positions in other departments
you would be using chemistry

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.090
in your research; that you could
also appreciate how chemistry

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.550
is used to solve real world
problems like we're talking

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.980
about today, make
informed decisions

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.480
about your own health,
the health of your family,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.250
environmental issues,
energy issues, a lot

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.860
of political decisions
that are going on-- there's

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.590
a lot of science actually
in the news these days;

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.580
and hopefully, make
the world a better

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.770
place by applying chemical
principles to problems

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.330
in science and engineering.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.840
So those are my goals.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.320
And then if we just kind
of look at the material

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.370
that we've covered.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.520
The first half of
the course, which

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.810
will be Exam One,
Exam Two material--

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.650
talked about the
basic properties

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.860
of matter, atomic theory,
periodic table, bonding

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.510
structures of molecules.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.480
And then thermodynamics
kind of transitioned us

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.490
from thinking about
basic properties

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.340
to thinking more
about reactivity

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.490
and how that material
that we learned

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.950
about in the first half,
how those elements could

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.260
come together and react
to form molecules.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.910
And to think about
how things react,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.493
we usually think
about thermodynamics.

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:10.389
We need to think about chemical
equilibrium, acid base,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.440
oxidation, and sometimes,
transition metals,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.160
because they are-- that middle
part of the periodic table

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.950
can do amazing chemistry-- and
also kinetics and solubility.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.600
So all of these things are
about how material reacts.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.940
So we can't review everything.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.810
But I thought we would stick
with this sort of carbon

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.162
dioxide biofuels theme.

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:35.620
And see how some of the things
we've learned in this course

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.699
would help us
understand how we could

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.240
approach this problem,
how people are

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.070
trying to solve this problem.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.610
So what is the problem again?

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.310
And Jingnan brought this
up, CO2 is a waste product

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.070
of combustion of fossil fuels.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.230
We want to remove it
from our environment.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.470
It's a greenhouse gas.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.620
It's also leading to the
acidification of the oceans.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.120
This is not a molecule
we want around

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.470
in the kind of quantities
that it is around.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.220
And I am personally very
concerned about climate change.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.940
And after those of you who
are freshman experience

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.790
this winter, I think you
will also be very concerned

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.230
about climate change.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.820
So this is a problem.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.010
What is the approach?

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.460
Well, the idea, I
think, is really great--

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.180
that you can take CO2 and
not just get rid of it,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.200
but convert it into
something we want,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.800
which is alternative
fuels, like biofuels.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.740
So I think this is a
really great thing.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.430
So there are a few ways
that one could do it.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.340
You could think about designing
small molecule catalysts

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.180
to do this.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.740
This is one thing
people are doing.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.660
But there's really
been a lot of energy

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.290
on looking at how
nature does things.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.030
So a lot of people are
interested in nature,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.380
thinking about biological
pathways that already do this.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.560
They already remove CO2 from
our environment and fix it.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.390
Form carbon carbon
bonds and make it

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.170
into multicarbon chains that
can be used as biofuels.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.170
So but before we do any of
this, before we can go and think

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.380
about any of these
solutions, we need

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.090
to understand the basic
properties of CO2,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.790
it's reactivity, and more
about these pathways.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.180
So let's talk about
carbon dioxide,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.750
and let's think about how carbon
and oxygen are bonded together.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.720
And we can use Lewis
structures to predict

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.160
what the Lewis structure
of this should be,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.540
what the bonding will be.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.830
So let's go ahead with our
first, our clicker question,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.894
and predict which
of these, and we

00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:34.560
have a little bit of
the periodic table,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.525
is the correct Lewis
structure for CO2.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.280
OK.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.060
10 more seconds.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.970
All right.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.540
So we're going to
go through and just

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.623
look at what's wrong with
some of these structures

00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:18.320
as a review.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.220
But first, can someone tell
me for a t-shirt, what is

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.960
the equation for formal charge?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.665
And Alaina will
bring you the mic.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.660
AUDIENCE: One half
the number of bonds

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.149
that are going on plus the
number of loan pair electrons.

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:42.190
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Right.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.540
So I think we're missing one
thing-- so formal charge,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.940
or maybe I didn't hear it.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.820
We have the number of valence
electrons that we have,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.415
which for carbon was what?

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.350
Four.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.970
So for carbon was four, and
for oxygen is six, right.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.240
So minus the number of lone pair
and then half of the bonding

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.620
electrons.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.680
So this is how we're
going to do this.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.490
The first structure has
zero formal charges.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.380
It's good.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.950
And that is, in fact,
the correct structure.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.770
The second structure
here, if we do it out

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:31.640
we have oxygen in the middle
and we have carbon on the end.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.810
And here we should have a
formal charge of minus 2

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.310
on that carbon and plus
2 on the middle oxygen.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.130
So it's not good, because it
has charges, which is not good.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.840
But it's also not good
because the negative charge

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.780
should be on what type of atom?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.710
A more electronegative,
so that's not true here.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.000
So that structure is not good
for a variety of reasons.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.370
OK, so if we look at
the next structure,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.610
we have six valence electrons
around one of the oxygens.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.600
We have two bonds to
carbon and two lone pairs.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.430
And we have-- oh,
actually we have the six

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.190
around the other one as well.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.630
So first off, if
you counted, there's

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.160
more valence electrons
used here than you had.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.780
So that's not good.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.570
And if you look at the
charges, it's minus 1, minus 2,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.070
and minus 1.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.570
So that's a lot of
charge, but also,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.950
what else is wrong with that?

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.920
It should add up to
0, which it does not.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.350
And it doesn't add
up to 0, because I

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.440
put extra valence electrons
in there that do not exist.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.920
So this structure is bad
for a lot of reasons.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.020
Also the higher
negative charge is not

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.760
on the most
electronegative atom.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.630
So this has many
things wrong with it.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.870
So then if we looked
at number four--

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.130
so we have an oxygen
with six around it,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.930
a carbon that has
two lone pairs double

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.290
bonded to an oxygen
with two lone pairs.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.380
And this has minus
1 and also minus 1.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.720
So again charges don't add up.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.330
It has the wrong number
of valence electrons.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.790
So that's bad.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:33.309
And then the last one-- we have
an oxygen with six lone pair

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:38.490
electrons, a carbon with three
bonds, no lone pair electrons,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.539
and an oxygen with
two double bonds,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.270
two loan pair electrons,
minus 1, plus 1.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.300
So this is not zero like
that one is up there.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.280
But also something
else is wrong.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.092
What else is wrong
with that structure?

00:08:53.092 --> 00:08:54.300
What's wrong with the carbon?

00:08:58.024 --> 00:09:00.980
AUDIENCE: Doesn't add up to 8.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.600
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Right,
so it has an complete octet.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.200
And so sometimes you can
have an incomplete octet.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.730
Does anybody remember what
two elements we mentioned

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.395
are happy with an
incomplete octet?

00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:15.430
AUDIENCE: Boron.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.960
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Boron
and aluminum, right.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.230
And then some of them are
happy with an expanded

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.700
octet, but to be
expanded you have

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.000
to have an n number of what?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.380
Three or above.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.460
So carbon does not want
to have a deficient octet

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.200
or an expanded octet.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.860
So many of these other ones
had a lot of things wrong.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.069
And so this is something that
could be useful to review.

00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:44.360
And again, Lewis structure
is one thing that people go,

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.609
oh, yeah, I know how to do it.

00:09:45.609 --> 00:09:48.560
But it's good to review the
rules right before an exam.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.870
OK, so here with our
correct Lewis structure.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.740
And that Lewis
structure stood well.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.780
That's a good structure.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.130
OK, so now that we know
the Lewis structure,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.700
we can think about the
geometry of the molecule, what

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.100
its angles are, what
it looks like in 3D.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.110
And we can use our friend, the
Valence Shell Electron Pair

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.060
Repulsion theory and
Valence Bond Theory

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.765
to predict things
about this structure.

00:10:18.765 --> 00:10:21.140
So why don't you tell me which
ones of these are correct?

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:34.462
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:10:34.462 --> 00:10:35.670
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.559
10 more seconds.

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:51.640
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.440
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right?

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.220
OK, so let's take
a look at that.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.080
So valence shell electron
pair repulsion theory--

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.800
the AX, no AXE nomenclature.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.630
So X is the number of atoms
bonded, and there are two here.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.500
So it's AX2.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.660
If there had been lone
pairs, which they're not

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.230
on the carbon, we
would have added an E

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.070
to indicate the lone pair.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.620
And AX2 molecules are linear.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.685
So here we have our
carbon monoxide.

00:11:23.685 --> 00:11:25.190
It just has a single bond.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.010
This model kit doesn't
have double bonds,

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.930
but we have a linear
molecule there.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.290
And again valence shell
theory is really just

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.300
about minimizing the
repulsion between things.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.850
So the atoms, and
especially those lone pairs

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.470
that really take
up a lot of room,

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.930
try to position themselves
around the central atom

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.250
so it's the least repulsive.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.660
So in valence bond theory leads
to the idea of hybrid orbitals.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.830
This idea that the
valence electrons

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.910
are available for bonding.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.367
And that you're not really
just having s orbitals

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:00.950
and p orbitals
separate, you're really

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.540
forming these hybrid
orbitals, which

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.680
tell you about the geometry
around individual atoms.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.020
So the number of
hybrid orbitals is

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.780
the number of bonded atoms
and the number of lone pairs.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.460
So carbon has two bonded atoms.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.476
So it's sp, and n
equals 2, so it's 2sp.

00:12:19.476 --> 00:12:23.260
And oxygen has one atom
and two lone pairs.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.790
Again the number of bonds
doesn't matter here.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:31.120
So it has one plus two or
three, so its sp2 and again

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.290
n equals 2.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.670
So 2sp2.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.339
And then we can also have
questions about the geometries,

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:39.130
what are the angles
for the different types

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.430
of hybridization?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.240
So this really gets at what
the geometry at every atom

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.500
is like, whereas
the vesper is really

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.920
thinking about the overall
shape of the molecule

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.660
around the central
atom and not so much

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.080
about the individual atoms.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.330
All right, and
remember that if we

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.510
have a singly-bonded terminal
atom, it's not hybridized.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.550
But this is not singly-bonded.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:12.960
OK, so now we can
also ask what is

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.690
the polarity of this
molecule, and that's

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.890
one more clicker question.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.763
All right 10 more seconds.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.920
All right.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.794
So if the polar bear
t-shirt had won,

00:13:49.794 --> 00:13:50.960
it would have given it away.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.730
But it didn't matter,
you still remembered.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.280
So, yeah, it does
have polar bonds.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.050
Electronegativity
difference greater than 0.4

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.510
does make it a polar
bond, but because it is

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.510
linear there's no net dipole.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:09.350
So the polar bond-- this
cancels each other out

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.150
with this linear geometry.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.650
Great.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.620
So non-polar molecule, even
though it has polar bonds.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.270
So it's not just
about the property

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.550
of the bonds that's important.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.540
It's also about the overall
shape of the molecule.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:30.730
OK, so we have looked at some
of the basic properties of CO2

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.400
now, which is the top part.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.100
And now let's move in to think
about the reactivity of the CO2

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.310
molecule.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.870
So when we're thinking about
reactivity we want to say

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.690
is CO2 a stable or
an unstable molecule

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.640
compared to its elements?

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.580
And this is not a
clicker question.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.830
So you can just tell me.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.030
To answer this question
about stability of a molecule

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.460
compared to its
elements, what is

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.745
the thing I want to know about?

00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:04.980
Yeah, I want to know about
delta G. In particular, I

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.360
want to know about the delta G
of formation of this molecule.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.850
But if you said delta G,
that would be very good.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:17.930
So here the delta G of formation
of CO2 is a negative number.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.720
It's a fairly big
negative number

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.830
minus 394 kilojoules per mol.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.330
So is CO2 stable or unstable?

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.580
And you can just yell this out?

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.110
It's stable, right.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.090
So the way we're thinking about
this is with a delta G that's

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.680
negative, it's spontaneous
in the forward direction,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.960
which means it's not spontaneous
in the reverse direction.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:47.530
So CO2 decomposing into its
elements is not spontaneous.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.810
So that makes it
a stable molecule.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.370
All right, so let's kind of
put all these things together

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.310
about CO2 now.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:01.030
So according to the Lewis
structure, it has double bonds.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.930
And usually a double bond
means that it's harder

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.830
to disassociate a big
bond dissociation energy.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.530
And you don't need
to know these,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.650
but in case you're
interested, when

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.160
you have carbon double
bonded to oxygen,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.810
you have a bond dissociation
energy of about 805 kilojoules

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.560
per mol.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.010
And it depends a little on
the molecule in question,

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.630
but a single bond
is more like 358.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.920
And so double bond, it's
hard to disassociate that.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.900
And it's also linear,
non-polar, and stable.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.400
All right.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.520
So we want to take CO2 and
turn it into other stuff.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.630
We want to make biofuels and
solve the energy problem.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.400
But this is a non-polar
molecule, and it's very stable.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.570
It has strong bonds.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.330
This is a hard challenge.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.900
And if it were an
easy challenge,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.870
we would have figured this out.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.286
But this is not
an easy challenge.

00:16:52.286 --> 00:16:54.620
It's a hard challenge,
which is why

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.100
it is a big area of
research right now.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.480
So fixing CO2, i.e., putting
these 1 carbon units together

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.310
to make these long
chain carbons like you

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.490
saw in Jingnan's video, when she
talked about these multichain

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.720
carbons being used as biofuels.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.119
This is hard.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.280
All right, so when
things are hard,

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.720
first thing that scientists
often like to do is say,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.819
can someone solve this
problem and can we

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.374
steal an idea from them?

00:17:23.374 --> 00:17:24.540
Honestly, that's what we do.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.589
But it's OK when the people
we want to steal from

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.990
are not really people,
but Mother Nature.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.770
And so we look to
Mother Nature and we

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.640
look to some of the most
intelligent life forms I know,

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.990
which are microbes and bacteria.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.150
Oh man, can they do amazing
chemistry that we cannot do.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.440
They are fantastic chemists,
these little microbes.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.280
So one approach is to look
at a microbe that does

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.680
a process called acetogenesis.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:55.680
And that is one of the six
known pathways of CO2 fixation.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.170
So acetogenesis makes acetate,
or what's known as Acetyl-CoA.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.280
That's Coenzyme A.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.780
And this is considered
the most ancient pathway

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.890
of carbon fixation
before origins

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.450
of life kind of times,
high CO2 environment,

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.710
that maybe this was one of
the first reactions that sort

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.390
of generated metabolic fuel.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.130
And so here you have two
molecules of CO2, one in blue,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:31.430
one in red, that are both
converted to other carbons

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.500
units that are then
combined with Coenzyme A

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.900
to make Acetyl-CoA, which then
can go on to make biofuels.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.880
So this is what we
want to understand,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.260
and we want to use this and
turn our CO2 into biofuels.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.870
So but before we
do this again, we

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.180
must understand how it works.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.980
And we can ask the
following questions.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.560
Are there redox
reactions involved?

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.580
Yes, there are.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.830
Is there acid-base catalysis?

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.950
Why, yes, of course, there is.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.120
Are there transition
metals involved?

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.580
Is this hard chemistry?

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.560
Yes, therefore pretty
much guaranteed they'll

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.270
be transition metals involved.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.210
Are there challenging
rate-limiting steps?

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.760
Oh, there's always, something's
always rate-limiting,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.840
absolutely.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.550
And what about the
chemical equilibrium?

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.200
What about our [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.950
All right, so let's
review the second half

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:27.420
material thinking about the
process of acetogenesis.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.480
First, oxidation
reduction-- so you

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.780
can tell me with a
clicker question what

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.170
is happening to CO2?

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.120
And what's happening
to blue CO2,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.510
and what's happening to red CO2?

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.668
Are they being
reduced or oxidized?

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.640
All right.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.438
10 more seconds.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.390
Great.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:25.850
OK, so let's take
a look at that.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.890
So that is right,
the top reaction.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.390
So both of these are plus 4.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.390
It's the same molecule.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.970
And so in one case
you're going to minus 2.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.290
So it's a 6 electron process.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.500
And in the other,
you're going to plus 2.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.790
But both of them
are being reduced.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.090
And so that is what's happening
in a lot of these carbon

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.130
fixation pathways.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.570
You're reducing carbon
dioxide and making it

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.080
into hydrocarbons, which
can be used for biofuel.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.870
And the precursor here is the
reduced form of this 2 carbon

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.600
molecule, this Acetyl-CoA.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.260
All right, so it's
being reduced.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.830
Now this is a fairly
large reduction.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.550
Six electrons is a lot.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:11.000
Most of the reagents in nature
that do reduction chemistry

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.900
do one or two
electron processes.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.130
So six is a lot.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.690
And in fact, it requires
five different enzymes

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.920
to do this six
electron reduction.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.460
So it's not just
one enzyme, it's

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.260
multiple enzymes
that need to do this.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.160
So this raises a question then.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.795
How are these carbon units, if
you take one, you reduce it.

00:21:30.795 --> 00:21:33.170
Then you reduce it again and
remove it to another enzyme,

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.690
reduce it again and remove
it to another enzyme,

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.680
and reduce it again, move
it to another enzyme.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.530
How does that happen?

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.890
How do the enzymes kind
of pass things along?

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.460
And I think about this as
a problem like kindergarten

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.330
soccer.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.430
So we have a bunch of enzymes.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.610
And we have a bunch
of one carbon units.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.670
But the one carbon units do
not get passed from enzyme

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.970
to enzyme in an
organized fashion.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.250
And in fact,
sometimes the enzymes

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.101
don't really have control
of those 1 carbon units.

00:22:01.101 --> 00:22:02.600
They can't grab it
with their hands.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.540
That's not allowed.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.000
And we know enzymes do
not have hands as such.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.550
So how do the enzymes grab
onto these one carbon units

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.600
and how does an enzyme bring
it from one enzyme to the next.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.720
And why-- you know it
takes energy to reduce CO2.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.550
So you don't want to just
reduce it and kind of pass it

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.101
along, and then who knows
what happens to that reduced

00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:23.600
molecule.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.808
You want to go to the next
enzyme and the next enzyme

00:22:25.808 --> 00:22:26.810
and the next enzyme.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.680
You want to make
your Acetyl-CoA.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.110
So how does nature do it?

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.200
It has a solution to the
kindergarten soccer problem,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.260
and its solution is a
B vitamin folic acid,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.750
also known as folate.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.504
And we talked about this before.

00:22:39.504 --> 00:22:40.920
This is why some
people might want

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.510
to drink Norwegian beer,
lots of folic acid in it,

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.990
or orange juice, or eat
leafy green vegetables.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.580
So here's folic acid
in its large form.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.360
In your notes, it just has
an R. This entire thing

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:58.940
is abbreviated as R. And
what these enzymes do is

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.510
they grab onto R, to that arm.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.920
And they hold onto it and they
bind their one carbon unit over

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.910
here.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.380
And then one enzyme
does a reduction.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.280
And then it releases it,
attached to folic acid.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.340
The next enzyme grabs onto the
folate acid by the R group,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.980
reduces it again, lets go of it.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.820
The next enzyme grabs onto
the folic acid by the R,

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.070
reduces it again and this works.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.240
This is a great thing.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.630
You have something small.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.700
You don't want it just
fre floating in the cell,

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.660
especially if it's not
really all that soluble.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.020
So you use something
else to hold onto it.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.020
You use a vitamin to hold
onto it this is great.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.530
But there's a problem.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.960
Well, first let's say, it
holds onto it really well.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.610
You can pass it really well.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.920
This is great.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.000
But then when you
get to the end,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.170
you're holding onto
it really tight.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.310
You get to the end-- how
do you get the methyl

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.220
group off the folic acid?

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.210
Great vehicle, but
you need a final step.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.350
You need to remove
it when you're done.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.290
So when the enzymes
are done, how

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.480
is this methyl group,
CH3 group removed?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:17.000
And now we need to think
about acid-base chemistry.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.710
So it turns out that
the deprotonated form

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.460
of folic acid, very hard
to remove the methyl group.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.600
Whereas the protonated
form of folic acid here,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:33.420
with the proton H in
red, it's much easier

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.200
to remove the methyl group.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:44.710
So if the pKa of folic acid
is 4.8, how much of folic acid

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:50.020
will be deprotonated compared to
protonated at physiological pH?

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.570
All right.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:08.492
10 more seconds.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:29.920
Yeah.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.060
Yeah.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.410
So sometimes these
things move around.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.330
The fonts change.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.110
So more will be deprotonated.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.700
I see that people
are paying attention.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:53.416
And we can look at
exactly how much more.

00:25:53.416 --> 00:25:55.540
So if we're going to look
at exactly how much more,

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.170
what equation do I
want to haul out?

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.662
And Henderson-Hasselbalch.

00:26:00.662 --> 00:26:02.370
I should have a little
approximate there,

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.800
but still, there it is.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:12.150
So we have pH of 7.4.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.870
pKa of 4.8.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:21.080
And if we solve this, we have
much more that is deprotonated.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.490
And again, the deprotonated
form is nonreactive.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.225
So this is true off the
enzyme, just a folic acid.

00:26:30.225 --> 00:26:33.530
It is not in a state that's
going to react very well.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.260
You're not going to get that
methyl group off very easily.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.290
Most of it will be
deprotonated and nonreactive.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.800
That's fine if you're
just transporting it,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.580
and that's great.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.680
Your body does this.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.140
You have methyl tetrahydrofolate
in your blood right now.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.260
And you have an enzyme that
takes off the methyl group.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.090
And you need an
enzyme to catalyze it,

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.090
because it needs to be
a catalyzed reaction.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.010
It's not going to go on its own.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:03.180
So again, just to remember
our little pretty pictures.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.300
When the pH equals the pKa,
you have equal number of moles

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.830
of protonated and deprotonated.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.660
At pH's below the pKa,
it's more protonated.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.850
And a pH's above the pKa,
it's more deprotonated.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:23.130
OK, so again we have
the problem here

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.510
that the removal of this
methyl group is challenging,

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.830
this is in fact a very
challenging reaction

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.570
both for humans and microbes.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:38.870
And so the solution, of course,
transition metal and an enzyme.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.680
So you need both the
transition metal, Vitamin B-12,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.170
bound to an enzyme to be
able to do this really

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.130
challenging chemistry.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.360
So this is one of the hard
steps in this pathway.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.890
So Vitamin B-12 we have
talked about before.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.000
It's an example of a naturally
occurring metal chelate.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.830
You have cobalt in the middle
of this core and ring system.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.900
And you have cobalt in
the plus 1 oxidation

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:08.010
state is very reactive and it's
capable of removing that methyl

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.770
group from the folic acid and
transferring it to itself,

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.940
forming a methyl
cobalt 3 species.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.760
And here's the little
methyl group on top.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.130
So we know about
transition metals as well,

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.520
and we can figure
out the d-count.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.760
So we can look at
the periodic table.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.694
And remember what about cobalt?

00:28:29.694 --> 00:28:31.110
What do we need
to know from this?

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.710
And so our d-count
would be what then?

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.420
You can just yell it out ,
it's not a clicker question.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.360
So it was group 9?

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.200
So we have 9 minus 1, or 8 d8.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.570
And over here we have
9 minus 3 equals 8?

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:55.280
No, d6-- yes, there's a typo.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.380
d6 is right, the other math
is incorrect, d6 system.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.470
OK, I was doing this
at 3:00 in the morning.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:06.530
OK, geometry around
the central metal.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.800
And it's a little
hard to see from this,

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.750
so I'm going to help you out.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.650
So here there are no
upper or lower ligands

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.440
in the code one state.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.080
So you just have
the ring system.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.420
So what is this geometry?

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.890
Yeah, so we have
square planar geometry.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.080
And then in the
code three state,

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.080
you have a methyl group above.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.060
And now you're also interacting
with this lower ligand.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.250
So now our geometry is what?

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:46.030
And what do we call
this core and ring that

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.120
has four points of attachment?

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.090
Tetradentate.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.010
Right?

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:57.360
Dent from teeth like claws
grabbing onto your metal.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.790
OK so before we do our
last chemical equilibrium,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.630
do we have a winner?

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.742
We have a winner.

00:30:05.742 --> 00:30:06.450
We have a winner.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:07.790
We do not need a tie breaker.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.549
OK, we'll announce
that at the end.

00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:11.090
And if you're the
winning recitation,

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.830
please come down to
collect your t-shirts.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:20.550
OK so very briefly then,
chemical equilibrium.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.330
So this B-12 enzyme which
catalyzes the reaction,

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:28.680
it not only uses this
transition metal, but it also

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.700
hydrogen bonds to the folic
acid and lowers that transition

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.540
state energy.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.080
And so here is the enzyme.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.750
And this enzyme exists in
multiple confirmations.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.410
So we can think about
chemical equilibrium

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.450
in terms of enzyme structure.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:49.710
Chemical equilibrium applies
to so many processes, not just

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.420
a plus b equals c plus d.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.970
So here we have our B-12
enzyme, the B-12 is bound here.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.710
And this is the
state, it's closed.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.280
B-12 is highly reactive, so
it needs to be protected.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.280
When you bind the enzyme
that binds the folic acid,

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.440
it opens a little.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.220
When you bind the folic
acid, it opens a lot

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.990
and it's able to do the
methyl transfer reaction.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.890
Then it needs to close up again
to protect the methyl group.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:20.640
And then it needs to go
on to transfer that methyl

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.310
group to the enzyme
that makes Acetyl-CoA.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.810
So you have all of
these equilibrium, which

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.440
are shifted by the
binding of various things,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.740
the binding of the other enzymes
or the binding of substrates.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.320
So the important point is
that enzymes are dynamic.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.090
Chemistry is dynamic.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:41.910
This is not about just
chemistry in the solid state.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:44.370
Chemistry in solution is cool!

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.660
And chemistry in solution
can save the planet.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:59.885
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:59.885 --> 00:32:02.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.245
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
if you appreciate this,

00:32:05.245 --> 00:32:09.810
this is how we're going to make
biofuels and save the planet.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.300
All right.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:22.180
We have what I would consider
as a bit of an upset.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:29.530
The winner of the 2014
t-shirt clicker competition

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.370
is Jay's Recitation.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:41.700
In second place, we have Lisa's
recitation in second place.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.160
And in third place, which
will also have a prize,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.780
we have Odin's Recitation.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.910
So good luck on the final.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.950
It's been a pleasure.

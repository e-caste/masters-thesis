YEN-JIE LEE: So
during class, I like

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.490
to take a few minutes of break.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.100
So that will allow
the students to take

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.910
some rest, because usually
the content is so intense,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.330
such that people--

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.160
it takes some time
for the students

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.950
to actually digest,
and then to understand,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.820
the concepts covered in the
first part of the lecture.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.740
And also, it give
them an opportunity

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.250
to interact with me.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.070
And usually, during
the break, they

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.350
bring a lot of questions, which
I didn't anticipate before.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.440
There are many, many
questions about mathematics

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.730
and those of physics concepts.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.620
Here you have del
square e, right?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.770
And the del square, you have
1, 2, 3, turn, three operators.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.160
And while you are--

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
if you write everything
explicitly-- so basically,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.220
this operator is going to be
operating on ex, ey, and zz.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.300
And then, we can usually
solve them during the class.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.710
And I can even cover part
of the question asked

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.740
during the break, so
that everybody, actually,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.315
can benefit from those
interesting questions

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:17.270
people actually bring
up during the break.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.520
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome to 8.20.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.160
Welcome to Special Relativity.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.470
And let me start by
wishing you all a happy New

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.350
Year, happy New Year 2021.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.060
I'm pretty sure
this is going to be

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.670
an exciting year with
a lot of changes ahead

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.520
and a lot of exciting events.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.790
My name is Markus Klute, and I
will guide you through this IAP

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.950
lecture on special relativity.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.020
This is very likely my
favorite class at MIT, A,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.000
because it's IAP, and
we start a new year.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.590
There's a lot of
excitement in the air.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.620
And we have a chance to focus
for this one month of January

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.470
on this specific subject.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.630
B. I have a chance to introduce
a man, Albert Einstein,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.880
through a discussion
of his physics,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.920
through discussion
of him as a person,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.730
and also through a discussion
of the historic context

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.020
in which he developed
special relativity.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.540
And C, if this is
the first time you

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.960
encountered special relativity,
it will blow your mind.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.080
And it actually is quite
fun as an instructor

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.050
to do a little bit
of a transformation

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.780
in your understanding
on physics.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.860
So let's get started with a
quote, with an Einstein quote.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.850
I have a number of those
as we go through the class.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.680
This one here is really kind
of the theme of the class.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.750
Let me just read this to you.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.330
"It is not the result
of scientific research

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.510
that ennobles humans and
enriches their nature,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.210
but the struggle to
understand while performing

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.470
creative and open-minded
intellectual work."

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.700
It is really the struggle with
the ideas, really the trying

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.990
to get understanding which
ennobles humans and enriches

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.830
their natures.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.600
And let me add here that,
through your own work,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.050
through your own mind,
you can transform

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.970
yourself and your understanding
of physics in general.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.490
This first video and
this first lecture

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.240
will mostly be concerned
with organizational topics.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.420
So I'll lay out the
schedule of the class

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.570
and also how you get a
grade, of what kind of PSETs

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.980
we have in mind and so on.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.300
Let's get started.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.870
So I introduced myself
already-- again, Markus Klute.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.190
You can reach me by email.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.440
It's klute@mit.edu.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.110
We have a graduate TA, Justin.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.280
His email is given on
the slide, as well.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.210
And then we have,
too, graders and TAs--

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.750
Mohit.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.590
Zach, YuQing, and Stephen.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.070
Those four will guide us
through the class, as well.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.350
And especially when we
go into breakout rooms

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.490
in the live class, they will
help you in the discussion.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.770
The class hours are from
3:00 to 4:30 PM on Zoom.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.370
And you can-- I encourage
you to join the class,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.760
to participate, to be
active in the class.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.550
But you will also be able
to get through the material

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.120
through recordings.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.940
I will not record
the live class,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.600
because I want to encourage you
to be just as open as possible.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.230
But I pre-record the class, and
after the class time is over,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.182
I'll upload those videos
for your reference.

00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:42.140
And also, if you live in
a different time zone,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.690
you have a chance to
listen to the class.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.610
Office hours will be Tuesday at
9:00 AM and Friday at 5:00 PM.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.790
Tuesday, you reach me, and
Friday you reach Justin.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.840
Will set up a Slack
workspace which

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.700
we use for our
internal discussions

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.980
with a teaching staff.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.140
But there's also
going to be channels

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.680
for you to discuss
PSETs as channels

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.610
we discussed for physics.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.410
And there's going to
be a channel, which

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.890
will be important when we
go to the exam discussion.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.519
The expectation is that you
spend about 30 hours a week

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.140
during IAP.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.900
Some will find the PSETs
very straightforward

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.740
and quickly to do.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.340
Others will need more time.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.070
So not a-- don't set your
stopwatch for 30 hours.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.400
That's just an average guide.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.780
I will evaluate you at
the end of the term,

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.300
and I will use this metric here.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.910
50% of your grade will
come from the homework.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.700
There's going to be five
different homework assignments.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.420
There's going to be two
midterms with 15% each and one

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.050
final that's 20%.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.270
If I do the math correctly,
this should lead us to 100%.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.830
You earn an A with 90%, a
B with 75%, a C with 60%

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.750
or higher, a D
with 50% or higher,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.500
and then a failing grade
with less than 50%.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.960
So all lectures will be on Zoom.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.630
You'll find the Zoom
links on the Canvas page.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.360
And you probably
found this already.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.910
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
able to find this video.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.830
And again, as I was
saying, the recordings

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.465
will be available after class.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.910
This is the schedule.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.970
Let me start by
explaining this picture.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.660
That's Little Thomas here
and then a German ICE train.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.450
This class-- the way
I look at this class

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.260
is that it's a
train which is just

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.270
leaving the station right now.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.000
And it will very
slowly pick up pace.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.120
But you want to make sure
that you stay on the train

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.040
and you don't jump off, because
this will, once it's picked up

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.350
its pace, will be a
fast moving train.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.920
And missing a few
days in IAP will

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.020
cause you to have
trouble following

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.000
along with the material.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.490
We'll start today with
this introduction.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.880
Tomorrow, we have a
very interesting lecture

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.840
by David Kaiser.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.420
This is the only one where we
actually record the live event.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.810
So we record the Zoom session.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.630
And then the rest will
unfold, I was about to say.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.560
You find this red block here.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.130
Those are our midterms
and the final.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.910
On those days, there's not
going to be a live class.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.280
But I will make the final--

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.830
sorry, the exam available
for about 24 hours.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.700
You should not spend
more than an hour,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.940
maybe an hour and
a half on the exam.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.490
And then submit
once you are done.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.030
The exams are open book
in a sense that you

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.070
can look at the
textbooks, and you can

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.930
look at the course material.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.290
But you are not supposed
to do an online search

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.940
for the solutions,
and you're also not

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.380
supposed to discuss
with your peers.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.310
You can ask clarifying questions
on one of the Slack channels,

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.370
and we will be happy to answer
as quickly as we see them.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.210
But again, this is an evaluation
of your own performance,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.880
and you should submit
your own performance.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.650
The PSETs are
different in a sense

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.440
that I encourage that you
guys build small groups

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.020
and work on them together.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.500
Each PSET then has to
be submitted by you

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.020
as an individual, meaning
that I don't want to see

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.435
copies of PSETs of other folks.

00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:37.240
I want your own answers
in your own words

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.180
to the questions we pose.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.260
Very important day in January
is Martin Luther King Day,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.200
and IAP gives us all a
little bit of a breathing

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.420
room and extra free day.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.780
And you see that
there's going to be,

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.970
after the discussion
at the very end,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.880
after the final, a special
lecture where I introduce

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.620
the topic of general
relativity, which is not

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.960
part of the core
content, especially

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.320
of this special
relativity class.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.130
Textbooks-- I will not really
follow the textbooks line

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.020
by line or chapter by chapter.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.020
But I encourage you-- and
I give you an outline--

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.330
to read them, especially
the first two ones.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.570
The first one is by French.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.470
The second one is by Resnick.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.880
The first one is the
former MIT professor.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.250
You are supposed to read
this book cover to cover,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.130
and I give reading
assignments on this.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.470
Resnick has a lot of good
examples and problems,

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.850
and we will focus on the first
four chapters of that book.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.240
There is a lot of literature
out there on special relativity,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.970
as a slew of
textbooks available.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.620
If you have one at
hand, you can also

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.430
use that and find the
relevant chapter in there.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.080
I give you one extra
book here, which

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.610
is nice because it is
an excellent explanation

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.050
of the mathematics involved.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.680
If you're more
inclined to course 18,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.650
that might be an interesting
textbook for you.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.257
Again, there's
many, many resources

00:09:07.257 --> 00:09:08.715
on the topic of
special relativity,

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.120
and I'll point out
a few as we go.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.090
In addition to the textbooks,
I give you a number of papers--

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.460
for example, the paper
in which Einstein

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.460
explains or
describes the concept

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.673
of the theory of
special relativity.

00:09:22.673 --> 00:09:24.840
And there's a few others
which I'd like you to read.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.620
They're interesting because
they introduce the physics,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.230
but they're also
interesting as they

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.800
have been written more than
100 years ago in a slightly

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.350
different language than
we would be using today.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.050
And Einstein,
specifically, doesn't even

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.180
write papers the way
other people wrote papers

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.990
at the time.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.410
He had his own style
in writing papers.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.130
And we will see that.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.360
So here is the reading
assignment week by week.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.470
We start in week one by Resnick
Chapter 1, French Chapter 2.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.930
There's two papers, the
Michelson Morley paper

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.210
and the Einstein paper
on special relativity.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.890
And then we go on as
we go through IAP.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.190
Your homework schedule is here.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.270
I hand out PSET number
0 today, and I'll

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.360
explain it on the next page.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.335
This is a PSET which allows--

00:10:17.335 --> 00:10:18.710
I mean, this is
a PSET which will

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.830
keep you busy for the
entire month, or most of it.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.350
The other PSETs are shorter,
and they are more pointed.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.570
And you get the
PSET, you work on it,

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.830
and your hand in the solution.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.230
And by the time you have
done that, the next PSET

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.650
rolls around.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.500
I would use the PSET
load a little bit,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.470
because I want to acknowledge
the fact that it will be harder

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.790
for you to work in teams.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.710
I still encourage this.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.280
You find yourself on Slack.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.370
You find yourself
on Zoom channels.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.090
Some of you might
have housing together.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.270
I really encourage you guys
to discuss the physics.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:57.140
There are some really
difficult concepts

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.700
which just need you to think
through and to talk through.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.730
And the talking through best
happens with your peers.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.670
And you will see that that will
be very beneficial, especially

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.060
when it comes to the PSET.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.220
But here is homework number 1.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.370
I've done this now a few
times, and I really, really

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.750
enjoy the solutions
given by the students.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.040
So this is a creative project.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.730
You have basically almost
all of IAP to hand it in.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.570
And the idea is to be creative
around a topic relating

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:40.040
Einstein, or/and the theory
of special relativity.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.720
The project might be a video.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.740
It might be a poem.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:48.080
It might be a musical piece,
artwork, animations, a game,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.360
a structure--

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.140
you name it.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:00.000
What I really want is that you
take something you do very well

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.680
and combine it with the
topic of this class.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.320
I want you to take
something where

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.810
you are very familiar with where
you are feeling comfortable

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.930
and then enter this new
topic, this new topic

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.080
of special relativity.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.860
I will rate it based on your
creativity, on the quality,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.540
and on your effort.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.900
And again, please hand
this in by January 22.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.570
I really encourage you to
not wait to the last minute

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.120
to start working
on those topics,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.135
those creative projects.

00:12:34.135 --> 00:12:35.760
They always take a
little bit more time

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.520
than you might expect.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.640
This class will have an
interactive component.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:47.400
And we will use breakout rooms
for discussions and smaller

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.340
problems as you would be doing
in the classroom, as well.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.510
Here is the very first one.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.360
People who are taking
this class asynchronously,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.550
I encourage you to stop here
and work through the problem.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.160
And then look at the
solution afterwards,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.840
or look at the discussion
of the solution afterwards.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.310
So this first Gedanken
experiment, thought experiment,

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.740
is about the topic
of relativity.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:22.040
And you want to
first understand what

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.580
that is, what relativity
is, before you discuss

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.500
what special relativity is.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.230
So imagine you wake up
inside a room with no windows

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.950
and one locked door.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:37.467
You checked.

00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:39.050
You make sure that
the door is locked.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.340
You cannot get out.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.840
You cannot see outside.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.240
Looking out around,
you see a table

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.160
with a number of items on it.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.340
There's a desk lamp
plugged in and turn on.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.870
There's a tennis ball.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.580
There's a bunch of string.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.140
There's a pitcher of water.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.250
There's a cup.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.270
There's a candle.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.650
There's a box of matches.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.150
And there's a music
player with headphones.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.030
A skateboard and a wooden
stool are also in the room.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.910
The music player has
a sign on it saying

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.300
turn it on for instructions.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.160
So you do.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.040
You're told that you are
in a specially designed

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.230
vibration-proof and noise-proof
train car [COUGH]---- sorry--

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.260
on a set of straight
and level train tracks.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.460
Your task is to use one or
more of the items in the room,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.620
perhaps in combination
with each other,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.360
to determine whether the
train car is stationary or is

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.330
moving on the tracks.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:40.110
There's a 30 minute time
limit on your test or tests.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.670
And you cannot destroy or
you cannot modify the walls

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.250
or the floors or the
ceiling of the car.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.870
That is not permitted.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.910
So the question to you is, can
you think of some creative way

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.370
to use the items that might
indicate whether or not

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.850
you are moving.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.190
Think about this and discuss
in your breakout rooms--

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.380
that is, for the
live session here.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.260
Again, I want to encourage
you to stop and to think

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.060
about a solution.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.120
Can you think about a creative
way to work with this?

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.438
The typical time is
about 10 minutes.

00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:18.480
You might think about it.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.220
You might want to
take some notes.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.380
All right, the answer is
you cannot figure it out.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:33.110
Every reference frame
by itself is inert.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.230
You cannot figure out whether
or not you are in a moving

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.410
or in a stationary
reference frame.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.410
And as long as you
cannot feel vibrations,

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.270
or you hear the sound, or
you have some other internal,

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.860
external indication, you will
not be able to figure out

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.340
whether or not the room
is moving with a constant

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.690
velocity.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:58.610
You will be able to feel
or measure accelerations.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.580
And so now you could
argue that since the train

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.960
track is on Earth, and
the Earth is actually--

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.960
since you are on Earth,
and if you're moving,

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.280
you would be able to feel
the rotation of the Earth,

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.040
there might be a way
to figure this out.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.410
But that will be
very, very hard to do.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.050
So the answer is you cannot.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.140
You cannot distinguish one
reference frame from another.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.990
You don't know what an
absolute velocity is.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.770
So another way we will
interact in this class

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.100
is through concept questions.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.220
So here, concept
questions are meant

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.980
to give you a little
bit of a checkpoint

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.640
to encourage you to think
about what I just explained

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.400
in a video or in the
class and to stimulate

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.050
some sort of discussion.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.170
Sometimes you will use contact
questions in breakout rooms

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.810
for the discussion
part sometimes

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.200
you just use Zoom features
in order to figure out

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.940
what the answer is.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.720
But besides the technology,
those concept questions

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.990
are really for you to figure
out whether or not you just

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.609
understand the concept.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:16.380
So again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.690
to think about the
concept question

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.674
and then move on
with the answer.

00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:22.424
Here's an example.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.750
A new Star Wars
movie came out, 2019.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.130
And I ask you to pick the answer
closest to your level of Star

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.080
Wars expertise.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.020
I saw the movie, and I consider
myself a Star Wars fan.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.610
I saw the new movie, but I do
not know much about Star Wars.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.130
I heard about Star Wars, but
I didn't see the movie yet.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.480
Always liked Star Trek better.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:47.980
What?

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.510
Star Wars?

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.690
OK, so very straightforward--
here I would give you

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.260
an option--

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.910
1, 2, 3, or 4.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.670
You collect the answers,
and we get some feedback.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.580
This is obviously-- there's
no right answer here.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.500
There can be concept
questions where there

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.310
is a right and a wrong answer.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.520
And again, for you,
this is supposed

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:12.220
to give you feedback on how
well you understood the concept.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.380
All right, before we
close this first video,

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.970
I want to introduce
players, Alice and Bob.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:22.800
We will have, often,
discussions of reference frames.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.803
Typically Alice or Bob are
in one reference frame.

00:18:26.803 --> 00:18:29.220
And then the other person is
in the other reference frame.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.300
I want you to think about
those Star Trek figures.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.520
We will use spacecrafts.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.950
We will use light--

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.220
so phasers or light pistols--

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.250
in order to demonstrate the
impact of special relativity

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.200
and understand the concepts.

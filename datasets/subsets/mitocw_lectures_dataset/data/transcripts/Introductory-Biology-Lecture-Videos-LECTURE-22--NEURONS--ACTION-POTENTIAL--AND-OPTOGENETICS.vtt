00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.550
ADAM MARTIN: All right,
let's get started.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.670
So I'm starting with
this video here.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.710
What's happening here
is there's this mouse,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.700
and you see there's like
this fiber optic cable going

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.580
into its brain.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.170
And the mouse is
asleep right now.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.070
And now the researchers
are shining light

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.040
into its brain, a specific
region of the brain,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.710
to activate specific
neurons in order

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.620
to test whether they
function in arousal.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.237
And here, you see the
mouse is going to wake up.

00:00:48.237 --> 00:00:48.820
There it goes.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.510
It's awake now.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.860
So for today's
lecture, we're going

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.010
to work towards understanding
how this experiment works.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.040
And we're going to talk
about how neurons function

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.510
and how researchers are able to
control that function in order

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.670
to modify behavior--

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.400
in this case, the
arousal of this mouse.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.570
OK, so this is going to involve
a particular type of cell

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.700
in our body, which
is the neuron.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.060
And neurons are highly
specialized cells

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.510
that have a function to
transmit information from one

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.960
part of the body to another.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.430
And so neurons are
highly polarized cells,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.110
which you can see here.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.090
On the left of this neuron, you
see this arbor of protrusions,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.970
which are called dendrites.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.980
And then on this side
of the cell body,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.530
you see a single
extension, which

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.150
is an axon, and then the
terminus of the axon over here.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.660
And this nerve cell
transmits information

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.490
in a single direction.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.340
It will transmit information
from this side to this side.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.180
And these neurons are able to
communicate with each other.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.210
And they communicate at the
ends of the neuron, which

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.520
are known as synapses,
which I'll come back to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.580
and talk about later
on in the lecture.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.000
So neurons could be making
synapses on this side

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.805
and also making synapses on
this side with other neurons.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.080
So to start to unpack the
function of this neuron--

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.130
and I should highlight that
this flow of information

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.990
can occur over very
long distances, right?

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.670
Your sciatic nerve extends
from the base of your spine

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.980
all the way down
into your foot, OK?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.130
So that axon is one
meter in length.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.340
So that's an extremely
long distance

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.550
to transmit information
along a single cell.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.550
And so we're going to go from
thinking about how signals are

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.070
transmitted in single
cells, and this will

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.500
evolve electrical signaling.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.310
Then we'll talk about synapses
and how synapses function

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.720
to communicate between neurons.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.040
And this is going
to involve also

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.190
sort of understanding how
certain antidepressants,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.810
like Prozac, work.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.880
And then we'll end
by talking about how

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.430
researchers did this experiment
to wake up the mouse.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.660
And it all starts with
something that I told you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.930
about at the beginning
of the semester, which

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.710
is that the plasma
membrane separates

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.380
distinct compartments
the outside of the cell

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.910
from the cytoplasm.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.700
And there are distinct
ion concentrations

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.990
on either side of this boundary.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.115
So we're starting now talking
about a single neuron cell.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.790
And we're going to talk
about a type of signal

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.012
known as an action potential.

00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:03.720
Oh, that's right.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.370
So we're going to talk
about an action potential.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.500
And what an action
potential is, is it's

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.390
an electrical
signal that travels

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.680
the length of the neuron.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.710
So this action potential,
I'll abbreviate this AP.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.260
So when I refer to
AP, I'm not referring

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.850
to advanced placement,
but action potential, OK?

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.020
So this is an
electrical signal that

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.920
travels the length of
the axon and the neuron.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.630
And so in order to have an
electrical signal propagate,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.000
we need some sort of
electrical property

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.180
that the cell has
that enables this.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.070
And so I showed you or I told
you earlier in the semester

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.330
how sodium ions are concentrated
on the outside of the cell

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.540
and potassium ions are
concentrated on the inside.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.900
You see here's the
sodium gradient here,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.690
potassium gradient here.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.160
And now I'm going to tell you
how it is that this happens,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.310
because this is
thermodynamically not favored,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.810
right?

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.190
These ions would
prefer, by diffusion,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.090
to be equal concentrations
on both sides of this plasma

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.670
membrane, which means that
the cell to shift this

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.340
from equilibrium
has to expend energy

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.980
to set up this situation.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.600
And so in the plasma membrane
of the cell, there is a protein.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.360
It's an integral
membrane protein

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.340
and sits inside the
plasma membrane.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.080
So this here is the
plasma membrane.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.210
And this integral
membrane protein

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.010
is called a sodium
potassium ATPase.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:10.770
So it's going to have a subunit
that hydrolyzes ATP to ADP.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.870
And the protein uses the
energy of ATP hydrolysis

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.650
to pump sodium ions up their
concentration gradient.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.440
So the sodium ions are
going out of the cell.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.790
And this is going
against the flow

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.900
that sodium would
normally like to take,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.800
which would be going downstream.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.380
And it pumps potassium ions
into the cytoplasm such

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.350
that there's a higher
concentration of potassium

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.140
ions in the cytoplasm, OK?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.130
So these neurons expend a huge--

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.290
a quarter of their ATP is used
by pumping ions like this, such

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.595
that there is gradients of ions
across the plasma membrane.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.030
Now, if one sodium
ion was pumped out

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.000
for every potassium
ion pumped in,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.300
there'd be no charge
difference between the exterior

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.090
and the cytoplasm.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.260
But what happens in
the plasma membrane

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.010
is that in addition to the
sodium potassium ATPase,

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.340
there are other channels
that are present.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.300
There are sodium channels.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.400
These are mostly closed,
but there are some potassium

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.230
channels that are leaky.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.860
And they're basically leaking
potassium from the cytoplasm

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.130
out into the exoplasm, OK?

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.330
And if you have positive
charges going out the cell,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.270
then the inside of
the membrane is going

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.413
to have a net negative charge.

00:07:47.413 --> 00:07:49.080
And the outside of
the membrane is going

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.070
to have a net positive charge.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.740
And this charge
across the membrane,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.690
where you have
positive on the outside

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.320
and minus on the inside--

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.390
I should label this exterior,
and this is cytoplasm.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.650
This voltage difference is
known as a membrane potential.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.250
So this is a membrane potential.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.520
And it's an electrical
potential across the membrane.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.020
If you're an
electrical engineer,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.740
you can think of the plasma
membrane as a capacitor, OK?

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.549
So this plasma membrane is
holding this charge difference

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.559
across it.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:42.169
And so there's a voltage
across the membrane.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:51.020
And in a resting state, the
cell's resting potential

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.180
is negative 70 millivolts.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.950
So if the cell is not getting
stimulated by something

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.440
like a neurotransmitter,
the resting potential

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.310
is negative 70 millivolts,
where the inside is negative

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.370
and the outside is positive, OK?

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.578
So now I just want to
define some terms that

00:09:12.578 --> 00:09:14.120
are going to be
useful for us when we

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.160
talk about action potentials.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.455
So when there's this
negative inside potential,

00:09:24.455 --> 00:09:28.760
a negative inside potential
is referred to as polarized.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.400
So it's polarized
because there's

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.120
a polarity across this membrane,
where one side is positive

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.660
and the other side
is negative, OK?

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.940
So polarized refers
to if there's

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.830
a negative inside potential.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.150
So the resting state of the
side is there's a polarized--

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.100
it's polarized.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.640
However, the cell can
lose this polarity

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.500
and not have a
charge differential,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.950
or it can flip and be
positive on the inside.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.750
And when that happens, if
there's either zero or positive

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.070
inside potential, this is
referred to as depolarized.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.420
Anyone have an idea as
to how the cell would

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.580
flip the potential?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.280
What would have to happen
in the plasma membrane

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.310
to flip this potential
and depolarize the cell?

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.900
Yes, Stephen?

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.710
AUDIENCE: You could
open the ion channels.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.600
ADAM MARTIN: So Stephen
suggested opening ion channels.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.431
Which ion channels
would you open?

00:10:36.431 --> 00:10:38.120
AUDIENCE: The sodium channels.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.870
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.260
So Stephen suggested
if you open these,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.970
it's going to
depolarize the cell.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.450
Because remember, sodium is
high on the outside, out here.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.180
And so if you open
these channels,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.730
positive ions are
going to flow in.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.120
And that's going to make this
less negative and this less

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.800
positive, OK?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.870
So this is the situation here,
where these sodium channels

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.050
open, and the sodium
channels-- or the sodium

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.650
ions rushing in is going
to create a depolarization,

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.780
where you now flip
the potential.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.120
And there's a greater
positive charge

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.620
on the inside of
the plasma membrane.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.270
Everyone see how?

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.360
Because the sodium ions are
going to just go downstream.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.400
They're higher
concentration out here.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.740
So just by opening
these channels,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.410
the cell doesn't have to
do any work to do this.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.600
Sodium is just going to
flow down its gradient

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.920
into the cytoplasm.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.750
So what an action
potential is, is it's

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:49.090
a transient depolarization
of the nerve cell.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:12:02.180
So the Action Potential, or AP,
is a transient depolarization

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:07.160
of the neuron, which
means it doesn't just

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.020
depolarize and stay depolarized,
but it depolarizes and then

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.010
restores itself back to
the resting polarity.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.310
And so what you see when
you measure the voltage

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.010
across the plasma
membrane in a neuron,

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.890
you see that it can
spike and depolarize,

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.880
but then it's rapidly restored
to its resting state, OK?

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.200
So it's a transient process.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.470
When we think about the neuron
at higher resolution, what

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.140
you're going to see is
not only is it transient,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.500
but it's also a traveling
wave that propagates along

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.870
the entire length of the cell.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.870
So this is also
a traveling wave.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.240
And one thing that you can
notice about these neurons,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.510
or the action potentials
here, is that they all

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.000
depolarize to the same extent.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.380
So they all depolarize to
this positive 50 millivolts.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.710
And so this illustrates
a key property

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.870
of neurons, in that the
level of activity of a neuron

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:25.480
is not determined by the size
of this action potential.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.450
This action potential is
an all-or-nothing event.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.140
It either happens or it doesn't.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.070
And when it happens, it
depolarizes to the same level.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.470
So the action potential
is all or nothing.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.490
You can think of it
as a binary signal.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.530
And therefore, the
way that neurons

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.950
encode sort of the
magnitude of activation

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.040
is not through the
level of depolarization

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.920
of a single action
potential, but it

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.280
is able to distinguish between
different frequencies of action

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.220
potentials that are
propagating along the neuron.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:12.640
So signal strength,
in this case,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.240
is related to the frequency
of action potentials firing.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.340
So now we're going
to unpack how it

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.820
is a nerve cell fires
an action potential

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.940
and how it propagates along
the entire cell length, right?

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.740
In the case of
the sciatic nerve,

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.230
this has to happen across
an entire meter, OK?

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.840
That's a very long
distance to propagate

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.410
this change in electrical
signal, at least for a cell.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.010
And so we're going to
talk about the mechanism.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.070
And I'm going to start at the
beginning, when this action

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.340
potential initiates.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.510
So we'll start at the initiation
of the action potential.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.140
So how is it that
this nerve cell

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.300
is told to start depolarizing
at the dendrites?

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.250
Because there's going to
be another neuron here,

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.820
which is going to communicate
to this neuron over here

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.160
to tell it to
start depolarizing.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.720
It does this at the location
known as the synapse, which

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.080
is basically sort of the
connection between the two

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.870
neurons.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.970
And the way this
process is initiated

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.980
is similar to the
type of signaling

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.860
that you saw in the past
few lectures, where you have

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.430
a ligand and a receptor, OK?

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:50.310
In this case, the
ligand is going

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:55.960
to be what's known as a
neurotransmitter, which

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.400
is a small molecule.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.210
And I'll show you some later on.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.590
And the receptor is going
to be a receptor that

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.660
binds to this ligand.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.820
But in this case, rather
than being something

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.510
like a G protein coupled
receptor or a receptor tyrosine

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.160
kinase, the receptor is going
to be an ion channel, OK?

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.560
So the receptor is going
to be an ion channel.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.250
And so you see one
example in the slide

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.820
up here, where
here's a receptor.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.410
And these receptors are what
are known as ligand-gated ion

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:35.950
channels.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.150
In this case, it's
a sodium channel.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.030
So it's going to be--

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.000
whether or not it's open depends
on the presence of the ligand.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.180
So if we take a
neurotransmitter like serotonin,

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.230
if it's not bound
to the receptor,

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.090
the receptor is closed.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.060
But if serotonin
binds to the receptor,

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.360
it opens up the channel,
which can selectively

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.070
let in a type of ion--

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.020
in this case, sodium.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.230
In this case, this is
an activating channel,

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.150
because letting
in sodium is going

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.740
to depolarize the cell, OK?

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.470
So this ligand receptor
binding uses a ligand-gated--

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.445
there's a ligand-gated
sodium channel.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.680
And it's this ligand-gated
sodium channel which

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.390
starts the depolarization.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:45.400
So that's how you sort of knock
over the first domino, right?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.800
But then there has
to be some mechanism

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.570
to propagate this along the
length of a very long cell.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:58.390
And so I'll tell you this
involves a different type

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.690
of sort of signaling
mechanism from what you're

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.960
used to thinking about, because
this involves a different type

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.730
of an ion channel.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.860
And it's called a voltage gated.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.800
And I'll abbreviate
voltage gated just VG.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.000
And in this case, it
will be a sodium channel.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.290
So what's a voltage-gated
sodium channel?

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.950
This is a voltage-gated
sodium channel here.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.930
And you can see, in the
resting state of the cell,

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.020
this channel is closed.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.470
And it's closed because
of this red rod structure

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.450
that's positively charged.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.240
That's a positively
charged alpha helix

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.430
that is a part of
this protein and is

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.520
embedded in the membrane.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.600
But this alpha helix
is positioned down

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.020
towards the cytoplasm, because
it's positively charged.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.540
And the cytosolic face
of the plasma membrane

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.120
is negatively charged, OK?

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.700
And the confirmation
of this protein

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.810
then depends on the charge
across this membrane.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.720
Because when there
is depolarization,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.070
that shifts the position of this
alpha helix, such that now it

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.160
shifts up towards the exterior
face of the plasma membrane.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.040
And that opens the channel,
which lets sodium ions rush in,

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.750
OK?

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.870
Again, sodium ions here, they're
always rushing downstream.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.290
They're concentration gradient.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.190
So in this case, whether or not
this channel is open or closed

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.830
depends not on the
presence of a ligand,

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:43.330
but on the membrane potential
across the plasma membrane.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.210
So these voltage-gated
sodium channels,

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.990
they're opened by
depolarization.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.990
And then the question
becomes, if you

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.770
open these channels at the
very end of the neuron,

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.550
how do you get it such that
this electrical signal moves

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.940
unidirectionally
along the neuron?

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.510
So what leads to
unidirectionality?

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.160
Who's been to a
sporting event lately?

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.750
OK, good.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.690
You guys know the wave?

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.752
So we're going to do the wave.

00:20:35.752 --> 00:20:37.710
Once you to stand up,
you're going to be tired,

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.440
and you're going to have
to sit down for a while.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.660
I'm going to be a ligand--

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.340
I'm a ligand-gated
sodium channel,

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.090
so I'm going to
start things off, OK?

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.510
You ready?

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.480
All right, here we go.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.720
OK, that's basically
an action potential.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.670
So the way that this
was unidirectional

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:11.920
is once you stood up and did
the wave, you then sat down,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.520
and you stopped doing anything.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.060
And so these voltage-gated
sodium channels

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.080
have a similar property.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.480
If we look at the
next step in this,

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.160
the sodium channel is
opened by depolarization.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.460
And you see there's this ball
of chain segment of the protein.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.290
You see that yellow ball?

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.160
Once the sodium channel opens,
after about a millisecond,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.080
that ball sticks in the
channel pore and blocks it, OK?

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.220
So these sodium channels
open to let in sodium ions,

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.590
but then they're
immediately inactivated

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.790
after about a millisecond, OK?

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:59.830
And so that enables
unidirectionality.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:06.090
So this is what I'll call
voltage-gated sodium channel

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.000
inactivation.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.600
And how this
promotes a traveling

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.610
wave of depolarization is
that if we consider an action

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.670
potential moving along this
axon from left to right

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.390
and if the sodium
channels in the green zone

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.880
are currently open,
it came from the left,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.940
which means that all
the sodium channels

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.340
to the left of this green zone
are going to be inactivated.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.590
So because they're
inactivated here,

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.930
there won't be
further depolarization

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.570
going to the left,
but depolarization

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.640
will have to move to the right.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.340
And you basically get
this traveling wave.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.950
And it goes one
direction, because if it

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.910
came from somewhere, which it
always does, then where it just

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.520
was coming from,
all those sodium

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.710
channels, the voltage-gated
sodium channels

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.720
are going to be closed.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.990
So this allows it to move
in a single direction

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.220
along the neuron.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.670
Also, once the action potential
gets to the end of the neuron,

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.560
it doesn't reflect back the
other way in the neuron.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.730
This can only go one direction.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.820
So this provides
unidirectionality.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:28.570
So it's this inactive
or refractory period

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.060
of the voltage-gated
sodium channel

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.180
which prevents the
action potential

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.380
from moving backwards.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.470
Now, if you look at these
action potentials in the cell,

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:47.540
you see that they happen,
but you don't just

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.150
depolarize and stay depolarized.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.830
The cell body depolarizes and
then repolarizes very rapidly.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.140
So there's an oscillation.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:03.180
So there has to be some way to
terminate the action potential.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:09.170
So there's a termination or
repolarization of the cell.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.090
So there has to be a
way for this nerve cell

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.950
to rapidly restore
membrane potential.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.530
And I want you to think for
just a couple of seconds

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.530
about what type of
channel might you open

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.390
to re-establish this polarity.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.390
What ion do you need to flow
from where to where in order

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:40.240
to get a net negative
charge on the inside?

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.127
Udo?

00:24:45.127 --> 00:24:46.955
AUDIENCE: You need to
move the sodium ions

00:24:46.955 --> 00:24:49.240
from the inside to the outside.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.270
ADAM MARTIN: OK, you could
pump the sodium ions out,

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.460
and that's totally accurate.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.430
So that's going to
require moving sodium ions

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:01.270
up a concentration gradient,
which is going to take energy

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.950
and is going to be slow.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.890
So is there another option we
could take advantage of here

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.270
to repolarize?

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.650
Rachel?

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.840
AUDIENCE: Move the
potassium ions.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.340
ADAM MARTIN: So
Rachel has suggested

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:17.200
to moving the potassium
ions to the outside, which

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.190
is how this is done.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.930
So remember, potassium is
high in the cytoplasmic,

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.180
low on the exoplasm.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.610
And therefore, if you have
a voltage-gated potassium

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:31.210
channel, that's going to cause
a rush of positive ions out

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.540
of the cell.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.340
And that will be able to restore
the net negative potential

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.670
on the inside of the cell.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.660
So this termination
or repolarization

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:49.390
is the result of the opening
of voltage gated, in this case,

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:54.110
not sodium channels,
but potassium channels.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.110
When do you think these
have to open relative

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.220
to the sodium channel?

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.340
Should they open right
with the sodium channel?

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.170
Carmen's shaking her head no.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.612
Do you want to
explain your logic?

00:26:10.612 --> 00:26:13.002
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, they
both carry the same charge,

00:26:13.002 --> 00:26:16.830
so they wind up getting out
at the same time [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.780
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.080
So what Carmen said is if
they open simultaneously,

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.150
you have sodium flowing in.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.800
You have potassium flowing out.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.760
And that's not going to
necessarily change the charge.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.510
So when would these have to open
relative to sodium channels?

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.000
Yeah, Carmen?

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.100
AUDIENCE: When it reaches
that potential [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.150
ADAM MARTIN: So after
it's depolarized, yeah.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.820
So this has to be delayed
relative to the sodium

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.470
channels, OK?

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:53.090
So this has to be
delayed relative

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.540
to the voltage-gated
sodium channels.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.070
Because if you're thinking
about this traveling

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.180
wave of depolarization,
the depolarization

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.850
is going to be high where
the sodium channels are only

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:11.870
entering.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.700
And then following
that, you would

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.010
have potassium ions
getting pumped out

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.280
and basically
repolarizing the cell.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.120
Everyone see how you sort
of get depolarization

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.760
with sodium rushing in,
and then after that, you

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.290
repolarize with the potassium
getting pumped out, right?

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.650
So here, you have a spike,
and you complete the cycle.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:36.410
It can even get hyperpolarized,
where it gets even more

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.730
negative than it normally does.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.170
And then it eventually gets
back to this resting potential

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.080
of around negative 60 or
negative 70 millivolts.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.970
OK, so this has to happen fast.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.500
And I want to tell you about one
process or property of neurons

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.110
and another helpful
cell that enables

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.680
this to go extremely fast.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.940
And that is that there are
these glial cells in your body

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.000
and your brain that
wrap around the axons

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.720
of the neurons and basically
function like electrical tape

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.820
for neurons, OK?

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.540
So they are these--

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:32.320
there's electrical
insulation around the axons

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.760
of these neurons.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.360
And this is provided by
another specialized cell

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.830
type called a glial cell.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.260
So this is by a glial cell.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.960
And here are two
examples of glial cells.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.940
There are
oligodendrocytes-- and you

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.360
can see how the cell
is extending processes

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.530
that wrap around the axons
of these two neurons.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.990
Here's a Schwann
cell over here, which

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.300
again, wraps around the axon.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:12.420
And these cells basically form
what's called a myelin sheath.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.810
So they form a myelin
sheath around the axons.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:21.590
And that insulates the
plasma membrane of the axon

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.370
such that--

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.800
so here is an axon.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.290
You have glial cells
that are wrapped around,

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.170
and it sort of forms
like beads on a string.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:38.330
And so there are these gaps
between the myelin sheath

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:42.950
that are known as
the nodes of Ranvier.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:51.470
So there are these
nodes of Ranvier, which

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.740
are gaps in the myelin sheath.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.000
And these nodes perform
an important function

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.720
for the neuron, because
where the axon is wrapped,

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.200
the membrane is
electrically insulated.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.930
And so the sodium ions--

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.240
or the sodium channels
and potassium channels,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.170
the voltage gated ones,
localize to these nodes.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:22.190
And when the action potential
is traveling along the axon,

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.120
because these regions
where the myelin sheath is

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.600
are electrically insulated,
the axon potential

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.870
doesn't just move continuously,
but jumps from node

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.050
to node, such that you are
just opening the sodium

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.700
channels at these nodes.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.710
And that allows the
action potential

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.820
to travel about 100-fold
faster along the axon.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.470
And that's what
allows your neurons

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.420
to transmit these
electrical signals

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.820
from the base of your spine
to your foot so rapidly.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:59.570
So you get an increase in speed
because the action potential

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.250
is jumping from node to node.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.610
And one important
reason to bring this up

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.930
is because there is an
important human disease that

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.260
affects the electrical
insulation in the myelin sheath

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.140
here, and that's
multiple sclerosis.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.780
So we're going to unpack
multiple sclerosis in a couple

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.690
lectures.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.873
This is an autoimmune disorder.

00:31:29.873 --> 00:31:32.540
And so we're going to talk about
immunity later in the semester,

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.220
and we'll talk about
how that happens.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.890
But for now, I just
want to point out

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:40.610
that multiple sclerosis happens
when the immune system attacks

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:41.870
this myelin sheath.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.530
So in multiple sclerosis,
the myelin sheath is damaged.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.130
And if you damage this
electrical insulation,

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.730
you greatly slow down
these action potentials,

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.980
and that has a
significant impact

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:06.020
on nerve impulses in the brain
and throughout the entire body.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.760
And that's why
multiple sclerosis

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.110
is such a devastating disease.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.350
All right, I'm going
to start moving now

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.840
to consider more
than one neuron.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.730
So until now, we've
just talked about how

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.740
an electrical signal is sent
along the length of one cell.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.240
And now we're going to start
thinking about multiple neurons

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.780
and how they connect and how
neurons integrate information

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.750
from multiple other neurons
to decide whether or not

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:36.480
to send an action potential.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.440
And so if we consider this
connection right here,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.420
there's a synapse right here.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.720
Here's a cell that's
sending information

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:50.690
and a cell that is
receiving that information.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.120
When we're considering
a synapse--

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.350
so if we consider
a synapse, there's

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.410
a cell that is sending
the signal, which

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.020
is called the presynapse.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.950
This is the sender cell.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.080
And there's a postsynaptic cell.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:21.320
But you can have
more than one neuron

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.240
sending a signal to a neuron
at a given time, right?

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.420
So here, you have
one neuron that's

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.220
sending a signal
at this synapse,

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.160
but you might have another
neuron sending a signal

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.620
to a synapse on this
part of the cell.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.920
And you could have another
signal coming in here.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.960
And so this neuron
will then have

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.390
to decide whether or
not to fire an action

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:48.740
potential down its axon.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.100
And the way that the
neuron decides this

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.950
is to integrate the signals.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.910
So there's a signal
integration process.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:05.010
And what's important for signal
integration in a neuron is

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.680
whether or not the cell body--

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.010
whether the voltage increases
above a certain threshold

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.270
potential.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.880
So if the cell body
doesn't increase--

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.159
if the voltage doesn't
increase above this potential,

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.889
there will be no
action potential fired.

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:25.739
But if the voltage increases
above the threshold potential,

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:27.840
then it fires the
action potential

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.120
and signals to a
downstream neuron

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.590
or muscle or another cell.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:49.020
So here, it is the threshold
potential in the cell body

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.750
that determines whether or
not an action potential is

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:52.650
sent down the axon.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.260
And there are different
types of signals

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.948
that nerve cells can send.

00:35:01.948 --> 00:35:03.615
So there are different
types of signals.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.640
Signals can be excitatory,
meaning it will

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.940
tend to depolarize the neuron.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:25.110
So there are excitatory signals,
which result in depolarization.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.770
For example, with
serotonin, that

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.310
opens the sodium channel, and
that results in depolarization,

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.890
so that's an excitatory signal.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.590
But there are other
types of signals

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:44.460
that bind to different types of
receptors that are inhibitory.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.290
What might be a type
of receptor that

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:53.220
would inhibit this process of
sending an action potential?

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.930
What might an
inhibitory receptor

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:06.870
be to lower the chance that this
action potential will be fired?

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.960
What if I told you
it's an ion channel?

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.334
What ion would you
expect it might pass?

00:36:17.334 --> 00:36:18.830
Udo?

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.082
AUDIENCE: Potassium.

00:36:20.082 --> 00:36:21.040
ADAM MARTIN: Potassium.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.460
Udo is exactly right, right?

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.650
If it passes
potassium, then it's

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.080
going to make the
inside more negative.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.250
And that's what's known
as hyperpolarization.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:36.060
So receptors that result
in hyperpolarization

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.475
would have an inhibitory
effect on this process.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.330
And remember, if
you're hyperpolarizing,

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.630
then you could cause this
to actually go down and get

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.610
even farther away from this
threshold potential, right?

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.550
And if you have an
activating signal

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.860
and an inhibitory signal,
they might cancel out,

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.910
because one will depolarize and
the other will hyperpolarize.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:08.100
So it's in this way a neuron
is able to integrate signals

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.720
coming from different neurons.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.820
And that influences
whether or not

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:17.550
it will send the signal
to a downstream cell.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.010
OK, so now we're
focusing on what

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.790
is the communication between
one neuron and another.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.585
And this revolves
around this thing

00:37:27.585 --> 00:37:29.460
that's called the synapse,
which is basically

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.600
the gap between the axon
terminal of one neuron

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.355
and the dendrites of
a postsynaptic neuron.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.590
And so the way that
multiple neurons communicate

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.230
with each other are
through a type of signal

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:51.090
known as a neurotransmitter.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.220
And this is what
initiates the signal.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:58.770
So there's a signal initiation
process at the synapse.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.430
Initiation.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:04.860
And this involves the
presynaptic neuron

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.170
secreting a neurotransmitter.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.280
So the signal, in this case,
signals between neurons

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.980
are called neurotransmitters.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.090
And as you see on
the slide, these

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.080
are examples of
neurotransmitters.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.140
They're often derived
from amino acids,

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.940
and so they're small molecules.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.280
They're not the
proteins that you often

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.460
see with receptor
tyrosine kinase ligands.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.490
This is a different
class of signal.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.320
So one example is serotonin.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.200
And if you look up at those,
we'll find serotonin here.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.710
There it is.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:47.190
Here, you can see it's a
derivative of tryptophan.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.530
So it's a small
molecule, and it's

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:54.070
able to bind to a receptor
on the postsynaptic cell

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.650
and induce depolarization.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:02.770
And so neurons are-- the
way that they communicate

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:06.480
is-- neurons are a case of
where luck favors the prepared.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.340
Neurons are totally prepared
to send signals to each other.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.460
They have everything ready
to go when they get word

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.150
from upstream, and they're
ready to send signals

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.250
to the next cell.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:23.640
And that's because if
we look at the synapse

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:28.320
prior to an action potential,
everything is ready to go.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.200
The cell has
neurotransmitter, and it's

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.340
packaged in these vesicles,
and it's tethered to the plasma

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.970
membrane, ready to be released.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:41.000
So prior to the
action potential,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.400
there are vesicles filled
with neurotransmitter that are

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.110
docked at the plasma membrane.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.340
I abbreviate plasma
membrane PM, just so I

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.440
don't have to write it out, OK?

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.590
So these contain
neurotransmitter, right?

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.690
But you see in this
docked vesicle,

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.180
the neurotransmitter
is in red, and it

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.340
can't get out if
that vesicle does not

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.810
fuse with the plasma membrane.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:13.199
So these contain
neurotransmitter.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:26.120
But at this point, the
vesicles haven't fused.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.670
But the vesicle's not fused.

00:40:38.258 --> 00:40:39.175
When should they fuse?

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.190
In this system of neuron
signaling to each other,

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:50.730
when should the vesicle fuse
with the plasma membrane?

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:54.210
What should trigger
the fusion process?

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.466
Yes, Miles?

00:40:55.466 --> 00:41:03.158
AUDIENCE: So after
[INAUDIBLE] axon

00:41:03.158 --> 00:41:08.526
when it's time for
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:08.526 --> 00:41:10.965
that's when the vesicles fuse.

00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:12.840
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah, so
Miles is exactly right.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.070
If we consider my
diagram here, there's

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.460
an action potential
traveling along this axon.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.950
When it gets to
the axon terminus,

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.010
that should be the
signal for these vesicles

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:28.530
to fuse to the plasma
membrane and to release

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.990
neurotransmitter.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.960
So it's the arrival of the
action potential, right?

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.750
So remember, in
this case, serotonin

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.650
is going to be in blue.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.810
If serotonin is inside
my vesicle here,

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.890
it's going to need to exocytose.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:48.510
And now the serotonin is
going to be outside the cell,

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.220
ready to bind to the receptor.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.740
All right, so as
Miles pointed out,

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.470
you have an action potential.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.410
The fusion should be triggered
by the action potential.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.150
In order to fuse,
there needs to be

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:07.890
some signal inside the cytoplasm
to tell the vesicles to fuse.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.710
That signal is increased
calcium ion concentration.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.940
And then when
calcium concentration

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.700
increases in the
cytoplasm, that triggers

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.930
the fusion of these vesicles.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:25.200
And when you get fusion,
that's exocytosis,

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.380
and the serotonin is now
on the outside of the cell,

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.920
where it can travel across
the synaptic cleft and bind

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.340
to a receptor on the
postsynaptic neuron.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.535
So this fusion is when
neurotransmitter is released.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.750
Neurotransmitter
is released here.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.230
And the way that this increasing
calcium has to happen,

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:00.770
when the action potential
arrives at the axon terminus.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.070
So when it arrives
in the axon terminus,

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:07.390
there's depolarization
of that part of the cell.

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.820
And so there's a
special type of protein

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:14.680
called a voltage-gated
calcium channel.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.870
All these channels are very
selective for different ions.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.470
So a voltage-gated
sodium channel

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:24.610
isn't letting in all of
the ions outside the cell.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:26.410
It's selective to sodium.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:29.230
And this case, this
voltage-gated calcium channel

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.540
is just going to let in calcium.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.510
And then there's a mechanism
that links calcium entry

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.700
to vesicle fusion.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.630
And that's going
to be shown here.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.380
What you see on this
docked synaptic vesicle

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:45.310
is this calcium-binding
protein called synaptotagmin

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:47.380
that's present on the vesicle.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.710
And so when calcium
goes into the cytoplasm,

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:55.060
that protein binds to calcium,
and it activates the fusion

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:59.350
machinery such that the plasma
membrane of the vesicle fuses--

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.650
or the membrane of the vesicle
fuses with the plasma membrane

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:05.680
of the cell, thus releasing
the neurotransmitter

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.970
into the synaptic cleft.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.960
So this is what
starts the signal.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.430
Now, you probably know that
these neurons are not active

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:20.830
or on all the time.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.020
So something has to
terminate the signal, usually

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.280
quite rapidly.

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.780
So now I want to
talk about that.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.870
So like all signaling
pathways, signaling

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:35.000
is useless if you
can just turn it on.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.180
You have to be able to
toggle it on and off in order

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.240
for biological systems to
function properly, right?

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.890
And that's the
case with neurons.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.990
If you just turn
on a neuron and you

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:46.790
don't have a way to
turn it back off again,

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:47.915
then that's pretty useless.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.140
And so we have to have a
way to turn off the signal.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.330
And if we consider
the synapse, this

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:59.090
is the presynaptic neuron here.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:02.000
I'm going to draw a
postsynaptic neuron here.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:10.390
And neurotransmitter is released
by the presynaptic neuron

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:13.810
to the postsynaptic neuron here.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:19.670
Neurotransmitter is released
into the synaptic cleft.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:23.690
So the sort of
extracellular region

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:27.275
between these two neurons is
called the synaptic cleft.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.770
So now the cell just
dumped a whole boatload

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.650
of neurotransmitter into
the synaptic cleft, right?

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:41.650
How is it going
to turn this off?

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:42.650
What does it have to do?

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:49.538
Yeah, Stephen?

00:45:49.538 --> 00:45:51.250
AUDIENCE: It could absorb the--

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:55.208
take back in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:55.208 --> 00:45:56.750
ADAM MARTIN: Stephen's
exactly right.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:58.460
What Stephen
suggested is, is there

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.360
a way for the presynaptic
neuron to reabsorb

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.670
this neurotransmitter
and, thus, recycle it?

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.560
So it could either
reabsorb it or degrade

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.870
the neurotransmitter.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:17.510
Different process for
different neurotransmitters.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.810
For serotonin,
there are channels

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:23.990
that are present in
the plasma membrane,

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:29.450
and these mediate
reuptake of the serotonin.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.520
So you have channels
that are basically--

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.860
after the neurotransmitter
is released,

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.670
it sucks the neurotransmitter
back into the presynaptic cell

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:41.510
such that it can then reuse
the neurotransmitter later on.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:53.570
And so this process of reuptake
highlights a very important

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:56.690
process that's been
utilized by drug companies

00:46:56.690 --> 00:47:00.200
to create antidepressants.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.250
So antidepressants
like Prozac and Zoloft

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.620
affect this reuptake process.

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.920
And what that does is it
keeps the neurotransmitter

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.700
in the synaptic cleft
for longer, such

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.990
that it enhances the signaling.

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:17.420
And so the idea
behind these drugs

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.940
is that if you are
suffering depression

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.790
from a lack of
serotonin, then you

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:27.830
can rescue that by
preventing the rapid reuptake

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:30.320
of the neurotransmitter
into the cell

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.170
after the synapse is stimulated
and the neurotransmitter

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:34.670
is released.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:46.240
And so Prozac, Zoloft,
these are a class

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:53.500
of drugs that are known as
selective serotonin reuptake

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.220
inhibitors.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.600
It's kind of a mouthful.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.860
This is abbreviated SSRIs.

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:12.220
But the way they function is
to leave the neurotransmitter

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.140
in the synaptic
cleft for longer so

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.420
that you enhance
signaling, even if you

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.750
have low levels of the
neurotransmitter to begin with.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.710
I also want to point out that
if we look at this diagram here,

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.070
the synaptic vesicle
fuses, and then this

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.870
releases the neurotransmitter.

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:40.090
But all the machinery
on this vesicle

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:44.470
is recycled by endocytosis such
that it can be reused again,

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:45.220
OK?

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.890
So cells are really
good at recycling stuff.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:51.850
If this is sort of the membrane,
you endocytose and then

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:56.760
you can use it
again later on, OK?

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.460
And so there's recycling not
only of the neurotransmitter,

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:04.090
but also all of the machinery
on the synaptic vesicles

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.320
that are responsible
for the fusion event.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.660
All right, now I want to
end by just telling you

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:14.230
how this experiment
works, where we're

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.860
able to activate specific
neurons in a brain

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:23.680
and that leads to the
animal sort of waking up.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.480
So in a normal neuron--

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.750
so this is the last
part, optogenetics.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:32.110
And I'm going to go
through this very fast.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.510
But normally, you need
a neurotransmitter

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.850
to induce depolarization.

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:39.610
But what optogenetics
is, is an approach

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:44.140
to control the activity
of a cell with light, OK?

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.300
So in this case,
we're going to have

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.880
light inducing depolarization.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.510
And the way this is done is
there's a protein discovered

00:49:55.510 --> 00:50:00.800
from photosynthetic algae
that's responsive to light,

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.580
and it is a sodium channel.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:12.400
And this protein is called
channelrhodopsin, specifically

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.590
ChR2.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:18.550
And this is a light-sensitive
protein where light

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.800
induces sodium channel opening.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.515
So that's going to
depolarize the cell.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.490
And what you can do is if
you have a gene that you know

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:37.060
is specifically expressed
in a certain type of neuron,

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.870
you can take the promoter and
enhancer region of that gene

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:44.920
and hook it up to this single
component, channelrhodopsin,

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.970
that open reading frame, using
recombinant DNA technology.

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.450
And if that's expressed
specifically in the neurons

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:54.340
that you're trying
to test, you can then

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:58.090
shine a light into the brain
of the organism and activate,

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:00.550
specifically, this
type of neuron.

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:04.060
And that allows you to test
the function of the neuron

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:06.320
in the behavior of an organism.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.710
So, in this case,
this mouse, the light

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:10.660
is shined into its
brain, and they're

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.540
testing a specific
type of neuron

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:18.220
that is involved in arousal
of the mouse, and it wakes up.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.330
Oh, it's not playing.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:26.020
So here, this is the
brain activity on the top,

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.970
and the muscle
activity on the bottom.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:30.340
So you're going to see light.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.090
There's the light.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:31.590
You see it?

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:34.880
Light going into the brain.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.930
They induce light at that
frequency for a while.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:41.890
And then they're
going to wait and see

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.150
when the mouse wakes up.

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:46.107
And it's going to
wake up right now.

00:51:46.107 --> 00:51:46.690
There it goes.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:47.200
It woke up.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.230
You see now its muscle
activity is going, OK?

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.080
So you can test the function
of specific nerve cells

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.480
using this approach,
and it's because you

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.830
have a light-sensitive
sodium channel.

00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:58.880
So I'm done for today.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.990
Have a great weekend.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.160
I will see you on Monday.

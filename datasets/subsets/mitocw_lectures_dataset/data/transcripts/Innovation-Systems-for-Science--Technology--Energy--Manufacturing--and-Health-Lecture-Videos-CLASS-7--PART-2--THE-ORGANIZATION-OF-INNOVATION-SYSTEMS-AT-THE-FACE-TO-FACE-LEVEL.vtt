00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:25.690
SANAM: --the founding
of Genentech.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.780
Yeah, so a little bit about
these two people, first.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.150
We have Herbert Boyer,
who was born in 1936.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.210
He was a biochemist
from Pennsylvania,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.710
an orchard in
Pennsylvania, and then

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.130
worked at the University of
California in San Francisco.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.890
And he's, sort
of, considered one

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.660
of the first pioneers in the
field of molecular genetics.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.430
And we also have
Robert Swanson, who

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.360
was born 1947 and died in 1999.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.220
He was from Brooklyn,
went to MIT,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.250
and then eventually got
into venture capital.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.080
And he was instrumental
in finding Genentech

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.130
and, kind of, developing the
financing structure for that.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.480
So here's a list of some other
players that were involved.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.720
They kind of came in throughout
the process of various towns

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.370
that were recruited, both,
nationally and internationally.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.330
Boyer worked with Arthur
Riggs and Keiichi Itakura

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.280
from the Beckman
Research Institute,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.460
and the group had become the
first to successfully express

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.740
a human gene in bacteria when
they produced somatostatin

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.700
in 1977.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.730
And then David Goeddel
and Dennis Kleid, as well,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.780
were brought on later
on, in 1978, I believe.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.880
Yeah, and they went on to
be instrumental figures

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.830
in the company as well.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.370
So I'll go into a little bit
about what they accomplished--

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.270
just, sort of, the early
history of the company.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.950
They really were
the first, kind of,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.340
kickstarted the American
biotech industry.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.840
And it all started when the
two of them kind of met--

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.690
Boyer and Swanson met over
beer and lay down $500

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.570
to start this
pharmaceutical company that

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.523
would explore
proteins that bacteria

00:02:15.523 --> 00:02:16.690
could be engineered to make.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.270
And they first
targeted human insulin

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.720
because that was, kind of, a
competitive area at the time.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.745
And there was a lot of
demand for treatments,

00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:30.370
but there was a worry
that there wasn't

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.390
enough supply of animal insulin
to meet this rising demand.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.820
So they kind of
decided on working

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.100
to make synthetic
insulin up to scratch

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.460
and be competitive with
what was previously used.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.530
And they targeted
meeting the requirements

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.250
of Eli Lilly, who they, kind of,
wanted to get his business to--

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.750
they targeted his
requirements, they

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.125
could get his
business eventually

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.840
and get the company going.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.330
So getting money was
kind of a tough process

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.120
throughout the entire time.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.960
They both really staked a lot of
their career on this endeavor.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.720
And Swanson, at the
time, was very young

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.820
and went through many
periods of unemployment

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.030
as he was trying to get the
money for financing this.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.860
And Boyer continued
his day job teaching.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.070
So eventually-- so they ran
into many obstacles financially,

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.020
but they also, at
the time, when they

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.870
decided to target humans
insulin in the first place,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.082
that kind of kickstarted a
nationwide race to do this.

00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:34.540
And so there was
a group at Harvard

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.700
and another group at some--

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.705
another university
in California.

00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:39.900
I'm blanking on the name.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.780
But, yeah, they were
particularly formidable rivals,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.310
and they had those
other two groups

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.420
who were, kind of,
entrenched in academia.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.290
And they had all the resources
that that brought them,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.460
whereas Boyer and Swanson
were relatively resource-poor.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.400
But they had one advantage--

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.320
Boyer was working with
synthetic DNA, which

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.410
would allow him to get around
regulations that the NIH put

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.230
on natural DNA
during this process.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.130
So they faced a lot
of other obstacles,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.290
but they still had
advantages-- other teams still

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.800
had advantages of scale
and sales ability.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.540
Swanson's goal was
to make Genentech

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.820
a fully integrated
pharmaceutical company,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.380
and they wanted--
the eventual goal

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.520
was to be able to produce and
sell a wide range of drugs.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.380
And they believed
that if they were

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.020
the first to make
the insulin, that

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.680
would give them the lift up in
the industry that they needed.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.400
So Swanson went on a hiring
spree and recruited talent.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.890
We were able to open up
their own lab, eventually.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.800
He was able to get 100k
from various sources

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.870
for that initial push.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.560
So eventually, by
August of 1978,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.240
they were able to
make their first 20

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.980
nanograms of the insulin.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.410
And they immediately
contacted Eli Lilly,

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.720
and Swanson kind of
went against convention

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.300
and had this huge televised
press conference, where

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.733
he announced that
they had achieved

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:01.900
what they wanted to achieve.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.820
And that kind of did
what he intended,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.460
and put Genentech--
really put it on the map

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.840
in the public eye.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.830
And eventually,
Eli Lilly's company

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.620
came forward with $10
million for Genentech,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.950
and they were eventually
able to fast-track it

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.980
for industrial production.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.200
And in 1980, they
had their IPO, and it

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.700
was one of the most spectacular
IPOs seen from this industry.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.070
And they were
eventually able to--

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.220
in 1985, they were able
to release a second drug.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.602
And these are some of
the early products of--

00:05:37.602 --> 00:05:38.564
thank you.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.840
Yeah, so going on to the types
of qualities of great groups

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.560
that we've been talking about.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.080
So I think one of
the main things

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.880
was Swanson's leadership.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.520
So the article mentioned that he
had a very down-to-earth style

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.670
and was well-connected
with everyone

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.640
who was involved, as well
as a great generosity

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.550
towards everybody.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.420
And so he was-- he
offered, basically,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.570
everyone, from the top
scientists to the custodians,

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.030
a share of the
company at one point.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.090
And he had a really great--

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.650
effective recruitment of talent.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.890
He was able to see
where they needed people

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.500
and how they could
fill those positions.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.010
Another really important
element is that there

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.590
was a real conviction of cause.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.220
So Boyer initially wanted to
get into commercialization

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.525
because he felt that
university research

00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:37.400
and government-funded
research wouldn't allow

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.580
him to see the real benefits--
practical benefits--

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.450
of his work.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.570
So it's kind of a really
altruistic goal of his.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.420
And that mission kind of carried
them throughout this process--

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.830
that they were
going to be making

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.018
something that would better
people's lives, save lives.

00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:56.810
Another important
element is that they were

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.670
working against a common enemy.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.790
So it wasn't exactly an
enemy, but they were--

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.290
there were those other teams
that they were working against,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.600
and that competition
really fueled them.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.250
And going along
with that, they were

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.890
kind of like the underdogs
and the young company

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.620
that didn't have the resources
and didn't have the funding,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.730
so that really was another
motivating factor as well.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.990
Another one is optimism
and a degree of naivety.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.040
So that kind of came into play
when they first made insulin,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.070
but Eli Lilly said
that they needed--

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.140
had put really strict
timeline on them

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.020
for developing it for
industrial production.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.465
And most people would have
said that that was impossible,

00:07:35.465 --> 00:07:37.340
and that they couldn't
do that in that frame.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.370
But they were none the wiser
and kind of went for it anyways

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.640
and it ended up
working out for them.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.450
Another thing is that the
people were not interchangeable.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.407
So like I said
before, they were--

00:07:49.407 --> 00:07:50.990
that list of players
that I showed you

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.960
were very instrumental in
their very specific expertise

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.570
that they brought
to the project.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.400
Also that there was
relative freedom

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.800
for a lot of the scientists
involved in Genentech.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.300
So one of the
things that Swanson

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.620
did to get people on board,
especially David Goeddel,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.708
he said that they could
still have the freedom

00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:10.750
to publish under their
own name, even though they

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.700
were contracted to Genentech,
so that was a real incentive

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.540
for people to join them.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.990
And lastly, there was a
really casual environment

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.060
in the office--

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.770
T-shirt attire, and there wasn't
any strict rules or a sense

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.610
of top-down management.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:36.405
So some other dynamics that
I think are important--

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:38.280
this was an interesting
case of a great group

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.780
because it came at
a time when there

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.539
was kind of a changing
relationship between science,

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.260
and business, and academia,
and the commercial sector.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.490
And Boyer's journey
was pretty interesting.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.200
He started out
firmly in academia,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.230
but he chose to
look beyond that.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.410
His words, like I said-- his
words at the initial meeting

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.910
with Swanson--

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.940
about wanting to see the real
practical benefits of his work

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.260
kind of carried the
whole team throughout.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.710
But the flipside of that was
that in the early history

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.950
of Genentech, he was a target
for academic scientists, who

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.338
dismissed the idea that
corporate science would ever

00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:14.880
be able to achieve
the kind of things

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.130
that they would be
able to achieve.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.620
And his move to
commercialization

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.728
really drew the
animosity of academia

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.770
because he was one of the
first of many scientist

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.180
at the frontier of
molecular biology, who

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:32.190
sought to capitalize on the
commercial opportunities.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.220
And one of Swanson's, and
Boyer's, to some extent,

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.950
strength was their
ability to recognize

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.760
the exact moment
in basic research

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.580
in molecular biotechnology that
was most beneficial to open it

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.910
up to a commercial endeavor.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.660
So they were able to combine
an extensive knowledge

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.460
of the science that
they're trying to do

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.330
and also the business acumen
needed to move it forward.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.940
And this really set them apart
from other big drug companies

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.290
at the time, and, I think,
ultimately contributed

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.120
to their great success as well.

00:10:09.928 --> 00:10:13.700
So this is a quote about
Swanson, who was really,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.650
kind of, one of
the first figures

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.370
who was able to really
bridge that partnership

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.350
between science and business.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.290
So in a way, you can
kind of think of him

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.630
as like an advocate for
the scientists that he

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.490
was representing and the
people at Genentech who

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.390
were looking to really
advance in this field that

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.380
was quite new.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.820
So I guess one of--

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.410
going on to, sort of,
discretion questions,

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.020
one of my main questions was--

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.890
did the relative newness of
this field and this industry

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.190
really help them?

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.100
I mean, did that
offer opportunities

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.190
to Swanson and Boyer that
maybe more established industry

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.633
or field would not have?

00:10:53.633 --> 00:10:54.300
Did that allow--

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.925
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So I'm going to put

00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:57.960
that on hold for just
a second and just throw

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.490
a couple of framing points out.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.980
But I think that's
a key question,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.190
and I'll lead up to that, Sanam.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.440
This is the first
biotech, right.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.130
This creates the model.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.590
And as you point
out, this combination

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.430
of Boyer and Swanson is a
fascinating combination,

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.550
because they are, as you put
it, able to kind of bridge

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.710
this divide between
business and science,

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.390
and that is the
inherent brilliance

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.830
of the biotech model.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.990
And these folks really
figure out how to do it,

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.570
and Genentech, to this day,
is an extremely successful

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.500
company.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.370
So it has been able to keep on
that innovation pathway, which

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.510
means that the culture
that they set up here

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.070
has been able to keep
innovation occurring

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.515
on a kind of ongoing basis.

00:11:50.515 --> 00:11:52.890
And some of the points you
made, Sanam, just to emphasize

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.098
some of the points you made--

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.350
The fact that Boyer and Swanson
allowed their researchers

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.020
to do their own
publishing, right,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.540
that they didn't treat
what they were working on

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.700
as a complete trade secret--

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.330
that was a huge enabler in
enabling the academic community

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.680
to kind of enter
into these biotechs.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.120
In other words, their academic
role was going to be respected.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.100
Their role as researchers
and scientists

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.110
who contributed in
general knowledge

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.910
was going to respect it here.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.810
And that created a rule
in this biotech that

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:33.310
prevails to this
day, and it very much

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.600
influenced that kind of model.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.180
But the ability--

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:45.390
So in the biotech model, and
Swanson and Boyer pioneer this,

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:50.480
they create this
revolving door capability.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.990
So in other words, scientists at
universities now in the United

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.910
States that work in life
science areas and related areas

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.450
are able to have careers,
whether in the Academy--

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.140
they move to a biotech as a
scientist for a period of time.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.060
They can move back
to the Academy,

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.800
right, taking their
advances with them.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.370
In other words, they can
move between these sectors,

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.800
so there was, in
European science,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.420
an historical
upstairs-downstairs treatment,

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.270
right?

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.100
The academic
scientists thought they

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.860
were in curiosity-driven
basic research

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.930
and should have nothing
to do with the, kind of,

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.290
ugliness and, kind
of, downstairs

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.800
of commercialization
of products.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.940
And that these worlds
ought to be kept separate.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.480
And biotech is the first
really serious attempt

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.540
in the Academy in
America to kind of bridge

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.740
these worlds effectively.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.450
And they do, brilliantly.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.990
And part of it is,
as you point out,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.180
Swanson is a chemistry
major at MIT.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.120
So he is not afraid of
science, just as you suggested.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.770
He understands what it is.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.230
He has the ability
to be in the room

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.960
with these academic
scientists and be in the game.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.520
But he also comes to this
with early venture capital

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.120
experience.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:13.790
So he first goes to work
on Sandhill Road in Silicon

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.350
Valley, outside Stanford.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.830
And they're only
interested in doing IT.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.800
They have no idea about
this biotech stuff.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.000
So he has to leave this major
event-- early venture capital

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.360
firm that he's with and
essentially starve, eat

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.060
hot dogs for months
at a time as he

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.740
tries to figure
out how is he going

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.520
to work in this biotech area?

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.330
And famously, he, as Sanam
suggested-- famously,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.800
he starts cold calling.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.840
He has this idea
that bioengineering

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.140
is going to be this
incredibly creative new field.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.840
He's aware of it from
his own training.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.180
So he starts cold
calling scientists

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.100
that are working in this
bioengineering field.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.790
He only has to get to the
bees, right, to Boyer.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.653
And then they have this famous
meeting at Churchill's Pub,

00:15:06.653 --> 00:15:08.320
where they actually
so much hit it off--

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.480
exactly as Sanam described--

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.120
Boyer is concerned that if
he just stays in the Academy,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.330
nothing he works on is ever
going to get out, right?

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.920
And he wants to
get his stuff out.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.640
He truly believes this.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.320
He is not out to get rich here.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.390
He is really out to get--

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.910
to save people and get the
technology out the door.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.530
So there's a statue
in front of Genentech,

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:38.200
to this day, that pictures Boyer
and Swanson sitting at the bar,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.300
each putting the $100
down on the table

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.690
as they toast each
other with beers.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.090
That's what you see when you
drive in and see the company

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.960
headquarters at Genentech.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.070
And that's symbolic, I think,
of what's happening here.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.460
These folks figure out how to
make a really workable marriage

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.570
between business
and science that's

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.600
remarkably productive on
both sides of the world.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.370
Boyer is totally ostracized
for doing this, right?

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.890
He faces tremendous
recrimination

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:13.390
at UCSF for having gone
this commercial route.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.180
And it's only when they come up
with these stunning successes

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.680
that the scientific
community really

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.120
has to rethink the kind of
way that it went after him.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.610
So this was not easy for
either of these players,

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.660
but it's a really--

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.000
it's a fascinating
moment, in a way,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.250
creates a culture
that, to this day,

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.010
kind of still dominates
that whole sector.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.080
That's a fair summary.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.240
Now, let's come back
to your great question.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.150
Why don't you just pose it
again, quickly, Sanam, and then

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.798
we'll do it.

00:16:40.798 --> 00:16:41.298
SANAM: Yeah.

00:16:41.298 --> 00:16:42.890
Do you want to say something?

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.380
AUDIENCE: Actually, I
had a curiosity question.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.020
I was wondering, well--

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.813
You had mentioned the ability
to publish under their own name.

00:16:52.813 --> 00:16:54.230
Was there anything
else that might

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:59.030
have spurred the success
of this marriage,

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.190
as you put it, between
academia and business?

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.490
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well that's
[INAUDIBLE] recruitment tool.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.630
In other words, if you
leave academic research--

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.569
university labs-- and come
to work for Genentech,

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.359
you don't have to abandon
your academic career.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.670
You can still keep
doing your research work

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.339
and building your research
reputation while you're

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.300
working at a company.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.540
And that's what that enabled.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.339
So it enabled
academic researchers

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.119
to feel that they weren't
leaving the universe that they

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.450
had-- that had nurtured them.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.500
They could continue doing
terrific academic work, as well

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.130
as practical work in this
kind of company setting.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.330
And that was very reassuring,
and it was a great--

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.670
it broke down a whole
divide between the worlds,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.970
because previously, in
pharmaceutical companies,

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.680
everything was secret, right?

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.050
Everything was
treated as a trade.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.640
So there was no
outside discussion

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.790
allowed until patents occurred.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.860
This really changed
that culture.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.468
But Sanam, restate
your question,

00:17:59.468 --> 00:18:00.760
because it was a very good one.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.690
Let's go back to it.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.130
SANAM: Yeah, so my
question was, do

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:09.920
you think that the fact that
this field was so new and so--

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.545
starting very few
years before that

00:18:12.545 --> 00:18:14.920
really helped them or afforded
them certain opportunities

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.670
that they might not
have been able to have

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.260
in a more established,
entrenched field or industry?

00:18:22.494 --> 00:18:24.800
AUDIENCE: I'd say
absolutely-- because there

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.240
was no previous infrastructure.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.280
There was no
establishment to fight.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.650
There was just the
scientific challenge

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.278
and then trying to
commercialize it.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.070
Of course, I mean,
there were other-- there

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.200
were other companies that were
trying to do these things,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.450
but because it wasn't as
established as, I don't know,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.030
coal, or the railroad industry,
or something like that.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.600
I think it certainly
made things a lot easier.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.920
The market was a lot more fluid,
and they had a lot more areas

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.822
to expand into.

00:18:53.822 --> 00:18:55.530
AUDIENCE: I think not
only that-- sorry--

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.500
there is also a lot
more room for error,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.500
especially as they're
getting started initially.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.900
They're able to experiment.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.050
They have more leeway in the
way they can market and present

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.617
their product, because there
is no established market.

00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:12.950
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
someone could share, maybe,

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.450
what they thought the regulatory
challenges that they didn't

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.040
face were?

00:19:19.246 --> 00:19:22.050
AUDIENCE: I mean, I think it was
mentioned that they pretty much

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.810
used the ability to use
synthetic DNA in order to get

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.790
over a lot of regulations.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.230
Also, it's relatively early.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.880
Nowadays it's a lot harder.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.638
I think the price point to
make a drug is over a billion.

00:19:34.638 --> 00:19:36.430
Back then, I really
don't know what it was.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.280
So really it was a
great opportunity.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.040
Also their investors
were Kleiner Perkins.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.027
Also one of them was--

00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:43.860
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.600
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: --Swanson
had originally worked for,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.183
and then had to leave, because
they didn't want to do biotech.

00:19:48.183 --> 00:19:51.270
But he went back to
them with this advance,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.923
and they gave him some money.

00:19:52.923 --> 00:19:54.340
AUDIENCE: And I'm
pretty sure they

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.790
were in different spaces
that are difficult.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.820
They would have helped.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.775
But the investors were
adequate in that space.

00:19:59.775 --> 00:20:00.900
AUDIENCE: What about Chris?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.770
Do you have any thoughts on
the regulatory challenge?

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.280
AUDIENCE: Yes, so definitely
using synthetic, kind of,

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.930
molecules in an
approach definitely

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.620
helps, because you can surpass
that whole clinical challenge,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.920
which not only is hard to pass,
but also takes a long time.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.420
right?

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.470
And especially,
they were mentioning

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.000
there was a real time crunch.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.650
A lot of groups were doing this
kind of approach and research

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.613
in this field.

00:20:26.613 --> 00:20:28.530
They really had to be
the first ones out there

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.510
so they could
establish themselves

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.510
as the leader and the real
innovators in, kind of,

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.610
this new biotech field, so.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.257
I think their
approach was smart.

00:20:37.257 --> 00:20:38.340
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.580
I mean, this is a moment where
there's a deep concern that

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.340
comes up from the public, but
also in the academic community

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:52.410
itself, about the implications
of this genetic engineering,

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:52.980
right?

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.438
I mean that's what
Genentech stands

00:20:54.438 --> 00:20:55.920
for-- genetic
engineering, right?

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.930
That's what they're all about.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.770
And there's a major effort
to put this whole movement

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.690
on pause, right.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:08.450
And there is an outcry in the
city council in Cambridge,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.660
here--

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.330
a wild hearing by
the city council

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:17.045
trying to shut down related
research at Harvard and MIT,

00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:19.170
because they're very worried
about the implications

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.712
of what's going to
be happening here.

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:23.580
So then there's an effort by
the scientific community--

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.030
this famous conference called
Asimolar out in California,

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.090
where the whole community comes
together and kind of really

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.890
begins to work
through the ethics.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.910
But their principal competitor,
Wally Gilbert at Harvard,

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.960
is forced, because of this
limit on genetic engineering

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.540
and the ability to
use genetic DNA--

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.473
he has to go to England,
where they're still

00:21:44.473 --> 00:21:45.890
allowing that
research, and enlist

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.780
a whole group of
British scientists

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.130
to undertake his research.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.790
But Swanson and Boyer get around
that by using synthetic DNA,

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.290
and they avoid the whole outcry.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.990
So it's a very
interesting development.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.620
It slowed down their
competitors pretty considerably.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.880
Wally Gilbert was a great
talent to be up against--

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.443
I mean, a famous scientific
leader and researcher.

00:22:09.443 --> 00:22:10.860
AUDIENCE: I didn't
do this reading

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.420
or know that much about the
genetic backgrounds at all,

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.978
but were the
pharmaceutical companies

00:22:16.978 --> 00:22:18.020
at all their competitors?

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.250
Or are they very much so
focused on just chemicals?

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.900
AUDIENCE: I think
Boyer really came--

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.980
you saw that drawing
with the pseudo--

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.840
that's a bacterial plastic DNA.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.100
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let's
go back to that, Sanam--

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.808
that original picture
of the two of them.

00:22:33.808 --> 00:22:36.047
AUDIENCE: And you insert
your synthetic gene into it.

00:22:36.047 --> 00:22:37.380
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: There it is.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:37.660
AUDIENCE: That--

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.285
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:38.285 --> 00:22:39.270
AUDIENCE: --rectangle.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.270
He basically came up with--
that wasn't in existence before,

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.760
and now it's used every day, in
almost every molecular biology

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.260
lab.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.220
Yeah, so they don't think
that the pharmaceuticals

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.330
were onto this.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.080
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, looking at that,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.087
you can try and guess which
one went to the Sloan School,

00:22:56.087 --> 00:22:56.587
right?

00:22:56.587 --> 00:23:02.697
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:02.697 --> 00:23:03.405
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:23:03.405 --> 00:23:05.280
They're wearing the same
kind of tie, though.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, Boyer almost never

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.008
looked that good,
let me tell you.

00:23:10.008 --> 00:23:10.800
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.688
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:11.688 --> 00:23:13.020
They look pretty similar.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.650
I mean, also, Swanson
was chemistry every day

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.327
at MIT and then Sloan masters.

00:23:18.327 --> 00:23:19.410
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.172
AUDIENCE: He was like
pseudo-Sloan [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:21.172 --> 00:23:22.255
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: How about
another good question, Sanam?

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.850
SANAM: So something that some
of you who had read this kind of

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.655
raised, and I was curious
about as well, was--

00:23:33.655 --> 00:23:36.838
so the initial years,
because it was so new

00:23:36.838 --> 00:23:38.380
and because they
were doing something

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.838
that hadn't been
done before, there

00:23:39.838 --> 00:23:42.830
was an increased amount of
risk-taking that was needed,

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.670
and they both really
staked their careers on it,

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.590
especially Swanson,
who ended up having

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.190
to check himself into hospital
when they had setback.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.620
So I wonder if
there's, kind of, a way

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.480
to encourage more sustainable
risk-taking in people who

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.900
have the visions, like Swanson,
and people who are starting up

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.300
endeavors like this?

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.808
So there is a way to make it
that they are incentivized

00:24:10.808 --> 00:24:12.850
to take these risks that
are necessary to further

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.512
their careers, but also,
maybe not to the point

00:24:16.512 --> 00:24:17.220
that Swanson did.

00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:22.120
AUDIENCE: At this
point, I've led

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.680
three innovation groups, where
I teach, sort of, people--

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.170
not just students, but people--

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.880
the engineering design cycle.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.100
And I think one of
my big takeaways--

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.050
having taught students as
young as five years old

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:40.317
to individuals as old as
in their 50s, maybe 60s--

00:24:40.317 --> 00:24:42.400
is that there really needs
to be a sense of safety

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.930
and security-- which was
something that was brought up,

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.608
I think, in the
Biederman reading--

00:24:45.608 --> 00:24:47.650
which is, I think, one of
the reasons why there's

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.020
that, sort of, big paradigm
of founding a company out

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:50.930
of your dorm room.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.930
Because there's something
that's implied there--

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.710
which is that you
have a place to live.

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.040
And that if you attend
an institution where

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.198
you have a dorm, you
also have access to food.

00:24:59.198 --> 00:25:01.240
And you're also not super
concerned about getting

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.300
a paycheck.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.110
And so, I think that
sense of security,

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.470
sort of both mentally, to sort
of take a step back and explore

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.160
your dreams, is really important
into the sense of stability.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.570
Like, literally, access to
shelter, access to food,

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.890
access to health care
becomes really important.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:22.390
So in those circumstances,
I feel like universities--

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.140
and not just, maybe, in
their undergraduate programs,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.570
but maybe universities
generally-- provide

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.520
really interesting
opportunities to innovate

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.100
for these kinds of very
disruptive innovations,

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.830
because they do provide
this real holistic support

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.150
to an individual.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.270
But that's still a theory
that I'm working under

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.560
and sort of hope to
continue exploring over,

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.880
maybe, a master's
thesis or a PhD.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.282
But I think the other really
big point about mental health

00:25:49.282 --> 00:25:51.490
is something that was also
addressed in the Biederman

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.950
reading, and it goes back
to that sense of safety

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.660
and security that, a lot
of times, individuals

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.380
who don't feel
comfortable in their,

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.180
sort of, organic or natural
ecosystem feel more stressed,

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.180
and thus, that prevents
them from being productive.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.520
And so, I think about
that in the context

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.275
of the current
political situation

00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:18.150
and the ways in which,
maybe, some people who

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.100
might be interested in
innovating or pursuing

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.410
innovative projects,
may not be able to do

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.530
so effectively because
of the ways in which

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:30.120
the political situation is
literally motivating stress

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.930
in their lives and is
preventing them from innovating.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.190
So those are some thoughts.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.210
I have a lot of them.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.767
[INAUDIBLE] share those too.

00:26:37.767 --> 00:26:39.600
AUDIENCE: I mean, on
the other side of that,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.060
I think this-- the
aspect that having

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.390
stress, a necessary
stress, is important.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.390
I think with the
Manhattan Project--

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.280
like there's no
safety and security

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.130
in thinking the Germans are
going to get the bomb first.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.230
I mean, I couldn't think
of a better impetus

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:59.370
than this has to work, or I
don't have a house to live in,

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.320
or food to eat.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.302
AUDIENCE: Well, actually,
that's actually not what

00:27:05.302 --> 00:27:06.510
they had to deal with at all.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.970
I mean, granted, they
would say, yeah, oh, we

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.790
don't have any lives, but--

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.450
so I kind of agree, but--

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.607
I mean, Oppenheimer did
mention in that paper

00:27:15.607 --> 00:27:17.190
he went six months,
and he didn't even

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.640
realize he had a paycheck--
he hadn't received one.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.410
And I saw that,
and I just thought

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.610
that was such privilege.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:30.640
So the fact that someone
could have that sense of, OK,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.280
well if this--

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.960
ignoring the implications
of, obviously,

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.470
failing on this project, outside
of the Manhattan Project,

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.200
any other technological
pursuit, I

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.420
think that definitely
helps someone

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.780
think more creatively
when you think about, oh,

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.190
how am I going to
pay for my car?

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:48.990
Or how am I going
to get to work?

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.997
Or whatever.

00:27:49.997 --> 00:27:52.080
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So one
of the important rules,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.330
I think here, is
that the group needs

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.737
to be on a protected island.

00:27:55.737 --> 00:27:57.570
And the point you're
adding, Steph, I think,

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.580
is a significant one.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.898
It needs to feel secure
in itself, right?

00:28:01.898 --> 00:28:03.690
People have to be
comfortable in this group

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.970
to be willing to be creative
together and contribute

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.090
to each other.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.720
I think that's an
important perception here

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.160
that probably applies to
a lot of these groups.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:12.660
But--

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.880
AUDIENCE: --has to do
with that scarcity--

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.160
why having too
little means so much.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.660
You don't have
your full bandwidth

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.742
if you're worried about
what you don't have

00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:22.950
and what you need to work on.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.320
So that's part of creativity.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.270
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Sanam, did this group

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.430
have that sense of security?

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.020
SANAM: I think from what I
read here, they definitely did.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.875
I mean, a lot of them were--

00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:36.250
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
You don't see

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.410
in this picture the whole team,
but there's a whole team here.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:38.770
SANAM: Yeah, there's a whole--

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.502
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It's very
collaborative with this duo.

00:28:41.502 --> 00:28:43.960
SANAM: Yeah, and I think that
that was an interesting point

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.080
about--

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.620
I did kind of get
a sense that class

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.265
came into this in a way
that really benefited--

00:28:52.265 --> 00:28:53.890
he went into
commercializing because he

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.770
had an altruistic vision,
which is interesting.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:00.520
But he had that
ability to not have

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.580
to worry about making
money and things like that.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.330
So I think that's a
very interesting point

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.130
that you all have raised.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.790
And yeah, what you're
saying about how

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.150
people who feel like they
are actively under threat,

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:15.220
or they actively don't have
the basic necessities taken

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.890
care of, would not be
able to function, maybe,

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.610
in the way that make
those innovations that--

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:20.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:21.680
They're on an island.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.910
They're not starving
on the island.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.530
SANAM: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.405
AUDIENCE: I think an
addendum that would be--

00:29:25.405 --> 00:29:27.540
have any of you read
When Breath Becomes Air.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.770
It's a book by Paul Kalanithi.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.590
He was a neuroscientist,
who was a resident,

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.330
I believe, at Stanford.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:39.670
[INAUDIBLE] neurosurgeon, who is
a medical resident at Stanford,

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.280
who's just about to complete
his neuroscience residency when

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.480
he was diagnosed
with brain cancer

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.350
and ended up passing
away, just shy

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.530
of completing his residency.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.790
But there's a really
incredible portion

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.890
in his memoir, where
he talks about what

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.740
he had to do in order to be
able to achieve what he did,

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.200
which is, essentially, after
going to Stanford undergrad,

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.590
he spent a year,
essentially, being homeless,

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.340
living in an abandoned home
and taking classes at Stanford

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.150
while studying for the MCAT.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.523
And I think there's a really--

00:30:09.523 --> 00:30:11.440
the reason I recommend
everyone read this book

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.857
if they're interested
in, sort of,

00:30:12.857 --> 00:30:15.160
becoming innovators, or
entrepreneurs, or people

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.790
who change the world
is that he elicits

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:23.980
a really great point
about not necessarily

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.270
just quote unquote male
privilege, but just privilege,

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.090
generally, because he
was able to, sort of,

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.667
opt out of being
alive and utilize

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:32.500
whatever money his
parents were sending him,

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.570
or whatever money he
had saved up, in order

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.150
to take these classes, in
order to study for the kind,

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.480
and then go on to do incredible
work in medical school

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.020
and then in residency.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.470
And I feel like that's,
sort of, close as you get

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.320
and the clearest,
sort of, articulation

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.010
of the process of giving up your
whole life in order to pursue

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:52.325
this big dream that you have.

00:30:52.325 --> 00:30:53.950
And so, Paul Kalanithi's
book, I think,

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.408
is a really, really great study,
not just of a great group,

00:30:56.408 --> 00:30:58.630
but of a great individual,
and a person who's

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.180
sort of a risk taker, and
willing to give up their life

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.980
for their work, and
then ultimately,

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.660
obviously the conclusion
of it is quite beautiful,

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.920
and the narrative
arc is there, but--

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.200
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And these
folks are giving up medicine

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.865
to pursue the dream.

00:31:12.865 --> 00:31:15.210
AUDIENCE: We're also looking
at the winners, though.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.752
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: We're only
looking at the winners, right?

00:31:19.577 --> 00:31:21.160
AUDIENCE: I would
say that pretty much

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.360
every biotech entrepreneur ends
up with ulcers and high blood

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:25.930
pressure.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.420
That's just-- they do.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:27.920
And--

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.270
AUDIENCE: Or is it
every entrepreneur?

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.062
AUDIENCE: Probably.

00:31:31.062 --> 00:31:32.812
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
She only said biotech.

00:31:32.812 --> 00:31:33.580
You're safe.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.550
AUDIENCE: I know I'm more
familiar with the biotech side.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:40.780
But I think that because these--

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.940
I think that's also
a characteristic

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.350
of the great group leaders--

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.480
that they're able to
take risks and get ulcers

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.090
so that the rest of their
team can feel the insulation

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:56.680
and as though they have the
opportunity for success,

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.820
resources, and security.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.035
So I that's an aspect of this.

00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:04.410
SANAM: Yeah, I agree.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:08.410
There was a quote in the paper
that the scientist at Genentech

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.920
had no boss other than the
Swanson's nervous vigilance,

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.490
so that really carried
them through [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.448
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's
a great line, Sanam.

00:32:16.448 --> 00:32:17.680
That's good.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.390
All right, let's
do Venter, Lily.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.230
LILY: OK.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.550
So I'm going over the Craig
Venter great group today.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.530
A few of you have heard of him.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.330
Most have not.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.980
The leader of the great group,
of course, was Craig Venter.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.140
And just going through some
of the Bennis and Biederman

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.920
necessities of great groupness,
or greatness in a group.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.740
His mission from God was
to sequence and decode

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.430
the human genome-- so check,
we have a mission from God.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:51.390
The island-- in this
particular case study,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.550
while they were decoding
sequencing and decoding

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.160
the human genome, their
island was Celera,

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.180
which was a biotech that was--

00:32:59.180 --> 00:32:59.908
it's complicated.

00:32:59.908 --> 00:33:01.950
I'm going to try to keep
it as simple as possible

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.410
for the purposes of
this presentation.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:10.470
Just know that Craig Venter
had many, many for-profits

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:14.390
and non-for-profits institutions
all running at the same time.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.140
He now has now more
than he even used to,

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.970
so I'm just really going to talk
about Celera for the purposes

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.680
of this presentation.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.090
And then the mainland-- he has
connections with the public.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.630
There's a lot of publicity going
on at this time over the Human

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:32.480
Genome Project.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:38.730
So that's sort of their highway
to the public, or the mainland.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.470
And he has contacts,
still, at the NIH

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.990
and adversaries at
the NIH as well.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.540
And they are,
indeed, the underdog.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.380
Craig Venter's great
group defect from the NIH,

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.680
and they're up against
funding from the US government

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.480
and, actually,
international collaboration,

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.775
especially with the
British government.

00:33:58.775 --> 00:33:59.400
And the enemy--

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.230
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Sorry--
I think it's actually Watson

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.700
rather than Crick, right?

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.540
LILY: Oh.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.070
Yeah.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.040
Sorry.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.820
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.320
OK.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.890
LILY: It is Watson.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.333
I put the wrong one in there.

00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:11.250
No, Francis Crick had
nothing to do with this.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.758
It was Watson.

00:34:12.758 --> 00:34:15.300
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And Watson
was heading the Genome Project

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.610
at NIH at the time.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:17.110
LILY: Yeah.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:17.400
Yeah.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.380
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
he drives Venter out.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:26.969
LILY: And Venter and Watson
begin as a very powerful duo.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:30.389
And Venter thinks
that the genome needs

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.179
to be sequenced in a
slightly different way,

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:37.440
and Watson is not OK with
that, because so much money

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.260
and so much effort
has been put into it--

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.500
the sort of outdated way.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.110
And he completely
undermines Venter in front

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.429
of US Congress, et cetera.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:48.971
And I'll get into
that a little more.

00:34:48.971 --> 00:34:50.820
But yeah, basically,
the enemy is

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.219
anyone who pisses
off Venter, which

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:57.330
turns out to be quite a lot
of people over the years.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:01.830
Venter-- Craig Venter, I
think, is one of the more--

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:04.410
one of the most
controversial scientists

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:06.450
in biotech in our time.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:13.650
He's a very-- a little
bit of a hothead, and he--

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.350
people in science either
love him or hate him.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.430
So a little bit of background.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.570
His early life-- he's sort of--

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:27.780
he is reminiscent, for
me, of Thomas Edison.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.980
He has some severe
learning issues,

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.490
almost flunks out of high
school, does not go to college.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:39.000
He ends up a surfer bum
in Southern California

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.370
on Redondo Beach.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.360
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Now
I want to add one fact.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.120
Not just one parent,
but both his parents

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.625
were Marines sergeants.

00:35:46.625 --> 00:35:47.250
LILY: Yep, so--

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.030
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You can only
imagine what that does to you.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.960
LILY: From this
militant household

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.740
and decides that
as soon as he is--

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.290
I think he's 17 when he
graduates from high school.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.330
He decides, I'm
getting out of here.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.660
I'm going to live in Redondo
Beach, in a surf shack,

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.860
and grow my hair out
long, and wear cutoffs.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.675
So that was his, I think,
rebellion against his parents.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.630
This is during the
time of Vietnam.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.752
Venter realizes-- he comes
from a military family, first

00:36:16.752 --> 00:36:18.960
of all, so I think he has
a somewhat a sense of duty.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.570
But he also realizes that he's
probably going to get drafted,

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.840
and it's better for him if he
joins the Navy voluntarily.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.980
He's actually an extremely
good competitive swimmer,

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.673
possibly Olympic quality.

00:36:30.673 --> 00:36:32.340
So he joins the Navy,
thinking that he's

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:38.190
going to be on the swim team and
not actually see active duty.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.022
And this turns out to be--

00:36:41.022 --> 00:36:42.480
couldn't be farther
from the truth.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:51.420
Vietnam ramps up, and
he is trained as an EMT

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.920
and deployed to Da Nang.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.755
And he actually has two active
deployments in Vietnam--

00:36:58.618 --> 00:37:00.910
sees some things that I think
changed his life forever.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.020
In the interview,
he talks about how

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:08.590
he is the person he is because
of his time in Vietnam.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.890
He survives and attends
community college

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.570
in California.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.990
Transfers to UCSD, which is
University of California San

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:23.240
Diego, gets a BS and
then a PhD there.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.435
I think he completed
his PhD in three years.

00:37:25.435 --> 00:37:26.800
It was the fastest--

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.780
at that time, it was the fastest
biochem PhD in UCSD history.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.420
He goes immediately to a
faculty position at Buffalo,

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.610
in New York.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.860
Interesting transition
for him, yeah.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.740
That's part of the interview.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:45.400
He talks about how he's this
Californian with long hair

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.600
and then goes to goes to
Buffalo, where he begins

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.080
to make people angry, actually.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.400
So he starts young on his path.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.070
So he marries his PhD
student, Claire Fraser.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.930
He's very clear that they get
married after she graduates,

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.200
so there's nothing
wrong with that at all.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.880
And in 1984, he leaves
Buffalo, pretty much so

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.790
that she can start her--

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.820
prove herself as her own
scientist at the NIH.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.210
And I think this is where
the great group really starts

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.360
to coalesce and starts to form.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.780
Some sequence of events.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:30.820
So while at the NIH,
Venter is traditionally

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.030
trained as a neuroscientist
working in receptors.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.340
So is Claire Fraser.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.830
They have separate
lab at the NIH,

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.960
but something that Venter
gets really interested in

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.220
is molecular biology.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.530
He sees it as this field
that's going to explode,

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.410
is extremely important,
and is, basically,

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.750
our path to future medicine.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:55.900
So he starts to try to get
funding to do molecular biology

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.760
experiments and get
into this field,

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.933
buy the machines necessary.

00:38:58.933 --> 00:39:00.600
And he's totally
stonewalled at the NIH.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.642
He's basically told, no,
you're a neuroscientist.

00:39:02.642 --> 00:39:05.650
You can't work in this
other stovepipe at the NIH.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.640
That's just not done.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.680
It won't work.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.510
So he becomes increasingly
and increasingly

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.695
frustrated with the
bureaucracy, basically.

00:39:13.695 --> 00:39:15.070
And he says that
he looks around,

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.580
and he sees people who are
lifers at the NIH, who just

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.860
go through the motions
of being a scientist, who

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:26.230
couldn't really compete in
the academic, or the outside,

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.990
world.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.980
So he does something
a little maverick.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:38.313
He creates this-- he's
reading about and hearing

00:39:38.313 --> 00:39:40.105
about the Human Genome
Project because it's

00:39:40.105 --> 00:39:42.160
a big initiative at NIH.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.140
And he decides,
well, if they're not

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.390
going to let me get into
molecular about biology

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:47.950
and sequencing the
human genome, then

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:52.600
I'm going to sneak
in by, basically,

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:58.930
sequencing a gene
involved in neurobiology.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.533
So he does that, and he
invents this thing called EST.

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:03.700
And I'm not getting into it.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.950
Honestly, it's such
an outdated thing

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:10.780
that I didn't even learn
about it during my studies.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:16.417
And then Watson and
Venter have met.

00:40:16.417 --> 00:40:19.000
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So Watson
is running the huge Human Genome

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.470
Project at NIH.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:21.970
LILY: Right.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.150
Venter comes up-- he has
the sequence of this gene.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.360
He's made some pretty cool
breakthroughs and goes in

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.380
and meets with Watson.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.900
And Watson gets excited
about it at first.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:37.930
But then, Craig Venter goes
off and, kind of, procures

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.135
a machine, sort of
behind Watson's back--

00:40:40.135 --> 00:40:41.830
it's what Watson thinks--

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.690
and makes Watson really mad.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:47.050
So he totally
undermines and vilifies

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.720
Venter in front of
Congress and the US public,

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.570
because this is a huge--

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.760
this is a huge initiative.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.760
People are talking about
it at the dinner table.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.480
It's a big deal back in
the mid-1990s, I would say.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:07.700
So Watson basically doesn't like
the way Craig's doing things.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.200
So--

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:08.650
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So let me just

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.000
add one quick detail, Lily.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.570
So there is an
issue here on what

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:17.410
gets patented on a project
like the human genome.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.080
Can you patent
the genome, right?

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.840
So this whole
issue is coming up.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:29.050
The general counsel
at NIH advises Venter

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.840
that, yes, we are going
to be able to patent

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.250
a lot of this emerging genetics
field, so let's protect--

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.390
he's a researcher for NIH.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.170
So he's intramural
researcher at NIH.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:45.940
Let's protect NIH by filing a
lot of the patents ourselves.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.430
And the confrontation
with Congress

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:55.330
is where Watson attacks
Venter for patenting genome

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.740
technologies.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.240
In other words,
it's not going to be

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.967
available to the
scientific world.

00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:01.300
It's not going to be open based.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.190
It's not going to
be in the commons,

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.730
even though Venter
had received--

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:09.250
had been told by the general
counsel's office at NIH

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.510
that that's what he had to do.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:15.080
So that leads to this
explosion of anger by Venter.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.270
LILY: Yeah, so--

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:17.530
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Is
that a fair summary?

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:17.820
LILY: Definitely.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.110
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: OK.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:20.180
LILY: Yeah, from Venter's
side of the story,

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:25.330
he says, I didn't necessarily
want to patent these genes.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.160
The NIH advised me to.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.960
It was their initiative.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.050
And Watson used it as
a way to undermine me

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.750
in front of the American
public because he

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.210
didn't want me to use my
technology that I had come up

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.380
with.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.650
So that's the-- sort
of the backstory.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:47.020
Venter is insanely angry,
and he and his wife

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.500
defect from the
NIH and form Celera

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.420
with the help of
venture capitalists, who

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.870
later also anger Venter,
and that explodes.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:59.650
And they take with them 12
men of their lab members

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.450
from the NIH.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:03.350
So the team.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.380
And I think that Craig
Venter really exemplifies

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:10.120
a great group leader in that he
seems able to identify talent

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.130
in others.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.800
So they start out
with the 12 from NIH.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.710
They have their
island of Celera.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:20.170
And the team that
they start to form--

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:25.270
this is not including the
board of directors and such,

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.880
which also seemed to be
pretty amazing people.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.800
But they recruit Hamilton--
actually I think--

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.550
Well, Hamilton Smith
comes onto the scene,

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.237
and he's their premier
molecular biologist.

00:43:36.237 --> 00:43:38.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
he's a Nobel Prize winner.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:38.710
LILY: Did he?

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:39.106
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:43:39.106 --> 00:43:39.502
LILY: OK.

00:43:39.502 --> 00:43:39.900
At--

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.340
AUDIENCE: Was that during
the time period or after?

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:41.760
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Prior.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.180
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:42.650
LILY: Yeah.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.150
Yeah.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:45.953
So I don't think any of--

00:43:45.953 --> 00:43:48.370
this is actually a question
I'm going to pose to the class

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:49.810
at the end of my presentation.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.450
I don't think anyone
in this great group

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:55.840
has won a Nobel Prize, except--

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.950
like for this.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:57.917
Previously Ham Smith.

00:43:57.917 --> 00:43:59.000
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.260
LILY: So Marshall Peterson
is this computer geek

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.800
because not only is Hamilton
Smith literally coming up

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.830
with the sequencing
technology to do this--

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.310
this is 30 billion
base pairs of DNA.

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:15.610
The most anyone has sequenced at
this point is like C. elegans,

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.320
or like a worm--

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.430
tiny, tiny genome.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.560
So this is a huge deal.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.320
They have to come up with
new sequencing technologies,

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.750
new ways to decode the
sequence, and new computing.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:32.440
So they literally build
the third largest computer

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.350
on the planet, I think.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.470
The DOE has a larger
computer, and there's someone

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.760
somewhere else in the world.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.720
And they build this
massive computing facility

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.530
and then bring on Gene
Myers as this coder who's

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.680
coming up with the algorithms
to try to piece together

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.400
all these little pieces of
DNA and build a 30 billion

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.440
base sequence.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:05.320
So in the meantime,
the public sector--

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.970
academia, the NIH-- are
becoming increasingly angry

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.370
with Craig Venter,
saying that he's

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.590
defecting to the
private sector, and he's

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:17.650
going after the human
genome for profit.

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:19.690
Craig is saying, I don't--

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:21.010
I'm not in this for profit.

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.050
I'm in this because
we need a human genome

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.950
so that we can promote human
molecular, biology-based

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:28.330
medicine.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:32.020
In the meantime, he sequences
the drosophilid genome

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.160
and gives it--

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.240
publishes it in science.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:35.740
Gives it--

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.170
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Fruit fly.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.220
LILY: Yeah, the fruit
fly genome, which people

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:43.720
have been trying to figure
out what genes in fruit fly

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.530
do for decades and
decades and decades.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.110
And so, there's this
really cool part

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:51.460
in the interview where he talks
about this community of fruit

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.180
fly researchers, who, I think,
are kind of like the physics

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:54.680
community.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.080
And they're pretty close-knit.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.850
They have their
conferences, and they

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:02.590
try to get together, and
decode the fruit fly, which

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.620
they don't have the basis or
the knowledge to do that yet.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.060
So they're doing it gene by
gene by gene over many years.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:14.870
And Craig decodes the
fruit fly genome and says,

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:16.780
come to Celera.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.270
I have all of the information
that you've been looking

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:20.780
for the past few decades.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.180
And you can have it.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.120
It's here.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.490
So he says, maybe on the
order of 100 or so fruit fly

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:28.297
researchers come.

00:46:28.297 --> 00:46:30.130
And they are just like
kids in a candy shop.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:31.920
They stay up all
hours of the night

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.840
and making these
breakthroughs that they've

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.360
been looking for for decades.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.970
So that's pretty
fun, pretty cool.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:47.020
So fruit fly sequenced, NIH.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:51.190
You would probably know
more about the interplay

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.730
between Francis Collins
and Venter, because that--

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:56.645
I don't-- I'm not-- it's
a little fuzzy for me.

00:46:56.645 --> 00:46:58.020
I can never figure
out if they're

00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.970
working together or
against each other,

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:04.500
but eventually, what
happens in 2001--

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.100
the NIH and the public--

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.040
like academia, so people
from different universities--

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.960
come together and
publish the human genome

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.030
in the journal Nature.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.192
And two days later,
Celera announces the--

00:47:18.192 --> 00:47:19.400
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Same day.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.120
LILY: Oh it is the same day?

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.100
It comes out in Science.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.695
So this is--

00:47:24.695 --> 00:47:25.930
AUDIENCE: Was that planned?

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:26.220
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:26.720
LILY: Yeah.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.070
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So there had to be--

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:31.380
I mean it's a
fascinating story, right?

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.990
And there's rich
MIT history, which

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:38.840
MIT was on the side of
NIH, just so you know.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:47.000
So Venter, through
a research model

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.160
that was extremely
focused on getting

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.230
this project done, right?

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.690
Everything was to be
organized for the project.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:56.270
NIH is on a research
model that could

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.780
be described as, let's
let 1,000 flowers bloom.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:03.680
We'll have a lot of RL1
researchers out there.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.310
Eventually, that will turn
into the Human Genome Project.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.220
Someone made the analogy
to that research model

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.910
as, OK, if you put a whole
lot of monkeys into a room

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:15.860
and give them
typewriters, eventually

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.590
we'll get Shakespeare, right?

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.870
It's obviously
exaggeration here,

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:23.390
but Venter, with his
very focused research

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:26.030
project, and these computer
scientists, and Venter himself,

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:28.400
becomes a master
of the computers

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.550
that he's working on
building, and EST technology

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:34.480
is from that--

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.110
versus a much more decentralized
research operation.

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:43.550
So slowly NIH realized,
it's going to lose the race,

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:45.280
unless it gets its act together.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:53.340
So they begin to
focus on getting rid

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:54.460
of the 1,000 flowers.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:58.470
Let's get down to a small number
of focused research centers.

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:07.480
And it's a race,
really, between--

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.640
who's that Broad Institute head?

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.390
What's his name?

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:15.100
Oh, how can I forget?

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:15.613
Eric Lander.

00:49:15.613 --> 00:49:16.280
Yeah, of course.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.530
Sorry, excuse me.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.930
So Eric's a mathematician.

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.720
He's not a life
scientist, right?

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:31.040
And he becomes the leader of the
Human Genome Project for NIH.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.870
Collins is heading
it, but Eric is

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:35.500
the one who's carrying out
the computational parts of it,

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:36.230
right?

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:39.590
And they do it in cooperation
with this Department of Energy

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:42.230
supercomputer labs, because they
need their own supercomputing

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.860
capability.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.380
Venter's built his.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.940
NIH uses DOE.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.730
So this race is ongoing.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.640
The NIH crowd is
attacking Venter

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.030
constantly for, essentially,
trying to profit

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.213
from patenting the genome.

00:49:58.213 --> 00:49:59.630
That's their
complaint-- that he's

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:03.170
going to take this critical
scientific advance,

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:05.870
critical to the
future of medicine,

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.630
and take it out of circulation
and access to science,

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.730
and patent it, and prevent
anybody from using it.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:14.650
That's the case being
made against him.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:18.440
It's pretty far, in reality,
from what the truth is,

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.030
but that's the case being made.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:26.910
And Eric and the NIH
team are gradually--

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:29.100
they are using some of
Venter's technology.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.960
They're originating,
certainly, many of their own.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.390
They're within range.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:36.090
So at that point,
a negotiated truce

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:39.300
is arranged so that nobody
gets embarrassed here, right?

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.390
And the real worry was that
NIH would lose the race, right?

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:46.160
So eventually, Venter is
prevailed on to declare a tie,

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.880
and each side will
publish, in the two

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:52.630
major scientific publications,
their version of the genome.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:54.480
And that's, in
fact, what occurs.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.677
It's-- Go ahead.

00:50:56.677 --> 00:50:58.010
LILY: Two points I want to make.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:00.340
One is that in this
interview, Venter

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:06.250
says that he finds out that
Francis Collins, the head

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:10.060
of the NIH, has
budgeted less than half

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.310
of what it's going to
take at their current rate

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:13.810
to complete the human genome.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.360
So in his mind, Collins
has no intention

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.640
of really completing it.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.720
And they can't-- as
the way things stood.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.710
The other point I wanted
to make is that the NIH--

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:29.463
Venter's enemies and
adversaries keep bombarding him

00:51:29.463 --> 00:51:30.880
in the public by
saying he's going

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.240
to profit off the human genome.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.140
And there is a little--
there's actually

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.560
a lot of friction between Venter
and his venture capitalists,

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.360
because he wants to publish.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.173
Publish, publish,
publish the findings

00:51:42.173 --> 00:51:44.590
that they're making so that
other people can utilize them.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.358
And the venture capitalists
keep saying, no, we

00:51:47.358 --> 00:51:48.650
don't want-- you can't do that.

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:49.400
You can't do that.

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.440
It's private.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.180
We want to patent, et cetera.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.490
So there's that
friction going on.

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:59.050
So yes, eventually
published at the same time.

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:04.000
Celera actually-- Venter is--

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.022
both quits and is fired from
Celera at the same time.

00:52:08.022 --> 00:52:09.290
And--

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:10.940
AUDIENCE: Which one came first?

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.680
LILY: In Venter's mind, he
was about to quit anyway,

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.620
but yeah, he was basically asked
to leave on a Monday morning.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.580
AUDIENCE: He's truly the
Steve Jobs of biology.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:20.080
LILY: Yeah.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:20.770
Yeah.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.285
Yeah, there are a
lot of parallels.

00:52:22.285 --> 00:52:25.350
AUDIENCE: Even the hippie phase.

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:29.140
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: But
Martine, he's different, right?

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:32.170
He creates this group,
originally, at his NIH lab.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:34.090
It's basically still
with him, right?

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:34.740
LILY: Yeah, they
want to follow him.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.823
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:52:35.823 --> 00:52:39.340
This is not Jobs's abrasiveness,
right, and screaming.

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.360
This is somebody who is really--

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:43.810
he's a pretty
charismatic figure.

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:46.090
I've spent a little
time with him.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:49.600
And he is able to keep an
absolutely remarkable team

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.810
together for a remarkably
long period of time.

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:57.130
So it's a different personal
atmosphere, a different kind

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:58.780
of leadership style.

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.530
But remember what it
must have been like.

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:04.540
I mean, he comes back
from the Vietnam War

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.290
full of Navy and Marine
Corps tattoos, right?

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:13.968
He's a veteran of this
ghastly war, and he's been--

00:53:13.968 --> 00:53:15.510
he's seen some of
the worst outcomes,

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.420
running a whole hospital
wing, virtually on his own,

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:22.500
in Da Nang, and sees
death and loss of life,

00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:26.280
and trying to save
life, firsthand,

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.380
in a very personal kind of way.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.640
He's completely different than
the kind of culture of NIH.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.280
He's up from a working
class, military family,

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.910
and it's just a different world
that he's been exposed to.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:40.830
And he doesn't get
along with this kind

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:45.310
of established liberal
community of scientists at NIH.

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.790
So that's part of what's going
on here, I think, really.

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:48.540
LILY: Yeah, I think what's--

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.210
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: He's just
a really different character.

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:54.080
LILY: What's always
pushing him at the NIH is

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.610
and throughout the
Human Genome Project is,

00:53:56.610 --> 00:54:01.860
decode the human genome so
we don't see the situation,

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:04.850
or the things that he saw
in the hospital at Da Nang.

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:07.500
He doesn't-- he thinks
that modern medicine should

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:12.570
eradicate those
sorts of injuries.

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:14.400
His vision is synthetic biology.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:14.957
Regrow.

00:54:14.957 --> 00:54:16.290
Regrow everything synthetically.

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:18.130
Regrow human limbs.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:20.220
He's very forward
thinking as far

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.060
as the medical uses
of knowing genetics.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.310
AUDIENCE: I had this question.

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:29.600
So what exactly were they
trying to patent on either side

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.650
that we see?

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.960
LILY: Lots of things.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:39.730
So I think that one worry
was that his invention--

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:47.170
Craig's method of EST
would be patented itself.

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:50.350
And it's an extremely-- it
was for a-- well some areas

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.430
of biology still use it.

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:53.680
Not my particular field, but
a lot of areas of biology

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.230
still use it.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:59.880
And if it were patented, they
wouldn't be able to, obviously.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.790
So it's widely applicable.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:03.200
It's technique.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.345
And there was worry that
he would try to patent EST,

00:55:06.345 --> 00:55:07.220
or there might have--

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.160
I think there was a
patent in, and the NIH

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.577
pulled it, or
something like that,

00:55:10.577 --> 00:55:13.330
with so much negative press.

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:15.730
There were a couple of other
things up for patent, maybe,

00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:17.838
but I don't know the specifics.

00:55:17.838 --> 00:55:20.130
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Why don't
we get in some questions.

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:20.830
LILY: Yeah, OK.

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:21.070
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Do
you have any more slides?

00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:22.480
LILY: But I wanted
to let you know--

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:22.580
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Oh.

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:22.630
Oh yes.

00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:23.020
OK.

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.010
LILY: What does he do?

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:24.510
So Celera--

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:26.510
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: This
is what he's doing now.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:29.540
LILY: Celera goes boom
with the dot come bubble.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.880
It's worth $15 billion, and
the stock goes from 500 bucks

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.700
to $6.

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.430
At that point, Craig
had already left.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:41.770
One of the reasons that the
stock dropped so drastically

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:44.780
was because people found
out that Craig left.

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:47.800
So now-- well not now,
but then, he decides,

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.660
well I'm going to
do my own science,

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.848
and I'm going to sequence
the entire ocean.

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.140
I'm done with the human genome.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.680
Now I'm going to
go to the ocean.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.550
So he gets on this 100 foot
yacht-- the Sorcerer II.

00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:00.520
And a couple of people--

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.940
I taught with a woman
who's a professor at USC,

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:07.450
who was on some of the
Sorcerer legs of the journey.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:09.760
And then her husband,
John Heidelberg

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.400
is on-- he was on my
thesis committees,

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.900
so he's the third
author on this paper.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:18.243
And they have lots of fun
Craig stories as well.

00:56:18.243 --> 00:56:18.910
And one of the--

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:21.130
I think one of the themes
throughout the great groups

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.410
is that, there are
a lot of partiers.

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:26.070
If they're not doing
really crazy, good science,

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.454
they're partying.

00:56:27.454 --> 00:56:30.580
So they dock, and they just
have the big huge party.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.710
So then he finishes
sailing around the world

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:36.040
a couple of times and sequencing
all the bacteria in the ocean

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:40.360
and sets up the JCVI, which
is located in La Jolla,

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.810
right next to his
alma mater, UCSD.

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:46.400
So that's a picture of
Craig from a few years ago.

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.498
So to conclude, a few
choice quotes from Craig.

00:56:49.498 --> 00:56:51.040
"I've gotten some
pretty nice awards.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.460
And I'm having trouble finding
places to put them all."

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.830
And then one that's more
pertinent to this class

00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:00.740
is, "The environment has fallen
to the wayside in politics."

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:04.120
And lastly-- oh, I wanted
to go over Venter's thoughts

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.240
on innovation, but that's not--
we're getting close on time,

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.540
so that's not really necessary.

00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.540
These are better.

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.240
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: How
about some questions?

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:16.510
LILY: OK, so show of--

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:19.670
I wanted to see, in the
class, by a show of hands.

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.570
Who thinks that Venter, or
maybe a couple of people

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:23.380
within his group--

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:27.970
I mean, they decoded the
human genome, which was--

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:30.490
just the amount of new
technologies that they came up

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:33.070
with, both in computing
and molecular biology,

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.090
in order to do that
are astounding.

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:38.560
So who in here would say he
should be a Nobel Prize winner?

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.518
Or people in his group?

00:57:39.518 --> 00:57:41.018
AUDIENCE: I'm sure
there's got to be

00:57:41.018 --> 00:57:43.680
some other equivalent,
biology-centered award, right?

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.660
AUDIENCE: I mean, he could just
make his own award and then.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:46.285
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:46.285 --> 00:57:48.595
LILY: Well, he's got a
lot of them [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:48.595 --> 00:57:49.970
AUDIENCE: I mean,
but [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:50.980
give out your own award.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.480
AUDIENCE: If there's a
Watson and Crick award,

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.729
and he wins it, imagine how
hilarious that would be.

00:57:54.729 --> 00:57:56.312
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That won't happen.

00:57:56.312 --> 00:57:58.600
AUDIENCE: --it was self-critical
and then was like--

00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.260
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Watson.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.100
AUDIENCE: Oh, Watson.

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:00.460
LILY: Yeah, sorry.

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.502
AUDIENCE: When they started,
a lot of their stuff

00:58:02.502 --> 00:58:04.560
was based off of
Schrodinger's What is Life?

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.510
That's how they come up with the
DNA, because it was mentioned.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:10.520
And they were seen as
nobodys up to that point.

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.520
It's really interesting.

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.228
AUDIENCE: Lily, can
I ask a really simple

00:58:13.228 --> 00:58:14.240
semantic question?

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.540
Why do they call it
decoding, and not encoding,

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.640
the human genome?

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.180
LILY: I think it would be
called decoding because--

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.555
AUDIENCE: You're
only reading it.

00:58:22.555 --> 00:58:25.510
LILY: What this looks like
when you actually read

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:28.390
the bases is fluorescent dye.

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:29.920
So you have to read--

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:33.190
you have to decode the
fluorescent signature in order

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:34.460
to get the base pairs.

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.130
AUDIENCE: So it's not about--

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:40.540
it's about, more so, evaluating
the results than it is about,

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.620
sort of, expressing the result?

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.370
LILY: Yeah.

00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:45.720
Yeah, I would [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.595
AUDIENCE: They also did
something cool that's

00:58:47.595 --> 00:58:49.210
you inject DNA into
like a bacteria

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:51.400
and it changed the way it was.

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.530
[INAUDIBLE] changed
the lifeform.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:54.220
I was--

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: One thing
about this effort here--

00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.680
you have to get a sense
for how transformational

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.840
this seemed in the 1990s,
because it was really

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.490
quite amazing.

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:06.550
But this was one of the
great scientific competitions

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:07.720
of all time, right?

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.870
This incredible race to do the--

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:12.250
to decode the genome.

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:15.410
And this is being--

00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:17.500
this a major news story, right?

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.860
And Francis Collins has
a Harley motorcycle,

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.290
and sings in a
blues band, and he

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:26.480
has his own fast-- he still
rides his motorcycle into work

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.300
at NIH.

00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:34.180
Venter is a yachtsman, who
buys these wild, incredibly

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:40.180
dangerous sailboats and loves
that kind of wild adventure

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:44.800
of being in a tempestuous
sea, close to the wind,

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:49.410
and near capsize danger,
with these monster sailboats.

00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:52.310
So both of them have their,
kind of, wild side here.

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:54.580
There's no question about it.

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:58.890
But this competition captures
the public imagination.

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.530
And it's a very important
race, because the race

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:05.280
forces incredible
speed in the project.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.830
So what had probably
been originally viewed

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:10.710
as a 40-year project
that gets knocked down

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:13.050
to well less than a
decade by the time

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:15.450
these characters kind
of complete the race

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:19.710
and agree to a truce by
publishing on the same day.

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:23.100
And in turn, I was
working in the Senate

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.520
while this is all going on.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.090
And the public was
getting a sense, gee,

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.560
we really are
getting fairly close

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.040
to some absolutely
fundamental answers, here.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.580
And when two US senators--

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.350
Senator Specter
and Senator Harkin

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:39.660
from Pennsylvania and
Iowa, respectively--

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.230
were chair and ranking on the
appropriations subcommittee

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:45.000
that handles NIH.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.530
They actually-- there's was--

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:48.990
in the Clinton years-- because
of the IT revolution is

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:51.750
creating a lot of
extra tax revenue--

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:52.920
were balancing the budget.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.480
So there's revenue, on
one of those rare moments,

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.530
there's revenue in the federal
government Specter and Harkin

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.600
go down and take the revenue.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.600
And that's what doubles NIH.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.870
And nobody says they're wrong
because of the excitement

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:10.150
that this race to get to
the genome has created

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:13.090
and what it's scientific
possibilities are.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.750
So sure, there's a
whole political effort

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.000
to radically
increase NIH funding,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.610
but the enabler here is
the public excitement

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:23.950
around the genome race and
what its possibilities might

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:25.480
be to accomplish.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.810
So this has enduring,
kind of, lasting effects

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.790
that spill over in
many kind of ways

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:34.500
into the life science arena.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.430
Next question.

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:38.730
How about-- you want to
pose a couple of questions,

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.407
and then we'll wrap things up.

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:43.740
LILY: Yeah, one of the things
I was thinking about while

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.740
reading this and the other
readings in the class

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:51.120
is that Venter seems to
form and dissolve and reform

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.580
multiple great groups
throughout his lifetime--

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:56.100
from the 80s to present day.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.955
And in thinking
about other great--

01:01:57.955 --> 01:01:59.580
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
But Lily, he's only

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.110
changing the formal structure.

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:04.360
The team really follows him
from one organizational model

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:04.860
to another--

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.190
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's true.

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:06.760
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: In many way.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:09.150
LILY: So do we think
that most great group

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:11.520
leaders have a great--

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.390
one great group, and
that's their opus.

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:18.000
They don't go on and--

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:18.970
they have one mission.

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:22.070
AUDIENCE: When you say group,
do you mean a following?

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.670
Or a team?

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:24.502
LILY: One team.

01:02:24.502 --> 01:02:26.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
mean, I would disagree.

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.620
Well just a counterexample
I'll give is Apple.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.870
Because there is the Mac
team-- those are very unique.

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:32.470
So I'll take certain products.

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.400
Or if it's a one particular
problem, you have a group.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.768
And them you can choose
to decay the group after.

01:02:38.768 --> 01:02:41.310
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah, Apple
is remarkable for its ability

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:45.570
to go from one major technology
launch to another in sequence.

01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:46.290
It's really--

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:47.660
AUDIENCE: It's hard, yeah.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.785
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: --very
hard and very difficult.

01:02:49.785 --> 01:02:53.487
And interestingly, it hasn't
happened since Jobs died.

01:02:53.487 --> 01:02:54.570
AUDIENCE: That we know of.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That we know of, yeah.

01:02:58.935 --> 01:03:01.270
AUDIENCE: Who else
is a [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:02.770
AUDIENCE: I feel
like they'd release

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.308
some information
about that, seeing

01:03:04.308 --> 01:03:07.692
as how the hype around Apple's
kind of starting to die down.

01:03:07.692 --> 01:03:09.650
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
There's a model in history.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:11.520
I mean, how does a
big company innovate?

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.670
It's a terribly
difficult problem, right?

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:14.420
They're the suits.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.190
They're the bureaucracy.

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:19.730
Lockheed is kind of noted
as the experimenter here.

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:23.360
They set up something
called the Skunk Works

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.180
as a completely side,
separate organization

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.770
on a protected
island, with a bridge

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.930
back to the Lockheed management.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:36.660
And they do remarkable advances
in aeronautics and aerospace.

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:39.380
So they do the U-2.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.440
They do the SR-71 Blackbird,
which many people to this day

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.060
think is the most
remarkable plane ever built.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:48.950
But then a whole sequence
of other aircraft.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:51.260
And they do stealth, right?

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:54.950
They're the implementers of a
lot of the stealth technology.

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:57.860
So that's an example
of how a corporation is

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.040
able to create an
entity that can

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.310
move through a series of great
groups and keep innovating.

01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:07.070
That's kind of held up as
a kind of iconic model.

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:08.120
So it is possible.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.910
So when your-- the small
companies that you all set up

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:14.870
become major corporations,
read about Skunk Works,

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:18.150
because that'll be your
clue to continued survival.

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:19.850
AUDIENCE: Ray
Stata did something

01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:22.657
interesting like that, where his
company, they wouldn't fund--

01:04:22.657 --> 01:04:24.740
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's
Analog Devices, just up

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:25.430
the street.

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:27.097
AUDIENCE: They wouldn't
fund [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:28.097
to digital technologies.

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.847
And so what he had to
do is, he personally

01:04:29.847 --> 01:04:32.050
putting in his own money
to make a new company

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:34.370
that the old company
could not buy back.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.640
So he had to get
over it that way.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.913
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's Interesting.

01:04:38.913 --> 01:04:40.580
Lily, how about a
closing thought for us

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.930
about this amazing crowd?

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.370
LILY: Let's see.

01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:52.508
I think that Craig is right when
he says you have to take risks.

01:04:52.508 --> 01:04:54.050
You have to take
risks or else you're

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:58.030
not going to do anything
worth writing about.

01:04:58.030 --> 01:05:00.910
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
that's a great way to close.

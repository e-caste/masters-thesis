00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.530 
In our openhpi course "A
Half Century of Internet"

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.060 
we now want to consider
the IP protocol.

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.470 
The internet protocol which is one
of the most important protocols

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.100 
in the TCP/IP stack.

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.500 
The internet protocol IP is a
central communication protocol.

6
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.520 
It is located in the internet layer
of the TCP/IP protocol stack

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.940 
and the tasks are
the following.

8
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.440 
Packet switching - packet switching or data
packets between different network technologies.

9
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.910 
This is what we already mentioned
in different connections.

10
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.280 
Then IP protocol provides
an addressing scheme.

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.530 
An addressing scheme so the IP
addresses, the internet address

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.000 
and the IP protocol is reported
responsible for finding an optimal path.

13
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.050 
It's responsible for the routing
of the data package through the

14
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.180 
internet, through the network, with
various interconnection systems. So

15
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.570 
routing is mainly between the
different intermediate systems. The

16
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.550 
transport through the
through the network

17
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.200 
if the router has packed it in
the network package that's

18
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.600 
no problem. But to find out
what is the next router,

19
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.310 
for an optimal path there for such tasks
is the internet protocol IP protocol

20
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.850 
is responsible and then
the IP protocol provides

21
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.570 
means for error
detection

22
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.790 
and to determine errors
by using checksums.

23
00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.130 
The current version and most used
most popular IP version is the IP

24
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.630 
version 4 and already in place
and consider a refraction

25
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.600 
is a new IP protocol the IP protocol
version six or some people called it also

26
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.370 
NG, IP-NG, IP protocol
next generation.

27
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.180 
You remember the route. The routers
that are needed as intermediate

28
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.400 
system to connect to networks. Here in
our example SONET and ethernet network

29
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.920 
and in the router the transmission
of the SONET protocols

30
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.490 
into the ethernet protocol
needs to be done.

31
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.500 
So each network transports ip packets
but they transport it as payload,

32
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.820 
as payload of their corresponding
packet data formats

33
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.580 
because inside the network an IP address
is not understood. Only routers

34
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:06.200 
can deal and can understand IP
protocol, IP package, IP addresses.

35
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.220 
So if a package is sent from the
ethernet then we have the header

36
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.030 
of the ethernet technology and then
the IP packet we see IP header,

37
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.970 
and with the data inside, they are
payload of this ethernet header.

38
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.690 
And then the router
checks this and

39
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.980 
makes a decision
to transmit

40
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.440 
the packet next to the sonet.
So the sonet package

41
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.470 
format has to be introduced and
the IP packet is payload now

42
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.140 
of its owner packet. So the IP
packet does nothing know about

43
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.120 
the protocols of the link layer.
The IP packet has no clue

44
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.030 
from the ethernet technology, no
clue from the SONET technology,

45
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.170 
it is handled as payload of
the corresponding packages.

46
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.530 
Let's have a look on the
addressing scheme.

47
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.620 
What is needed is an addressing scheme
that spends several networks together

48
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.770 
and that it provides for each for each
host in such a connected network

49
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.010 
a unique IP address.

50
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.230 
So IP is responsible for the address
translation at the network interfaces,

51
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.920 
the IP protocol requires directory
services for assignment of IP addresses,

52
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.030 
so the IP address and this is
important challenge is need to be

53
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.770 
globally unique. Otherwise we
could not send a data package,

54
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.760 
we could not send messages
to destinated systems.

55
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.870 
To give an example, this
is an IP address.

56
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.020 
So the format of IP addresses
are asserted to bits.

57
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.750 
The bits are, the thirty-two bits
are subdivided in four groups.

58
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.350 
Eighty bits and the eighty
bits are expressed in this

59
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.380 
decimal system. So here a one hundred
forty one point eighty nine

60
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.570 
point two hundred twenty five point
one point one. Each of this

61
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.260 
numbers can be encoded with eight
bits. So the IP address in

62
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.650 
the IP protocol IPv4 it's a
thirty two bit long, thirty-two

63
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.730 
bit long bit string.

64
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.800 
If we look to the IPv6
addresses then IP

65
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.540 
addresses are much more complex.
The reason more that we need to

66
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.160 
step fromIPv4 to IPv6 because
the IP address IPv4 addresses

67
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.140 
do not provide enough different
addresses. About four billion

68
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.820 
addresses can be formed in IPv4 but
today we have much more systems

69
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.000 
that wants to connect to the system. So
here we have one hundred twenty eight

70
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.870 
bit, twenty eight
bit strings

71
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.360 
and here the strings
are this one

72
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.730 
hundred and twenty eight
is subdivided into

73
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.610 
several sixteen bit strings that can
be expressed in the hexadecimal

74
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.460 
systems or you see not only
numbers but also letters are

75
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.820 
inside and instead of the points
we have the data points. We

76
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.400 
will look have a closer
look later on this IPv6.

77
00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:03.280 
One task of the internet protocol a is
that IP has to handle correct forwarding

78
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.110 
of data packets. And what could happen
is that there is a long package

79
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.360 
that was transported to
the router received

80
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.300 
at the router from one network but
it is much too long to be sent

81
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.810 
through the
next network

82
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:31.240 
because for the packets there is a maximum
size in the different network technologies.

83
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.670 
And this maximum
size differs.

84
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.800 
So if data packet is transmitted
through a network which has an MTU,

85
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.830 
MTU - maximum transfer unit,
which is smaller since the

86
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.680 
size of the packet, then the packet
needs to be fragmented, needs

87
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.180 
to be fragmented into
several parts.

88
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.080 
This is a task that IP
is responsible for.

89
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:04.360 
During the fragmentation of course each
of the fragments needs a header.

90
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:11.100 
A header with address and sender and
the receiver address and the header

91
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:18.160 
although needs extra information about extra
information about the fragmentation.

92
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:25.890 
Reason, the receiver system should be
able to see ok that's the fragment

93
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.380 
of a larger message
and has to be able

94
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.380 
a larger message and
has to be able

95
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:37.450 
to put it on the right place when the message
is reconstructed from the fragments.

96
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.440 
So this extra information is used
by the receiver to correctly

97
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.110 
defragment the data packets.
Of course it is looked that

98
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.230 
it is done very efficient. So with a few
information with a few extra information

99
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.270 
the receiver is enabled to do
this. But this is one problem

100
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.950 
which occurs when you interconnect
networks with different

101
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.400 
technologies and with different
maximum transfer units.

102
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:15.770 
Another very important task of
the IP protocol is routing to

103
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:22.880 
find, to determine the optimal route to
forward the to forward the package

104
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:28.280 
to the receiver. So IP ensures
that the IP packets are taking

105
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.390 
the most optimal path through the internet
from the sender to the receiver.

106
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:38.210 
Optimal could be mean different
could be the cheapest path

107
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.720 
or the shortest path or the
farthest path. This depends from

108
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.550 
the routing algorithm that is used.
We discussed this by the way

109
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.920 
we discussed this already when we
spoke about wide area networks.

110
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.330 
Problem is the internet has
millions of network nodes.

111
00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:00.360 
So each packet shall not visit
any unnecessary nodes.

112
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.750 
So it should find the

113
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.090 
fastest or most
direct way.

114
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:15.680 
The reason is faster the transmission,
less is the danger of getting

115
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.510 
getting damaged.

116
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.740 
So a packet shall arrive
at the recipient as fast

117
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.920 
as possible. Of course this is
what we like to see when we are

118
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.680 
working with the internet that
we do not to have to wait for

119
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.800 
information from other sources.
So in this way via this

120
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.000 
different networks to find
interconnected network, and of course

121
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.840 
the internet consists of hundreds
of thousands of such networks,

122
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:50.180 
to find the optimal route that is an
important task of the IP protocol.

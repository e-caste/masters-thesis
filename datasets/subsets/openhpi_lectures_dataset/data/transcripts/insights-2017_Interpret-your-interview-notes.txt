00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:10.550 
Hi and welcome back. In the previous session,

2
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.800 
I conducted an interview with Tom about how he plans

3
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.150 
and prepares for traveling.

4
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:20.410 
We ask you to pay attention and take careful notes,

5
00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:22.340 
to practice your note-taking skills.

6
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:24.530 
I also took some notes,

7
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:28.090 
and I went on and summarized my notes,

8
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:29.990 
using the template

9
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:32.940 
we introduced you, called "Capture your Interviews".

10
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:38.310 
So I started off by describing who I met

11
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:41.060 
and giving some information about his context,

12
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:44.170 
and then summarized some of those interesting,

13
00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:47.390 
surprising aspects of our conversation

14
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:48.430 
that stood out to me.

15
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:50.050 
Now in the next step,

16
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.590 
we want to go beyond

17
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.000 
what we heard and dig deeper.

18
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:59.180 
So here we want to interpret meaning and motivations

19
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:02.790 
that might be lying behind those statements

20
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:06.370 
that we hear. You're going to use and new template for that.

21
00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:11.760 
So I want to look at my findings,

22
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.340 
and those things that stood out to me

23
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:14.860 
first and ask myself,

24
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:17.670 
what would be some of the motivations

25
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:20.030 
or needs that are lying behind them?

26
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:21.360 
Let me give you an example.

27
00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:22.980 
When I was talking to Tom,

28
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:24.780 
one of the things that stood out to me

29
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.980 
was, that he mentioned, he is someone who likes to plan,

30
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:30.560 
who likes to take the lead when traveling;

31
00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:31.780 
but when I asked him

32
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:34.520 
about his last trip to the Philippines with his friends,

33
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:35.970 
he mentioned that

34
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.230 
because his friends had a limited time,

35
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:41.600 
and they were going to leave the Philippines

36
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.580 
earlier than him,

37
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:44.370 
they wanted to make sure that they would see

38
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.850 
every important site.

39
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:48.260 
So he let them take the lead.

40
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:49.400 
He let them plan,

41
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:52.490 
and then he just tried to go along with them.

42
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:54.420 
So I ask myself,

43
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:58.590 
I wonder if this means that when traveling with friends,

44
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:03.300 
Tom would compromise his preferred way of planning

45
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:07.310 
for a harmonious time and agreement with friends?

46
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.850 
So you see, I'm interpreting here.

47
00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:12.530 
This is not something that Tom has directly stated,

48
00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.080 
but I'm trying to go deeper behind,

49
00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:16.260 
trying to figure out

50
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.990 
what are some of the motivations

51
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:20.520 
that Tom might have for saying this.

52
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.170 
So I want you to do the same thing. Go on and at least pick

53
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:28.180 
three of those findings that you had from your conversations

54
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.660 
that you found interesting or surprising.

55
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:32.340 
Look at them and ask yourself,

56
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:35.930 
I wonder if this means, and interpret deeper

57
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.440 
meaning behind them.

58
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:40.450 
And remember, there is no right or wrong here.

59
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.120 
You just have to try out different formulations

60
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:47.190 
to get to one juicy, interesting statement. Have fun!

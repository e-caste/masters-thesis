1
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.134 
Yeah, hello, it's me again Wolfram Greis from the European Mainframe Academy,

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.999 
and in this next session, I want to do a brief demonstration

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.829 
how time sharing option rock works, how we work with

4
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.024 
TSO, a short demonstration.

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.549 
Let's make a review, how a TSO address space is

6
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.989 
created. We have a user, in this case, it's me,

7
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.639 
wanting to make log on to the TSO,

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.539 
so we give our request to VTAM and

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.229 
VTAM forwards the request to the TSO communication

10
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.149 
address space. TSO communication address space now wants to have more information

11
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.810 
and sends to the user a menu where the user can

12
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.749 
fill out some fields. And one of the most important field is the password

13
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.649 
field to give in the password and the password is then

14
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.499 
checked with RACF security database and if the comparison

15
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.569 
is successful, means the password is the same as in the

16
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.009 
security database, a new address space is created

17
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.139 
and the address space has the name of the User ID,

18
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.919 
the user gave in at the log on request.

19
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.599 
The a terminal monitor program is started and the user gets

20
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.129 
a prompt back to his screen and

21
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.499 
he gets ready prompt.

22
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.029 
OK, we have some TSO log on screen

23
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.709 
I will show you afterwards directly on

24
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.299 
our system, how to fill out some information, and these

25
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.099 
are some examples of some of the TSO commands that are

26
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.569 
available. Let's get out of the your presentation now,

27
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.669 
and let's have a look on to our terminal emulation.

28
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.659 
We have a very special terminal emulation.

29
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.939 
It's very, very useful, it's from Virtel.

30
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.920 
Virtel is the product of the French company called Syspertec.

31
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.199 
The big advantage of Virtel is that you can do 3270

32
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.619 
emulation within your browser.

33
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.329 
It means the emulation is installed on the server side and you just

34
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.949 
have to click on where you want to go, as example, you see here we can make

35
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.599 
log onto the CICS, we can make log on to TSO,

36
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.639 
that's what we want to do now.

37
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.789 
So I just click on TSO and I get now the

38
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.740 
message from TSO.

39
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.469 
Important for all new users to such a mainframe environment.

40
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.459 
These messages are very, very unique.

41
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.677 
If a message message starts with IKJ

42
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.250 
in each and every case, you can bet on it, it comes from

43
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.339 
TSO. So TSO now sent me the message IKJ56700

44
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.429 
Enter user ID, I should enter my user ID.

45
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.959 
What I want to do now, I say UWGR, it's my user

46
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.949 
ID and now you'll see the log on mask, I talked

47
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.509 
just before about it.

48
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.779 
Here I have to give my password.

49
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.069 
In my case, I put in my password.

50
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.509 
If you want to set the new password, you can type

51
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.009 
it in here. You have to type it twice to to confirm your new password

52
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.449 
and so on. There are some other fields that normally are already filled

53
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.159 
in, as example, the log on procedure, as example, an account number,

54
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.719 
and so on. What is really useful is to select reconnect because if

55
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.459 
your user ID hangs within the system and you don't

56
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.289 
have a connection to the system anymore, with select

57
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.879 
reconnect, you can get a reconnect and it doesn't matter if the

58
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.309 
reconnect doesn't work because the user is set up

59
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.079 
on a new way, no problem at all, you can get a new

60
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.579 
log on. OK, I gave in my password and now I

61
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.359 
press the return key.

62
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.339 
I get another message.

63
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.170 
The other message begins with ICH.

64
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.929 
You can bet if we get a message with ICH, in each and every case,

65
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.609 
it comes from the RACF, the resource access control facility means

66
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.199 
the security was last accessed

67
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.649 
was at Saturday, November 03 at

68
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.910 
19:58 log time.

69
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.108 
Two more messages from TSO or IKJ in

70
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.959 
progress and no broadvast messages, and when you see three asterisks

71
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.579 
in TSO it means there is something displayed and

72
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.180 
if you again type again, the

73
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.299 
enter key, the next message is displayed or the next information

74
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.914 
comes. And in this case, we go directly, this is in many cases,

75
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.899 
directly to ISPF, we want to quit ISPF now to get into the native

76
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.349 
TSO mode. So I say X because I do another demonstration

77
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.730 
after our ISPF's introduction.

78
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.939 
And I have to say I want to get rid of the list file

79
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.499 
and now I get the ready message from TSO, this

80
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.299 
is the one from TSO thet I can type in now new

81
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.369 
commands, and I want to do that now.

82
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.899 
The first thing I want to do is I type profile, profile means

83
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.629 
show me the profile of my user ID

84
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.649 
and you see a lot of settings as an example

85
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.149 
in this case. And what I want to emphasize now is

86
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.011 
that there is one parameter set that is the prefix,

87
00:06:33.012 --> 00:06:37.749 
this is normally the high level qualifier of the User ID I am working

88
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.720 
with and in this case is UWGR.

89
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.026 
I want to give in the next command and I say LISTC, it's the abbreviation for list

90
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.089 
catalog. I want to see what entries are in the catalog,

91
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.489 
beginning with my prefix.

92
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.929 
Normally, this is the high level qualifier we talked about the dataset

93
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.739 
conventions. LISTC and now I get an message in

94
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.740 
CATALOG:SYS1.USERCAT.VSYSUSR.

95
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.763 
I want to remind you, normally

96
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.419 
z/OS is set up with a master catalog and user catalogs

97
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.979 
and in this case, I get the information now out of the user catalog

98
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.839 
and all of the datasets that are beginning with my prefix I get now,

99
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.969 
UWGR and so on.

100
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.629 
A lot of datasets, not too many, but some.

101
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.812 
And here we are finished, I get again the ready prompt.

102
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.349 
I want to do another demonstration, I want to get rid of my prefix,

103
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:48.720 
I say PROF

104
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.409 
abbreviated, can also say PROFILE. I say PROF N now, no prof means

105
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.809 
I don't want to have the prefix set anymore.

106
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.279 
And I got ready. Again, I say PROFILE and

107
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.779 
you see, the perimeter is set now to

108
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.579 
no prefix and I type in

109
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.409 
the same command again list catalog.

110
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:24.399 
And now I get a really big list of all of the entries

111
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.510 
in the SYS1.CATALOG.VSYSLIB.

112
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.519 
And this is in this case, this is our master catalog.

113
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.058 
And now I get a lot of entries, you see a lot of alias entries.

114
00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:41.558 
Alias means it's just one entry pointing to a

115
00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.679 
user catalog. A lot of information and

116
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.749 
a lot of entries.

117
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.790 
OK, now we have non-VSAM and VSAM datasets

118
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.889 
in this case and so on. And this is really a huge list because it lists

119
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:04.749 
all the entries, entries in the master catalog.

120
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.249 
And if you want to get rid

121
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.869 
of this display, now you'll want to to cancel

122
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.849 
it. You have to know your PA1 key,

123
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.529 
and in many cases, you have to check in your terminal

124
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.719 
emulation and in this case, we have here a virtual keyboard, and I

125
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.219 
press now the PA1 key and you'll see now,

126
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.705 
it's the same as if you press the Control+C

127
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.870 
on any other platform like Unix,

128
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.039 
Linux and Windows.

129
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.749 
OK, I get the ready message Now I set my

130
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.607 
profile back to my user ID,

131
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.409 
PROF PREF(UWGR) and just

132
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.109 
to check it again PROF, and you see my prefix is set

133
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.110 
again to UWGR.

134
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.129 
I just wanted to show you some information

135
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:16.259 
from TSO, what you can do,

136
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.139 
what commands you can put in.

137
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.969 
OK, now I want to say I want to

138
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.499 
terminate my session now. In this case, there's another TSO command and this is

139
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.773 
called LOGOFF.

140
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.689 
And now I get back to our

141
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.339 
input screen, and I can do a new log on or I

142
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.259 
can do some other things.

143
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.239 
Well, this was a very brief demonstration on how TSO is

144
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.769 
working. Have fun and hope I see you in one

145
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.689 
of our next video clips.

146
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.519 
Thank you very much for attending.

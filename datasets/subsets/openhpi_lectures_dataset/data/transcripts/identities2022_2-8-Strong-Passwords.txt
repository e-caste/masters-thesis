00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.850 
Now we can summarize our knowledge
about strong passwords

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.170 
in our openHPI course about
Digital Identities.

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.210 
You remember - passwords
are called strong

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.720 
when they are complex, and difficult
to attack when they securely

5
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.440 
protect an account. We give several
advises for choosing strong

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.920 
passwords: We said passwords should be
case-sensitive, should contain upper

7
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.690 
case and lower case letters, it should
be a combination of different words,

8
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.380 
it should use
special characters

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.300 
and digits, and minimally it should be of
length 12 to be difficult to attack.

10
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.750 
And then for other reasons, we
said passwords should not be

11
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
found in the context of a dictionary,
this is to make dictionary attacks

12
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.450 
impossible. And a password
should not be reused:

13
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.590 
When they are compromised,
when they are in the hand

14
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.130 
of the attackers and they are
used also with other service,

15
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.830 
even if they are strong, the
attacker can misuse them.

16
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.830 
Another way,
we have the

17
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.390 
wish that a password should
still be easy to remember,

18
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.110 
because when we do not remember
passwords we have to write it down.

19
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.210 
Studies show that around 1 meter
around the desktop of a computer,

20
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.590 
there are post-its, 50 % are
post-its, and the password

21
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.820 
is written on those post-its, and
the reason is password is good but

22
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.100 
it cannot be remembered, so it's written
down. The attacker can access it

23
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.060 
via the written down
version of the password.

24
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:08.040 
So a way to even remember complex
passwords is to use an abbreviation,

25
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.120 
to use initial letters of
words in a sequence.

26
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.630 
To give an example for that: a difficult
password can be realized if you remember

27
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.010 
a complete sentence,

28
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.630 
a complete sentence and then
to take the case-sensitive

29
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.690 
initials of all words, as
well as punctuation marks

30
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.970 
which are used to
form the password.

31
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.380 
Here is an example, the example is a
sentence "Where there is a will,

32
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.980 
there will be a way."

33
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.140 
I have cited this with a red colour,
take the initial of each word

34
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.950 
and take all the punctuation, then you
get this password - "Wti1W,tWb1W.".

35
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.810 
It is quite long and it cannot
be found in a dictionary.

36
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.580 
It is taking upper case letters, lower
case letters, it takes the digits,

37
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.840 
it takes special symbols. So this is
the way - with a simple sentence,

38
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.350 
a sentence easy to remember, to
form a strong password. There

39
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.550 
are services available on the internet which
help you to check whether a password

40
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.980 
you want to choose
was already

41
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.020 
been stolen, because such
passwords should never be used.

42
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.570 
They make it easier for the attacker to
get access to your digital identity.

43
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.760 
The service I want to introduce you is this
service here "Pwned Passwords" which

44
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.700 
discovers passwords.
This is a link

45
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.860 
you can follow and then you come
to this website, you can type in

46
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.460 
your password candidate and the
service commences. And they know

47
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.140 
this password you should not
choose because it was used already

48
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.530 
such many times or it was already
stolen. So it helps you to select

49
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.750 
a secure password.

50
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.660 
But when you have a secure
password, a strong password,

51
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.090 
then the question is how can you
remember it? How can you store it

52
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.630 
in a way that you
can work with it?

53
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.420 
So a very important thing is you should
never pass passwords to third parties.

54
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.370 
They should be unreachable for data
thieves when they for example,

55
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.810 
get access to
your computer.

56
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:48.170 
And so it makes sense that you make use
of a password manager. Password managers -

57
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.970 
these are tools, and we will discuss
them in more detail in the next video,

58
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.510 
these are tools which help you to deal
even with a very complex password.

59
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.550 
To summarize, up to this moment we
have discussed strong passwords,

60
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.410 
we have said it's important that they
contain upper and lower case letters,

61
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.870 
we said they should contain numbers and special
characters, that they use all available characters,

62
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.050 
and that they should be at
least 12 characters long.

63
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.310 
Strong passwords
should not

64
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.340 
be found in dictionaries to
prevent dictionary attacks, and

65
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.980 
they should not be able to derive from the
user context, then otherwise guessing

66
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.860 
attacks would be successful. Strong
passwords should not be reused

67
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.210 
and a password manager can help you
with the generation of password,

68
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.980 
and the storage of password. And these
we will discuss in the next video.

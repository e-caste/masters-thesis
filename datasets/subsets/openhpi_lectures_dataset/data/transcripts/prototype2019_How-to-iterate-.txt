00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.890 
Hi! This video is about
planning your first step for

2
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.050 
iteration. You tested your prototype,
you sorted your feedback,

3
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.880 
so what's next? - When you look
at the design thinking process

4
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.720 
it may seem linear but
it's actually iterative.

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.120 
Iteration, per definition, is the
repetition of a process until

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.540 
you reach a goal. In design thinking
it means that we are open

7
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.610 
to failing early, to redo parts
of our journey and improve

8
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
our idea. This means that we don't
spend ninety percent of our

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.160 
time on planning and ten
percent on building,

10
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.750 
but actually a hundred
percent of our time on

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.470 
learning, building, and
testing repeatedly.

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.860 
How do we decide on
what we will do next?

13
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.670 
When you look at your feedback
grid, you might see some patterns

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.210 
among users. You can sort the
feedback according to topics

15
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.370 
or categories, and this might
help you to think of your next

16
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.980 
step. - Were you able to answer
your testing assumption?

17
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.340 
If you didn't really find an answer
yet, you should think about

18
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.070 
how you can test better and
repeat the testing in that way.

19
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.230 
You can phrase this as your
next step for iteration.

20
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.050 
Did the testing show that your
assumption was wrong and that

21
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.040 
the user doesn't desire or
required the solution?

22
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.940 
Then you need to think about the
next phase you want to go to.

23
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.110 
So maybe you found out that the
problem that you're trying

24
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.610 
to solve does not really exist.
The user doesn't really

25
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.810 
have this need that you were
thinking of tackling with this

26
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.800 
solution. Then you might need to
dive into your user research

27
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.410 
again and do some more
observation. Maybe

28
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.320 
the need that you found is
essential and a very valid one to

29
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.910 
keep looking into, then your solution
might not be perfect. Maybe

30
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.820 
you need to spend more time on
brainstorming or building a

31
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.890 
quick new prototype. So for both
cases you would need to think

32
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.480 
about which phase do you
want to go next to.

33
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.630 
In these cases, you can pick a phase
as the next step for iteration.

34
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.500 
Did the testing validate your assumption
and your prototype resonated

35
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.150 
well with the user? In that case
you can start to develop your

36
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.770 
prototype further and incorporate
changes based on the feedback

37
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.140 
you received. So for example, some
ideas that the test has brought in

38
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.230 
or some answers to some
open questions you heard.

39
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.870 
You can describe the little change
you would make in your prototype

40
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.520 
as your next step for iteration.
- In this course, we asked you

41
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.580 
to test at least with
two different people.

42
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.950 
This is a very small number
even for an initial test.

43
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.640 
But we want to
encourage you that

44
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.230 
you don't stop and you don't
interrupt your design process

45
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.480 
just because you did one
testing and the person

46
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.720 
didn't like the prototype,
or didn't see

47
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.640 
use of it in their daily life.
Just as we don't want you to

48
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.860 
think that your prototype is
finished or that it's perfect just

49
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.000 
because one person really
loved your idea.

50
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.910 
Testing is not a one time event, it's
part of this iterative process.

51
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.750 
This might sound very scary, as
if you'll never be finished.

52
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.040 
But for this course we would
encourage you to take it as a

53
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.800 
learning opportunity. If you start
to embrace critical feedback,

54
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.340 
then iteration can be
incredibly helpful.

55
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.160 
It will help you to save
time, money, and effort

56
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.070 
and also to discard
flawed ideas early on.

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.630 
Hello everybody and welcome to
week two. So, now after learning

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.610 
about some of the tools
that you can use

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.040 
when you working remotely, let's
see what Salim has prepared

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.230 
for us for week two...... Thank you
Hanadi, this week we are going

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.400 
to talk about the human
side of remote work.

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.190 
We cannot expect that just
remote work is something about

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.470 
technology, it is important to
have technology definitely and

8
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.200 
remote work relies on technology
heavily but also we cannot forget

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.670 
on the other side of this internet, there
are humans.Absolutely. And humans

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.830 
have feelings and there are some
issues, and some aspect that

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.400 
we definitely need to consider.
For instance, we will need to

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.360 
recognize who are the perfect
remote workers or who need to

13
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.170 
be trained in order to
be a remote worker.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.240 
What is important from the
team leaders and also from

15
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.370 
the management to empower the
people to work remotely?

16
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.890 
There are different apologies
of remote interactions

17
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.980 
centrally, decentralized, we
would see all the stuff.

18
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.540 
Measurement and quality do we
need to trust as well? What is

19
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.280 
there? Because of the human-side,
we are humans and we are

20
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.130 
it is difficult, we are just not
a machine that always does

21
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.850 
the same. We are flexible as
well, there are some cognitive

22
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.070 
preferences when
people interact,

23
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.140 
Every one of us has a particular cognitive
(profile), we are talking about

24
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.790 
the rules of communication, the
organizational challenges and

25
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.870 
how will this impact the
whole organization?

26
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290 
Because of the social, digital and
geographical dispersion society.

27
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.980 
It is a complex term. So,
complex something that

28
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.190 
it is not impossible but if we don't
do not address it correctly,

29
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.760 
we will have a problem.
Now if we see right now

30
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.150 
we have a society that is interacting,
we can see in this slide.

31
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.930 
People are interacting in the
society, these are the social

32
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.220 
networks, you can see people from
the US are interacting with

33
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.920 
people from Australia, from
the other side of the world.

34
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.750 
From very remote people in Europe
also interacting with people

35
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.280 
from Africa. For instance,
there are some

36
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.470 
special networks when
we see here China

37
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.520 
sorry, Russia and also other
countries in the Arabic countries

38
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.210 
people are interacting, people are
enjoying this interconnectivity.

39
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.770 
Then the question that is on the
bottom of this slide. Does

40
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.090 
interconnectivity bring
us anything? It does.

41
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.650 
It does it, but then we will
need to use it for our

42
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.720 
purposes it means for the
organizations. To be more productive,

43
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.620 
to perform more effective in
how we have interacted and

44
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.010 
as I said before, we should not
ignore the risks that are there.

45
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.730 
OK. Now working remotely it's also
connected with several issues.

46
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.490 
I know because for some people
for example, or for some part

47
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
of the management, I believe if you
are not working in the office

48
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.330 
then you are not working. Exactly,
this it is something called

49
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.220 
to manage the hot seat. If you
don't see people there working,

50
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.440 
then they are not working. Ok,
this is a cheap, that we need to

51
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.830 
start changing also in
organizations. It probably will

52
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.050 
not happen within a couple of
weeks or days. It will take a

53
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.870 
while but the management
needs to believe, that this

54
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.000 
is something that will
bring them further

55
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.220 
if they don't see people working
in the office it doesn't mean

56
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.440 
that they are not working.
If you commit yourself and

57
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.760 
delegate property task, defining
the targets you want to achieve,

58
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.450 
who is doing what, when, everything.
Probably It can be even working

59
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.010 
by far better that it
is working in the

60
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.450 
office. People also say people
at remote locations in homes

61
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.590 
are full of destruction. This is it may
be true. This is still true actually

62
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
true and therefor, when you are
preparing this whole process

63
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.380 
to move to this culture, to
this to this lifestyle.

64
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.020 
It is a sign that you define some
conditions and some rules.

65
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.410 
Are you going to work at home?
OK, please make sure that you

66
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.830 
have space or office, where
you can close your office.

67
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.390 
When you are distracted, you
will not be distracted from

68
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.630 
the domestic situations. That
the someone is making lunch or

69
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
something like that and you
have also your plan for the

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.470 
for the whole day. Say of this time
to this time, I will be doing

71
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.400 
this. This is important
we cannot ignore it!

72
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.920 
People say, only the office of
offers a secure environment.

73
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.870 
I have my doubts about that
because part of the things

74
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.580 
that are happening right
now are based on

75
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.490 
papers and documents. What about
if you have these documents

76
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.610 
digitalized and then you
actually work remotely.

77
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.480 
We will we will be seen that
the communication would be by

78
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.960 
far faster because a document
that normally was in one single

79
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.850 
place in one office now
it's in a server,

80
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.680 
and you can share it, of course
with the correct permissions

81
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.640 
and security, to more people.
Therefore, not necessarily a secure

82
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.310 
environment is only in the office.
OK, you can share documents,

83
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.990 
but how about the face to face
meeting with customers?

84
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.210 
If you are working remotely can
still attend to customers? You

85
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.920 
can attend to customers, there are some
policies and some organizations.

86
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.090 
When you say there are some
organizations for instance in Germany

87
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.060 
that they for talking to customers
if you are working remotely.

88
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.700 
You are not allowed to
use video. OK. Because

89
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.260 
we have seen already in the
some of the conditions, when

90
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.340 
you are sharing your video,
sharing more of the information

91
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.760 
that you have in your
back and probably,

92
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.490 
your organization doesn't want to
show information to customers.

93
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.930 
There are some conditions
and some rules,

94
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.270 
that need to be defined
by the organisations.

95
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.360 
People think we are too small,
we are too small to implement

96
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.800 
such a kind of a model,
working model. No,

97
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.200 
it is not, don't try to
make a difficult things.

98
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.800 
Start defining the processes,
define the processes that work

99
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.100 
in your office locally and
you will see that you can

100
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.220 
transform those processes in order to bring them outside.
Everything what you depend on, the local office, let's say

101
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.180 
a piece of paper can you
digitalized a piece of paper?

102
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.990 
Can you put it on a server? Can
you make sure that you are not

103
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.260 
depending on this? if you're
depending on this then of course

104
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.370 
you will need to have someone central
but not the whole organisation

105
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.570 
need to be central managed,
managing this piece of paper,

106
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.650 
this is very important. The
option to work remotely

107
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.450 
should be for all people or not?
It depends on the work they

108
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.210 
are doing. There are things that
definitely you cannot do it

109
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.050 
at home or remotely, you cannot
have a surgery remotely or

110
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.050 
they cannot work as a
firefighter remotely. There

111
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.270 
are several tasks
that you can not do

112
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.120 
but most of them. Where you
are talking about services,

113
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.920 
also, when you are talking about
manufacturing, this is a

114
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.230 
a very good example. Think about
Airbus is not in one single

115
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.370 
location, they are distributed in
different locations and they

116
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.890 
are working. Some of them are
making the wings or doing all

117
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.790 
the turbines. Everything is happening
and at the end the assembled.

118
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.890 
It means remote work is not
just when we think about

119
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.830 
work at home, it also happens when
the organization is distributed

120
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.820 
in a different location
and making different

121
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.220 
things. That our industry does
not feel such a working model.

122
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.300 
I would like to see which
is the interest today?

123
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.480 
There are industries as before,
you cannot fly a plane at home.

124
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.790 
you can not fly an airplane
remotely but there are

125
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.190 
most of them, they can do it remotely.......
So, it's all depends on the

126
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.390 
culture of the organization,
the experience of the worker

127
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.320 
may bring?..... Exactly, and this
world culture this is a really

128
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.850 
let's say heavy word because
culture and I need to repeat

129
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.980 
again, culture is this working
style is a kind of working

130
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.610 
style at the organization start
implementing and if you are

131
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.820 
already practicing
remote work but only

132
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.600 
just once a month because you
are traveling, because of...

133
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.900 
This is remote work but if you
make it in another a cyclus,

134
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.170 
then probably, for sure you
are going to make it twice a

135
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.120 
week. You will start seeing
that the remote work

136
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.320 
the paradox is that are there.
Need to be re-validated again

137
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.980 
because this is we are thinking
about the past, this

138
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.860 
complains and these mistakes
that were made in the past.

139
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.890 
By for now the organisations
are getting into this

140
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.650 
new trend and they are
implementing this

141
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.540 
culture of this
working lifestyle.

142
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.890 
We also need to start
thinking about that,

143
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.040 
work is not a place, work is
something that you do, when

144
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.360 
you do it, how you do it.
This is the most important

145
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.290 
definition from the organization.
That you say, I want to achieve

146
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.690 
this in this period of time
and we want to achieve

147
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.720 
I don't know, more revenue or this
KPIs to reach higher productivity

148
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.040 
to a higher level. These are
the things that we definitely

149
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.340 
need, to start moving an
organization from the

150
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.440 
management, team leaders
and also employees.

151
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:42.010 
OK. So thank you very much,
Salim. Now please share with us

152
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.190 
what issues, what advantages, what
disadvantages you would consider

153
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.390 
that a geographically
disparate society

154
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.740 
may bring? If you have any other
questions, if any comments

155
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.280 
any concerns regarding the
discussing topic, please

156
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.950 
share with us.
Thank you Hanadi

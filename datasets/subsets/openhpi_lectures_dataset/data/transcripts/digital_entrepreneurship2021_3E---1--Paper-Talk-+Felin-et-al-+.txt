00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.886 
Welcome to our first paper talk for this OpenHPI course, digital

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.390 
entrepreneurship for this video, Nina and I will be

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.369 
talking about the article titled Lean Startup and the business model Experimentation

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.989 
Revisited, published in 2020 and written by Felin and colleagues.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.179 
If you haven't already taken the chance to read the paper by yourself, then please

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.500 
feel free to stop the video now and come back once you have read the paper.

7
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.310 
You can find the link to the paper in the previous section.

8
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.608 
So we hope you took the chance to read this recent article and

9
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.075 
that you found inspiration during your read.

10
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.222 
Valeska, and I would like to contextualize this article by providing

11
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.509 
some further insights, such as who the authors are, what type of outlet

12
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.559 
they published their article in and what are the methods about.

13
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.954 
Then we want to shed some light on this article by sharing our understanding

14
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.529 
and opinion with you.

15
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.860 
So let's begin by talking about the outlet.

16
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.780 
The article was published in the scientific journal Long Range Planning,

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.924 
which is a journal from the field of strategic management articles published

18
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.319 
in this journal Focus on topics such as business strategy, organizational

19
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.920 
structure, entrepreneurship, of course, and business models.

20
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.789 
And Valeska. Would you say that long range planning is a famous journal

21
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.219 
in the field of entrepreneurship?

22
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.580 
Well, Nina, I'd say that it's well known by management researchers and

23
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.620 
obviously strategy matters for entrepreneurship.

24
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.209 
Let's take a closer look at renowned journal rankings that Nina and Robert

25
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.850 
mentioned in the input video 2B such as the Heart Sync Journal Quality

26
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.209 
List and the Fall Habit.

27
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.699 
We can see that the journal is listed in both with pretty high rankings.

28
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.150 
Another quality indicator is the impact factor.

29
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.727 
The impact factor measures the importance of a journal based on the number of times

30
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.539 
the journals articles recited within the last year or years.

31
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.770 
The higher the impact factor, the more highly ranked the journal.

32
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.229 
The Impact Factor is beneficial to compare journals within one research field.

33
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.660 
Over the past five years, long range planning and an impact factor of

34
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.400 
4.8, which is quite a good number for a journal in our research field.

35
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.919 
To date, the article itself has been cited over 10 times by other authors.

36
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.732 
But you have to keep in mind that the paper is fairly new and was published in 2020.

37
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.789 
It takes some time for other articles and authors to cite a paper.

38
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.359 
OK, so now we know the journal behind the article, what about the minds

39
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.770 
behind the paper?

40
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.559 
All four authors of the paper are university professors, either

41
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.810 
in a field of strategy or technology management, namely Teppo Felin,

42
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.045 
Alfonso Gambardella, Scott Stern and Todd Zenger.

43
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.669 
Based on their research interest. We can already see that the research profile fits

44
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.729 
the journal and the paper's topic.

45
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.159 
All Four have published several articles prior and other renowned management journals

46
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.367 
such as Research Policy and the Strategic Management Journal, and present

47
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.970 
a long publishing history in this field.

48
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.389 
It is also quite interesting that some of the authors have already coauthored

49
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.919 
other publications together and have written other articles with

50
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.629 
well-known management scholars such as Peter Klein or Michael Porter.

51
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.849 
So, Nina, would you say that we can assume that these four authors have the insight

52
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.280 
into this field to write a critical piece about two popular methods in

53
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.639 
entrepreneurship practice?

54
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.349 
Yes, I think so.

55
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.949 
Now, let's get talking about the content of the article.

56
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.373 
Good idea. So would you say that this paper looks like a very typical article

57
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.139 
that you come across every day in entrepreneurship journals?

58
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.530 
I have to say that it is slightly different from the typical entrepreneurship

59
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.629 
article for several reasons.

60
00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.130 
First of all, it is pretty short segment.

61
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.879 
It does not have the typical article structure that Robert and I

62
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.410 
presented in an input video to be when scrolling the article,

63
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.360 
you probably noticed that the office did not include a theoretical background,

64
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.389 
methods and data or results section.

65
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.699 
Third, as you can tell by the mentioned missing sections, the

66
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.730 
authors did not conduct their own empirical work, rather

67
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.663 
the artcle is conceptual, it appears to me, as more of a commentary

68
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.040 
of existing entrepreneurship methods.

69
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.579 
But even though the paper does not appear as a typical article, it is not uncommon

70
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.439 
for management journals to include conceptual articles or even be written

71
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.579 
in an essay format.

72
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.839 
Yeah, I think you're right. Also, I find it quite valuable to read such

73
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.173 
critical pieces because it extends my own perspective on widespread

74
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.166 
theories, methods or approaches in entrepreneurship researchers.

75
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.221 
I believe that these kinds of paper help drive the discourse on relevant topics

76
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.279 
and ensures that we stay on top of our game.

77
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.109 
As scientists, we know that new insights and findings can lead us to challenge

78
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.699 
assumptions and develop new ideas and approaches over time.

79
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.318 
And that's kind of what Teppo Felin and his colleagues did for

80
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.954 
that paper. Namely, the authors took a critical stance towards two

81
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.963 
of the most famous methods entrepreneurship theory, the lean startup approach

82
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.810 
and the business model canvas BMC.

83
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.377 
But, Nina, before we talk about their critique, let us quickly talk about

84
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.880 
the two methods you just mentioned that they assessed.

85
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.389 
In the input video three 3C, Karine presents a short introduction and explanation

86
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.589 
to the lean startup approach and the BMC.

87
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.592 
We suggest you watch this video to have a better understanding of how the two approaches

88
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.079 
fit in when reading the article.

89
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.954 
I remember the lean startup approach builds on the idea of quickly

90
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.839 
developing new products by applying so-called lean principles such

91
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.419 
as continuous product improvement and learning.

92
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.543 
Further, the approach focuses on using experimentation and customer

93
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.600 
interaction to test the startup's hypothesis.

94
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.669 
Yes, one of the central tools of the lean startup approach is the business model

95
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.949 
canvas. This framework aims to help startup develop

96
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.319 
their business hypothesis and business model.

97
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.040 
The BMC splits the business model, it's nine different elements, for example,

98
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.029 
customer segments, key resources and cost structure,

99
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.549 
all essential aspects to consider when developing a business idea.

100
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.978 
And not to forget, oftentimes they describe the lean

101
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.339 
startup method and its tool set off a scientific approach

102
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.290 
to the creation of startups.

103
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.407 
And this is the point when a paper of Felin and colleagues comes in, they

104
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.752 
challenge this perception of a scientific approach and discuss three

105
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.899 
challenges in their article.

106
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.839 
For the first challenge, the authors argue that the lean startup approach does not

107
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.730 
match the ultimate goal of a startup.

108
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.749 
A startup strives to develop breakthrough radical innovations,

109
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.209 
however, by applying the Lean Start approach, startups can only achieve minor,

110
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.610 
minor incremental innovations.

111
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.769 
According to the authors, the lean startup approach aims to achieve lean production

112
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.579 
through different principles.

113
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.650 
It does not focus on creating radical innovations.

114
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.209 
To summarize, the second challenge the authors see the strong focus

115
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.619 
on customer feedback and interaction when applying the lean startup approach,

116
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.124 
especially at the beginning of new product development to customer feedback,

117
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.050 
can be misleading and not helpful.

118
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.389 
The authors argue that customer feedback is valuable when looking for

119
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.861 
incremental improvements, but then aiming at radical innovations,

120
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.839 
the founders and key employees of the startup can develop

121
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.489 
far better radical innovation because they know the startup and

122
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.490 
the product at its best.

123
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.149 
To be honest, I personally am not convinced by that argument.

124
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.500 
What do you think Valeska?

125
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.201 
Actually Nina, quite fitting to that statement, there exists a follow

126
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.999 
up article by Bachman's nor from 2020, and they share your

127
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.429 
sentiment. They argue that customer feedback and experimentation

128
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.720 
is very valuable for startups, for any product development process.

129
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.470 
Thanks for the recommendation. I have a look at it and link to the article below for you.

130
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.919 
So the third challenge that they mention focuses on the business model canvas.

131
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.598 
Here the authors criticize that one starts apply the BMC, they focus too

132
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.519 
much on cataloging the different components of their business model instead of developing

133
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.000 
valuable hypotheses.

134
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.549 
They argue that a startup will not create a unique business idea

135
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.919 
when filling out a framework.

136
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.179 
All in all the author states to the lean start up approach and its method,

137
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.730 
distract start ups from coming up with unique theory of value.

138
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.159 
So let's just sum this up in our own words.

139
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:50.799 
The three challenges described in the article are mismatching, misleading

140
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.399 
and misplaced.

141
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.460 
So, Nina, what is your impression of the article?

142
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.789 
I found it to be quite an interesting read, actually.

143
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.629 
As you mentioned earlier, I think it's essential for researchers to be

144
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.129 
willing to take a critical perspective towards theories or approaches,

145
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.604 
even though the lean startup approach and the business model canvas are well

146
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.850 
known and taught in entrepreneurship classes worldwide.

147
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.649 
This doesn't mean that these approaches are perfect.

148
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.169 
I think the authors present, viable and well thought out arguments

149
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.169 
in the article when criticizing the approach.

150
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:34.150 
I agree. I also think it's important to note that the authors do not discard the

151
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.419 
approach altogether.

152
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.538 
Some companies only strive for incremental or minor innovations, and for

153
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.340 
them, the lean startup approach can be a perfect fit to reach their goal.

154
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.529 
We hope that our discussion of the article of Teppo Felin and his colleagues

155
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.611 
helped you to better understand the content of the article and to contextualize

156
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.440 
the insights provided by the office.

157
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.840 
See you for our next input video on paper talk.

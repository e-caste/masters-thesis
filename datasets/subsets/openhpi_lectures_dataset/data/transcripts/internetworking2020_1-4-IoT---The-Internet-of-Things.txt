1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.650 
When we look to "A Half
Century of Internet

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.380 
and How it Works Today" we have to consider
the so called internet of things.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.790 
This graphic shows the numbers are in
billion, said here twenty twenty one

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.950 
the number of computers, smartphones,
tablets that are connected to the internet

5
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.000 
is the same
like devices

6
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.450 
in industry, media to regulate lamps,
to regulate traffic and other things

7
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.160 
are about the same. So not only with computers
and with smartphone and other device

8
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.880 
we connect to the internet, the
internet is also is very important

9
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.330 
communication, interaction,
infrastructure for things.

10
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.470 
And this explosive increase in the
number of smart devices such things

11
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.790 
which I can use internet
are called smart devices.

12
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.490 
This explosive increase in the
number of smart devices has

13
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.530 
several reasons.

14
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.780 
Several, in several contexts and
with several ideas it makes sense

15
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.150 
to enable devices also to
make use of the internet.

16
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.520 
to communicate with other
devices over the internet.

17
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.900 
We call this ability that the thing,
the system or device become smarter

18
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.350 
becomes intelligent.

19
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.890 
Motivation is very different. For
example in the private sector

20
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.870 
the people want to get
their daily lives

21
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.510 
facilitated. In the flat for example
it is called a smart home,

22
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.610 
for example with some automatic
light adaption or heating adaption

23
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.950 
to the living the conditions
of some people.

24
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.430 
The motivation in the business sector
is that production processes,

25
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.930 
logistic projects can be organized
by means of such smart devices

26
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.560 
much more efficient. So the digitalisation,
the push, the development

27
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.050 
and the use of such
smart things.

28
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.660 
So the internet of things becomes more
and more important in industry,

29
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.860 
the title industry for
who is another term

30
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.820 
for the internet
of things.

31
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.690 
Let's have a closer look at what is such
a thing in the internet of things.

32
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.540 
So basically a "thing"
can be anything.

33
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.130 
The only requirement that needs
to be fulfilled is that it

34
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.400 
must be powerful enough to
connect to the internet.

35
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.590 
To connect to the internet and in this way
to be able to interact via the internet

36
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.840 
with other devices
or with humans.

37
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.000 
So the most things do not include
a lot of computer hardware.

38
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.390 
So it's not like a laptop or tablet no its
a small sensors with small equipment

39
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:48.820 
with various tiny operating elements,
no display, small memory but

40
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.520 
with the ability to connect
and to use the internet.

41
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.260 
They often operate with rechargeable
batteries to ensure more

42
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.760 
flexible application of course since such
sensors such devices that things are

43
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:12.800 
in the reality in any place. And you see
here a lot of applications, scenarios

44
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.150 
of the usage of such things. Let's
have a look to a smart home.

45
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.690 
The coffee machine can be connected to
the internet and can become smarter.

46
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:36.320 
For example seeing when you come close that you want to have a
coffee and not only was it fixed due to a fixed time scale but

47
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.320 
to have a coffee and not only was it
fixed due to a fixed time scale but

48
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.290 
recognising devices you
have or the refrigerator

49
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.740 
that may be connected to the
internet the tools brush

50
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.460 
with some measurings and other
things, ceiling light it's very

51
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.020 
important, entertainment systems
which are controlled by systems.

52
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.550 
Of course there was also a growth
turning in the past without internet

53
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.960 
for example in following
a fixed time table

54
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:15.780 
but here the things can really react
in connection with other devices

55
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.270 
or with the humans. When we look
to another use case of such

56
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.580 
devices in the internet of
things then its smart city.

57
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.610 
Smart city means that our sensors
in for example the road surface.

58
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.260 
And the sensors can measure the
traffic volum,e they can measure the

59
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.100 
they can adjust the traffic light
corresponding to this traffic volume,

60
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:51.300 
they can give information over
available parking spaces and others.

61
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.520 
Smart meters are important in important
type of device in smart city.

62
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.730 
Smart meters for example to measure
the electricity in the households

63
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.460 
or in the different devices and
the idea is that such meters

64
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:17.200 
can sent information can get information.
For example if the scenario

65
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.000 
for a household is that that
smart meter can help to control

66
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:29.670 
the usage of electrical devices in
the household according to the

67
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.190 
surprise one has to pay
for the electricity.

68
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:40.310 
So in the night it's much more cheap
than on the day in the rush hours.

69
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:47.880 
So here with such meters this smart
control can be, can be realized.

70
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.670 
Then there are in a smart city for
example sensors in the street lamps

71
00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:00.880 
that reduce light intensity when
there is no pedestrian in close.

72
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:09.210 
The traditional way is to control
the light intensity according

73
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.170 
to whether it's day or it's night on the
basis of a fixed timetable. But here

74
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:22.980 
with such smart otherwise one can really
react on certain activities, on certain

75
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.580 
things that are not happening
at the same time every time.

76
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.060 
Here another use
case - trash bins.

77
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.990 
In a busy and pedestrian zone
trash bins are quickly filled up

78
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.230 
and if they are filled up you
notice these pictures. Then

79
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.750 
the trash ends up on the street.
One can prevent this with a smart

80
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.710 
trash bin. A smart trash bin that
automatically sends a message

81
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:01.700 
to the city's department of sanitation
when maximum capacity is reached.

82
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:11.760 
See a smart trash bin can also
flap the cap, lock the

83
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:19.500 
the flap if it's filled.
The root of the

84
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.500 


85
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:25.350 
clearing cars can be
adapted to the filness

86
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:34.030 
degree of such trash bins. So there
are a lot of a lot of ideas

87
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.450 
around this internet of
things around a small city.

88
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:47.510 
also solar cells in the lid supply
energy to the bins. So here you see

89
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.660 
even areas like
agriculture

90
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:57.070 
can be organised by the internet of things
in a much smarter way. For example

91
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:04.430 
sensors in the soil inform the farmers about
the possibility the possible dryness

92
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:11.960 
or about frost or heat warnings or
in the a fitness tracker for cows

93
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.050 
measures of temperature, the
suggestive movement activities

94
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.890 
which are important to know in the
context of milk production or

95
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.190 
the measurable such

96
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:35.910 
smart devices that measure and
automatic feed deliveries for

97
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:41.510 
a different. In the area of
health we speak about e-health

98
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:48.220 
or digital health there is a lot of
scenarios in this smart devices.

99
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.220 
You all know this as
a fitness tracker.

100
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:57.180 
This fitness tracker that
continues a measure and monitor

101
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.760 
your health situation.

102
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.750 
They are integrated sensors which
are able to measure health

103
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.590 
data like blood pressure, pules
rate, number of steps taken

104
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:15.680 
and the collection of such data
and then analytics of such data

105
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:22.580 
find for example to transfer this data
to the smartphone or into the cloud.

106
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.890 
Then one can access this data and can
share it with the physician and others.

107
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:35.100 
They implanted a pacemakers,
monitors vulnerable people

108
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.100 
of an vulnerable
people

109
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.770 
in everyday life
situation

110
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.220 
in the event and in the event of
a life threatening situation,

111
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:49.370 
an emergency signal can be sent
to the smart phone or even

112
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.160 
directly to the doctor.

113
00:10:52.550 --> 00:11:00.490 
So there are a lot of use
scenarios for such smart devices

114
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.300 
in the internet
of things.

115
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.240 
What are the requirements, what is
the hardware and software needed?

116
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:15.270 
Of course such device need to be
high reliability in the systems.

117
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.800 
For example in the health context
it is very important that you

118
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:28.040 
can trust and can trust on such
devices and be sure of the arrival.

119
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:36.830 
Because they are distributed and in the
environment low maintenance is important,

120
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:43.100 
low energy consumption is very important
and also lower purchase costs.

121
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:50.500 
The use of technologies are for example
RFID, are QR codes, are bar codes.

122
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.680 
This can be used even for devices
with only a very tiny computational

123
00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:04.200 
infrastructure or with
low energy, low

124
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.270 


125
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.200 
low

126
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.530 
amount of energy that's
available. Sensors, actuators

127
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.730 
are a technology in the internet
of things and of course

128
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.790 
the internet itself and web
technologies like TCP, UDP,

129
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:26.120 
IPv4, IPv6, HTTP about this
internet protocols which

130
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.470 
we will learn more
in our course.

131
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:34.170 
So internet of things and a
more and more important part

132
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.980 
of the internet when we want to understand
the internet we have also to look

133
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.580 
to the internet of things and the
techniques that are used here.

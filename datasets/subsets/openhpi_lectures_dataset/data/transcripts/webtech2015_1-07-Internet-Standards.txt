00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.970 
To finish this introductory week, let's have a look on Internet Standards. How such

2
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.690 
internet standards are developed.

3
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.990 
We already mentioned that there is no government.

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.780 
There is no governmental institution that completely controls the internet.

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.240 
There is the Internet Society, there is the Internet Architecture Board that

6
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.960 
drives the development of the internet and the World Wide Web,

7
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.840 
but it's very interesting to see how the standards that are needed,

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.660 
that systems which interact over the internet

9
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.230 
are able to interpret and to show and to interact

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.730 
in a way in a re-designed way.

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.780 
The internet standard is a specification that is supported

12
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.190 
by the internet community. Only if internet community, if all the players

13
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.740 
accept such a solution is step that the format is accept such a protocol

14
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.080 
then this protocol can be used and understood.

15
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.830 
How is that Internet Standards are developed?

16
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.460 
The sarting point of such internet standards are so called

17
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.760 
RFC- Request for Comments.

18
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.620 
Already this is funny, comments asked to comment something-

19
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.170 
a technical development technique.

20
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.260 
This is a starting point of an internet standard.

21
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.460 
Such RFC, everyone is allowed to submit such RFC. Such RFC could contain proposals

22
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.450 
for establishing new internet standards

23
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.650 
or for revising existing ones.

24
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.750 
In order to include the internet community,

25
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.840 
the internet community has to accept it.

26
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.660 
So it needs to be included. The request for comments are published online

27
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.090 
free of charge and the internet- the IESG

28
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.260 
from the Internet Architecture Board is responsible

29
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.470 
to controls its publishing process.

30
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.080 
Then there are different levels

31
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.730 
for such an inside such Standarization process.

32
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.740 
It starts within a so called

33
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.660 
Internet draft. Internet draft that may be submitted by individuals

34
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.530 
or by working groups.

35
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.390 
Then it gets a number and it's

36
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.730 
archived, and it becomes an RFC proposed standard.

37
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.130 
So a draft that was approved by the

38
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.120 
IESG and IETF- Internet Engineering Task Force get this standard, gets the

39
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.660 
level of a proposed standard.

40
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.710 
So the prerequisite to get this

41
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.450 
level is that for proposed standards, at least two independent

42
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.900 
and interoperable implementations are needed within six months.

43
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.020 
The internet community

44
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.110 
has to prove that it is interested in getting this implemented.

45
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.240 
And as proof is considered if there are two independent

46
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.800 
or interoperable implementations occur within this six months.

47
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.760 
Then after sufficient experience with these implementations, a proposed standard

48
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.490 
can get, can reach the status of an RFC Internet Standard.

49
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.950 
The Internet Architecture Board is responsible to establish status,

50
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.820 
status for each,

51
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.420 
standard. There are different status, example required,

52
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.820 
recommended, elective, limited use, not recommended.

53
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.630 
And this is order is discussed in the group, in the Internet Architecture Board

54
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.510 
and should help the users in the internet players

55
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.250 
to get help in characterizing what's the meaning of this internet standard.

56
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.400 
If we look to the process for such standardization in the internet,

57
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.360 
then it startz with the internet draft. Every

58
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.140 
individual can send such a draft, every working group can submit such a draft.

59
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.870 
Then after an improvement from the internet

60
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.830 
IESG, then it gets a status of a proposed standard and

61
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.960 
within six months two independent implementations are needed.

62
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.860 
And then, in this process, it can be changed for example from the learnings,

63
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.630 
from the implementations and if it is changed

64
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.930 
then it

65
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.820 
gets back to the status of internet draft, and if it remains unchanged

66
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.410 
then it can become an official internet standard.

67
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.500 
By the way there are many standards that never reached a valid in the internet,

68
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.070 
that never reached the internet official standards.

69
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.930 
If we look to the World Wide Web

70
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.830 
Consortium, we mentioned already they are not allowed to develop such standards.

71
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.990 
But what they do is they can develop such recommendations and

72
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.890 
they can publish the recommendations.

73
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.020 
And this recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium

74
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.750 
play a similar role like the RFC's standards in the internet.

75
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.530 
So the development of such an

76
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.020 
recommendation of the World

77
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:23.120 
World Wide Web Consortium is quite similar to the Internet Architecture Board Standards,

78
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.610 
but it's somewhat more, somewhat less restrictive.

79
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.650 
So there are different stages of development. There's a working

80
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.980 
draft in the beginning.

81
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.120 
It's openly accessible and open to comment. Everyone can discuss

82
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.410 
about it. Everyone can try. Then there is a

83
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.320 
Candidate Eecommendation

84
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.490 
when only minor changes

85
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.380 
and development in the implementations are necessary.

86
00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.040 
And it can then reach the status of a proposed recommendation.

87
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.440 
Request supplemented by documentation and

88
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.900 
evaluation of the implementations that prove that this is a useful

89
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.590 
approach, a useful technique, a useful recommendation and then

90
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:25.560 
after it is approved by the World Wide Web Consortium, it

91
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.080 
gets the status of a recommendation.

92
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.060 
All the drafts of the World Wide Web Consortium and all the recommendations

93
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.030 
of course are available like the internet starts online.

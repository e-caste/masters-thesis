00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.150 
Welcome back. This module is about
making your ideas tangible

2
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.940 
and building simple prototypes.
Let's talk about the advantages

3
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.390 
of prototypes: Prototypes will help
you to demonstrate and communicate

4
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.060 
your idea with others, whether
you are talking to potential

5
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.390 
users or with clients. It helps
you to get your idea across.

6
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.120 
Prototypes can save you a lot of
resources and time as well.

7
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.040 
Instead of spending a lot of
effort and money on building

8
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.190 
an idea, you can make a simple
and cheap prototype first and

9
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.580 
test it and learn a lot about it.
When you test the prototype,

10
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.190 
you might not get that desired
positive feedback that you wished

11
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.240 
for, but that's alright! It's a
valuable and essential step.

12
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.630 
You can learn a lot of
details about your idea

13
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.990 
by testing it with potential
users and refining it.

14
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.510 
Building a prototype is about
taking the mental image of the

15
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.110 
idea and exploring it further.
It also helps you to trigger

16
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.090 
new ideas. Don't worry if you're
not a designer or an engineer!

17
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.220 
Anyone can build rapid prototypes.
- The goal of this module is

18
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.780 
to teach you the basic skills you
need for making low fidelity

19
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.600 
prototypes. Low fidelity prototypes,
also known as lo-fi prototypes,

20
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.360 
are prototypes that are
sketchy and incomplete.

21
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.910 
The power of lo-fi
prototypes is that

22
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.330 
they will help you to learn a lot
about your idea without spending

23
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.390 
so much time or money on it. For
instance you can make a lo-fi

24
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.940 
prototype of a digital solution
without a line of coding

25
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.650 
by using paper mock-ups. - Or you can
prototype a service or experience

26
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.380 
and you can act it out, or you
can create a role play for

27
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.960 
this. - We will discuss
different prototyping methods

28
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.190 
in this module. So here we want
to talk about an example in

29
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
a real life project to show you
the power of prototyping.

30
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.780 
The famous design agency IDEO
was working with a company and

31
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.320 
they wanted to develop a
new nasal surgical tool

32
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.860 
that had different features. So
there was a team of designers

33
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.110 
and a team of surgeons that were
sitting and discussing and

34
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.320 
the surgeons were talking about
what they wanted to see from this

35
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.260 
new tool. And there were a lot of
discussions but not that much

36
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.590 
progress until one of the
designers jumped out,

37
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.240 
comes back with some random
material that he found, taped

38
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.080 
them together and he shows them
to the client. And by building

39
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.740 
this very basic prototype it
really helps the team and

40
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.530 
the client to get the same idea
and get on the same page about

41
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.870 
what this device could look
like and what it can contain.

42
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.290 
The finished solution is
the surgical tool called

43
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.200 
Diego Surgical System and it
was already used in thousands

44
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.290 
of surgeries in the past years.
So in this picture you see

45
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.290 
that there is still a resemblance
with the original lo-fi prototype.

46
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.520 
This week we will introduce you
to different techniques of

47
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.880 
prototyping and talk about which
technique to use in which

48
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.980 
situation. We also talk about
how to plan for your prototype

49
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.690 
and there will be a podcast for
those of you who want to learn

50
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.960 
about the theory behind prototyping.
So we hope you enjoy!

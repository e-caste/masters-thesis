00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.699 
Hello, it's me again, it's from the European Academy

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.799 
and its next video clip, I want to talk about mainframe security within

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.329 
our operating system. And in this case, I talk,

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.930 
of course, about our z/OS environment,

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.229 
the components of Social Security. So is if

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.429 
resource access control facilities, this is the most important part of the security

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.899 
service. It's also possible to implement DCE

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.639 
Security Sova and they are also z/OS firewall

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.609 
technologies available. In my opinion.

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.589 
These are and my experience is that these z/OS firewall technologies

11
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.299 
are not really often used because in many environments

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.799 
firewalls are already implemented on other platforms before

13
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.609 
and access goes into a mainframe environment.

14
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.768 
An important part of the security server is also

15
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.269 
added up. So you can implement and end up so very easily

16
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.989 
in an mainstream environment and get access.

17
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
We always end up SOA and the graphical interface and

18
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.409 
the proposal as example and get access to the environment

19
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.289 
and the cryptographic support functions available for

20
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.609 
implementing cryptographic technologies.

21
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.559 
When we talk about mainframes, says often, quote, heard

22
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.109 
that z/OS is the most secure commercial operating system available.

23
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.549 
I only partly agree to the statement I want to

24
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.349 
change this quote. To see us is the most secure global

25
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.939 
commercial operating system. It means you really have to do something to get

26
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.919 
the the really highest security that is available today

27
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.450 
on commercial systems.

28
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.379 
This is the picture of the system authorization facility,

29
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.899 
the system authorization facility is a component built into

30
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.719 
the z/OS operating system.

31
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.279 
It means is it is part of the operating system and you

32
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.929 
use interfaces to the system authorization facility

33
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.659 
to check if and access to a resource

34
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.509 
is granted or not.

35
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.189 
And as additional components you have in so-called external

36
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.989 
security protocols in place

37
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.179 
to support the the data and definitions.

38
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.919 
And in most cases, this is a of resource access

39
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.799 
control facility is the IBM product.

40
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.009 
So other products available from as example, Computer Associates,

41
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.759 
ACFTU are top secret and

42
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.289 
I think all the other security products

43
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.329 
are available.

44
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.889 
And the resource managers that want to

45
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.539 
check if an access is granted or not can

46
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.069 
be a lot of different components means DFPS,

47
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.019 
a data facility product. It's a data management component within

48
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.019 
z/OS, open, close and so on.

49
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.759 
Of course, if I open to a data set, it has to be checked

50
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.199 
before if I'm able to access this data set, unique

51
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.819 
system services, storage management, transaction

52
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.639 
management databases and so on.

53
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.329 
All these are resource managers that use interfaces to the system

54
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.419 
was also a special facility and behind system authorization facility

55
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.039 
sales and security product with all the data.

56
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.849 
And, um, configuration management.

57
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.528 
Now, let's have a look into if as one of the

58
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.480 
external security products that are available, if you see

59
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.609 
the product from IBM and in each and every case, it's really

60
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.630 
important to look at the

61
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.079 
events that are occurring.

62
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.579 
There are two possibilities. In most cases, both are used.

63
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.979 
We can lock information to see if the console

64
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.839 
or we can implement a special console for

65
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.769 
security locks.

66
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.389 
We use SMS as a system management facility.

67
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.369 
It's a really important component within z/OS

68
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.679 
to lock each and every event that occurs in a z/OS environment.

69
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.619 
We have enough users that have to be defined.

70
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.049 
And today, in each and every environment, it's

71
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.699 
really notable that each and every user who wants to have

72
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.349 
access to a series also have to be an active user.

73
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.819 
It means you have to be integrated into

74
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.439 
the environment. The user profile has to be generated for

75
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.179 
such a user means each and every user today also have to be

76
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.979 
an issue. So we have active commands available.

77
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.449 
I show some of these commands after words in one of our

78
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.439 
next video clips with a short demonstration.

79
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.999 
We have utilities to get some statistics out of

80
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.589 
our environment. Utilities, there are two kinds

81
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.179 
of utilities. One is for the administration of

82
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.009 
such an environment and as all part

83
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.959 
of utilities or some utilities are available for audit

84
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960 
functions.

85
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.939 
But if it is organized with both sides, so

86
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.379 
each and every user has to have a profile

87
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.849 
and each and every user has to belong

88
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.540 
to at least one group, and each and every group

89
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.769 
also has a profile.

90
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.599 
And then we have two kinds of profile to protect resources.

91
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.099 
One is the data set profiles and the other is

92
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.189 
general resource and with general resource.

93
00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.289 
In fact, we can protect each and every resource

94
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.759 
that are available in our z/OS

95
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.620 
environment. But it depends if you really have to use

96
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.769 
these protection.

97
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.269 
As example, terminals today are no longer

98
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.399 
physically terminals are no longer in place, though they do not need to be protected.

99
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.169 
And another example that devices normally today

100
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.729 
also have not to be protected with rockets because dust devices

101
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.909 
are managed by storage management.

102
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.649 
We come to storage management in one of the next video clips, storage

103
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.179 
management managers, which

104
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.479 
data is stored on which volumes.

105
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.609 
So we don't need to have the security

106
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.119 
protection on Tosti devices.

107
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.699 
And the same is true on tape devices.

108
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.909 
This is a lack of SPF panel and interactive

109
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.769 
interface to if I show this again in

110
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.920 
my demonstration video clip

111
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.309 
we have for each of the three profile ileum we

112
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.779 
saw of the overview picture of rockets that we have

113
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.849 
for different kinds of profiles.

114
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.319 
We have user profiles, we have group profiles, we have data set profiles, and we have

115
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.908 
general resource profiles. And all these profiles have to be managed.

116
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.499 
And this management can be done by commands we have defined

117
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.799 
for each and every profile type.

118
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.759 
We have an alter for altering the profile.

119
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.559 
We have a list for listing the profile and we have a delete foget

120
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.560 
profile.

121
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.140 
How workers meet security needs an important

122
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:08.529 
part of security, of course, is identification of users.

123
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.329 
Each user must have an individual user ID, no exceptions.

124
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.749 
In the past, some generic

125
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.979 
users values by by multiple people.

126
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.119 
This is no longer necessary.

127
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.739 
So in today's environment, each and every user has to have its

128
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.559 
own individual user ID and he can get all the

129
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.820 
authorizations he needs to to fulfill his role.

130
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.519 
If he is a database administrator or an

131
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.169 
administrator or whatever his role is developer, all

132
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.039 
the authorities can be given.

133
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.359 
We are the.

134
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000 
Wolfhounds.

135
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.879 
Verification means that at least a passport is necessary and proof that the

136
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.679 
user is the person he claims to be and sometimes more than the passport

137
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.919 
is necessarily necessary in between.

138
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.929 
Also, multi factor authorization

139
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.470 
is possible in mainstream environments.

140
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.979 
Access control means that secured resources may only be accessed by authenticated

141
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.799 
persons and knocking and reporting.

142
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.509 
I already mentioned it has to be implemented and customized.

143
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.179 
User interface has to be flexible as to be has to have

144
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.979 
a sound structure and an easy handling is necessary

145
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.090 
ijo these interfaces afterwards in a short demonstration.

146
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.979 
This was a video clip concerning US security

147
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.779 
over for questions and remarks, please use, as always,

148
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.859 
for discussion forum on our HPI platform.

149
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.059 
Thank you very much for attending and see you in one of the next video clips.

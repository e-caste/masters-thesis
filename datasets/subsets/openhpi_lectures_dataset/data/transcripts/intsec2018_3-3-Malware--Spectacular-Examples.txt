00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.050 
Here are some spectacular
examples of

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.840 
malware attacks.

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.990 
This is interesting to see
the wide variety of attacks

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.110 
that can be performed with
malware, so that it motivates

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.370 
you to be very careful to
get your computer not

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.560 
infiltrated with malware.
So I will shortly discuss

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.660 
the cookie monster. I will discuss
the micro virus" I love you".

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.850 
the conficker, the stuxnet,
the regin a malware

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.660 
the campaign malvertising
ransomware so that you

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.730 
and wannacry. Starting
with a cookie monster,

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.690 
it was really something you can
laugh about it. So the cookie

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.970 
monster is neither a proper virus,
because it replicates itself

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
nor a worm, because
it does not spread.

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.680 
It is therefore called
a proto virus.

15
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.680 
and cookie monster is considered
the first worldwide example

16
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.880 
of a computer malware and it
did it's worse in the late

17
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.640 
sixties. Originally it
was intended for users

18
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.590 
of the computer network
of the Brown university

19
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.020 
and the idea or the attack
of this cookie monster

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
was that it sends messages that
block another applications on

21
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.750 
the computer, and asked for
cookies to get access

22
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.490 
back to the system. So significantly
this a cookie monster impaired

23
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.110 
the performance of the affected
systems and users were only able

24
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.500 
to use blocked applications back
and continue to work after

25
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.470 
typing the word cookie.
You see it so harmless,

26
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.300 
but it prevents people to use
computer, if they did not have

27
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.280 
this idea and the original
Brown university shows

28
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.690 
that there was, it's assumed
that there was a gang

29
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.930 
of students of Brown
university to develop

30
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.250 
this malware." I love you" is
another malicious software

31
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.920 
which was launched
from the Philippines

32
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.190 
in the year 2000 and
the idea of this

33
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.180 
malware was
working that

34
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.710 
it was sent as an email with
the subject" I love you",

35
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.160 
and then there was an attachment,
the attachment" Love letter

36
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.650 
for you.txt.vbs which
contained the malware.

37
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.460 
The .vbs is a visual
basic script extension.

38
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.850 
This was not displayed
in the windows systems

39
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.320 
and this was performed
and affected users

40
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.900 
that opens the malware
when they that started

41
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.030 
infiltration of the
malware, when they opened

42
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.920 
this attachment, this
love letter for you.

43
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.640 
Then the infiltrated malware
starts to send itself

44
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.120 
to all contacts from the
windows address book

45
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.950 
of the owner of the system
and then they overwrote

46
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.480 
image files. And you see they
were really damaging, because

47
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.990 
each infected systems, all the
contacts, all the contacts in

48
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.450 
the windows address book where
is infiltrated, if the

49
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.490 
user's opened the
attachment of this mail.

50
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.840 
The users viewed the
email as trustworthy

51
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.810 
with attachment, because
it came from a contact,

52
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.800 
it came from the window
address book so it was a

53
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.900 
contact of the person. so the
uses that received this mail,

54
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.770 
this I love you
mail with the

55
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.000 
attachment, they looked at it
as coming from a trustworthy

56
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.720 
party and often they opened
the attachment and

57
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.590 
in this way, they start to
become with their own system

58
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.730 
an origin for new infections.
The damage is estimated

59
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.530 
at five to eight billion us
dollar and it was estimated

60
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.670 
that ten percent of
all internet users

61
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.360 
who were affected. So fifty
million affections were

62
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.020 
recorded in the first ten
days of this malware,

63
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.560 
of this I love you malware.
Another popular malware

64
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.730 
attack was performed by
the conficker malware

65
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.450 
which was discovered
in November 2008.

66
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.090 
It spiked windows systems via
both via vulnerabilities

67
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.150 
in the windows and an attack on
the administrator password.

68
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.810 
Then add-ons were loaded to
other infected computers

69
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.370 
via the internet
and the

70
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.960 
integrated affected
the infected systems

71
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.460 
where integrated
in a botnet.

72
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.350 
This way different types of
attacks were combined with this

73
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
conficker, so the comments are
received over the network and

74
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.670 
executed without further checking.
It was installed on removable

75
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.810 
media abuse from the
removal media,

76
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.020 
is installed on the
removable media

77
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.590 
which abuses the autorun function
and the dictionary attacks

78
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.760 
on admin attacks were
part of this conficker,

79
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.590 
attack and finally files
are used, printer

80
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.230 
sharing functionality was
used for distribution.

81
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.080 
Another famous malware
was stuxnet.

82
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.850 
The stuxnet worm entered the
circulation at the end of

83
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.730 
2007, but it was
not discovered

84
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:43.930 
until 2010. The stuxnet worm
used a variety of previously

85
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.270 
unknown vulnerabilities in
windows systems and networks.

86
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.170 
So it's assumed
that this access

87
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.810 
to this zero day
exploit was only

88
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.260 
able for a very small
group of people which

89
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.440 
gets paid a lot to get
this information.

90
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.250 
Subsequently, how
there was searched

91
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.530 
after misusing the vulnerability
of the windows system.

92
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.190 
There was a
system search

93
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.020 
for a control software, for industrial
systems coming from Siemens.

94
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.690 
So the software for the control
of the technical processes

95
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:36.110 
in water works in pipelines,
factories, but also in nuclear power

96
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.000 
plants. this software which
were known to be used there

97
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.230 
and then if such
systems were found.

98
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:50.730 
Another infiltration over
the networks was done via

99
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.820 
removable media,
via usb stick,

100
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.450 
and only sporadic internet
access was required

101
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.080 
for the communication with the
control and command server.

102
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.440 
So the people which are
infected could not seen

103
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.710 
analyzing the traffic, or
it was very difficult

104
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.530 
to see analyzing the traffic
that there is coming

105
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.680 
commands and connection
to an external server.

106
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.110 
And then by means of
the stuxnet worm,

107
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.360 
the settings of the
control software,

108
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:32.040 
configurations where are changed.
They were changed in a way that

109
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.820 
the owner of the system did
not be aware of this change.

110
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:43.050 
And then in the result stuxnet
caused a damaged in Iranian

111
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.340 
nuclear power plants and
consequently and this seems to be

112
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:53.720 
the idea of that dark swarm
attack, they delayed the nuclear

113
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:59.510 
power program from Iran.
So you see here with

114
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:04.780 
this example of malware, some
vulnerabilities of systems

115
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.260 
are used, sometimes
some vulnerabilities

116
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:15.160 
that are not known in the public,
and in this way no protection

117
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.750 
measures are in place.
and you see also that

118
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.090 
here with such a
complicated attack.

119
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.260 
It seems that the
powerful party with

120
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.410 
lot of resources with a
lot of money was able,

121
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.200 
was only able to do such type
of attack. and here you

122
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.620 
see it was also with a
political mission.

123
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.650 
Regin is a highly
developed other malware

124
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.420 
which was discovered
in 2012,

125
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.840 
and which was mainly
used for espionage.

126
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.710 
In the most cases the regin
attacks, regin attacks windows

127
00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:00.970 
systems and performs a
variety of functions,

128
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.640 
for example, stealing
access information,

129
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.850 
remote access to systems,
control of mouse and keyboard,

130
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.920 
the recording of data
traffic and others.

131
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:19.290 
Also infected system from
mobile operators could such

132
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.340 
infected systems from mobile
operators and could

133
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.870 
such influence and spy
out the communication

134
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.780 
in this mobile world. The
quality of that malware

135
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.220 
the complex scope of functions
and the rumors point

136
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.160 
to the fact that the attackers
were state-sponsored,

137
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.150 
similar like in the case
of a stuxnet malware.

138
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.640 
Another popular malware attack
is so called campaign.

139
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.220 
Malvertising,
Malvertising,

140
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.980 
Malicious advertising
here an attacker

141
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.930 
registers with an ad
network and distributes

142
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.550 
malicious advertisement. Then
as the malware is loaded by

143
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.400 
the malicious ad when it
appears to the user.

144
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.850 
and in October 2015

145
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.000 
cybercriminals distributed
malware in the so called

146
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.190 
Kampagnen action. And in the
result of that attack,

147
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.180 
the affected
internet sites,

148
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.070 
there were internet
sites affected

149
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.690 
from huge companies like ebay,
like t-online, like arcor

150
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.200 
and others. Ransom32 is
another popular malware

151
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.880 
attack, ransom32
has been offered

152
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.400 
as a ransomware service on relevant
internet sites since october

153
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.240 
2015. The malware is
rather simply generated

154
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:07.370 
through the website and the objective
is to extorting bitcoins.

155
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.030 
Bitcoins from this
crypto currency, from

156
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.460 
the victims. 20%
of the revenue,

157
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.960 
if you speak
of revenue,

158
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.240 
is retained by the developers
of that malware,

159
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:28.050 
and the developers use techniques
that enable the execution

160
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.680 
of different platforms. For
example, execution on windows

161
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:38.410 
on Mac on Linux, in addition to
the encrypting, in addition to

162
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.980 
encrypting the user
data, ransom32 also

163
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.920 
contains other functionality,
for example locking

164
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.650 
the computer or others. WannaCry
the last example I want

165
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.770 
to mention in the
series of famous

166
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.970 
malware attacks. WannaCry
is a ransomware

167
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:09.180 
that was mainly active in
last year in May 2017.

168
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.780 
According to Microsoft NSA discovered
the vulnerability in Microsoft

169
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.110 
Windows, But they did not publish
and didn't mention it, to

170
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.540 
Windows and did not publish
this vulnerability.

171
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:28.330 
But they used it to
build an exploit for

172
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.090 
doing some work on the
people's computers.

173
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:38.870 
NSA informed Microsoft only after
the exploit was leaked from

174
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:44.930 
NSA by a hacker group, and
later on misused so microsoft

175
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:50.730 
provided patches for this
vulnerability very shortly in March

176
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.530 
2017. But many companies,
many users did not

177
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.050 
apply updates. And this brings
us back to the point,

178
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.560 
it's very important to apply
updates to protect your computer.

179
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.830 
Here you see an example
in may 2017. There

180
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:12.180 
was this huge attack. The
update was available

181
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:18.490 
already in march 2017.
So the exploit, the

182
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.880 
WannaCry the exploit of the WannaCry
malware was used by other

183
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.800 
hacker groups to build
ransomware that encrypts

184
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.760 
the data on a computer particularly
the personal data, and then

185
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:37.450 
money is requested
for decrypt

186
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.330 
the data. Very huge
number of companies

187
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.790 
were affected by the wannacry
attack, for example Deutsche Bahn

188
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.910 
Honda, Nissan, O2, FedEx,
and Hospitals in UK.

189
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.280 
And particularly the last
case with the hospital

190
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.810 
became very popular
and shows that

191
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.180 
our modern society is
really vulnerability by

192
00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.950 
such attacks coming
over the internet.

193
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.120 
And it's really important to
increase the security awareness

194
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.590 
and to help people to
protect their system,

195
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.190 
to make such attacks
impossible in the future.

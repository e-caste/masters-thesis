Hi, I'm Annie Kerguenne,

2
00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:10.350 
a Design Thinking Strategist

3
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:12.590 
and Master Coach for Executive Trainings.

4
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:15.670 
At the HPI, I'm responsible for the long-term

5
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:16.730 
design thinking formats

6
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:18.420 
like the professional track,

7
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.190 
and leading digital transformation and innovation.

8
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:24.120 
One of the biggest misunderstandings

9
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.970 
and polarizing topics in design

10
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:28.150 
thinking is the principle of FAILURE.

11
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.690 
Which is normal, because failing is contradicting

12
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:33.140 
everything we have learned

13
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:35.410 
since the very first steps of our education.

14
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.090 
When we grow up,

15
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:40.170 
we quickly lose our drive of trying out things,

16
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.690 
and we lose our curiosity. In school, university

17
00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:44.800 
and in our jobs,

18
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:48.770 
we're supposed to deliver "the one and only perfect result".

19
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:51.700 
No time, no money for experimentation!

20
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.580 
The faster we deliver, the better we are.

21
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.330 
And this is exactly the appropriate strategy,

22
00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:00.930 
when we know exactly where to go: from A to B.

23
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:03.730 
But today established companies

24
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:04.700 
as well as start-ups

25
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:06.340 
have to deal with challenges

26
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:08.840 
that do not have predefined solutions.

27
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:10.710 
Your challenges today

28
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:12.250 
may look more like a labyrinth

29
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:13.780 
than like a roadmap.

30
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:17.710 
Failing early and often, or experimenting

31
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:21.040 
forward is one of the fundamental design thinking principles.

32
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.130 
It has its roots in system engineering.

33
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.130 
This iterative procedure means that

34
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:30.870 
instead of doing one big step, from concept to the final solution,

35
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.860 
you cut your development process in small steps,

36
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:37.120 
and you expose those steps to your users

37
00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:39.750 
for feedback. This guarantees

38
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.260 
early detection of bugs and mistakes,

39
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:45.290 
while you're moving forward towards an exact solution

40
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:46.020 
for your challenge.

41
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:49.820 
By the way, just take some seconds

42
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:52.670 
to reflect how one can reach such high success

43
00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:54.340 
as a star decorated chef,

44
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:55.930 
a gold medal winner,

45
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:58.130 
or simply growing as an adult

46
00:01:58.131 --> 00:01:59.980 
with all your talents and skills.

47
00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:03.060 
Yes, it's by experimenting forward,

48
00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:05.280 
which is the fundamental driver

49
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:07.610 
of evolution and growth to excellence.

50
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:11.180 
So knowing how to apply the design thinking

51
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:12.920 
process is a starting point.

52
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:17.100 
Adapting and experimenting forward mindset

53
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:19.230 
in all complex situations

54
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:21.430 
will help you being more efficient,

55
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:22.880 
more user-oriented,

56
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:23.900 
and in the end

57
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:25.960 
more responsible regarding the budget

58
00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:29.920 
you have been entrusted with. Just dare, failing

59
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:32.640 
early to learn quickly and succeed sooner.

60
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:35.580 
It's simply in our nature as human beings.

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.540 
In our OpenHPI course about
cyberthreats by malware,

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.050 
now I want to introduce Scareware
and Rougeware as also very

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.680 
dangerous types
of malware. So scareware,

4
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.200 
also called rogueware is malware
that scares the users,

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.980 
with the goal that the users then
install malware to solve fake

6
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.990 
issues on their system.

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.890 
Imagine you are working on your system
and then you got the information

8
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.880 
shown on your desktop
"virus detected",so you are

9
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.210 
shocked what happened!

10
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.100 
will I lose my data?

11
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.300 
So this scareware is using

12
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.970 
such type of social
engineering attacks

13
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.570 
by showing such messages, "virus detected",
or error messages, or "be careful

14
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.410 
system is crashing" or other things
and

15
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.070 
it offers help. So the
scareware sends such fake

16
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.120 
information to scare the user and then
there is an offer to download something,

17
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.770 
to download a software or to
purchase software to solve this

18
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.430 
fake problems.

19
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.090 
Actually it is a malware that could
steal personal user information

20
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.090 
or take complete
control of a user system.

21
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
Often it appears at malicious
pop up advertisements,

22
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.750 
or spread via spam emails
to the user systems.

23
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.430 
To show an example
of such an scareware, the error

24
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.950 
DW6VB36, it is

25
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.190 
displayed on your computer, an
information you run on a Windows system,

26
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.540 
so it looks very trustworthy,
and then there is information

27
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.660 
your computer was closed. This
is a mistake and then

28
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.730 
the name of the
scareware is not written.

29
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.960 
If you look in detail this is a message
to scare the user,

30
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.270 
to bring him in a
hectic situation,

31
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.970 
and here the help, the
offer of help please call

32
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.290 
the telephone number so and so.

33
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.960 
And there the user
gets advice

34
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.610 
what was designed on
his display by means of the scareware.

35
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.190 
What are the protective measures
against such scareware?

36
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.240 
If possible, simply
close the scareware,

37
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.370 
and then it's finished. If you
do not start to follow the

38
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.210 
proposed actions
which after this

39
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.590 
bad message on your computer,

40
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.150 
simply close.

41
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.710 
In any case you should not click
any link that is displayed

42
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.060 
by the scareware,
you should not

43
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.880 
call, or use the telephone
number, and others.

44
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.320 
And you should
not download

45
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.000 
or even pay for a software
that is proposed to you to

46
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.920 
repair this fake problem the
scareware has displayed to you.

47
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.380 
The scareware can be detected by
anti-virus and anti-malware programs,

48
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.350 
so you should have such programs and
then by means of this programs

49
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.490 
it's also possible to detect such scareware
on your computer and to remove it.

50
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.610 
So please be careful if there are such
fake messages, do not immediately start

51
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.620 
to follow the proposed

52
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.050 
help, proposals, links

53
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.680 
and recommendations.

54
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:50.230 
Stay clear and a trust in
your system, trust in your

55
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.940 
anti-virus software. Of course that
needs to be installed and needs

56
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.310 
to be updated regularly
on your computer.

1
00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:07.610 
But how can we find inspirations? By looking

2
00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:09.910 
and listening carefully to our surroundings.

3
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:12.780 
Instead of surveying people,

4
00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:15.250 
we want to immerse ourselves in their lives

5
00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:16.940 
and see things through their eyes

6
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:18.750 
and learn about their experiences.

7
00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:20.580 
We want to observe

8
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:23.490 
and ask questions from people about their behaviors

9
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:24.300 
and rituals,

10
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:26.480 
in order to understand their hidden needs.

11
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:29.170 
Although talking to a mainstream user

12
00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:31.230 
might help us understand the challenge better,

13
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.180 
we will find inspirations from those that show

14
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:35.700 
very different behaviors

15
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:37.050 
in a given scenario

16
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.200 
or in relation to a product or service.

17
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.130 
They can formulate

18
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:43.890 
and point out problems that the mainstream user

19
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:44.870 
might also have.

20
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:47.530 
Imagine you were working on a project

21
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:49.660 
related to improving household tools.

22
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:51.880 
Take a moment to think about

23
00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:53.350 
who could be an extreme user,

24
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:59.630 
in this case. One example of an extreme user

25
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:01.310 
could be a professional handyman

26
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:04.310 
who uses these tools on an advanced level.

27
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.460 
Another extreme might be a retired grandfather

28
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:09.040 
who would also use the tools,

29
00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.790 
but might have different needs because of his physical condition.

30
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.480 
How about a young student who just started living alone,

31
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.710 
and got a tool box from his parents as a gift

32
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.810 
and now he's going to use it for the very first time?

33
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:23.580 
These are just some of the examples of where

34
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:26.590 
to find inspirations beyond the obvious and mainstream.

35
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.780 
Adopt a curious mindset.

36
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.070 
Try to pay attention to people's feelings and emotions

37
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:33.160 
as they experience

38
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:35.070 
something or interact with products

39
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:36.180 
and services around them.

40
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.710 
This will give you a lot of hints

41
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:39.650 
and inspirations

42
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.940 
for creating solutions that will delight them.

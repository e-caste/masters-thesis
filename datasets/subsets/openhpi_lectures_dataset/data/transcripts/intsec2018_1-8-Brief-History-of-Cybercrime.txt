00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.450 
This is a brief history
of cybercrime. Since

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.490 
such electronic systems arrived,
there were attempts to

3
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.950 
attack these electronic
devices for whatever purpose,

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.590 
for whatever reason. Already in
1903 when Guglielmo Marcone

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.120 
demonstrated the first
transatlantic radio link,

6
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.030 
signals were intercepted
by Nevil Maskelyne and

7
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.070 
unautorized messages
were sent to the

8
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.980 
receiver instead. So even
in the first experiments

9
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.170 
to bridge the Atlantic for
transmitting a radio information

10
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.670 
over the Atlantic, there
was people that tried to

11
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.450 
attack this and to send
to use this link

12
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.640 
to send unauthorized
messages. From the 1930s

13
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
and during the second
world war there were

14
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.550 
even sometimes industrial
organized attempts

15
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.720 
to break into cryptosystems, for
example to break into the

16
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.940 
famous enigma encryption.
They succeeded to

17
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.350 
do this, so they could encrypt
all the information

18
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.000 
sent from the German

19
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.320 
army. The famous Turing

20
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.880 
was head of this
industrial organized

21
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.290 
decryption station in
U.K. Then later in the

22
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.860 
1970s there was a
phone freak movement

23
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.200 
in the U.S and this phone freak
movement they tried to get access

24
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.880 
to the communication
system, to the telephone

25
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.870 
communication system without
paying. This could be seen

26
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.440 
as the first hackers,
telephone hackers

27
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.240 
the phreakers and what they did
they searched for flaws in

28
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.510 
telephone systems then to make
cheaper use or even free

29
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.540 
phone calls. For you in
our days we have to

30
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.820 
remember that to make
long distance calls

31
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.000 
in that time, so it was extremely expensive
so there was a big motivation

32
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.770 
to get a cheaper or even
to do it for free.

33
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.100 
Of course this is a criminal activity
though this criminal activities

34
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.720 
was explained with a confused
ideological justification

35
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.050 
and this justification said
freedom for communication it's a

36
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.770 
prerequisite for freedom of humanity
and in this light with this

37
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.730 
confused ideologic justification
the phreakers had the feeling to

38
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.160 
do something for the
freedom of humanity

39
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.620 
when they did criminal
attacks against the

40
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.130 
telecom companies. The scene
was organized by means

41
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.560 
of underground journals, a
famous one was this YIPL

42
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.830 
the Youth International Party
Line, later known as TAP

43
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.030 
Technological American Party.
This could be considered

44
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.350 
the first hacker
magazine.

45
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.520 
An example for that type of hacker
activity was blue boxing,

46
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.850 
connections could
supposedly

47
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.290 
by terminated by controlled
tone of a special

48
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.790 
frequency but the line to
the switching center

49
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.470 
remained open, then later
on it could be misused.

50
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.450 
This was an example of such
a phone freak attack.

51
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.540 
So the phreakers could
use this line this open

52
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.530 
line for their communication
without paying tariff.

53
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.370 
The blue box was a device for
generating various control

54
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.980 
tones for doing such type of
attacks. The first generation of

55
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.310 
computer hackers we have to say
when the personal computer became

56
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.120 
popular then the hacker
community grew as well.

57
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.740 
The goal was the infiltration of
computer networks. For example

58
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.010 
Kevin Mitnick, this is
a famous computer

59
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.520 
hacker of that time, he
got sentence in 1982

60
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.850 
because he infiltrated the
telecommunication company

61
00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.430 
PacBell and stole important
documents. Here you see there was

62
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.870 
a connection to the
phone phreakers.

63
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.810 
In Germany in 1981 the
CCC the Chaos Computer

64
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.500 
Club was founded, it started
as a German community but in

65
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.350 
late decades they became
an international

66
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.420 
community. Since '84 each
year they organize

67
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.770 
a congress the Chaos
Communication Congress,

68
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.860 
C3 and the last one
took place in Leipzig in

69
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.300 
2017 and a year before
it was in Hamburg

70
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.280 
with the motto
"works for me."

71
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.480 
Spectacular hacks that revealed
software errors and vulnerabilities

72
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.520 
which were
performed by CCC

73
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.880 
was for example
the attack

74
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.660 
against the newly
introduced BTX service

75
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.140 
of the Hamburger Sparkasse.
The members of the CCC

76
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.880 
they hacked this and
they transferred

77
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.440 
134 Deutsche
mark to the

78
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.470 
Chaos Computer Club. In 1996
to mention only one of

79
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.290 
other activities of CCC they
demonstrated an attack against

80
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.180 
Microsoft ActiveX to show
that there is an easy

81
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.720 
possibility to attack such
a very popular system.

82
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.800 
In 1998

83
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.140 
members of the Chaos
Computer Club cracked

84
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.950 
the COMP128 encryption
algorithm

85
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.550 
which was used
in many GSM

86
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.240 
sim cards. In 2008
the Chaos Computer

87
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.740 
Club to protest against the
use of biometric data

88
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.800 
in German ID cards with the computer
cars got published so the fingerprints

89
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.240 
of federal minister of the
interior Wolfang SchÃ¤uble.

90
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.250 
Another spectacular action of
the computer chaos group was

91
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.850 
2011 where they published
the technical analytics

92
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:26.230 
of poorly engineered
Bundestrojaner, federal

93
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.590 
spy software.

94
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.890 
If we look at the hacking
scene in the 1990s

95
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.290 
of the last century
then one could state

96
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.680 
that there was a rapid
spread of computer systems

97
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.460 
that lead to equally rapid
development of hacking activities.

98
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.290 
So for example the
state legal systems

99
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.990 
began to pay attention and
to enact legal regulations

100
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.790 
for example the computer misuse
act in Great Britain in 1990

101
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.840 
and U.S and Germany
and other countries.

102
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:15.470 
Attacks on computer systems
were classified as criminal

103
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.180 
and the same time we can see that
these attacks are performed

104
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.830 
increasingly automated.
Automated worms

105
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.220 
or scanners or other attack
tools caused a huge flood

106
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.530 
of a security incident, the
quantity of the log messages and

107
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.640 
the IT systems grow
rapidly, so the

108
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:46.220 
new type security systems
were developed for example

109
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.960 
the so called intrusion
detection systems

110
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:56.550 
the IDS they should help the
administrator to observe

111
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.470 
whether the system is in
a normal work situation

112
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:04.650 
or whether it is under attack and
monitoring system were developed

113
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.870 
in that year to
defend or at least

114
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.130 
to see that there are attackers,
that there are ongoing attacks.

115
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.710 
Then if we look to
computer crime in the

116
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.030 
early 2000 years almost
every computer system now

117
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.780 
in that time became
connected to the

118
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.500 
internet, the internet an open
network, we discussed this already

119
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.830 
so as a result the number
of security incidents

120
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.490 
increased dramatically, viruses,
worms, trojans became popular

121
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.880 
botnets occurred,
industrial espionage

122
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:50.600 
was extended to a
large extent,

123
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:56.720 
any large company has
to implement own

124
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.830 
departments for IT security,
find specialists

125
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.670 
that take care that the IT system
of the company runs in a secure

126
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.520 
way, hacking software became
more and more sophisticated

127
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.550 
and became easily available
on the internet.

128
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.880 
So the number of script
kiddies increased

129
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:23.190 
and the appearance of underground
networks such as tor or I2P

130
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:29.120 
or Freenet became
popular. Only

131
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:35.510 
a few remarks to cyber crime and
cyber war activities today.

132
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.810 
So security services in most
countries established cyber

133
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.240 
defense department cyber
defense departments

134
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.950 
for interior and exterior
protection. For example in Germany

135
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.330 
that the national
cyber defence center

136
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.730 
in the NATO has a co-operative
cyber defense center

137
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.450 
of excellence. In the USA they
have established the United

138
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:04.590 
States cyber command and
also in china the PLA unit

139
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.880 
61398 was established.

140
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.850 
Some famous act of which
was classified as

141
00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:19.090 
cyber war activity was
the following that

142
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.250 
the in 2007 there
was an attack

143
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.780 
in Estonia. So internet
services of the government

144
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:33.360 
of banks were attacked by a
distributed denial of service

145
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.070 
attacks with a huge impact on
society and on the economy.

146
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.330 
So for that reason this was not
an attack against the business

147
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.340 
or against the single
unit, it was an attack

148
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:54.110 
against the state Estonia and the
Estonian government accused

149
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.080 
Russia of attacks resulting
from a conflict

150
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:03.360 
with Russia about war memorial

151
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.190 
that was taken away
by the Estonians.

152
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.210 
To continue with some
current cyber attacks

153
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.550 
let's look back to August
2016. Here ShadowBrokers

154
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.910 
claimed to have
infiltrated a system

155
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.680 
of the NSA and retrieved
multiple tools vulnerabilities

156
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.440 
and the question was was
it true or not but

157
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.070 
slowly they released insights
for example information about

158
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.880 
an EternalBlue vulnerability
that was used in WannaCry

159
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:47.990 
and Petya in October
2016, the Mirai botnet

160
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.860 
performed a powerful denial
of service attack against

161
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.070 
Dyn, a DNS provider.

162
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.360 
So the effect was that the multiple
high-profile websites for example

163
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.000 
Netflix, github, twitter were
not available for hours.

164
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.170 
Another popular
attack was

165
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:16.450 
in May 2017 when
several types of

166
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.450 
ransomware for example
wannacry, petya, notpetya

167
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:26.290 
infected numerous
systems, encrypted the data

168
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.390 
on that computer and
then blackmailed money

169
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.640 
to recover the data. So
also such an attack

170
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.270 
was against that
hospital so that the

171
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.880 
system were not more working
not more correctly. So this

172
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.290 
is really a
dangerous attack.

173
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.720 
Then in October 2017 to
mention it at last

174
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.550 
researchers are detected
a crack vulnerability

175
00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:02.680 
in the WPA2 encryption
data for mobile

176
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.210 
computing, it was considered as
a secure system up to that

177
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:15.150 
moment and the idea, the
vulnerability was that

178
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:20.320 
it could be a forced to
reuse a Nonce and to

179
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.410 
enable the cracking
of the session key.

180
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.130 
The attacker in that way
exploiting this vulnerability

181
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.570 
could read along
traffic between other

182
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.630 
clients and router in
the same WiFi net

183
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.570 
and so from this attack

184
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.410 
it becomes obvious that
one needs to use https

185
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:54.430 
as a second level for security,
whenever one is using

186
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:59.680 
mobile computing. And meanwhile
there are many updates to

187
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:05.050 
repair this security goal. There
are much more attacks but only

188
00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:10.180 
to give an idea about the huge
variety of what's going on there

189
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.370 
in the cyber
crime scene.

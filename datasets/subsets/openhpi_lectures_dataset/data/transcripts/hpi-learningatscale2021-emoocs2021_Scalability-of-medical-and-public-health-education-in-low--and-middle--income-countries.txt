1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.079 
Good morning.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.299 
Good afternoon and good evening.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.119 
Really a pleasure to host this

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.159 
session where three

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.429 
of us practitioners

6
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.619 
from different corners

7
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.779 
of the world will be

8
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.520 
presenting our work,

9
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.579 
where we try and

10
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.069 
make equitable access

11
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.199 
possible for low and middle-income

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.209 
country participants on

13
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.409 
online learning.

14
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.349 
And we have three different aspects

15
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.479 
from our own work domains

16
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.669 
to present and all of them

17
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.889 
have a common denominator,

18
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.899 
namely the equity and

19
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.149 
access and how the

20
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.339 
public health and medical education

21
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.559 
can be scaled

22
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.509 
in these countries

23
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.429 
of global south.

24
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.430 
My name is Heini Utunen.

25
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.239 
I work at the World Health

26
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.129 
Organisation's Health Emergencies

27
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.139 
Programme, where I lead

28
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.729 
the online learning platform

29
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.730 
OpenWHO.org

30
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.340 
work.

31
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.119 
And I'm joined

32
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.369 
today by two associate

33
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.370 
professors

34
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.169 
from two distinguished

35
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.219 
organisations,

36
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.650

Asia.

48
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.329 
Welcome, Dr Titi.

49
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.939 
And we have Dr. Matthew Strehlow,

50
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.859 
who's an associate professor at

51
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.739 
Stanford Emergency Medicine

52
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.959 
Department and also

56
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.760 
as we speak.

57
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.779 
Colleagues here will first

58
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.859 
present their

59
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.728 
low and middle-income country

60
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.659 
related works.

61
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.519 
And we start with Dr.

62
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.679 
Matthew. The floor is yours.

63
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.809 
Hello, I'm Dr. Matt Strehlow

64
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.729 
from Stanford University.

65
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.589 
And I'm going to speak about whether

66
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.809 
we can use MOOCs to train bedside

67
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.789 
health care workers during a global

68
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.790 
pandemic.

69
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.649 
Early on during the COVID-19

70
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.509 
pandemic, our team was

71
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.639 
approached by our partners

72
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.439 
across the globe, primarily from

73
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.629 
South Asia, asking

74
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.459 
whether we could help educate and

75
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.979 
train bedside health care workers

76
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.959 
on the management of COVID-19

77
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.829 
patients.

78
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.839 
And the primary request

79
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.819 
centred around whether we

80
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.189 
could help train doctors

81
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.949 
to care for patients on ventilators

82
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.989 
that had COVID-19.

83
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.519 
And there was a lot of energy and

84
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.189 
effort focussed on the acquisition

85
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.259 
of ventilators and then managing

86
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.760 
patients on ventilators.

87
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.339 
The challenge with this, though,

88
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.199 
that we detected early on

89
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.089 
was that the vast majority of health

90
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.979 
care provided in low

91
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.109 
and middle-income countries is not

92
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.329 
provided by critical

93
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.669 
care, speciality trained physicians

94
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.409 
or emergency care speciality trained

95
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.339 
physicians.

96
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.289 
But it's provided by nurses

97
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.329 
and non-speciality trained

98
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.189 
or generalist physicians and

99
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.439 
other health care workers.

100
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.449 
Additionally, the vast majority

101
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.519 
of patients with COVID-19 aren't

102
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.379 
ending up on ventilators, and

103
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.599 
the real opportunity to potentially

104
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.879 
save lives was prior

105
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.129 
to the patient getting that sick.

106
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.049 
When once they were that sick,

107
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.879 
it was going to be very difficult

108
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.469 
to make a difference in their

109
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.470 
outcomes.

110
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.099 
So we developed a hypothesis

111
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.539 
that there would be a substantial

112
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.789 
demand by non-fixed speciality

113
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.679 
physician health care workers in

114
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.809 
the detection and early care

115
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.119 
of COVID-19 patients.

116
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.009 
So with this in mind, we aim to

117
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.010 
create a free

118
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.909 
MOOC designed for bedside health

119
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.219 
care workers in low and middle-income

120
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.220 
countries.

121
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.199 
To do this, we reached out to our

122
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.179 
partner at the vice-provost

123
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.009 
of online learning office at

124
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
Stanford called digital MEdIC.

125
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.259 
They, along with us, had significant

126
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.169 
experience developing online courses

127
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.819 
for health care workers in low and

128
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.169 
middle-income countries.

129
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.549 
And we reached out to industry

130
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.709 
partners such as Coursera, edX

131
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.629 
and YouTube, along

132
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.489 
with academic partners from across

133
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.739 
the United States and some

134
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.140 
from sub-Saharan Africa.

135
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.009 
And together, we developed a

136
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.869 
simplified course

137
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.699 
using easy to

138
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.589 
recognise imagery that was kind of

139
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.509 
universal, and

140
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.369 
we had a bedside focus really

141
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.169 
trying to target the health care

142
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.939 
worker that was actually caring for

143
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.919 
the patient in the detection

144
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.809 
and early care of COVID-19.

145
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.649 
We wanted to optimise the course

146
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.479 
for mobile use

147
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.039 
so that we knew that providers

148
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.449 
probably wouldn't have laptop

149
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.699 
computers or access to computers,

150
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.499 
but they would have often times

151
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.529 
access to smartphones or tablets.

152
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.659 
And we developed 16 short

153
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.879 
modules, each module lasting about

154
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.859 
10 minutes with the goal

155
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.809 
that they could intermittently

156
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.519 
look at these modules throughout the

157
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.379 
day when they had downtime

158
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.869 
instead of long modules

159
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.059 
that were going to take them away

160
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.029 
from their general activities.

161
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.559 
And the total length of the course

162
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.149 
came out to be about four hours.

163
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.739 
And that included pretesting

164
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.080 
post-testing and surveys.

165
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.589 
We saw fairly strong uptake, and at

166
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.579 
this point, we've had about one

167
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.350 
hundred thousand enrolees.

168
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.459 
With approximately a quarter

169
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.469 
of our enrolees coming from North

170
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.479 
America, but only six

171
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.429 
percent of our enrolees

172
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.109 
coming from sub-Saharan Africa.

173
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.529 
When we break this down further.

174
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.419 
What we found was that we

175
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.669 
had strong uptake in middle-income

176
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.469 
countries and that's continued to

177
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.999 
rise.

178
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.189 
But we had relatively meagre

179
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.589 
uptake in low-income countries,

180
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.509 
with our early analysis showing

181
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.369 
only one percent of our

182
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.719 
course participants were from

183
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.829 
low-income countries.

184
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.259 
Now, did we target the right

185
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.790 
health care provider group

186
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.669 
when we broke that down, what

187
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.739 
we saw is that their largest cohort

188
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.299 
was actually health care workers,

189
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.679 
bedside health care workers that

190
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.569 
were non-physician and non-nurse

191
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.589 
.

192
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.899 
So pharmacists, techs,

193
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.389 
pre-hospital care providers.

194
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.799 
This was followed closely by

195
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.019 
physicians and nurses

196
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.999 
and then students broken

197
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.769 
into those that were practising

198
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.389 
clinically and those at work.

199
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.949 
And so we did see that the vast

200
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.899 
majority of our course participants

201
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.349 
were bedside health care workers.

202
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.829 
We had a relatively strong

203
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.149 
completion rate.

204
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.039 
You know, typical course

205
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.079 
completion rate is somewhere

206
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.029 
between eight and 15 percent and

207
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.889 
ours was ranging around 30

208
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.769 
percent early on.

209
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.109 
It's risen all the way up to about

210
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.119 
40 percent currently

211
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.159 
likely due to the short duration

212
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.749 
and design, of course.

213
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.689 
Looking at knowledge assessment, our

214
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.669 
goal really was to see whether

215
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.559 
we could create a universal

216
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.169 
course but targeted

217
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.659 
towards LMIC providers.

218
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.069 
And so when we looked at knowledge

219
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.509 
assessment on Post

220
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.169 
-course versus pre-course testing, we saw strong knowledge gains

221
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.299 
despite people coming

222
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.189 
from different backgrounds, whether

223
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.509 
you were in a high-income country or

224
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.099 
lower-middle-income country, the

225
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.299 
knowledge gains were relatively

226
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.679 
equivalent.

227
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.479 
And the same is true when we looked

228
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.279 
at it by profession.

229
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.929 
Typically when I design courses, I

230
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.759 
spend a lot of time focussing on

231
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.039 
whether who is my audience,

232
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.959 
is it nurses, is it pre-hospital care

233
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.089 
providers? Is speciality physicians

234
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.369 
to try and design a universal course

235
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.809 
was quite a challenge.

236
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.399 
But what we did see here was that we

237
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.619 
had strong knowledge gains

238
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.959 
by both physician and non-physician

239
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960 
health care workers.

240
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.239 
On our four-pointLikert

241
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.189 
scale of self-assessment on

242
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.049 
whether providers felt

243
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.699 
that they were improved, their

244
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.529 
knowledge improved, their ability to

245
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.229 
care for COVID-19 patients,

246
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.699 
the answer to this question is the

247
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.259 
one I probably care most about,

248
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.059 
which is I have received adequate

249
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.189 
training on caring

250
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.739 
for patients with COVID-19.

251
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.569 
And we saw that post cause

252
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.399 
most providers agreed with this

253
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.288 
question or strongly

254
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.589 
agreed.

255
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.918 
Now, we anticipated

256
00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.869 
that providers would just reach out,

257
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.939 
find this course and take

258
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.899 
it.

259
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.029 
But what were the motivations

260
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.969 
for taking the course?

261
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.519 
Why did they reach out?

262
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.349 
So we looked and we asked and

263
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.239 
surveyed some of our participants

264
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.859 
afterwards to say, like, what are

265
00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.599 
your motivations for taking it?

266
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.009 
And what we found was that the

267
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.259 
strongest motivators for taking

268
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.909 
this was just your personal

269
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.049 
motivation.

270
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.999 
Right. Which we know is a strong

271
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.349 
driver.

272
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.209 
And it also the fact the

273
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.189 
course was free and who offered

274
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.989 
the course actually impacted it

275
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.149 
quite a bit versus

276
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.039 
things that had less of an impact

277
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.989 
or demanded or

278
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.209 
recommended by the employer

279
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.219 
or to earn C.M.E, which

280
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.349 
we know is not typically

281
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.389 
a motivating factor in LMIC,

282
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.579 
where continuing education

283
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.679 
and continuing medical education

284
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.539 
are not required for nurses and

285
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.590 
most physicians.

286
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.769 
So what about this challenge of

287
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.509 
low-income country health care

288
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.679 
workers?

289
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.089 
We came up with three theories on

290
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.559 
why we weren't reaching, and one is

291
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.759 
they didn't know about the course

292
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.199 
because we weren't contacting them

293
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.819 
through their news sources and

294
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.829 
social media feeds that they

295
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.779 
prescribe to.

296
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.129 
The second was they didn't have the

297
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.559 
technology, bandwidth or smartphones

298
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.629 
in order to access the course.

299
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.699 
And third was that we

300
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.169 
offered the course primarily in

301
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.999 
English, and we weren't reaching

302
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.009 
them in a language that

303
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.419 
would allow them to learn from the

304
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.420 
materials.

305
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.709 
So to combat these things and to

306
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.899 
try to address them, we developed

307
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.639 
directed partnerships across a

308
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.469 
number of locations, including South

309
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.169 
America, Uganda and Pakistan.

310
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.599 
And in South America, we focus on

311
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.819 
leveraging health care workers

312
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.679 
and physician network that we had

313
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.659 
there across emergency medicine

314
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.669 
to translate the course materials

315
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.589 
and localise the content a little

316
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.590 
bit more.

317
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.989 
In Pakistan, we focussed on

318
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.429 
telehealth workers, the government

319
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.439 
of Pakistan had contracted with

320
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.269 
female physicians that worked from

321
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.179 
home to provide telehealth services

322
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.369 
to COVID-19 patients.

323
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.949 
And so we built a telehealth module,

324
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.899 
had them take the course and

325
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.900 
then conducted

326
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.219 
webinars to answer questions

327
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.079 
for about four hundred

328
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.910 
Pakistani female physicians.

329
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.679 
And in Uganda, the government

330
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.329 
decided that their health care

331
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.039 
workers and hospitals needed further

332
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.869 
training, and so we worked

333
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.329 
with them to provide this course

334
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.009 
and then as part of a blended

335
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.179 
learning approach where they got

336
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.279 
bedside training as well

337
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.230 
from speciality physicians.

338
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.239 
And our most recent partnership has

339
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.859 
been with AfreHealth to try to

340
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.289 
specifically target sub-Saharan

341
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.290 
and Africa.

342
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.429 
And here with this group,

343
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.979 
AfreHealth is a Pan African

344
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.259 
organisation that has now co-branded

345
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.269 
the course and is working to help

346
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.039 
us translate it into French and

347
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040 
Portuguese.

348
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.369 
So our challenges and our next

349
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.370 
steps.

350
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.959 
One of the big challenges of this is

351
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.789 
constantly changing so

352
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.169 
MOOCs during a pandemic can't be

353
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.789 
static. They've got to constantly be

354
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.439 
iterating the content and we've been

355
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.239 
working to do that, language

356
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.039 
barriers are of significant

357
00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.539 
challenge, and we've started using

358
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.699 
AI-assisted translation to improve

359
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.599 
that.

360
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.919 
Course completion rates, although

361
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.959 
strong, are nowhere near the 70

362
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.919 
to 80 percent I'd like to see.

363
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.469 
And we've got to figure out how we

364
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.939 
can continue to improve that in the

365
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.949 
course of this short and

366
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.359 
then our lower usage, as I've

367
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.039 
previously mentioned, in low-income

368
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.849 
countries.

369
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.679 
So we continue to analyse that,

370
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.659 
to form these direct partnerships

371
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.039 
and to see whether we can improve

372
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040 
those.

373
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.769 
So in conclusion, I want to

374
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.599 
thank all of the partners and all

375
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.429 
of the providers that helped

376
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.079 
build the course, and I want to

377
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080 
thank the

378
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.429 
conference organisers for allowing

379
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.430 
me to speak today.

380
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.149 
Thank you, Dr. Matthew, we have

381
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.399 
a lot of interesting findings

382
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.960 
from your session

383
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.709 
and will now go straight

384
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.809 
to hear the presentation

385
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.879 
from Dr. Titi and the work

386
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.219 
that she's been conducting

387
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.220 
on their competency-based

388
00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.659 
medical and public health education

389
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.660 
in the SEARAME. Dr Titi, the floor is yours

390
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.540 
.

391
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.169 
Good morning, afternoon and evening.

392
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.609 
We know that at the moment

393
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.209 
pandemic COVID-19 is still going on

394
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.069 
and we don't know yet when it will

395
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.079 
end. However, we need

396
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.879 
to continue our health professional

397
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.019 
educations.

398
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.789 
In these sessions, I would like to

399
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.769 
discuss to what extents

400
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.689 
distance and distributed learning

401
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.369 
could increase access and equity

402
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.859 
during and after COVID-19 pandemic

403
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.579 
in SEARAME contexts.

404
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.279 
There are three topics that I would

405
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.169 
like to present.

406
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.170 
The first is principles in Competency-based

407
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.259 
education.

408
00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.759 
The second is Health Professional

409
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.679 
Education Responses to pandemic

410
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.049 
COVID-19 in SEARAME context

411
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.029 
and then is a distance and

412
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.579 
distributed learning solution?

413
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.533 
First, Principles in

414
00:13:48.534 --> 00:13:49.669 
Competency-based Educations.

415
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.619 
We know that at the moment

416
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.019 
in many countries, competency-based

417
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.819 
medical educations have been

418
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.709 
implemented and it is

419
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.869 
considered the most appropriate

420
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.939 
educational approach

421
00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.729 
to educate health professionals.

422
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.769 
And also we know that

423
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.807 
by applying competency-based

424
00:14:08.808 --> 00:14:10.669 
education, we have to

425
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.719 
have a curriculum design

426
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.689 
backwards and we have

427
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.849 
to create

428
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.129 
many learning opportunities.

429
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.259 
And also we need to make sure that

430
00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.479 
there is a constructive alignment

431
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.459 
between the learning outcomes

432
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.619 
or the competencies, the assessment

433
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.779 
and the learning activities.

434
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.759 
Secondly, how

435
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.199 
the health professional education

436
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.059 
responds to pandemic

437
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.819 
COVID-19 in SEARAME context.

438
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.739 
In this presentation, I

439
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.499 
use SEARAME as the context

440
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.329 
because in SEARAME we

441
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.309 
have low-income countries as

442
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.259 
well as we have middle-income

443
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.339 
countries.

444
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.936 
These are the members of SEARAME.

445
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.589 
And we did an online survey

446
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.419 
using Google forms, and

447
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.399 
we had 132

448
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.009 
medical doctors responding.

449
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.259 
We asked them

450
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.849 
a number of questions.

451
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.829 
They are from India,

452
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.839 
Thailand, Indonesia, Nepal and

453
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.699 
from other countries in

454
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.700 
SEARAME.

455
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.779 
We asked about what

456
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.129 
instructional strategies that they

457
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.169 
use for facilitating the achievement

458
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.939 
of competencies.

459
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.979 
Using qualitative methods, we come

460
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.899 
up with 20

461
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.059 
strategies from synchronous

462
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.039 
online lectures down to

463
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.049 
life broadcasts of real patient

464
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.309 
encounter.

465
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.769 
So they are a lot of varieties

466
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.989 
of how medical teachers

467
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.629 
have struggled to

468
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.459 
continue the teaching-learning

469
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.289 
process by

470
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.269 
using whatever means

471
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.249 
available to them.

472
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.069 
And here from this survey,

473
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.070 
it is

474
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.389 
found that most

475
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.279 
teachers use synchronous

476
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.709 
online lectures for

477
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.769 
the competencies at the

478
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.939 
Knows How level and also

479
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.189 
for the Shows and the Does level,

480
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.079 
they use synchronous online

481
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080 
lectures.

482
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.909 
So synchronous online

483
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.159 
lectures have become

484
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.199 
the most method that

485
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.389 
are used by many medical

486
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.439 
teachers, followed by

487
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.709 
online problem-based learning,

488
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.779 
simulation lab and then case study

489
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.229 
review and video play.

490
00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.509 
What are the challenges?

491
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.609 
These are some of the

492
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.169 
answers.

493
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.569 
We know that in low-income

494
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.659 
countries, they

495
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.699 
have insufficient

496
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.559 
resources in terms

497
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.539 
of IT infrastructure and digital

498
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.540 
technology.

499
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.239 
Lack of skilled and well-trained

500
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.549 
educators in this country,

501
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.099 
many teachers are not used

502
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.469 
to distance learning applied

503
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.089 
in medical and health profession

504
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.090 
education.

505
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.969 
As the results, because

506
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.339 
a lot of medical teachers

507
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.539 
or health professional education,

508
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.848 
teachers do not know how to

509
00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:06.869 
do the

510
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.380 
clinical educations

511
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.809 
by distance learning, so

512
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.699 
many sessions in clinical

513
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.019 
educations have been suspended.

514
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.059 
Skilled examinations and licencing

515
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.189 
examinations are also cancelled

516
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.809 
or suspended.

517
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.549 
And then because there is sudden

518
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.829 
disruption, many

519
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.019 
move to online teaching.

520
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.999 
But just to

521
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.979 
shift from Face-To-Face

522
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.929 
to online teaching without

523
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.989 
designing new curriculum.

524
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.999 
And in many places, especially

525
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.069 
in remote areas, the

526
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.019 
lack of access to Internet and

527
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.599 
electricity and also

528
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.669 
lack of opportunities for practising

529
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.319 
communication skills with patients

530
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.320 
and colleagues.

531
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.580 
So a lot of questions.

532
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.979 
Do we produce the same competent

533
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.929 
health professionals, before and

534
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.930 
after

535
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.090 
pandemic.

536
00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.969 
Or we produce

537
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:07.970 
different

538
00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.199 
health professionals because

539
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.479 
they are less competent than

540
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.670 
the before pandemic COVID-19.

541
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.149 
So is distance and distributed

542
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.680 
learning a solution?

543
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.550 
There is

544
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.979 
publications by Horton W in 2012.

545
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.629 
He said that at its best,

546
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.459 
eLearning is as good as the

547
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.319 
best classroom learning, and

548
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.269 
at its worst, it's about as

549
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.789 
bad as the worst classroom learning.

550
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.160 
The difference is design.

551
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.499 
So we must

552
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.070 
trust and we must believe that,

553
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.369 
by applying distance

554
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.259 
and distributed learning,

555
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.260 
we need to come up,

556
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.729 
we need to produce the same

557
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.439 
level of competencies of health

558
00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.440 
professions.

559
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.249 
There are a lot of interchangeably

560
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.519 
terminologies have been used

561
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.721 
like distance learning, distributed

562
00:19:06.722 --> 00:19:08.819 
learning, online learning,

563
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.469 
e-learning, virtual learning and

564
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.029 
flexible learning.

565
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.079 
But in this session

566
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.749 
, we are focussing on the

567
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.799 
distributed learning.

568
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.844 
So what is distributed learning?

569
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.599 
Jim Levin explains that this

570
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.609 
"perspective on learning that

571
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.039 
examines the distributions of

572
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.559 
learning in space and time and the

573
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.429 
mediation that crosses the

574
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.430 
distributions"

575
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.299 
another definition from Victor

576
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.399 
and Hart, 2016,

577
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.999 
"distributed learning is an umbrella

578
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.129 
term, including one or more

579
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.989 
blended learning, learning

580
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.628 
that combines instructor-led

581
00:19:46.629 --> 00:19:48.559 
training with web-based training

582
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.029 
and other learning activities

583
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.030 
outside the classroom".

584
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.709 
And then "mobile learning, learning

585
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.689 
that occurs on a portable device

586
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.819 
that is a tablet or smartphone"

587
00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.439 
or "informal learning, learning that

588
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.419 
occurs outside the formal learning

589
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.919 
environment.

590
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.149 
This type of learning is facilitated

591
00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.380 
by social interactions". The

592
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.669 
Obsidian Distributed Learning model

593
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.960 
as described by Victor,

594
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.299 
especially focussed on the three

595
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.189 
aspects that are needed in

596
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.119 
the distributed learning, that

597
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.999 
this technology, experience

598
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.529 
and people.

599
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.349 
However, in

600
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.359 
low income and middle-income

601
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.329 
countries, we

602
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.933 
cannot overnight

603
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.139 
catch up with the advancements of

604
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.519 
technology.

605
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.949 
Therefore, we need

606
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.109 
to put the principles

607
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.239 
of obsidian distributed

608
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.689 
learning.

609
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.329 
The first is blended

610
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.099 
using various combinations

611
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.390 
of instructor-led

612
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.999 
training, web-based training

613
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.500 
and mobile learning.

614
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.629 
In case we don't have web-based

615
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.609 
and mobile learning, we can use

616
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.819 
instructor-led training

617
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.529 
and then to maximise the

618
00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.989 
collaborative learning, including

619
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.179 
partner and group experiences,

620
00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.489 
and it can be spread over time,

621
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.379 
we use just in time (JIT) learning

622
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.239 
that occurs at the point of need

623
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.609 
along with performance support

624
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.499 
and then focus on competency

625
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.659 
development rather than on knowledge

626
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.660 
growth.

627
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.869 
And also in

628
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.369 
Victor and Hart, 2016, it is

629
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.079 
explained there are three guiding

630
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.449 
principles of the

631
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.559 
Obsidian Distributed Learning.

632
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.570 
The first is fully learner-centred.

633
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.459 
The second is learning should be

634
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.019 
blended and the third is learning

635
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.329 
should be a social experience.

636
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.050 
So in the

637
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.709 
low-income and middle-income

638
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.779 
countries, we need to

639
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.119 
explore further how we can

640
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.920 
apply distributed learning.

641
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.879 
There are many learning resources

642
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.139 
out there.

643
00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.979 
There are many real patients,

644
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.949 
real situations.

645
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.559 
In societies and communities,

646
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.560 
in villages,

647
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.219 
there are many hospital, many health

648
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.199 
centres that

649
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.929 
can be used by

650
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.369 
medical and health profession

651
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.189 
students that are distributed

652
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.199 
in various

653
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.589 
geographical areas.

654
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.639 
So these are the

655
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.109 
references.

656
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.110 
So we think,

657
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.929 
to answer how

658
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.369 
to continue the

659
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:33.650 
health professional educations

660
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.019 
during and after

661
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.020 
COVID-19 pandemic,

662
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.949 
I think distributed learning

663
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.419 
is the answer.

664
00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.869 
Thank you.

665
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.519 
And thank you for this very

666
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.379 
interesting presentation

667
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.419 
and after the

668
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.579 
sessions now, we will have a

669
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.709 
chance for a short

670
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.030 
Q and A, questions and

671
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.959 
answers session in which

672
00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.960 
colleagues

673
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.799 
and myself are able to

674
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.900 
answer your questions.

675
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:07.199 
I am Heini Utunen from the World

676
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.029 
Health Organisation's Health

677
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.009 
Emergencies Programme and

678
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.319 
I lead the OpenWHO

679
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.449 
platform, which is

680
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.459 
online learning platform for

681
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.619 
health emergencies and servicing

682
00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.030 
the world with

683
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.939 
WHO's technical guidance and

684
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.789 
evidence-based learning.

685
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.679 
OpenWHO just this

686
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680 
month,

687
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.939 
celebrated the four

688
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.799 
years anniversary.

689
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.569 
We've been in operation for four

690
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.429 
years, delivering

691
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.289 
learning mainly for

692
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.559 
low and middle-income countries.

693
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.449 
And I have some

694
00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.339 
findings from the platform

695
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.199 
now during the COVID-19

696
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.899 
and also some interesting

697
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.789 
changes in the use of

698
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.469 
online learning of our health

699
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.479 
emergency learning platform

700
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.829 
over the pandemic.

701
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.959 
So it is a pleasure

702
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.089 
to present and this presentation

703
00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.189 
is put together by many

704
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.349 
talented colleagues

705
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.719 
with Ms Ngouille Ndiaye

706
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.789 
who has provided

707
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.129 
the most support for this

708
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.709 
data and evidence

709
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.049 
leading to this presentation.

710
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.939 
So overall,

711
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.749 
here are some figures from the

712
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.839 
OpenWHO platform.

713
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.029 
We are currently

714
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.149 
hosting 5.3 million

715
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.380 
course enrolments.

716
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.009 
These course enrolments are

717
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.229 
across almost 100

718
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.119 
different course topics.

719
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.059 
We have 34 courses for COVID-19

720
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.279 
and currently 61 other

721
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.499 
health topics

722
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.599 
as courses on the platform.

723
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.369 
We have very high completion rates,

724
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.020 
almost 60 percent

725
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.919 
completion rates on an average

726
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.019 
on the platform, meaning we've

727
00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.539 
issued more than 2.8

728
00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.179 
million certificates so far.

729
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.979 
And this has really been a big

730
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.839 
change during the pandemic.

731
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.669 
Our completion rate before

732
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.379 
the pandemic was less than 30

733
00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.659 
percent and now it's nearing

734
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.189 
60 percent.

735
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.169 
So the learners are really

736
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.439 
staying and completing the courses.

737
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.569 
Our learning materials are in

738
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.399 
54 different languages

739
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.379 
and counting, and out of those

740
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.019 
languages, 15

741
00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.239 
are languages of the most vulnerable

742
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.639 
populations in the world, mainly

743
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.949 
from Africa and Asia.

744
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.139 
And this is one of the key values

745
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.059 
for us on OpenWHO,

746
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.009 
we try and make the effort

747
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.989 
to provide materials in

748
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.879 
languages of the most

749
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.979 
vulnerable populations.

750
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.409 
We host materials for

751
00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.929 
42 languages

752
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.299 
of the least developed

753
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.889 
46 countries.

754
00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.809 
So we are in particular trying

755
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.419 
to reach the most vulnerable,

756
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.029 
least developed countries.

757
00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.339 
We have so far translated

758
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.529 
almost 10 million words.

759
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.569 
It's a huge figure.

760
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.909 
And thanks to the pandemic surge,

761
00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.919 
we've had volunteers from all around

762
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.019 
the world to help translate into

763
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.849 
these dozens

764
00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.230 
and dozens of languages.

765
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.559 
We are hosting almost

766
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.449 
1800 videos and it's more

767
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.149 
than 30 thousand hours of videos

768
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.980 
watched on the platform.

769
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.919 
Here as the background on OpenWHO,

770
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.199 
so, our key assets

771
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.509 
are really on the scalability.

772
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.609 
So already four years ago

773
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.409 
when we started designing and

774
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.449 
planning together with HPI,

775
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.669 
this platform, that the number one

776
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.429 
priority for us was the scalability

777
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.319 
to go into

778
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.139 
massive user numbers

779
00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.119 
in an event of the pandemic.

780
00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.039 
And now we've been on

781
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.169 
this pandemic real-time test

782
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.639 
for one and a half years.

783
00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.319 
And we can say that we've

784
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.659 
successfully met that learning

785
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.609 
demand and need of the

786
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.669 
world in a massive

787
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.249 
global pandemic.

788
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.079 
And here are some figures we've

789
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.999 
done from one

790
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.009 
and a half years ago, we had

791
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.259 
less than 200 thousand

792
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.969 
enrolments on the platform.

793
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.069 
Today it's more than

794
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.199 
5.3 million enrolments.

795
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.539 
So we've grown exponentially

796
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.539 
over the past one and a half years.

797
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.399 
We have currently

798
00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.649 
70 technical and expert

799
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.599 
teams producing courses

800
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600 
all in a dispersed manner,

801
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.979 
everybody working mainly from home,

802
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.689 
from all over the world.

803
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.429 
And we have systems in place where

804
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.319 
we can produce all the technical

805
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.219 
content.

806
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.629 
And when I say technical, it's the

807
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.605 
expert content of WHO

808
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.549 
real-time from anywhere in

809
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.359 
the world.

810
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.189 
We are also hosting resources and

811
00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:00.229 
materials for all other infectious

812
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.749 
diseases, not only COVID-19.

813
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.639 
So we cover about 20

814
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.219 
other diseases on the

815
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.140 
platform, infectious diseases.

816
00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.399 
And serving the vulnerable is

817
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.669 
one of the very foundational

818
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.619 
values for not only

819
00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.079 
for OpenWHO but for WHO

820
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.219 
as a whole.

821
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.199 
So for us, it has meant that we

822
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.019 
make available all materials,

823
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.719 
free, accessible,

824
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.549 
open-source and in

825
00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.439 
low bandwidth adjusted

826
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.519 
formats.

827
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.559 
All the materials work from

828
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.959 
any gadget, device, mobile,

829
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.310 
desktop, tablet,

830
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.699 
any format

831
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.409 
the user wants to use.

832
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.329 
And we have offline formats

833
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.159 
and downloadable formats.

834
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.619 
And this is one of our key priority,

835
00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.539 
to have materials at ease

836
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.519 
for users so that they can be

837
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.569 
used anywhere

838
00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:58.539 
and in a way

839
00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.949 
learn and wants to use them.

840
00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.989 
And we believe this is behind the

841
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.749 
that quite high numbers,

842
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.459 
the successful enrolments on the

843
00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.289 
platform, that the usability of the

844
00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.309 
materials is very high

845
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:12.699 
in different type of Internet

846
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.529 
environments and for

847
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.920 
different types of learners.

848
00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.659 
We've really expedited this language

849
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.309 
work, as I mentioned, and in

850
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.959 
particular for the vulnerable, the

851
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.119 
populations, the language used by

852
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.009 
vulnerable populations,

853
00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.869 
and that multilingualism

854
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.089 
for us is

855
00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:33.849 
natural domain.

856
00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.069 
The United Nations has six official

857
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.029 
languages.

858
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.069 
And this is usually the starting

859
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.679 
point for our course

860
00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.909 
and content production.

861
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.009 
We aim to publish initially

862
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.809 
in all six UN languages and

863
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.239 
Portuguese and then continue

864
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.129 
into the national and local

865
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.059 
languages.

866
00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.199 
And this is what we've done,

867
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.479 
together with WHO country

868
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.399 
and regional offices.

869
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.829 
WHO is present in 130 countries.

870
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.779 
And this has been a big

871
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.089 
crowdsourcing effort, along

872
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.979 
with dozens and dozens

873
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.989 
of volunteers who've come up

874
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.059 
and started translating into Indian

875
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.279 
sign language, in 14

876
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.349 
different African languages and many

877
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.219 
more.

878
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.049 
And we have also institutes

879
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:18.879 
that work with us,

880
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.429 
such as Translators Without Borders,

881
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.469 
who translate also that

882
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:24.910 
languages that have

883
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.659 
less of a commercial

884
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.249 
capability and interest.

885
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.229 
So we are aligning well, our

886
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.329 
work with the Translators

887
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.369 
Without Borders, our long time,

888
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.049 
long term partner.

889
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.939 
And we work with other platforms

890
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.379 
such as Pan-American Health

891
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.689 
Organisations Virtual Campus,

892
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.759 
which is hosted in

893
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.629 
Panama.

894
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.459 
And we are collaborating

895
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.929 
with the Spanish and Portuguese

896
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.759 
courses where all

897
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.339 
our courses are translated

898
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.319 
into these two languages and also

899
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.329 
hosted bringing us

900
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.239 
almost half a million additional

901
00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.559 
learners.

902
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.659 
And interestingly,

903
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.660 
the multichannel multi-platform

904
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.979 
publishing during the pandemic has

905
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.979 
been very popular.

906
00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.859 
For instance, Brazilian health

907
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.858 
institutes are

908
00:31:13.859 --> 00:31:15.729 
hosting our learning resources and

909
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.829 
have 130 thousand

910
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.929 
additional Portuguese

911
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.969 
users in Brazil on

912
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.169 
their own platform, hosting

913
00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.349 
OpenWHO courses at their domain

914
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.329 
at the easeful

915
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.219 
health workers in Brazil.

916
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.989 
So this is all to say that these are

917
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.939 
the ways and efforts we

918
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.129 
are making to ensure

919
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.139 
access and equitability

920
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.209 
in learning through the online

921
00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.199 
means. And it's been working well,

922
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.019 
but I'll be happy to also

923
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.389 
show more results tangibly

924
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.309 
what it means, having this

925
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.169 
type of performance and

926
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.170 
resources.

927
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.979 
Here a recent

928
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.329 
world map on

929
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.479 
OpenWHO's country enrolment's.

930
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.519 
So where

931
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.739 
the courses are used at most

932
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.449 
and you sort of can see that they

933
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.679 
are somewhere in the

934
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.729 
really starting in the

935
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.709 
southern hemisphere, we have

936
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.899 
quite a strong use case.

937
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.459 
And it is true that during the

938
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.439 
pandemic we've

939
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.569 
actually increased

940
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.429 
the platform use in the low

941
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.369 
and middle-income countries.

942
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:26.259 
Before the pandemic, those countries

943
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.149 
accounted for 50 percent of

944
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.589 
the enrolments.

945
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.539 
And now currently more than

946
00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.539 
70 percent of our enrolments

947
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.609 
derive from the low and middle-income

948
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.349 
countries, which is really we are

949
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.959 
happy to see this development.

950
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.689 
But we have use case in all

951
00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.909 
countries and territories

952
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:46.910 
as WHO

953
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.010 
states

954
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.149 
from all around the world.

955
00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.469 
So we are really happy to reach

956
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:54.940 
every corner of the world.

957
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.750 
Here are some

958
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.339 
data from March this year (2021)

959
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.889 
really showing that the middle-income

960
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.450 
countries are using

961
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.749 
the platform the most, 70

962
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.609 
percent of the use

963
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.610 
is in

964
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.659 
middle-income countries, with India

965
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:15.660 
leading.

966
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.169 
Only 3.4 percent of

967
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.819 
the users are in the low-income

968
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.489 
countries. And this is very much

969
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.429 
in line what Dr Matthew was

970
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.019 
mentioning here before, that we are

971
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.909 
also struggling to see how we

972
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.429 
can reach those

973
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.799 
frontline workers and personnel

974
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.809 
who need the evidence-based

975
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.859 
learning materials in low-income

976
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.860 
countries.

977
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.389 
We've, however, noted that

978
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.429 
over the pandemic, the use case

979
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.889 
in the global south of OpenWHO

980
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.509 
has equalised.

981
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.999 
In fact, that's before the pandemic

982
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.009 
and that

983
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.200 
was really Africa focused.

984
00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.349 
Africa use case used to be more

985
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.569 
than 25 percent of the platform

986
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.399 
enrolments, currently

987
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.409 
less than eight percent.

988
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.388 
We have more use from

989
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.609 
South America and Asia

990
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:13.369 
than ever before on the platform.

991
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.499 
And this naturally is explained

992
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.388 
by the fact that earlier

993
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.698 
the infectious disease materials

994
00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.729 
such as Yellow Fever, meningitis,

995
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.559 
Ebola, Rift Valley

996
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.959 
fever and many others

997
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.968 
were mainly utilised by our

998
00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:30.769 
African learners.

999
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.988 
And now with the COVID-19 pandemic,

1000
00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.049 
there are many more strong

1001
00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.069 
use case countries

1002
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.899 
from also

1003
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.900 
other regions,

1004
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.229 
not only Africa.

1005
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.658 
So in the top 10

1006
00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:46.968 
low and middle-income countries,

1007
00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:49.459 
India is always leading.

1008
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.259 
It's also a big population, but also

1009
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.238 
very keen on online learning

1010
00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:54.239 
use.

1011
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.839 
But equally, many of the South

1012
00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.449 
American countries have emerged

1013
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:00.450 
on OpenWHO's user

1014
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.789 
lists.

1015
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.349 
And that is also due to the fact

1016
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.509 
that we've started really

1017
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.559 
investing on the Spanish

1018
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.439 
course materials.

1019
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.169 
We didn't host Spanish materials

1020
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.269 
at the scale we are doing currently

1021
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.199 
during the pandemic.

1022
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.119 
And now we've really noted

1023
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.099 
that the Spanish language

1024
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.929 
users preference is

1025
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.579 
always to use Spanish, and we have

1026
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.229 
therefore very happy that these

1027
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.689 
resources have found their use

1028
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.150 
in the South America.

1029
00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.169 
Here's the list of top COVID-19

1030
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.419 
courses and their popularity

1031
00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.619 
in the low and middle-income

1032
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.419 
countries. And the "Introduction to

1033
00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.639 
COVID-19" is by far the most popular

1034
00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.529 
course in low and middle-income

1035
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.969 
countries, followed by "Infection

1036
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.709 
prevention and control" and the "UN

1037
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.019 
country team preparedness and response"

1038
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.219 
course. So these are quite naturally

1039
00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.502 
the topical course

1040
00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.939 
titles popular in the low and

1041
00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.139 
middle-income countries.

1042
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.419 
Here just to show the comparison

1043
00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.609 
before the pandemic,

1044
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.499 
as I said before

1045
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.689 
that time, that low-income

1046
00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.939 
countries were much higher

1047
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.989 
on the course use than

1048
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:16.269 
what they are now, and in

1049
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:17.590 
particular, Africa,

1050
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.799 
the middle-income country use has

1051
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.629 
increased the most, coming

1052
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.459 
from saving 40 percent to 70

1053
00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.499 
percent, whereas the

1054
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.259 
high-income countries has decreased

1055
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.519 
during the pandemic.

1056
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.409 
And of course, here before

1057
00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.239 
the pandemic, the

1058
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.669 
use of courses is is

1059
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.709 
very different popular

1060
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:39.759 
courses that we didn't have.

1061
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.859 
We only had one coronavirus

1062
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.479 
cause on the Middle Eastern

1063
00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.459 
Respiratory Syndrome

1064
00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.460 
and all the other

1065
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.659 
courses are actually related

1066
00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.489 
to the antimicrobial stewardship

1067
00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.309 
or Ebola or risk communications

1068
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.839 
and pandemic and epidemic from

1069
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.999 
diseases that were

1070
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.280 
leading before the COVID-19.

1071
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.899 
It needs to be said that the

1072
00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.789 
antimicrobial stewardship

1073
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.769 
course, was the more popular

1074
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.169 
course in the middle and high-income

1075
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.239 
countries and not in the top 10

1076
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.799 
in the low-income countries.

1077
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.959 
So we also see change,

1078
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.820 
different use patterns of the

1079
00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:21.759 
courses in these different three

1080
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.780 
categories of

1081
00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.779 
countries income level,

1082
00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.279 
which is important for us to

1083
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.259 
understand where to target and

1084
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.149 
how to place the courses and

1085
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.679 
in which languages.

1086
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.569 
And simultaneously we are doing work

1087
00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.729 
where we are scoping more,

1088
00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.949 
what type of epidemic and infectious

1089
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.809 
diseases we have and

1090
00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.639 
in which countries

1091
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.349 
and what type of languages are

1092
00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:46.569 
needed also for other diseases,

1093
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.069 
then COVID-19.

1094
00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.989 
So for plague, for

1095
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.939 
meningitis, for many

1096
00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.099 
of these other infectious diseases

1097
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.100 
courses.

1098
00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.209 
We were just lately taking some

1099
00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.129 
stock on the

1100
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.889 
course experience, course users

1101
00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.959 
experience on our two

1102
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.999 
vaccination courses that went

1103
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000 
live in

1104
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.299 
2020.

1105
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.249 
And we in particular wanted to look

1106
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.299 
at the barriers.

1107
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.129 
So we,of course, looked at

1108
00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:17.079 
the motivation and interest

1109
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.789 
and affiliation, the usual

1110
00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.469 
interesting

1111
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.529 
course statistics.

1112
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.509 
But then we also surveyed

1113
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.609 
on what are the barriers

1114
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.739 
to join the vaccine courses

1115
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.740 
on OpenWHO.

1116
00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.669 
And quite interestingly,

1117
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.679 
out of them, almost three

1118
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.629 
thousand respondents to

1119
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.519 
these surveys,

1120
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.919 
56 percent said they had no

1121
00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.389 
barriers whatsoever.

1122
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.159 
It went smooth.

1123
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.289 
30 percent of the respondents

1124
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.389 
mentioned Internet connection issues

1125
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.669 
being a barrier.

1126
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.829 
They were system OpenWHO

1127
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.109 
IT-related issues,

1128
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:58.179 
for 10 percent some

1129
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.489 
difficulty navigating,

1130
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.379 
not enough time to complete the

1131
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.089 
courses was also perceived as a

1132
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.159 
barrier and the language

1133
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.649 
by eight percent of the respondents.

1134
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.569 
And then there were a set

1135
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:12.639 
of other questions, other

1136
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.219 
topics of causing a barrier.

1137
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.749 
And they were looking more in

1138
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.659 
detail, we can

1139
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.519 
this one can, of course, guess

1140
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.679 
but this is coming straight

1141
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.680 
from the course survey.

1142
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.679 
When you look at the Internet

1143
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.569 
connectivity issues, you see

1144
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.279 
with the map here highlighted

1145
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.729 
in yellow that it's really in

1146
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:36.369 
countries like Cameroon,

1147
00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.709 
Ethiopia, South Sudan,

1148
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.659 
Ghana, Zimbabwe,

1149
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.819 
Uganda, Yemen,

1150
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.422 
Afghanistan, where the responders

1151
00:39:44.423 --> 00:39:46.929 
that had indicated

1152
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.039 
issues with the Internet

1153
00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:48.999 
connectivity.

1154
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000 
And it goes

1155
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.229 
to say that the low bandwidth

1156
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.269 
format packaging of materials

1157
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.339 
is very important

1158
00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.769 
when trying and reaching

1159
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.719 
the users in countries

1160
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.059 
with likely

1161
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.208 
compromised internet

1162
00:40:06.209 --> 00:40:07.449 
connectivities.

1163
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.339 
We also looked at that, the

1164
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.269 
languages.

1165
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.270 
So

1166
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.059 
there were responders

1167
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.889 
who felt that there were

1168
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:19.779 
language constituted a barrier,

1169
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.089 
at that time, the course was only

1170
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.039 
available in English.

1171
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.040 
And

1172
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:27.899 
it informs us that

1173
00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.159 
in several countries

1174
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.019 
of global south,

1175
00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.729 
there is a desire to have the

1176
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.230 
materials in

1177
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.169 
languages, local languages and

1178
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.909 
languages spoken in the country.

1179
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.209 
More national languages are

1180
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.549 
needed. And this we can also see

1181
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:48.249 
when we look our whole of platform

1182
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.239 
results.

1183
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.339 
The top languages here

1184
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.129 
for us is the Indian sign language

1185
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.139 
and Hindi are very

1186
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.999 
popular, of course, because we have

1187
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.219 
such a big numbers of users

1188
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.289 
from India, 25

1189
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.299 
percent of our users are from India,

1190
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.889 
but for instance, the Indian sign

1191
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.839 
language course is consumed all

1192
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.969 
over the world. It's our own

1193
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.189 
only sign language resource

1194
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.139 
and it's very popular all over

1195
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.089 
the world in all continents.

1196
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.489 
So it hosts 55000

1197
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.409 
learners and it's been utilised

1198
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:21.519 
all over the world.

1199
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.229 
So it's a service not only for the

1200
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.779 
Indian sign language community,

1201
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.119 
but also beyond.

1202
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.099 
And this is a global feature

1203
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.959 
and phenomena that

1204
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.239 
we are thankfully seeing

1205
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.249 
that the learning travels across

1206
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.169 
the world

1207
00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:39.789 
when it's produced.

1208
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:41.649 
It can host not only the

1209
00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.509 
host learners, not only that one

1210
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.569 
given country, but also beyond.

1211
00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.189 
Just generally speaking, here are

1212
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.529 
some country and of course,

1213
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.629 
top lists and

1214
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.329 
more details and interesting

1215
00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:57.249 
survey findings and

1216
00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.109 
research findings can be found on

1217
00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.059 
OpenWHO where we collect

1218
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.829 
all the publications we publish.

1219
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.999 
We're just now working to

1220
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.919 
detail how our different

1221
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.929 
user groups are

1222
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.239 
approaching and completing that

1223
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.369 
the learning journeys.

1224
00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:17.099 
This is a global figure, but

1225
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.709 
students, people,

1226
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.599 
learners identifying themselves

1227
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.369 
as students.

1228
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.559 
Our biggest category, almost 38

1229
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.560 
percent of the

1230
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.429 
OpenWHO learners, followed

1231
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.769 
by health care professionals,

1232
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.689 
23 percent and then

1233
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.429 
other non identified

1234
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:38.290 
background

1235
00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.859 
is very large as well.

1236
00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.420 
And then evenly split

1237
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.999 
in NGOs, international

1238
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.979 
organisations, ministries and

1239
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.989 
health expertise in different areas.

1240
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:50.849 
We are looking into detailing these

1241
00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.189 
for low and middle-income countries

1242
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.689 
and see the motivation of

1243
00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.699 
participation to courses

1244
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.279 
from in particular from

1245
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.709 
low and middle-income countries.

1246
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.049 
And to finish off, this

1247
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:05.279 
is just to show that we are

1248
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.739 
investing on serving the countries

1249
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.689 
and producing materials in

1250
00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:10.690 
the

1251
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.709 
performance that the countries

1252
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.779 
and our country

1253
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.939 
offices have been leading this work

1254
00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.279 
in establishing translated

1255
00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.529 
versions of the key

1256
00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.359 
resources we have on the platform

1257
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.369 
and publishing them in their own

1258
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.739 
channels. So we've just launched

1259
00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.030 
six channels

1260
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.779 
and many more are coming

1261
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.969 
and we hope and

1262
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:37.889 
see that in the future, just

1263
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:39.749 
like in the example of Ukraine,

1264
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.849 
that the country is now producing

1265
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:44.279 
their own country derived

1266
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.109 
learning resources on the

1267
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:46.919 
platform.

1268
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.689 
And this is the direction where we

1269
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.819 
want to go more

1270
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.309 
focussed, localised

1271
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.199 
resources for the responders

1272
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:59.009 
that can be hosted on this platform.

1273
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.929 
With these findings, I thank

1274
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:01.930 
you for your time and

1275
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.409 
we will be joining the question and

1276
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.669 
answer session.

1277
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:06.670 
Thank you.

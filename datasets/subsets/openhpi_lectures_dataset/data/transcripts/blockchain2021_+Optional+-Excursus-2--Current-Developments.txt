00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.540 
Welcome back to our openHPI course: Blockchain - Revealing the myth.

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:08.140 
In this video, we want to take a look at current developments using

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.400 
blockchain technology.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.780 
In the previous videos, we've already looked at some applications of blockchain

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.029 
technology, this included automated contracts, decentralized markets, tracking of

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.300 
possessions, but also a very important area of identity management.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.209 
Identity management can include a lot of different sub-areas but in

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.640 
this video, we want to talk about the current developments in identity

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910 
management applications that is very current to our ongoing pandemic, it's the

10
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.579 
UBIRCH Covid-19 passport.

11
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.289 
There are basically two scenarios where this technology will come into play,

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.985 
on the one hand, the covid-19 test certificates can be issued, in

13
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.350 
this case, the user would take the Covid-19 test.

14
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.108 
The test facility would then issue the results as a digital certificate

15
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.009 
and when presenting the digital certificate to relying parties such as Lufthansa during

16
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.090 
a flight checking, it can be verified through the usage of a decentralized

17
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720 
blockchain.

18
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.469 
In the same vein, a Covid-19 vaccination certificate could be issued, the

19
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.729 
user gets Covid-19 vaccination and the doctors then become the

20
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.659 
party issuing a confirmation of successful vaccination.

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.749 
So, how is this actually realized?

22
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.959 
Well, it can be separated into three distinct processes.

23
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.012 
First, obviously, the user goes to a laboratory for a test

24
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.760 
or goes to a doctor for the vaccination.

25
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.310 
He/she then also brings some identification documents, such as a passport, which

26
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.300 
can be used to create a certificate

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.930 
of the successful vaccination or the successful test.

28
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.349 
The result that is given or handed out to the user is

29
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.090 
in the form of a QR code, which includes, on the one hand, the result of the

30
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.279 
vaccination or the test, as well as some information

31
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.975 
on the identity, such as the name, birth, etc., as well

32
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.830 
as a timestamp.

33
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.319 
For anchoring this as a kind of validation backbone to

34
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.409 
the blockchain, an anonymous fingerprint is created.

35
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.930 
When the user presents the handed-out QR codes

36
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.519 
to relying parties such as Lufthansa during a flight check-in,

37
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.360 
the results in the QR codes can be compared with the

38
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.143 
anonymous fingerprint in the blockchain, if there are any discrepancies, this

39
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.890 
would lead into what would point towards

40
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.680 
some manipulation.

41
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.469 
So, the general idea of it is very easy,

42
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.479 
however, it has to be kept in mind of what is actually being achieved by

43
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.309 
this blockchain and what even is the blockchain in this case.

44
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.509 
So, UBIRCH told us in a request that they primarily

45
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.905 
use GovDigital for their blockchain infrastructure.

46
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.390 
However, they are agnostic towards any specific technologies

47
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.240 
and they would be able to issue these anchorings towards any

48
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.020 
blockchain that is suitable for it.

49
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.369 
At this point, they were unwilling to provide any more information, however,

50
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.279 
this is probably due to them being in active development and discussions

51
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.009 
for rolling this technology out, German-wide.

52
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.051 
So, GovDigital itself is a consortium for providing Blockchain infrastructure,

53
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.499 
they are primarily focused on private blockchains for public applications such

54
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.069 
as different bureaucratic processes.

55
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.469 
The border between blockchain and replicated databases, however, becomes very unclear in

56
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.165 
this context. So, if GovDigital is a closed consortium,

57
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.154 
which is using private blockchains, the distinction from

58
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.179 
a replicated database becomes very unclear, at least from a user perspective.

59
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.490 
So, we can't interact with the GovDigital system in any other way

60
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.279 
than we would with a normal replicated database.

61
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.418 
So, as we've said in previous videos, you have to keep in mind

62
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.259 
what is actually the advantage if you are trying to deploy

63
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.360 
a certain technology. Yes, there are some advantages to the blockchain, but

64
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.160 
using a blockchain for any and all applications might not be beneficial.

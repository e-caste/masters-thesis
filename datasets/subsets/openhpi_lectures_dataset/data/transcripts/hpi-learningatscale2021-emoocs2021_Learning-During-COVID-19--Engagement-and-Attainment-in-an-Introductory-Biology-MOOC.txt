00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.540 
alright so hello everybody. i'm virginia blackwell. and it's

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.100 
my pleasure to speak to you today on engagement and attainment

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.640 
of learners during the cope nineteen pandemic in a single introductory

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.120 
biology.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.950 
in march twenty twenty many countries shifted to online schooling

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.500 
at all education levels due to the kopa nineteen pandemic and

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.820 
because of this my platform saw a greatly increased traffic

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.570 
and gained millions of new learners.

9
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.660 
the pandemic is a unique event and that it affected all of our learners

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.990 
although personal situations varied and the motivations. and

11
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.450 
educational goals of those learners are quite diverse.

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.850 
and at this point most analyses of the pandemic 's effect on moocs

13
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.530 
have largely been focused on that increased enrollment.

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.180 
but what about changes in participation and engagement

15
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.110 
and in achievement in moocs and has the pandemic merely increased.

16
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.270 
the number of learners or people engaging with moocs differently

17
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.840 
and learning from them in a different way

18
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.720 
and are aspects of learner engagement during the pandemic

19
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.310 
that we find are beneficial do we want to bring them into a post pandemic time.

20
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.890 
so therefore we sought to determine whether the covd-19

21
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.410 
pandemic resulted in increased learner engagement and attainment

22
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
in a single introductory biology course.

23
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.840 
and we investigated the following measures

24
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.010 
enrollment and specific learner demographics.

25
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.990 
the proportion of learners engaging with videos problems and

26
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.030 
forms within the mooc.
the number of engagement events performed by individuals with

27
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.810 
videos problems and forms within the mooc

28
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.450 
and learner verification and performance.

29
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.450 
we predicted that learner enrolment and engagement in this

30
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.270 
mooc increased during the pandemic. but we did not

31
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.630 
necessarily expect higher scores or more certifications to be earned

32
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.200 
in the mooc in question 's seven hundred x introductory introduction to biology.

33
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.940 
the secret of life. it's a college level introductory biology

34
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.760 
course developed by mit ex biology has been available on at ecs.

35
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.360 
since twenty thirteen may be runs in regular intervals

36
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.330 
learners may enroll in a free auditor track or pay for the verified track

37
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.980 
which gives access to a comprehensive competency exam

38
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.360 
that with a sufficient score earns verified learners a certification.

39
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.630 
the course is largely self-paced within its defined start and end date

40
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.330 
with a competency exam at the final week of the course.

41
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.430 
we evaluated data from three pre pandemic runs and two runs during the pandemic

42
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.780 
each named by the month and year in which that run began.

43
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.460 
we also defined classification labels to categorize those who

44
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.620 
register for this mooc.

45
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.930 
so learners are users who have enrolled in the mooc.

46
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.540 
participants are learners who viewed this course at least once.

47
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.370 
and engaged participants performed at least one engagement metric

48
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.910 
by viewing a video attempting a problem posting on the form

49
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.120 
or attempting that competency example mentioned.

50
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.710 
so we first investigated enrolment and learner demographics.

51
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.720 
the pandemic affected different countries in different ways

52
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.360 
and so we wished to determine if there was a difference in overall learner locations

53
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.130 
prior to and during the pandemic.

54
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.980 
and we found for all course runs that learners represent the

55
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.500 
same countries in approximately. the same proportions

56
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.940 
in total over one hundred and sixty countries represented with

57
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.620 
forty percent of learners coming from the united states, india and united kingdom.

58
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.420 
other demographics like age and level of education are also of interest.

59
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.790 
but our team ar unreliable due to response bias and self-reporting nature of these

60
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.530 
of these measures and a low response rate in general.

61
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.470 
so our next analysis was on enrollment over time for the smoke

62
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.930 
free pandemic runs or in shades of blue and green

63
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.390 
and pandemic runs or in orange and red.

64
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.530 
so for the first pandemic run we see enrollment increases rapidly

65
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.620 
during the pre pandemic rapidly compared to pre  pandemic values

66
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.280 
specifically after the world health organization declares cova nineteen

67
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.360 
a global pandemic in early march.

68
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.750 
we reach a peak of fifteen thousand learners,

69
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.440 
when the prior of the runs of the smoke reached about six to eight thousand.

70
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.010 
so this increase is an unexpected considering the widespread reports

71
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.460 
of new learners joining with platforms,

72
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.150 
while the second pandemic run in july twenty twenty also shows increased enrolment.

73
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.150 
but it's not as much as the early months of the pandemic and

74
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.240 
so the suggest that these boosts and romans are

75
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.910 
better due to the pandemic may not be sustainable in the long term.

76
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.490 
so our next question was did increased rowman actually translate

77
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.360 
to increased participation and engagement.

78
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.010 
we calculated the percent of learners who classified as participants.

79
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.320 
and if you remember this is learners who access the course at least once.

80
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.740 
and this percentage is similar between pre pandemic runs.

81
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.420 
but we found that they peaked in the first pandemic run and

82
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.540 
dipped in the second. so this hints that even though both runs

83
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.080 
occurred during the pandemic they might show different engagement

84
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.260 
trends from each other.

85
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.930 
and from here we dove deeper into engagement by calculating.

86
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.630 
the percent of participants who performed an engagement action at least once

87
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.890 
during the course run.

88
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.420 
the engagement actions we analyzed represented a range of effort

89
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.380 
from more passive video viewing to more active problem attempting

90
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.630 
or posting on a form.

91
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.080 
when we saw that the percent of participants posting to forums

92
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.020 
was significantly higher during the pandemic than pre pandemic.

93
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.110 
and this is actually surprising since we expected lower effort

94
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.820 
activities like viewing videos to show larger increases in engagement.

95
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.420 
when in fact during the second pandemic run we actually see

96
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.520 
a lower percentage of video viewing than in all prior runs.

97
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.970 
so one reason for this increased form posting could be lack

98
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.950 
of in-person interactions due to stay at home procedures.

99
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.530 
but the decrease in video viewing posed a curious mystery,

100
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.020 
so we analyzed the number of unique videos viewed by individuals

101
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.620 
excluding participants who didn't view any videos at all

102
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.330 
for each run we broke values into three categories auditor

103
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.080 
track participants which is the free track available to all enrolled learners.

104
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.820 
the verify track participants who did not earn certification and certified participants.

105
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.120 
we found that certified participants in march twenty twenty

106
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.290 
viewed more unique videos than prepared democrat runs.

107
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.430 
but in contrast the participants of july twenty twenty viewed

108
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.810 
far fewer unique videos especially among those who earned certification.

109
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.490 
so not only did a lower percentage percentage of participants engage with videos,

110
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.540 
but those that did engage with videos viewing viewing far fewer

111
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.050 
unique videos in total.

112
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.320 
additionally we looked at the average number of play pause

113
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.390 
events per video for each participant.

114
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.030 
this is calculated as an individual's cumulative number of play events

115
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.550 
divided by the number of unique videos that that person has viewed.

116
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.790 
there are many reasons for a learner to click play or pause in a video

117
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.870 
like taking more detailed notes processing information within the video

118
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.860 
or just re watching video content. so this ratio is representing

119
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.100 
a deeper video engagement or simply viewing.

120
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.670 
we found that play per video ratio is pretty similar across

121
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.710 
the three pre-paradigmatic runs. but both pan-democrats show increased play events

122
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.410 
per unique video for all three categories of learners.

123
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.030 
so although the july twenty twenty participants viewed fewer videos.

124
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.470 
they appear to interact more with those videos that they have viewed.

125
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.050 
next week investigated participants attempting problems. so

126
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.690 
the percentage of participants attempting problems was approximately

127
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.950 
same across all five friends and we found the number of unique

128
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:55.110 
problems that these individuals attempt is also approximately

129
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.560 
the same across all the runs.

130
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.490 
and we follow this by comparing a normalized problem attempt

131
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.320 
per day for each run. so this is calculated as the total number

132
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.820 
of problem attempts within the mooc each day divided by the

133
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.790 
total number of problem engage participants in each run.

134
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.040 
we find that the three pandemic runs and the july twenty twenty pandemic run

135
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.220 
show similar participant activity with medium problems

136
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.820 
attempts per day think about point three

137
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.360 
the march twenty twenty pandemic run is distinct having a slightly

138
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.210 
higher reading of point four meaning these participants are

139
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.880 
making more attempts at solving problems during this run.

140
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.050 
our next individual analysis was a number of form posts
for form engaged participants.

141
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.820 
so for utter track and verify check participants. we found little

142
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.890 
difference between the pre pandemic and pandemic runs.

143
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.300 
but for certified participants sometimes. but not always they

144
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.720 
made more formed posts than the other sort categories,

145
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.120 
so there are also and in addition to this during the pandemic.

146
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.770 
there are more high post count outliers among the auditors

147
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.830 
and so despite having more participants posting to the form

148
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.830 
during the pandemic as i mentioned earlier

149
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.680 
individuals themselves aren't necessarily making more posts

150
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.040 
and in some ways this makes sense considering that forum posting

151
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.130 
is not a necessary interaction to complete the mooc like viewing

152
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.560 
a video or attempting problem.

153
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.520 
after individual engagement metrics we compared the verification

154
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.910 
of certification trends across course runs.

155
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.030 
so verification implies an intention to complete most of the book content

156
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.210 
while certified certification shows successful completion. so

157
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.620 
these are good measures for attainment for this mooc.

158
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.270 
first we calculated the percent of verified truck participants,

159
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.570 
out of all participants and in this case the black horizontal line

160
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.990 
represents the mean prix pandemic percentage while the number

161
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.770 
of individuals in that run is noted in white text

162
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.080 
prepared democrats have similar verification percentages about

163
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.090 
three percent of all participants and both pandemic runs are

164
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.740 
higher than pre pandemic values.

165
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.770 
especially in the case of the july twenty twenty run.

166
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.240 
so more learners are indicating an attempt to complete the

167
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.470 
course during the pandemic.

168
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.060 
and we next investigated the certification percentages among

169
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.500 
all verified trac participants and in this mood verify trac

170
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.990 
participants figured as four eighty percent higher on the competency exam or certificate.

171
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.750 
so for a pre pandemic we find the certification percentage

172
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.100 
tends to decrease in consecutive runs from a peak of nearly

173
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.250 
twenty percent in april twenty nineteen.

174
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.550 
the first pandemic for intense looks like it breaks this trend

175
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.050 
and we have a higher expected percentage of people earning certification.

176
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.930 
however, the second pandemic run shows the lowest certification

177
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.770 
percentage of all four fronts at about twelve and a half percent.

178
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.390 
so this metric was calculated with all verify tracked participants

179
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.440 
which means we also capture people that didn't engage with

180
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.120 
a competency exam at all.

181
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.050 
it turned out that approximately half of the verified participants don't even attempt

182
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.310 
the exam.
so we recalculated this by excluding these non attempters

183
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.130 
and found certification percentages to be much higher

184
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.870 
however the july twenty twenty round is still quite low with

185
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.280 
only one third of participants earning certification.

186
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.490 
we were curious to the cause of this boost in verified participants

187
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.790 
and hypothesized that this massive shift from traditional education to online classes

188
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.760 
could have contributed to this increase.

189
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.700 
for both pandemic grunts the percentage of learners with an

190
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.270 
e-mail domain associated with higher education institution

191
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.720 
was significantly higher for verified trac and certified trac participants than independent

192
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:53.360 
and paper meaning that more university students staff and faculty

193
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.450 
verified and certified in this mooc during the pandemic.

194
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.130 
the lower percentage of certified learners in july twenty twenty

195
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.570 
prompted us to investigate the learner scores on the competency exam.

196
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.840 
and this included only the verified trac participants who attempted the exam

197
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.750 
and received a non-zero score.

198
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.500 
in these box plots the down horizontal line represents the

199
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.780 
passing score of eighty percent

200
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.960 
so we found that verified trac participants earned similar

201
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.250 
scores across the first

202
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.360 
first four runs but during the july twenty twenty run more

203
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.160 
participants earned lower scores resulting in that lower certification

204
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.690 
percentage.

205
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.110 
in conclusion we hypothesized that the cover nineteen pandemic

206
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.630 
increased learner enrollment and engagement in this mooc

207
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.870 
and as noted by many others we saw increased enrollment in our course

208
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.260 
though appears to be falling back to pre pandemic levels.

209
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.940 
we also saw an increase in the proportion of all learners participating

210
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.940 
in the first pandemic run, but a decrease in the second.

211
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.930 
and an overall engagement many more participants posted to

212
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.810 
forums during the pandemic, but individuals themselves did not

213
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.990 
necessarily make more form posts. and this was unexpected to

214
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.540 
us because we thought lower effort activities have larger increases.

215
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.980 
a further analysis of the forum such as looking at poke post

216
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.930 
content and post length is necessary to determine the context

217
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.100 
of this increase and to see if phorm engagement will continue

218
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.280 
to be high moving forward.

219
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.090 
contrary to our expectation video viewing decreased in the second pandemic

220
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.110 
both in percentage and in the number of unique videos viewed by individuals.

221
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.100 
and this could be due to learners repeating the course who

222
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.990 
have possibly already seen these videos in a prior run

223
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.870 
and are returning to focus on specific topics

224
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.410 
and this could also be due to learners taking the book concurrently

225
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.100 
with the outside biology class.

226
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.380 
so thus explaining the higher proportion of learners with dot edu email addresses

227
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.410 
and that would necessitate less video viewing as well

228
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.320 
play per video ratio actually went up which could correspond

229
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.460 
to participants taking notes or watching free watching parts of videos

230
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.360 
would also could correspond to them struggling to understand

231
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.360 
the video content.

232
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.240 
when combined with lower exam scores and lower percentage of certified participants

233
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.220 
the slower attainment could be due to learner fatigue or changing

234
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.440 
lifestyle as learners return to in-person activities and this

235
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.230 
would be an unfortunate consequence of the pandemic on which

236
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.390 
we also saw a higher percentage of verified users which could

237
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:39.530 
be attributed to the shift to online schooling more partnerships between

238
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.920 
platforms and universities or just an increased personal motivation

239
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.470 
to gain new skills for employment

240
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.420 
and additionally we saw higher percentage of people with university affiliated email addresses

241
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.240 
among those that were verified check and certified.

242
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.990 
so in fact the percentages we found are likely an underestimate

243
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.980 
of the learners for associated with higher education since

244
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.550 
those learners could just use a non educational personal email address like joe.

245
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.250 
but for the second pan-democrats specifically the high verification

246
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.320 
percentage could be due to learners returning from a prior run

247
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.650 
they may have used the march twenty twenty run to preview the

248
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.270 
course before committing to verification. but we need to perform

249
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.390 
some further investigation to take a look at this,

250
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.070 
while the enrollment trends for this mooc are applicable to

251
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.570 
other moves the engagement trends may not be as easily generalizable

252
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.430 
as likely that courses outside of biology not introductory

253
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.920 
moves and moocs with more restricted demographics

254
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.620 
will show different engagement patterns.

255
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.160 
however, our look into learner activity during the pandemic

256
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:48.230 
further shows that mics play a key role in learning during times of uncertainty

257
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.440 
and are a very important coastal learning option.

258
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.060 
naturally not even remote work is done in a vacuum, i wouldn't

259
00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.260 
have been able to conduct the study without the support of

260
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.470 
the MIT biology department and specifically the mit x biology team

261
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.040 
especially thanks to mariel and ultra darcy gordon and money

262
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.820 
available for their keen insight and exceptional feedback.

263
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.960 
thank you very much for your time and attention.

1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.240 
When we think how we can
select good strong passwords

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.600 
we have to discuss the
dilemma of weak passwords.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.660 
What is a weak password, a weak
passwords is such a password

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.570 
that can very easily revealed by
attacks we will discuss later

5
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.060 
in more detail. The problem is
that many users use and work

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.760 
with weak passwords when they
registering when they setting

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.440 
up their digital identity they
can select the password

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.300 
freely and of course they want
to be able to remember this

9
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.240 
so often only a weak
password is chosen.

10
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.490 
The human factor is a
problem, convenience

11
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.980 
so to take the same
password for all service

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.180 
complex passwords are harder to
remember and then it's more

13
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.730 
difficult after a while to
get access to the (web?)

14
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.380 
and many people do not completely
understand why passwords

15
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.890 
are needed at all so there is a
lack of security awareness which

16
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.650 
leads them for example to
select as a password

17
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.060 
the sequence one 123456
or similar easy things.

18
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.300 
The password can be weak for
various reasons for example

19
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
they can be weak because they
have a very low complexity

20
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.800 
but the password can also
considered week when it's easy to

21
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.720 
derive the password from
a known user context

22
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.140 
from his name, christian
name, family from his

23
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.600 
personal data he will stay or
from some characteristics

24
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.020 
or other things and
in a third way

25
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.230 
passwords can be
weak also when

26
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.870 
formal strong passwords
are re-used

27
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.810 
you know your operating
system from time to time

28
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.840 
asks you to select a new
password and even if

29
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.800 
there was a strong
password chosen when you

30
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.720 
ever time re-uses then
and attack were able

31
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.230 
to get access to this password
then also strong passwords

32
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.390 
can be considered to be weak.
Lets have a closer look

33
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.210 
to this different cases let's
start with weak passwords

34
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:42.670 
due to the low complexity. We
have to consider a password

35
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.920 
as weak if it has less
than ten characters

36
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.740 
we have to consider there's
a weak if its only

37
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.940 
created only from one
type of characters

38
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.220 
for example only from numbers
or only from letters

39
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.530 
or only from special characters
you have to mix these

40
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.650 
character groups and passwords
need to be considered

41
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.540 
weak when it's easy to found
them in a dictionary.

42
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.960 
We will understand this better
when we go into more details

43
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.120 
and see how the
attackers attack

44
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.820 
such passwords and a simple way
to attack passwords is to

45
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.810 
take a dictionary and then to
compute all the hash values of all

46
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.020 
the words of all the strings in the
dictionary and then to compare

47
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.620 
the outcome with the hashed
password of a stolen

48
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.750 
user database, also
key sequences

49
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.680 
which are very simple and
form simple figures on

50
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.790 
a keyboard need to be considered
weak for example these

51
00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.230 
two examples, the table shows the
10 passwords of the 12 largest

52
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.090 
leaked identity databases
you remember we collect

53
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.960 
we at HPI collect
such data leaks to

54
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.480 
give them as to
use them as

55
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.100 
a basis for our identity checker
so we have some insights and

56
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.020 
we analyzed the usage and often
such password, occurred

57
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.100 
and it was very very
astonishing for us

58
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.740 
so half percent of this
is more than 160

59
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.580 
million users use the
password 123456

60
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.950 
you see also the passwords
very very simple formed

61
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.280 
with a very small and
low complexity so

62
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.150 
for a user or for an
attacker it becomes easy

63
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.210 
to guess to try a user name
together with a password 123456

64
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.260 
always one of the other

65
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.630 
password in the list and
there is a big chance

66
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:14.870 
that he succeeds to get into
the account of a user

67
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.500 
and come into the
position to

68
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.770 
misuse this. I also mentioned that
passwords need to be considered

69
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.650 
weak if the password is
close to some personal

70
00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.450 
information around the user so
for example many users use

71
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.100 
personal data as password
their surnames

72
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.990 
their first name the name of the
partner, child, parent, dog

73
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.020 
many others or date of
birth favorite bands

74
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.810 
favorite actors and others and
everyone who knows the person

75
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.760 
can guess this data and can
later try out whether these

76
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.750 
data are used as
password so passwords

77
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.810 
chosen at least to some
extent from then

78
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.880 
from the authentication
service

79
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.030 
there is another approach
to remember the password

80
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.800 
so we're speaking about human
factor so many people for example

81
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.370 
when they use adobe
they use the password

82
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.090 
which reminds them to adobe
for example adobe123

83
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.180 
of photoshop or adobe1 so from
the personal information

84
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.690 
the password can be guessed
but also from the

85
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.410 
context the password
is used for

86
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.430 
the cyber criminals have
a chance to guess

87
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.110 
the password if the user is
not aware that passwords

88
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.740 
need to be strong. An attacker
who knows his victim

89
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.560 
can easily guess passwords and
then third factor is the reuse

90
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.570 
of a former passwords and also
this needs to be considered

91
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:13.510 
as a weak password even if the
password is a relatively secure

92
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.510 
possible, why that?
For some passwords

93
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.130 
it's often used the same password
is often used for all accounts

94
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.670 
for example this looks
very quite strong

95
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.530 
password it's a mix
of different groups

96
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:37.200 
of signs but when this password
is used for every service

97
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.400 
in the internet by any user and
if only one of the services

98
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.880 
is leaked then the
attacker has access

99
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.470 
to even the strong password
of the user and can misuse

100
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:57.440 
or if a strong password is
used only with slight

101
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.300 
modifications here for example to
(append?) the name of the service

102
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.290 
that's used the
same password and

103
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.980 
short information what
kind of service is used

104
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.750 
so this needs to
be considered as

105
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.810 
weak because if password data of
only one services is leaked

106
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.970 
to the internet then all other
services are affected, the attacker

107
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.240 
can misuse this found
password in the leak

108
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.270 
to attack user
accounts even from

109
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.960 
other services. The
question is how to choose

110
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.050 
safe passwords?

111
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.060 
First, do not use any information
from the user context

112
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.400 
no information that attacker
could find about the victim

113
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.850 
for example name, first name,
birthday, favorite band

114
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.170 
a name of the dog or many
others. Second one should not

115
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.750 
choose a phrase or a word which
is a which can be found in

116
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:10.340 
the dictionary because there
are dictionary attacks which

117
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.030 
make it easy for the
attacker to reveal

118
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.760 
the password to
reveale such phrase

119
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.520 
from a hashed password found in
the leak of a user database.

120
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.260 
The length is important of a
password so it should be at least

121
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:34.670 
ten characters the
reason is if only one

122
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:41.490 
character is added to a password
then to find out to reveal this

123
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:48.360 
needs double the long time.
Select characters from

124
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.510 
different character groups
special symbols and

125
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:58.360 
numbers and letters, special
cases, upper lower case letters

126
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.350 
and others, this
increase the number of

127
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.930 
characters that
need to be tested

128
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.970 
if the attacker performs
a brute force attack

129
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.560 
another way another hint for
choosing a safe password is

130
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.920 
that one definitely need to
choose different passwords

131
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:29.720 
for different accounts. I mentioned
this the attacker is able

132
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.430 
to get access to one password
from a leaked user database

133
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.600 
then he can and user
use the same password

134
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.600 
for different services
and he can misuse

135
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.830 
the password also for
un-leaked services.

136
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.220 
Then he one should not
reuse old passwords and

137
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.450 
if one following these rules that
one can significantly improve

138
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.780 
the security of accounts
and the internet

139
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.920 
then if you follow these rules
it becomes more work and

140
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.340 
more difficult for
the cyber criminals

141
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:13.730 
to attack your password and
to get your password in

142
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.970 
their hands and allow them
to misuse your accounts.

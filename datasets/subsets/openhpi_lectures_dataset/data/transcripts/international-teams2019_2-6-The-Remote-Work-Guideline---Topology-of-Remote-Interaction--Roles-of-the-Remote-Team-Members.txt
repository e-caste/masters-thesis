00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.350 
OK, Salim. Let's talk
about the structure

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.100 
of remote interaction, how do
you organize that and which

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.620 
roles do you need? do
you need roles at all?

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.140 
Definitely, you need roles and
particularly it depends on what you

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.680 
are doing. When we think about
remote work don't expect

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.430 
we just imagine everyone
is out there without any

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.870 
structure we need structure.
Therefore, we define

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.160 
a topology and the roles of
the remote interaction.

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.180 
Why? It is because it's
necessary to have this

10
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.770 
remote structure needs
to be coordinated.

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.760 
We cannot expect because people
have a laptop and a camera

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
and an internet connection, everything
will work just like that.

13
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
We need to define it!
we start now defining

14
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.290 
the topology. Topology is a
type of interaction, we

15
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.660 
particularly look forward
to in order to have.

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.070 
It depends. It defines
also, some roles

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.160 
to people for interacting probably.
I have a one team leader,

18
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.820 
I have many team leaders? What are
doing all team leaders, that

19
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.950 
are there? It also impacts directly
performance because if we

20
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.660 
don't have the information
coordinated, the tasks

21
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.430 
are not coordinated, at the end
we will not have anything.

22
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.220 
Also, it is important to
define topology-based

23
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.710 
on the knowledge and experience
of the people. I cannot put

24
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.300 
a team of just new people
everyone together

25
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
Then all of the experts
on the other side. No,

26
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.400 
we need to combine all of
this because it will bring

27
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.650 
also success. We will talk about
a bit of individual cognitive

28
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
preferences. Because you
probably, will learn more

29
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.410 
reading and I learn more
watching a video or probably,

30
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.980 
I will be listening to something
and I will be by far more

31
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.010 
effective with that. And also we
need to define some rules of

32
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.530 
communications, rules are very
important, how to communicate?

33
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.200 
Now, these are the three topologies
that we normally have in

34
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.030 
a remote working environment
we have a centralized

35
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.840 
we have one single point of contact.
It means there is one single

36
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.380 
team leader and everyone
talks to the team leader,

37
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.440 
but can you imagine, how negative
will be the experience if

38
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.200 
we have fifty people talking
to one single person.

39
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.980 
it won't work. Particularly
for the guy in the middle

40
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.240 
It would be impossible
for him to coordinate,

41
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.600 
the others will be bored
about what should I do?

42
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.570 
It also depends, how
big are your teams?

43
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.110 
If you have a really small
team for four people then,

44
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.420 
just go with centralized but
you have a team of fifteen...

45
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.470 
already starting with ten is
already, becoming difficult.

46
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.070 
try to make your teams when
use centralizes up to five,

47
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.840 
After that, they start growing
and if you start growing

48
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.380 
you can move to a
decentralized, where you have

49
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.440 
several centralized teams
with one team leader.

50
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
Someone with experience,
someone that can coordinate

51
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.670 
and you will see that at
the end you have in the

52
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
middle someone that is coordinating
also all the decentralized

53
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.400 
teams but then it means it's a huge
challenge in the communication.

54
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.770 
You must coordinate, therefore,
the tools that you already

55
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.810 
presented in the past. There is
a schedule, some meetings.

56
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.590 
The tools there, video
communication, audio communication

57
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.000 
they are really, pretty nice but
are nothing if we don't plan

58
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.040 
successfully. This is the
point of the decentralized

59
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.840 
team. It is very effective and
it is the most widely used

60
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.430 
in team topology......
I imagine it is

61
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.660 
easier to organize the
decentralized than the

62
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.290 
distributed one, that you probably
will introduce in a couple

63
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.890 
of seconds but also, it has a couple of disadvantages.
I see several, single, points of failure.

64
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.530 
Exactly, this is the main point
there in the decentralized.

65
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.450 
If one of the leaders in
the in one of these

66
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.060 
little bubbles goes out then,
the team could go out.

67
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.380 
Therefore, there are also
strategies. Where you say, if am

68
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.630 
a team leader of one team and
I have another team leader

69
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.970 
that I'm working with,
you have a backup

70
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.790 
between these other teams because
then the other one can back

71
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.530 
me up whenever I am
sick, on holiday or Im

72
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.530 
traveling. Therefore, this is
definitely a single point of

73
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.430 
failure but also there are some
coordination tasks to achieve.

74
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.240 
The last one which is the
distributed one, probably can

75
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.770 
you imagine. Does it looks like
something for you, this distributed?

76
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.260 
I mean to me it looks like
the internet. It is and you

77
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.710 
can see that the single points of
failure are not that evident

78
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.750 
Communication always can find the detail
and you will always gonna have...

79
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.870 
Exactly, it is very
difficult to fail but

80
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.800 
it is very difficult
to manage.

81
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.650 
Does this one really need way more
trust in all of the others?

82
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.610 
Of course, because when you share
something it is shared to

83
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.130 
everyone. It means it depends
on the kind of project,

84
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.150 
but probably for instance,
when you're coordinating

85
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.910 
things, let's say
with a lawyer

86
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.430 
and you need more people
involved in the same task.

87
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.300 
It is important
that everyone,

88
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.150 
knows everything about
what is going on.

89
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.580 
Therefore, distributed
teams are also relevant.

90
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.570 
Very difficult to manage because
who has the lead there? No one,

91
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.210 
but there is a consensus that
we need to share everything

92
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.470 
what we know in
order to go ahead.

93
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.630 
Now, when we talk about
teams and the topology, we

94
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.370 
need also, to define roles in
the conscious of a remote team

95
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.210 
are defined as, the power player
or expected to be played

96
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.620 
by a team member. You are a team
leader, I'm a member of your team

97
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.520 
and potentially, I will need
to talk to another team.

98
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.440 
Go ahead do it, but keep in
mind, I respect your rule,

99
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.780 
you respect my role, this
is very important.

100
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.340 
Because, in the remote
structures, some people try to

101
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.470 
become the boss. Keep it
easy, there is some

102
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.720 
kind of leadership there and this
is necessary to be respected.

103
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.030 
If you do not agree with
that, talk to your manager,

104
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.510 
go ahead discuss it. Now,
individuals can express themself

105
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.680 
in three different types. Let's
say in functional roles,

106
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.150 
they enable the team to
achieve the project

107
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.740 
objectives. You have always
in teams, come on...

108
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.730 
let's do it, we will reach this
by the end of the week or

109
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.420 
will deliver this and will
be the best project.

110
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.210 
Those motivations are
important, don't forget!

111
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.750 
There are some...we are
talking to humans.

112
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.540 
It means this support and trust for each other is very
important. There are social emotional roles, it means

113
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.680 
that people need to build trust,
they need to collaborate, they

114
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.140 
need to be effective
and for instance, if

115
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.400 
people do not motivate each other
or are constantly in conflict,

116
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.930 
it will slow down the chain of
communication and it will definitely

117
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.130 
impact the whole
project.

118
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.990 
There are individual roles
when they need, I'm working

119
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.050 
here but no one tells me anything
about what I'm doing, I'm doing

120
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.890 
good or doing it bad. This individual
or the person as an individual

121
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.280 
need also recognition
or probably a critic

122
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.740 
in order to improve
what they are doing,

123
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.660 
but these are some of the...
let's say of the roles, that

124
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.480 
people play on this remote
teams. Now, the team leader,

125
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.930 
it is definitely necessary
to have a team leader

126
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.060 
out there. When we bring a lot of
people out there when we want to

127
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.280 
communicate, we need also the
team leader also to be there

128
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.730 
to have experience.
So, he or she has

129
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.240 
the same experience of working
remotely? Because then he or

130
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.550 
she will have the experience.
OK, this is a problem,

131
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.260 
we should change this probably,
the meetings are being too late

132
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.790 
or video communication is
too slow or is breaking

133
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.190 
up. There is something with the
leader perspective to say

134
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.560 
OK, we need to change things and
we will need to improve that

135
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.440 
in any kind of direction.
These roles in the remote

136
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.850 
teamwork environment are definitely
important, the team leader

137
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.270 
even if you have a very small
team, you need to have a team

138
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.630 
leader. This team leader probably
is not the manager of a

139
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.640 
department in your organization
but it plays a role of

140
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.380 
keeping everything
organized.

141
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.670 
Again as always, we would
like to invite you

142
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.460 
to contribute a
forum to discuss

143
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.470 
the roles that you would consider
mandatory to have when working

144
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.530 
with remote teams?
Do you know

145
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.450 
other topologies? Do you
have any suggestions?

146
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.330 
Did you have any experience
with any of these topologies?

147
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.940 
Just try the discussion
on the forum and

148
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.750 
let's get going with that. Thank
you, Salim. Thank you, Tom.

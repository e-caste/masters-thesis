WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.119 
Based on that, IBM blockchain platform, we are offering

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.859 
or building blockchain solutions, so IBM Food Trust

3
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.689 
and TradeLens are in production.

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.419 
IBM Blockchain World Wire will be announced soon.

5
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.329 
And we are working on trusted identity.

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.099 
So what's that, Food Trust addresses the key issues

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.629 
in the food ecosystem to secure supply chain

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.189 
for food and for food safety because still a lot of people get

9
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.880 
ill because of food

10
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.430 
wrongly handled or being contaminated by something.

11
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.649 
And so we built with an anchor client, Wal-Mart,

12
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.479 
a solution to track the food from farm

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.919 
to fork and enable functionalities

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.839 
like records.

15
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.149 
So, when the project started the Wal-Mart's CEO, went to his team,

16
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.159 
had a cup of sliced mango from the branch he was in and said

17
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.569 
"where's this mango coming from? Please investigate, time is running".

18
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.219 
And the team needed over six days, nearly seven days to find

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.879 
out from which farm this mango was harvested.

20
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.589 
The information was all there, but it was in silos and bringing it all together needed

21
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.090 
time because a lot of them is paper based.

22
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.989 
So, with the Food Trust solution,

23
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.459 
all the participants and all the steps in the supply chain

24
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.179 
are captured with standard measures from just one

25
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.969 
platform. Everything the industry knows they're working with API,

26
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.739 
so you don't have to key it in and you just load it.

27
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.239 
And here you can see an example of

28
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.459 
how the ingredients are traced.

29
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.019 
So, you're asking for a certain lot

30
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.259 
certain date and you get

31
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.259 
the dates of where the ingredients come from,

32
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.729 
where they have been stored, where they have to be transformed, where they have

33
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.199 
been distributed and which stores this particular lot has

34
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.639 
been delivered. So, in a recollection, you

35
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.169 
know where to go to and which products to take

36
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.697 
out of the shelves. If you want to have a closer look at it, at the bottom there's a URL

37
00:02:40.698 --> 00:02:45.179 
of a guided demo where you can click

38
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.220 
yourself through that in a guided way.

39
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.459 
So, TradeLens is about digitizing the global supply

40
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.969 
chain. This is a project we started with Maersk.

41
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.299 
It's about the freight containers and the associated paperworks.

42
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.519 
Most of the world trade of the goods, consumers use are transported

43
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.990 
into the containers and shipped over the ocean.

44
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.969 
And there's a lot of paperwork around that.

45
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.004 
So, Maersk also shadowed a container at the beginning of the project.

46
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:26.459 
It was Avocado's from Kenya to Rotterdam

47
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.679 
and they found out that there were over 30 enterprises

48
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.779 
involved in that process with one hundred twenty people and two hundred information

49
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.969 
exchanges. So, there's a lot of work in that paper documentation

50
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.649 
and transport. And sometimes the paper handling is

51
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.759 
more expensive than transport itself.

52
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.869 
So, what we try to achieve together, Maersk

53
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.519 
and IBM, is to build an industry solution where on the one

54
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.679 
hand the container can be traced and to end,

55
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.889 
not like, you know, from the supply chain and minus one and plus one.

56
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.039 
So, who am I getting this from and to who I have to hand it over,

57
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.569 
having all the events predefined when you enter the

58
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.269 
transport order with the lanes and the participants

59
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.709 
and so you know who will be involved in that process and you can see

60
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.369 
where is that container now in that process.

61
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.989 
And you get all the access to the associated freight papers, they are

62
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.689 
handled, uploaded into a blockchain and

63
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.299 
there are secure signatures around it.

64
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.199 
So, if there is a workflow, the multiple parties have to verify to validate

65
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.819 
the paper, they will do it over the identities of the blockchain.

66
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.369 
And end to end the people at the end of the process have an

67
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.109 
early peek of the papers, can see them before they arrive

68
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.009 
physically or would arrive physically at a station.

69
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.349 
Now coming to cross-border payments, settle payments in seconds,

70
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.819 
not days. So, if you want to send money

71
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.289 
out of Europe, we have SEPA, so we have a service level agreement that

72
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.720 
our money will be there the next day

73
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.729 
regardless if it's in-countryor cross-country.

74
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.409 
But if you want to send money really around the world, then

75
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.939 
it takes time and it takes a lot of fees to do that.

76
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.939 
What we are doing differently with IBM World Wire is that we

77
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.499 
want to use a digital token cryptocurrency called

78
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.089 
Stellar Protocol Lumen as a transport medium for

79
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.069 
transferring money, and we are doing that by building or establishing

80
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.609 
the financial institution, a so-called stable coin.

81
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.109 
So, somebody hedging the risk of

82
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.729 
the exchange rate between the currencies and the Lumen and make

83
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.229 
it look what you transport like a dollar or a euro or a fiat

84
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.619 
currency on that blockchain.

85
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.059 
And so banks will be able to transfer money according to the

86
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.769 
regulation of the anti-moneylaundering with the best execution,

87
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.899 
with all the rules which are around in money transfer

88
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.369 
over blockchain and do that in a fraction of the

89
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.459 
time and a cost which is here today.

90
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.749 
And we're working on getting an identity solution on the blockchain.

91
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.729 
So, when you look at identity disorder - identities

92
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.099 
of persons that are rendering sole representations

93
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.779 
attesting your identities or attributes of your identity and

94
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.509 
the interactions of identity, the same is for organizations

95
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.540 
and we'll have the problem of

96
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.869 
things census, for example, having an identity or needing an identity

97
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.849 
to ensure the provenance of the information

98
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.739 
and that they are secure.

99
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.629 
How do we want to accomplish that?

100
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.689 
We joined the Sovrin Foundation as a founding steward

101
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.349 
and are working on a self-sovereignidentity.

102
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.059 
This will be implemented in a Hyperledger project called INDI as the blockchain

103
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.269 
implementation for self-sovereignidentity.

104
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.779 
And this is how it will work.

105
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.360 
So, imagine you get a certificate from a university,

106
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:02.839 
so the issuing university will sign a credential,

107
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.589 
a verifiable real credential that you are, for example, here a doctor

108
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.949 
now, your account is signing it and you have a verifiable credential

109
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.871 
represented by a decentralized identifier on a public blockchain.

110
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.639 
And if you want to present your credentials because you are applying

111
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.559 
for a job and you want to prove you're a doctor, you meet a qualification,

112
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.439 
then you can give that credential.

113
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.808 
And this hospital in this example will be able to verify

114
00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:40.279 
if you're really a doctor because they can verify the signatures from you

115
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.099 
and this university.

116
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.839 
And this will work also for procedures like Cyro Knowledge Proof, for example,

117
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.789 
if you have to attest that you are at a certain age to do

118
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.499 
some purchases which require a certain minimum age, then today

119
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.509 
you have to present your ID card with your name and your address with everything.

120
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:07.069 
And this will be a medium that you can say, I'm over 16,

121
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.099 
I'm over 18, or whatever age you need.

122
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.959 
And they need no other attribute from you than this one

123
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.489 
there have to look after.

124
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.339 
So IBM is making blockchain for business around the world, as are some

125
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:29.129 
of our published reference projects, and as you can see,

126
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.909 
the industry's approach. Yes, blockchain started in finance and the

127
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.929 
financial sector is still very active.

128
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.399 
So trade finance is a popular use

129
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.959 
case, then around security, the pre and post-tradeenvironment

130
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.079 
is being piloted and tested.

131
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.579 
So the first insurances are looking into blockchain

132
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.629 
for multi-country risk coverage.

133
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.850 
Identity is also heavily piloted.

134
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.602 
There are loyalty currencies on the blockchain.

135
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.099 
Electronic health files are being tested for blockchain

136
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.769 
as a medium. That's also an interesting project, Smart Dubai,

137
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.709 
where we are a strategic consultant.

138
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.909 
Dubai wants to be a paperless administration within the next five years and blockchain

139
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.469 
will be one of the foundation technologies that we want to implement in

140
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.489 
that functionality.

141
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.300 
We have some asset tracking in the Netherlands, RDW with Ebikes.

142
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:45.209 
If they are stolen, you have a digital process to make your claims that insurance

143
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.539 
with police involved, etc. It's running in the Groningen area.

144
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.419 
And you probably have heard about Everledger, the diamond register

145
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.009 
now going over the immutable security system

146
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.929 
and doing an investigation on the compliance to the UN Kimberley

147
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.549 
Process so that only legally mined diamonds are supposed

148
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.440 
to get into trade and that conflict or blood diamonds are being detected by

149
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.379 
investigating in the certificate in an automated way if they comply to that process.

150
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.169 
And I've compiled some use cases here from the Dutch area,

151
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.879 
so we are working on payments in the automotive

152
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.039 
and IoT industry. So, we showcase the pilot

153
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.629 
with UBS and set a demo at IAA and CES,

154
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:45.369 
about a car that is able to pay over a blockchain.

155
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.449 
Because we more and more see that car-sharing

156
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.919 
or fleet services are owner of the car, and driver of

157
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.049 
the car is no longer the owner and is only using the car part-time.

158
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:07.549 
And so you have to take the measures, that car,

159
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:12.739 
for example, is able to pay when it gets into parking,

160
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:18.109 
into power loading or

161
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.419 
tolls, services, etc.

162
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.309 
and we made a Fab coin, a coin structure

163
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:30.529 
based on Hyperledger Fabric developed by the IBM Research in Zurich.

164
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:35.299 
And it's made opensource now. It will be part of, suggested to be a part of

165
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.749 
Hyperledger Fabric to make this coin structure, the Fab coin.

166
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.089 
We are working with the DB Systel, which is the I.T.

167
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.649 
provider of the Deutsche Bahn, on a new mobility serviceof having

168
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.839 
joint ticketing among several mobility

169
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.369 
services which can be checked

170
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.709 
by the respective parties and have respective revenue splitting

171
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:09.149 
based on a trustful and immutable transactional ledger, so that

172
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.589 
everybody can see which part of the transaction

173
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.299 
is his or her service and can get your respective revenue from that.

174
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.759 
And we're working here in Germany, in the Netherlands on the balancing of the electricity

175
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.319 
grid, so Tennet is responsible for keeping the 50Hz in the electric

176
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.149 
grid, and we need batteries to

177
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.100 
fill gaps due to the nature of renewable

178
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.729 
energies. So they're using the car batteries of

179
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:51.219 
the Tesla fleet in the Netherlands from Vandebron and here in Germany.

180
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.899 
The solar panel grid in the home batteries is from

181
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.900 
SunGrid.

182
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.759 
And now to use cases which IBM is using internally,

183
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:08.099 
this is our oldest one, it's been in production since September 2016.

184
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.379 
IBM has also an IBM global financing division,

185
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.179 
which finances transactions with our clients and with the business partners.

186
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.619 
And even if this business partner is having part

187
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.269 
of the transaction with other providers or suppliers like,

188
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.589 
let's say, Lenovo, the problem is if there's a dispute.

189
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.209 
So, for example, a business partner says you did not deliver

190
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.719 
the goods, they are not here, so I won't pay.

191
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.279 
A manual process started of getting all the information among those multiple

192
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.359 
parties together. So on average, it took us 44 days.

193
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.979 
We build a shadow blockchain, which is just, let's say, a productive

194
00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.449 
overhead, remodeled, a financial transaction, the data model

195
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:02.339 
and we help the parties to

196
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:07.019 
upload their data into that transaction model

197
00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.699 
so that when a dispute is arising or somebody

198
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.769 
has a question, where's my stuff?

199
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:18.599 
They can look into that shadow blockchain and see what have been the last steps,

200
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.279 
what is the information, which Shipper, which tracking number, etc.,

201
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.269 
and a lot of questions or disputes are solved by that.

202
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:32.159 
And for those remaining, we could reduce that from 44 days to 11

203
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.629 
days, releasing finance and capital for us so it pays off even if it's a

204
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.630 
shadow blockchain.

205
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.709 
And we are testing another use case around IBM Singapore,

206
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.939 
about the intercompany supply chain.

207
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.549 
So, if we pay other IBM affiliates

208
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.169 
for services they bring, then this is an intercompany

209
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:02.579 
agreement and all the regulators are looking into that.

210
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.879 
And we enable with smart contracts the data quality of that,

211
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.229 
intercompany agreements and money transfer and we allow the regulators, respective

212
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.849 
authorities to have a look into what we do here and if it's compliant

213
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:18.850 
to the rules.

214
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.039 
We are working on fostering an ecosystem.

215
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.539 
So, for example, we are working with Hacera for

216
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.249 
a registry of private and permissioned networks here for

217
00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.899 
Fabric. So, if you are considering joiningsomething which is already

218
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.519 
there, this is the way or the location where you can go to and kind

219
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.799 
of look after something for you.

220
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.129 
Our services, as I said, or what I want to recommend to you, if

221
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.539 
you want to implement a use case and you don't want to do it alone, you want to have

222
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.939 
experienced persons into that.

223
00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.089 
We are offering a blocking garage which is located here in Germany, in Munich and

224
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.699 
Boeblingen. And we are doing the design thinking workshops

225
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.169 
to define the use case and the scope and do

226
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.419 
that in joint development teams.

227
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:17.219 
So, you get experienced IBM staff, which guide you through a process

228
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.689 
of implementing a minimum viable product, an MVP in, let's say six

229
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.690 
to eight weeks.

230
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.889 
And of course, all the IBM Global Business Services is here to help you.

231
00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.569 
If you want to get consultancy and creating or joining a network of business value

232
00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.119 
assessment, how to do that?

233
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.979 
How to do a business case for that, how to grow your network and how to innovate

234
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.569 
with other technologies to make your blockchain network more

235
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.839 
innovative and more an industry platform.

236
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.839 
We compiled some of the first learnings from our first project in a

237
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.179 
small booklet called The Founders Handbook.

238
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.507 
You can download it on the website, the URL is there.

239
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.660 
And let's go through some of the major findings here.

240
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:12.309 
Always have a look at the blockchain Fit and the blockchain

241
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:16.959 
Fit should not be, our projects should not be started by a want to do something

242
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960 
with blockchain.

243
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.629 
Please pick a business problem and please pick a business problem, which is not only

244
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.579 
your problem, you should have multiple parties sharing the same problem

245
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.149 
and looking for a solution among multiple parties.

246
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:36.649 
So it's best applied when there's friction across multiple parties

247
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:41.239 
and every party can benefit when this problem is solved.

248
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.579 
How to find that, so if you identify the business problems which are on

249
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.319 
the list to be solved, then have a look of at which of them can

250
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.360 
be solved with today's technologies, not with blockchain,

251
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.519 
because then go that way

252
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:07.139 
blockchain as a decentralized, distributed system and has some

253
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.069 
complexity if you don't need that complexity.

254
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.420 
So go your way.

255
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:19.169 
It's best when there's an identifiable business network where

256
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.639 
we can find participants, the assets and the transactions

257
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.499 
and what other technologies usually cannot provide,

258
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.959 
and which blockchain is here for, if there's a need for trust

259
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.429 
in your business problem, you need a consensus among multiple parties, you need

260
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.899 
immutability, you need finality in

261
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.519 
terms of having transaction confirmations or you need a provenance

262
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.454 
information because that's building a blockchain.

263
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.369 
So, blockchain is a team player, and a total of the benefits

264
00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.979 
is greater than the sum of its parts and what we can recommend

265
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.579 
is "Start Small Dream Big and Act

266
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:11.039 
Incrementally" when going your blockchain use case,

267
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.229 
and we can assure you that in our projects,

268
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:22.079 
80 percent of the problems are not technical because it's a lot about collaboration,

269
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.549 
it's a lot about governance, finding common rules, finding common

270
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:31.859 
implementations, how to solve it together and consulting us

271
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.419 
is a very important way, a new way to collaborate between

272
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:42.209 
enterprises and always have in mind motivation drives the momentum.

273
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.769 
Everybody who is participating has to benefit from that

274
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.519 
solution and you have to rebalance that over time.

275
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.469 
Think of it, if new participants are on board, or if some participants

276
00:20:55.470 --> 00:21:00.059 
leave, always check if the motivation and the benefit for

277
00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.679 
both the parties are still there.

278
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.499 
Now, some predictions and some reflections about

279
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.969 
blockchain adoption. So in the past years, we did a

280
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.469 
lot of proof of concepts that did not go into production, but there is

281
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:22.539 
a decline in proof of concepts. So, the people are convinced

282
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.039 
that blockchain is capable of doing certain things very good

283
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.989 
and they rely on proof of concept which other enterprises or organizations

284
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.319 
that are not doing their own proof of concept.

285
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.049 
So, we see a decline in concepts.

286
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:43.479 
But what we see today is the forming of platforms, a distilling

287
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.919 
of best practices, forming of

288
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.249 
standards of gravity.

289
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.149 
So there's a lot of change going

290
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.289 
on. And what is the task of the future?

291
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:04.029 
A lot of organizations are working on standards and governance

292
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.030 
rules.

293
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.749 
Working on forming consortiums and

294
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:15.639 
we see that people are already thinking about how to connect

295
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.139 
the blockchain network, so we will have a network of networks

296
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.390 
and this is what we expect to happen in the coming years.

297
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:31.309 
Also, what we are expecting to come, IBM researchers working

298
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:36.049 
on so-called Crypto-anchors - so, you can't have physical

299
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:40.909 
things on a blockchain because it's digital, you always have to process a digital twin

300
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.349 
and you have to ensure that the digital twin and the physical reality

301
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.879 
is as good reflected so they are

302
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.279 
not going to waste.

303
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.959 
So, IBM Research is working on having

304
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.849 
Crypto-anchors, which can ensure that the product is

305
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.375 
original and fights

306
00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.879 
against counterfeiters, against copying ideas and

307
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.210 
you can trace and prove the origin

308
00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.899 
of physical things and connected to the blockchain.

309
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.170 
So there will be best friends in the upcoming years.

310
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:28.029 
A common question raised is about blockchain and GDPR.

311
00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:32.435 
So, the recommendations are quite simple,

312
00:23:34.093 --> 00:23:38.679 
the EU Blockchain Forum issued a report last

313
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.359 
October saying avoid storing personal

314
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.189 
data on a blockchain, starting off chain hash item.

315
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:52.690 
And our recommendation is that it's most easily implemented

316
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.209 
both in private and permission blockchain.

317
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.119 
So read the full report.

318
00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.710 
The URL is here on the slide.

319
00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:06.259 
And about emerging standards, standards are being formed currently.

320
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.420 
ISO has formed a technical committee 307

321
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.059 
already two years ago.

322
00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:18.339 
We are working and I'm standing as an expert into German

323
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.449 
standardization and working with ISO on that.

324
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.529 
So, there's a working group on foundations who are working on a glossary,

325
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.608 
on a taxonomy and ontology and on a reference architecture in the

326
00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.240 
foundation's workings group.

327
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.019 
We are describing use cases.

328
00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.489 
There is a working group on smart contracts and applications, having

329
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:47.829 
a technical report on which smart contract functionality

330
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:48.970 
do we see around.

331
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:55.089 
Working on a technical specification on smart contracts with a legally

332
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:59.379 
binding intention making a checklist for programmers.

333
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:04.239 
What do you consider if you want to have legally binding

334
00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.979 
contracts on the blockchain and as a working group on

335
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.779 
governance and of course, a working group on security, privacy,

336
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.399 
and cryptography because those are the key technologies

337
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.024 
used in the context of a blockchain.

338
00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.139 
So, we will publish the first standards

339
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.299 
this year if we meet our plans.

340
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.065 
So, stay tuned and look into the website for what's going on.

341
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.849 
So, this was my overview, I hope you liked it and

342
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.759 
hope to see you in the blockchain space

343
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.969 
implementing a solution for your business problem.

344
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.459 
Thank you very much. Bye bye.

Hi my name is Mathias and today I would like to invite you

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.390 
to our free course sustainable software engineering.

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.840 
In this course we will show how the two maybe most important

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.100 
topics of our society today which is digitalisation and climate change

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.790 
can be combined for the good for instance by using digital

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.490 
tools to save co two emissions. On the other hand digitalisation

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.270 
also causes CO2 emissions which will go into as well.

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.460 
Throughout the course will cover all relevant roles in the

9
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.640 
context of sustainable soft engineering,

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.840 
developers architects and so on and we will take each roles

11
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.730 
perspective on the subject. Finally we will also show how to practically apply methods

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.700 
to save co two in our relevant context of software engineering, also using

13
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.670 
programming examples. So to successfully complete the course

14
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.420 
fundamentals of programming in Python are mandatory.

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.660 
At the very end of the course you will have a good and even practical understanding

16
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
to do a software engineering in a sustainable way yourself.

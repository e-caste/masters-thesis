00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.370 
Welcome to the second week of our
openHPI course about digital identities.

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.920 
Digital Identities - Who
am I on the Internet?

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.030 
And the topic of the second
week is identity theft.

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.280 
So the theft of digital identities is
really serious and we want to start

5
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.240 
to discuss what kind of
attacks are possible

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.410 
and how we can
protect us.

7
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.520 
When we speak about
identities, you remember,

8
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.880 
on the internet we can use internet
services and its resources

9
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.800 
by means of our digital identity.
Digital identities is a set of data

10
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.320 
which helps to connect
a physical person

11
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
or an object with
a digital acting

12
00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.520 
person with a digital identity. So this
is the way how the service provider

13
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.220 
can connect resources and usages
of the data or its services to

14
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.360 
a physical person by means
of the digital identity.

15
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.280 
If we are authenticated,
that means, if the service

16
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.830 
or its ID provider is convinced that
the digital identity belongs to us

17
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.980 
then we can use
the service.

18
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.190 
But it's a very big problem if a
third party comes into possession

19
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.120 
of a user's
digital identity.

20
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.210 
Then this third party, the attacker
can use all services,

21
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.530 
can use all the resources that are
provided by the services in

22
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.170 
the users name for which the
user is authenticated. For example

23
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.240 
in case of an online shopping
service, a bank transfer or

24
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.520 
to watch videos.

25
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.820 
In the physical world it's
much more difficult.

26
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.500 
Unlike physical identities it's
relatively easy to steal and to abuse

27
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.170 


28
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.120 
digital identities. Digital
identities, you remember, this was a set

29
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.060 
of data that
characterize a person.

30
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.290 
Due to a high potential of
abuse, identity theft is very

31
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.590 
attractive to
cyber criminals.

32
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.480 
With stolen digital identity,
cybercriminals get all rights,

33
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.770 
all authorisation of
the rightful owner.

34
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.530 
Since internet service is authorised on the
basis of the digital identity alone,

35
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.600 
only on the basis of
the digital identity,

36
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.350 
thieves can use the service at the
expense of the rightful owner.

37
00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.060 
And this could be very important
services. So it could be a

38
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.180 
real problem if the digital identity
of a user which is characterized

39
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.810 
but such type of
data, if this

40
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.540 
comes into the hand
of an attacker. How

41
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.910 
attacker get access to
such identity data?

42
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.290 
There are different ways. For example
the attacker can steal

43
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.450 
the account database or the customer
database of an internet service.

44
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.670 
In this database
there is

45
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.130 
the digital identities stored
of a user, of all the users,

46
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.580 
and some information that's important
for the service to serve the users

47
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.860 
in a personally
liked way.

48
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.300 
So cyber criminals
can get access to

49
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.690 
this database when they are able
to get access to the system

50
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.070 
of an online service provider. For example
by break in or by misusing malware.

51
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.890 
So if they have the chance to
get access to the provider system

52
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.140 
then they can simply copy the database
from the provider's authentication system

53
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.090 
and then the attacker gets all
the identity data of the user

54
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.310 
of the service
in their hand.

55
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.390 
Often these attacks are executed
by so called SQL injections.

56
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.730 
It's not the place here
to go into more detail.

57
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.360 
The data theft it can be
done by means of malware.

58
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.720 
Malware is malicious software.

59
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.970 
There are different ways
to smuggle malware

60
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.660 
to the website of a user. For example
the malware informs of so called spyware.

61
00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.500 
Spyware, this is malicious software
that collects data directly

62
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.970 
from the user's
computer,

63
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.240 
of particular interest, identity
data. So when the user puts in

64
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.840 
its username password combination, then
by means of such spyware the attacker

65
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.050 
can get access to this information.
For example by means of keyloggers.

66
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.830 
Keyloggers, these are small malicious
software system that read data,

67
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.340 
and in particular the
thefts are interested

68
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.130 
in passwords, directly when entering and
transmitting them to the cybercriminals.

69
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.780 
So when the data
are typed in

70
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:51.250 
to the keyboard, then this software
records this data and transmits

71
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.120 
it to the cybercriminals. This is the
second way how it is possible for

72
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.450 
cybercriminals to get
access to identity data

73
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:09.810 
from services or from user. Another
way to get access to identity data

74
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.190 
is phishing, are
phishing attacks.

75
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.140 
In the case of phishing users are lured
in good faith to a malicious website

76
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:26.370 
that falsify claims to be a
legitimate site. For example the

77
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.610 
user gets an email

78
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.700 
from the service of
his bank, the service

79
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.320 
claims that a log-in
is needed to do

80
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.080 
some update
or some other

81
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.230 
technical activities and then
there is a link presented to the

82
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.790 
user. The iser is not thinking
and not looking carefully,

83
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:58.110 
push this link and got to a website
that looks very very similar to the

84
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:04.040 
bank's website but it isn't. And
the user sees the log in site

85
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.250 
of his bank, so he gives in his user
data, he gives in his user name and

86
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.870 
his password and then

87
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.340 
enters it but the data are not
sent and collected by his bank.

88
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.020 
The data are on this malicious website
and collected by the cybercriminals.

89
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.410 
So the phishing
attack is to

90
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:34.860 
lure users in good faith that they
believe, yes it's the right website

91
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.550 
from the bankers.

92
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:48.120 
And then social networks and
forums provide a lot of information,

93
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.730 
also identity data
from the user.

94
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:58.010 
So the users often pose all data about
themself, including identity data,

95
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:05.150 
including name of very personal
sensitive data in such social networks

96
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.100 
like facebook or
twitter or others.

97
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:14.600 
And anyone registered at those
platforms can then view all those

98
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.850 
identity data and
can steal it.

99
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:27.000 
Another way how attackers can
get access to identity

100
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.370 
data and can steal identity data is
the theft or the loss of data media.

101
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.680 
So for example the storages of
personal data are not correctly

102
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.410 
protected against physical attacks.
So someone is able to steal

103
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.760 
the USB stick or to
get access to the

104
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.010 
to the laptop or to the tablet
of a user and can take out

105
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.940 
personal identity data from that.

106
00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:00.440 
Also people lose their
smartphone with all the

107
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.660 
personal data or a laptop
gets stolen or others.

108
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.100 
So all this
provide ways.

109
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.790 
I also have to mention social
engineering. Social engineering is

110
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:20.230 
manipulation of individuals to disclose
sensitive data like identity data.

111
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.130 
So all this helps
to get attackers,

112
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.510 
the attackers can get
such digital identities

113
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.650 
in their hand and later
misuse these identities.

114
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:40.870 
And it's a real problem. And this is
shown by some security incidents,

115
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.480 
analysis reports which are
published in the internet.

116
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.060 
So there are numbers available
from different sources. One

117
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.780 
says that in two thousand
nineteen, thirty thousand

118
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.600 
security breaks

119
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:05.580 
were registered. About
four thousand confirmed that

120
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.520 
during these data
breaks,

121
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.130 
identity data are stolen.

122
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.070 
The most common attacks which are
used by attackers to attack the system

123
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.960 
of users or to attack systems
of the service provider is

124
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.370 
Denial-of-Service.
So that is

125
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.890 
only to disturb the real work
of the service or the people.

126
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.760 
But second is phishing.
Phishing, so it's

127
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:42.290 
already mentioned social engineering
attack which brings users to,

128
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.990 
brings the user that they
present their identity data

129
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.840 
to people they trust but
people that misuse that trust.

130
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.560 
And social
engineering. Here is

131
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.690 
another statistic which tells that
the most common hacking attacks

132
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:07.550 
are the usage of stolen access
data. And this is exactly the

133
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.190 
this is exactly the misuse
of stolen identity data.

134
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:20.260 
There are other attacks which are very popular.
So there is advantage of software vulnerabilities,

135
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.950 
exploiting some failures in
protocols or in software systems

136
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:32.190 
and the use of actors which give
attackers a possibility to access

137
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.770 
a system on an irregular way.
But the most important is,

138
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.010 
the most common
hacking attack is

139
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.010 
to steal digital
identities.

140
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.970 
Most common malware attacks are
e-mailing direct installation

141
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:54.030 
of malware or download by
malware. This is to prepare,

142
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.370 
such kind of attacks are misused,
are used by the attackers

143
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:05.490 
to prepare such an identity theft
in many cases. And the most common

144
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.820 
social engineering attacks
or attacks which

145
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.940 
attacks a human in a way to
force him to do something

146
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:20.170 
for several reason is phishing,
is a fake pretext and others.

147
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.390 
If you want to know whether
your identity data

148
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:32.050 
got stolen then we can provide
a service to you from HPI.

149
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:38.980 
It is free, this is the
link - https://sec.hpi.de.

150
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:46.690 
Then you come to such a website
which helps you to check whether your

151
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.950 
digital identity is
published in the internet.

152
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.580 
Because often the attacker publish
their leaks, the identity leaks

153
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:05.500 
to start, to trade it with other
people or to claim they are

154
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.760 
the best and powerful. So there

155
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:13.780 
are several motivation. And over the
years it is terrible what we found out.

156
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:21.190 
We found that there are twelve billion, more
than twelve billion identity data that

157
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.370 
got stolen and are published in
the open internet. We are not

158
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.360 
speaking about the dark internet, we
are speaking about the internet.

159
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.090 
These data are
available there,

160
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.780 
identity remember is the name, is the address,
is the bank account, insurance number,

161
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:45.390 
is the password, the email address. So all
what's needed to use the service.

162
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:52.190 
And coming back to our identity leak
checker service, here one can type in

163
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:56.020 
an email address. Because each
of these digital identities

164
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.320 
contains an email address, because this is a
way a service communicates with the people.

165
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:07.830 
So we ask you or we offer you the
possibility to type in your

166
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.430 
email address and
then we will check in

167
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:18.030 
this twelve billion leaked identity
data we will check whether there

168
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.380 
are, or your identity
belongs to this.

169
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.290 
So the service collects

170
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:31.030 
such leaked user and identity databases
which are published in the internet

171
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:37.140 
and we provide a search service. So
we have to normalize the data

172
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.850 
so that the search service can
work and you simply have to

173
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.190 
enter your email address because
this is part of identity

174
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.810 
and then we can find the complete
digital identity which is

175
00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:55.990 
connected to this email
address and we can warn you.

176
00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:00.890 
So the idea is to send the report
with the checked results.

177
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:08.230 
This is sent to the provider email
address. So the address, the

178
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:13.790 
email that's put in here gets our
report and the report says no,

179
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:19.500 
we could not find your data then you
can be happy. Or the report says

180
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:26.280 
be careful we found your data for example
with financial context or another context.

181
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:32.060 
We do not send exactly the
information of the digital identity

182
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:38.180 
so that also hacker cannot misuse
this, and then we advise you to

183
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.970 
change your passwords

184
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:45.150 
because when you change your
password then your identity data

185
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.660 
can no more be misused.

186
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.360 
What's interesting is,
on the basis of this

187
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:58.160 
service, we can also provide
some password statistics.

188
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.010 
Because many of the passwords
of these data services

189
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:11.150 
are not hashed, not encrypted and so
we can check them and can make

190
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.550 
top lists and others.

191
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.470 
So here are some
statistics

192
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.360 
on identity
theft. We can

193
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:29.470 
do on the basis of the collected
leaked identity data.

194
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.810 
We started the online service in May
two thousand fourteen. At the

195
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.360 
beginning it was an activity
to warn our students

196
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.480 
that their

197
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.210 
identities cannot be misused
and then we become aware that

198
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.810 
this question is not only interesting
and important for our students, but for

199
00:16:52.060 --> 00:17:00.190 
everyone because typically one does not
know whether the own identity data

200
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.870 
with one service got
stolen from that service.

201
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.380 
Up to now, I mentioned already more than
twelve billion stored identities

202
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.910 
we could find within more
than a thousand leaks.

203
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:21.420 
Fifteen point three million requests
we got in our service and

204
00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:26.050 
we gave almost four million
people's information.

205
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:32.020 
Be careful, your identity data
is published on the internet.

206
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:39.570 
Everyone can access this and everyone
can misuse this because in many cases

207
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:46.590 
the password is published in
clear text and not encrypted as

208
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.300 
it should be if the service
works in the correct way.

209
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.690 
So the leaked users, the leaked identity
data published on the internet

210
00:17:54.970 --> 00:18:01.260 
vary in size. Therefore we have to
normalize them before we can start our

211
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:06.290 
search service. They vary
in size and in type because

212
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.550 
for a financial service
other data are collected

213
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:16.300 
inside a digital identity then
for example with a shopping or

214
00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:24.890 
teaching website. What we found is more
than three thousand identity leaks

215
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.730 
with millions of credentials

216
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.160 
that have not been normalised
yet. So we do this piece by piece,

217
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:40.140 
because every month there is a huge
amount of such identity data

218
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.870 
which are newly published
in the internet.

219
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.360 
Here are some motivations
for the attacker

220
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.360 
to publish such a database,
such identity

221
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.210 
data collections and
such identity theft.

222
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:07.010 
That is the motivation to prove and to prove
reputation. Cybercriminals want to show

223
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.590 
that they are able
to steal such data,

224
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.020 
the captured data is publicly posed
on the internet as evidence

225
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.420 
that a service has been hacked
or that the attacker is such

226
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.210 
a professional to be able to get
access to such data. And of

227
00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.510 
course another important
motivation is profit.

228
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.600 
So such identity data
can be sold profitably

229
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:38.420 
on the black market and because
everyone who has such data

230
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:44.270 
in hand can use or can
use these data to

231
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:51.650 
misuse a service or to do other criminal
activities, for example sending spam,

232
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:58.150 
debiting of financial services,
the use of false identity in case

233
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:03.780 
of a service. Then hacktivism is
motivation for such identity theft.

234
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:10.850 
Some people want to claim that they do it
for political or for ideological goals

235
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.520 
and that they have to
fight for it and then

236
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:23.400 
use the data to damage the reputation of
the victim, of a service, of the company

237
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:30.570 
which they prove to have stolen
their data. For example Anonymous

238
00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:37.390 
is such a group which works in that
way. And then revenge is the reason.

239
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.530 
So someone feels to be
wrongly treated. So

240
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:48.170 
it wants to take back revenge by stealing
and publishing personal details

241
00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.280 
of this person he feels

242
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.240 
approached. So this are very
different motivations which

243
00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.610 
lead to the fact that stolen
identity data are stolen and

244
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.410 
published in
the internet.

245
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.080 
So let's summarize our sayings
about identity theft.

246
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.310 
Identity theft means that an
attacker takes over the digital

247
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.870 
identity of a user.

248
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:29.610 
And when he is able to do this, so he or she
can use all the services or resources

249
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.430 
for which the user's
identity is authorized.

250
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:39.310 
The more information attacker
has about his victim,

251
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.860 
the easier is it for him to
abuse his digital identity.

252
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.400 
So many of this information
also can be guessed.

253
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:54.080 
So be careful, think twice before
you publish something about you

254
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.140 
in the internet.

255
00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.930 
Attackers have various
possibilities to

256
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:06.970 
steal such access or to steal such
identity data, for example by

257
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:12.100 
theft of a password database, by
malware attacks, by phishing

258
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.490 
and other social engineering attacks,
by analyzing social networks and

259
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.340 
by theft of data media.

260
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.400 
So identity theft is a real serious
problem and we will consider

261
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.520 
in this week more
details about it.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.510 
In this video, we want to
dive together with you into

2
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.320 
the question of 'Why
space matters?'

3
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.610 
Space matters specifically for the organization
as a key driver of productivity.

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.810 
But even more importantly, it also drives
the satisfaction of your employees

5
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.810 
because they would rather prefer to work
in an organization that offers them

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.200 
a good work environment that helps
them to collaborate easily

7
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.700 
with each other and also drives their
thinking and working forward.

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.330 
Unfortunately, most of the office
spaces we know and see nowadays

9
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.240 
don't have these qualities. We
have lots of single offices,

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.090 
lots of hallways, closed doors,
not much natural light. When

11
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.510 
it comes specifically to people working
in the field of knowledge, innovation,

12
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.590 
and design, that's not the
environment they're looking for.

13
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.010 
To find an organization they want
to work with, identify with,

14
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.300 
and also create something with. So,
therefore, it makes absolute sense to

15
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.870 
consider the space not just as an expression
of who you are as an organization,

16
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.910 
your culture, but also as an
expression of what kind of work

17
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.370 
which flows, what kind of processes you
have been establishing in the past.

18
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.490 
So, therefore, space not only matters
because it expresses your identity,

19
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.750 
but it's also a way 'how you can
shape whom you do want to become

20
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.440 
as an organization in the future.
When we do look at the space

21
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.220 
in years in organizations, we
have found out in our research

22
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.070 
e.g. that 1/3rd of the space
potential is unused,

23
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.780 
specifically for knowledge workers.
And that is crucial because

24
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.340 
obviously the space doesn't
enable the people to fully

25
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.270 
tap into their creative and
innovative potential.

26
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.110 
In order to address this as an
opportunity for change, lots of

27
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.360 
organizations have started to change
from single office workplaces

28
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.430 
to more open environments.
Including e.g. hot desk

29
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.620 
policy, where you whenever you
come in the morning can pick

30
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.900 
a workplace place where you want to
work for an hour or the whole day.

31
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.520 
That's already a good starting
point, but it makes sense to

32
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.840 
take it a step further to also start
offering innovation labs, specific

33
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.860 
work zones dedicated to creative
and collaborative teamwork.

34
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.570 
Unfortunately, when companies are doing this
kind of interventions and strategic changes,

35
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.410 
they typically pick an example
that I have seen somewhere else.

36
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.250 
The creative work-play environment
at Google's and Facebook's,

37
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.010 
and just copy that and then
wonder why this is not working

38
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.880 
for them in their
organization.

39
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.110 
So, therefore, there is much more
in this field besides just

40
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.050 
having a playful environment.
That means trying to actually

41
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.360 
create a strategic approach of
making that change happen. Because

42
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.070 
you don't just want to be playful
as google, you want to be

43
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.210 
as innovative as you can get. And that means
you have to create your own approach

44
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.420 
in that field and you also have to
develop your own understanding

45
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.130 
and your own vision of what's actually
the future of the workplace.

46
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.540 
And the future of the workplace does
not only include the analogue

47
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.400 
workspace, but also how to
integrate teams, departments,

48
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.690 
areas of your organization that
are spread all over the world

49
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.590 
or just around the corner. And this
is what we want to further dive

50
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.890 
into in the rest
of our module.

00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.810 
In our openHPI course "Blockchain:
Revealing the Myth", now we consider

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.430 
how one can pay
with bitcoin.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.010 
And speaking about that,

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.890 
we have first to see how this new
currency, this crypto currency

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.290 
come to the world, where

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.140 
the first bitcoins
were mined.

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.410 
So if we have already learned new
coins entered the system through

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.410 
coinbase transactions,

9
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.240 
it means that the first coins
came from coinbase transactions

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.320 
of the first block.

11
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.860 
And this first block meanwhile
is called the genesis block.

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.900 
Let us have a look to
this transaction.

13
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.690 
So the coinbase
transaction

14
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.180 
the block reward
for creating a block

15
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.910 
in form of newly mined bitcoins
started at fifty bitcoins.

16
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.870 
And I already mentioned that it's being
halved every two hundred thousand

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.210 
ten blocks. This is approximately
once every four years.

18
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.220 
So today it start two thousand
eight and today this amount is a

19
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.230 
half half halved
up to six point

20
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.640 
twenty five bitcoins.

21
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.680 
Thus the first coinbase transaction
came from block zero and this

22
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.210 
consisted of fifty bitcoins BTC,
and no transaction fee because

23
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.150 
up to this moment there
were no transactions.

24
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.270 
This block was created on third
January 2009. So

25
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.530 
with each new block which was
created every ten minutes,

26
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.110 
then the last bitcoin will be mined around
the year two thousand one hundred forty.

27
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.630 
Some people see that this fixed
amount of bitcoin is something

28
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.500 
what led surprise in
increasing so fast

29
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.190 
of the bitcoins. So this
is an estimation which

30
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.170 
you remember as ten minutes came that
was a gap between the creation of

31
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.050 
new new blocks and it was
triggered by the target

32
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.550 
which set the

33
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.470 
how difficult it is to provide proof
of work and it's adjusted

34
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.590 
in such a way that's about
ten minutes needed

35
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.110 
and on the basis of such an
calculation, it is clear that the

36
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.300 
last bitcoin
can be mined

37
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.440 
mined around year 2140.

38
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.490 
The block zero, the genesis block like
numerous subsequent blocks

39
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.910 
consisted of only
one transaction.

40
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.270 
Of only one transaction, this
was the coinbase transaction.

41
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.030 
Here is block zero block zero that was
with the timestamp first January

42
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.810 
two thousand nine, at twenty fifteen.
It consists only of one transaction

43
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.140 
and the block reward was

44
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.780 
fifty bitcoins.
And this was a

45
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.770 
block that was
formed by

46
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.080 
Satoshi Nakamoto.

47
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.900 
Let's have a closer look to
this block with the number 0.

48
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
This is the moment when the first
bitcoin, the first ever minted bitcoins

49
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.660 
occur and come to the
world. There is the

50
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:18.260 
address to the public key of
Satoshi Nakamoto, this was the

51
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.390 
person, in this case it's not clear
whether it's a person or it's a group,

52
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.320 
this is the first
one knows

53
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.830 
who it is who is behind
this public key,

54
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.070 
because for the other

55
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.720 
participants of the
bitcoin network,

56
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
the hash of the public key cannot be
assigned to a person. So in case of

57
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.530 
the first block zero, it is clear
that this here is a public key,

58
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.160 
a hash of the public key
from a Satoshi Nakamoto

59
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.290 
and the money, the fifty bitcoin
were unspent, were free to use.

60
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.770 
If you imagine that you
are the owner of these bitcoins

61
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.170 
so you can once generate a key pair in
two thousand and nine and gave hash

62
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.290 
of your public
key to Satoshi,

63
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.090 
and then you are
the owner of

64
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.270 
fifty bitcoins.

65
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.400 
This would mean that you own the fifty
bitcoins which you would like this.

66
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.500 
These are the bitcoins.

67
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.650 
This is the hash value of the
block with that transaction.

68
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.560 
So really it looks very different
what we have in mind when

69
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.470 
we think two coins. It is cryptographic,
it is hash values it is cryptographic

70
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.180 
values. Correct, this is the hash
of the first transaction.

71
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.560 
This is also called the
transaction ID, the TXID.

72
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.720 
If you would be the owner, then you could
create a new transaction and transfer

73
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:25.070 
this fifty bitcoins by adding the
public key hash of the new recipient

74
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.870 
and signing the transaction
with your private key.

75
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:36.180 
So by sending amount means
to see the receiver,

76
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.820 
to take its public key,

77
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.520 
to compute the hash and this is
the recipient of the amount

78
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.850 
that you spend to
transfer to him.

79
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.850 
Here comes a definition of bitcoin.
It's the definition of bitcoin

80
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.000 
coming from Satoshi Nakamoto
in the already mentioned paper.

81
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.690 
We define an electronic coin as
a chain of digital signatures.

82
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.340 
Each owner transfers
the coin to the next

83
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.460 
by digitally
signing a hash

84
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.530 
of the previous transaction and
public key of the next owner

85
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
and adding this to the end of the
coin. So coins are sequences

86
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.770 
of digital signatures.

87
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.510 
What is the average
transaction per block?

88
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.870 
Only around november
two thousand ten

89
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.570 
this was after about eighty
eight thousand nine hundred blocks

90
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.530 
did the number of transactions
per block start to increase

91
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.440 
continuously.

92
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.120 
So one year almost
nothing happened

93
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:11.950 
and then in november of the next
year in november two thousand ten,

94
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.540 
after about ninety thousand blocks
then the number of transactions

95
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.670 
exploded. Here
you can see this.

96
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.090 
In the beginning there were
a lot of empty blocks,

97
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.220 
there were blocks inside
this designer community

98
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.830 
with some cryptographic people
to motivate them, to

99
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.100 
make some investigations in the
system but then people start

100
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.610 
to trust in this
new crypto

101
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.900 
currency and you see here
the number of transactions

102
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.790 
was increasing. So
this block 88,900

103
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.120 
if we have a closer
look to this block

104
00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:04.240 
it is here then we see that it's
something like an ownership register.

105
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.670 
Here are the
different owners

106
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.680 
and here are described
the different owners

107
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.110 
the hash value of
the public key

108
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.970 
they used in that time

109
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.540 
and the amount of
bitcoins

110
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.310 
which belong to it. And as we
see in all transactions,

111
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.590 
except the coinbase transaction,
that is the first

112
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.100 
this is a given to the

113
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.070 
producer to the generator
of that block,

114
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:44.190 
certain amounts of bitcoins are
overwritten from one owner to another.

115
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:49.740 
So one can spend money
or coins as one likes.

116
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.600 
Let's take an example.

117
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.750 
Let's take an example and imagine you want
to pay a coffee with your bitcoins.

118
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.120 
You have in mind a bitcoin meanwhile
is forty thousand euro value

119
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:13.130 
but in the beginning one motivation
for establishing such a system was

120
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.450 
that it is easy also to

121
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:27.620 
exchange very small amounts of
bitcoins. So how this works?

122
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.150 
Assume currently you
have fifty bitcoins

123
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.120 
you get from Satoshi. If we take
our example from the beginning

124
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.210 
and according to the
current exchange rate

125
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.340 
it is almost two
million dollars.

126
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:50.690 
To allow this value
to split and combined

127
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:56.360 
the transaction contains
multiple inputs and outputs.

128
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.840 
One transaction
can contain

129
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.490 
several inputs and several outputs.
Normally there will be either

130
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.860 
a single input from a larger
previous transaction,

131
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.150 
or multiple inputs
combining smaller amounts

132
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.260 
and at most two outputs -
one for the payment

133
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.990 
and one for returning
the change

134
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.330 
back to the sender. The
change if any is available.

135
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.200 
Because we have

136
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.450 
huge amounts by bitcoin,

137
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.090 
it is either that we have an
amount and can spend something

138
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.220 
or that we take

139
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:48.670 
several amounts coming in
to have a larger amount that is

140
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.690 
that we want to transfer
to a receiver and

141
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.460 
it is not exactly fitting like in the
case of coins of physical coins,

142
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:04.570 
we need to get something back
and this is one

143
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.480 
of the outputs.

144
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.500 
If this difference is not
transferred back to the sender,

145
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.020 
then this is considered a transaction
fee. Remember with the

146
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.040 
coinbase, in transactions in
coinbase transaction of a block

147
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:27.340 
as well as a transaction fees.
So if it's a small amount,

148
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:34.360 
then the sender does not insist
to getting it back, then it's

149
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.060 
considered as a transaction fee
and goes over to the creater of

150
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.260 
the block that contains
this transaction.

151
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.260 
But if it's a larger amount then there
is an output to send this amount back

152
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.580 
to give the change
back to the sender.

153
00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:00.080 
So your transaction with the coffee
would look like as following -

154
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.640 
here are your
fifty bitcoins,

155
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.100 
your signature and there are
two outputs. The one output is

156
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.180 
for the coffee shop. So it is 0.00005

157
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:21.860 
bitcoins and this is
sent to the public

158
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:28.640 
key which is the
public key of the coffee shop

159
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.770 
which is hashed. This is the
addressee of this output

160
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:38.690 
and this output is sending
the spending back,

161
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.560 
the 49.9999

162
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.720 
to your address and your
address is your public key

163
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.950 
and the hash
value of this.

164
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.870 
In that case, if we
have multiple outputs

165
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.990 
the hash of the transaction itself
will not be enough for us

166
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.020 
to continue using the
bitcoins sent back to us.

167
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.710 
For this reason we
need an output index

168
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.870 
that points to the output in which
we send forty nine point nine

169
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.970 
bitcoins back to us.

170
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:24.880 
So if you already have spent your
forty nine point nine nine bitcoins,

171
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:31.420 
used the hash of the sample transaction
and the index of your output

172
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.990 
in the input of a
new transaction,

173
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:40.460 
then you can
get it back. And this

174
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:48.900 
money is this bitcoins UTXO is
the unspent transaction output,

175
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:56.390 
this is the bitcoins
which you didn't spend up

176
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:01.120 
to now and that you can
use to pay for others.

177
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.180 
So if you have already
spent then this is not

178
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.330 
and the coffee shop has still
not used their

179
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.410 
0.00005 bitcoins.
So is these are unspent.

180
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.190 
So here you see what is, what could
be spent and what is not spent.

181
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:27.400 
And the unspent transaction
output, the UTXO,

182
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:33.040 
this is the amount that can still
be spent, one calls it

183
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.260 
for that reason one calls this
unspent transaction output.

184
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.800 
To have a closer
look to

185
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:48.230 
such transactions - so when a
transaction is checked whether

186
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:54.830 
it's a valid transaction, it needs
to find out whether the amount

187
00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:00.410 
is whether the amount
was unspent up to now.

188
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.010 
Such a transaction is considered, such
a UTXO is considered valid

189
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:12.380 
if it has been included in a block that
already has at least five successors.

190
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:20.740 
The reason is here it can find out that
there was already other spendings, so

191
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:23.420 
after only
after a while

192
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.630 
five blocks its about one
hour, after one hour

193
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:36.470 
its considered as valid. It's
considered that really this amount

194
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.550 
can be spent to go to
any other recipient

195
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.420 
for a service to pay a
service or other things.

196
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:50.350 
Why five successors? This number was
determined based on the assumption

197
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.880 
that potential attackers do not
have enough computing power

198
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.900 
or want not to spend it
to recalculate

199
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:05.800 
these six blocks, because
for each, this is one hour

200
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:11.900 
huge computational resources
needed that have to be

201
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:18.170 
invested to manipulate here
something, for example to

202
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.570 
change it as money
that already spent.

203
00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:30.090 
If we summarize what we have seen
then electronic coins are chains,

204
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:35.410 
bitcoins are chains of
digital signatures

205
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.590 
that become longer and
longer and that are a

206
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.270 
part of transactions
and that can be

207
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.020 
can be spent to
any things.

208
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:57.970 
Only the UTXOs counts as valid. Only these
transactions which spent bitcoins

209
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.060 
that are not
used for other

210
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.980 
transactions before. And

211
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.930 
such a transaction
can be valid after

212
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:18.310 
five blocks additional five blocks were
generated and accepted by the network.

213
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.970 
It is important that the user
sufficiently protect their private key,

214
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.960 
because the private key

215
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.740 
who owns the private key or who
has access to the private key

216
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.150 
is allowed to trade with the values
bound to it, more specifically

217
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:46.670 
to the public key hash address
comparable to physical currency.

218
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:53.080 
So the private key needs to be
really secret only for the user

219
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.740 
because this is
used to sign

220
00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:03.820 
transactions and this to sign
UTXOs and this way they are

221
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:09.800 
coins in this bitcoin, in
this bitcoin universe.

222
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:18.160 
So this was another piece of the complex
bitcoin system which has told us

223
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.750 
how transaction
can be done

224
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:27.850 
with this crypto
currency with the bitcoins.

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.522 
What makes for an entrepreneurial team and what are key factors for successful

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.670 
entrepreneur teamwork?

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.150 
Each of us is experiencing teamwork in our everyday lives, and we know

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.890 
how difficult it can be to collaborate in a small group.

5
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.957 
This comes especially obvious when we rely on others to venture

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.143 
a new idea to market throughout the challenging stages of the entrepreneurial

7
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.289 
process we talked about earlier.

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.419 
Undoubtedly, the effectiveness of a founding team has substantial

9
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.046 
and lasting implications for the success of a startup, and it is essential

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.079 
to ask the right questions about effective teamwork early

11
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.649 
on. What are our shared goals?

12
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.849 
How do we lead each other?

13
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.959 
Do we care about our team climate and conflicts?

14
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.600 
Now, in this session, we will draw from the state of the science of entrepreneurship

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.369 
and organizational research to gain a deeper understanding of

16
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.260 
entrepreneurial teamwork.

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.040 
Welcome to this video on collaboration in entrepreneurship.

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.999 
My name is Katerina Hutzler and together with Robert Rosa, we will take

19
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.799 
a research perspective on teams and entrepreneurship.

20
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.304 
And there's a reason we are featuring teams when it comes to entrepreneurial

21
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.759 
collaboration. In fact, teams are the very work units where

22
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.379 
ideas are brought to life, where a unique combination of

23
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.000 
diverse contributions allows for addressing even the most complex issues.

24
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.830 
Individual entrepreneurs as well rely on social relationships to further their ideas,

25
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.749 
and even the most popularized lone entrepreneur has

26
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.889 
to at some point and still teams of experts to implement their vision.

27
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.980 
The collaboration of a few individuals, the synthesis of their various knowledge,

28
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.659 
skills, abilities and other characteristics allows

29
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.889 
for information and views to be put into prototypes and eventually

30
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.960 
to be transformed into innovative, marketable solutions.

31
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.267 
Consequently, entrepreneurship researchers are heavily invested

32
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.669 
in the study of entrepreneurial teams and their formation,

33
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.159 
but especially their effectiveness and contributing factors that enable

34
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.419 
individuals to successfully venture together.

35
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.374 
And while you will find many different labels for team based entrepreneurial

36
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.830 
efforts, for example, new venture teams, founding teams

37
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.089 
or startup teams, the underlying definition of any team still

38
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.407 
applies. The team involves two or more interdependent

39
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.550 
individuals that work towards a common goal.

40
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.759 
In the case of entrepreneurial teams, that common goal is the venture's future

41
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120 
and the success.

42
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.379 
Now, what makes for entrepeneur teams and how do they differ from other

43
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.020 
work teams? When looking for key determinants of team effectiveness,

44
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.892 
researchers usually differentiate first team processes and

45
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.245 
states so-called mediating mechanisms, for example, how

46
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.410 
team members share information or whether they trust each other.

47
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.569 
Second, structural features and third, compositional features

48
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.789 
for each. We will have a dedicated video where we talk about the aspects

49
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.330 
of virtual teamwork and team diversity more in-depth.

50
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.059 
So while these factors matter all that much for entrepreneurial teams as well,

51
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.199 
three further important key ingredients come into play based on an

52
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.659 
integrative review by Andrew Knight and his colleagues.

53
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.979 
First, the ownership of equity.

54
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.869 
That is the degree to which individual team members have a financial

55
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.870 
stake in the team's work.

56
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.379 
Across all facets of entrepreneurial teams, such as its teamwork,

57
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.849 
climate or teamwork quality, it is crucial how much

58
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.594 
equity is held by whom and how its distribution has been

59
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.209 
set up in the founding phase.

60
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.918 
According to a study by Nikola Boycott's and her colleagues, the perceived justice

61
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.290 
of equity distribution and an entrepreneurial team can either trigger

62
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.730 
positive or negative spirals of interactions in the team

63
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.311 
and ultimately lead to higher performance or even

64
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.880 
team member exits.

65
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.459 
Second, the Ptolemy of strategic decision making is a further

66
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.449 
defining dimension. This refers to the degree of independence

67
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.990 
that team members have when shaping the eventual strategic direction.

68
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.182 
Think of how leadership and authority can be differentiated within a

69
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.880 
team. It can range from one person holding all the authority

70
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.380 
to all team members, sharing decision making responsibilities and leadership.

71
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.600 
Most teams are in between and not just popular books tell us

72
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.744 
that it matters for any team's effectiveness, how we lead each other towards

73
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.850 
our goals.

74
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.519 
Organizational research on this topic is extensive and goes beyond

75
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.754 
the scope of this video. However, an important consideration is at

76
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.763 
which point the entrepreneurial team is an information process, how authority

77
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.329 
has been formalized and where it's coming from and from whom.

78
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.642 
Finally, the third dimension is called admittedly not very

79
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.069 
intuitive entity activity, referring to a definition by

80
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.839 
HOGGE and colleagues, this involves a team's boundaries, internal

81
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.379 
structure, common goals and common fate.

82
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.149 
Or to put it differently. It is what makes a group grouping

83
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.270 
for entrepreneurial teams. This dimension is important since there are

84
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.049 
usually many changes in team membership throughout the entrepreneurial process,

85
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.470 
which is what we call fluidity.

86
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.630 
For example, founding teams can remain as they are when the venture is

87
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.199 
growing, or they can also dissolve because one of the founders

88
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.160 
decides to run start a new venture.

89
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.269 
One founder prefers an expert role and becomes, for example, the head of product

90
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.889 
development. And just another founder joins from the

91
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.149 
outside because he has more managerial experience from the past.

92
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.911 
So to put it into perspective, the wealth of research teams

93
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.540 
can tell us much about entrepeneur teams when it comes to processes and states

94
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.309 
composition of features and structural features, we will follow up on this and other

95
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.860 
videos by providing more details for the topics of team diversity and

96
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.870 
virtual teamwork.

97
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.990 
Going beyond the insights that are relevant for team effectiveness in general,

98
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.119 
specifically important for entrepeneur teams is first how

99
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.689 
the ownership of equity is set up.

100
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.389 
Second, where the autonomy of strategic decision making is vested.

101
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.709 
And third was that the founders still represent a coherent team unit.

102
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.499 
Using this framework can help researchers to identify patterns and

103
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.709 
guide our thinking about what makes for an entrepreneur.

104
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.399 
We hope this first glimpse into the depth of research on team based collaboration

105
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.450 
and entrepreneurship could help to structure your thoughts on this.

106
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.871 
Rather extensive topic, and we do look forward to seeing you again in

107
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.100 
the next video.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.280 
Hey, this is our last video today.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.760 
We're done.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.880 
Unfortunately, unfortunately, well

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.560 
we had actually a very good
time here behind the table in

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.040 
communicating with you.

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.520 
And we hope that you had

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.840 
also a great time
during the last five weeks.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.000 
Yes,
and also, it was great to discuss with you

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.840 
online and the forum
and also learning from you,

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.080 
what are your concerns,

11
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.400 
what are your topics and also
what are your questions to design

12
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.760 
thinking, that's even
more than just a method.

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.000 
And we want to stay in touch with you.
Of course.

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.640 
And there are lots of opportunities

15
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.120 
to stay in touch with the HPI
design thinking community.

16
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.400 
There is the online version and also the
offline version.

17
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.920 
And the online version will
continue in September already.

18
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.040 
Yes,
so there you will find an online course

19
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.360 
on how to build and test prototypes,
starting in September this year.

20
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.000 
And if you're also interested

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.000 
in the problems stage and phase of design
thinking, there is still the online course

22
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.480 
about from sentences to creating ideas
in the archive mode that you can also

23
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.200 
access. And to get physically
in touch with us,

24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.960 
there are lots of opportunities.

25
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.560 
HPI Academy is offering different formats.

26
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.800 
So we start with the open course, it's

27
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000 
a three day format which is happening
every month in German and English.

28
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.720 
And the next one is, could
be also a customized.

29
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.840 
version of the open course.

30
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.320 
So if you're interested as an organization
to dive deeper into design thinking within

31
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960 
your community, that might
be also an option for you.

32
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.200 
And this is actually what we're spending
a lot of time, HPI academy is spending

33
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.000 
a lot of time, is actually
customized workshops.

34
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.480 
So you come up to us and tell us what your

35
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600 
needs are and we try to figure
out a good program for you.

36
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.280 
And while we just make use also of our
existing modules, like the professional

37
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.680 
track, which we developed over a period
of one and a half years,

38
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.160 
actually together with industry,
to find out what kind of portions of time

39
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.960 
is necessary to implement design
thinking on a sustainable way.

40
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.880 
And it's kind of open format as well.

41
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.520 
Three times three days over
a period of three months about.

42
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.080 
And we have another format,

43
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.520 
which is actually more about
training your design thinking

44
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.880 
coaching skills,
because if you also want to start applying

45
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.680 
it, you also want to use your
knowledge to convey this to others.

46
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.560 
And therefore, the certification
program is quite long.

47
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.840 
It's a year long.
It has several modules,

48
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.560 
three onsite modules here
at the HPI Academy in Potsdam,

49
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.800 
plus lots of training days where you are about

50
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000 
to get supervised feedback on your style
of coaching, of design thinking teams.

51
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.760 
And there is an additional program

52
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.960 
focusing on leadership and digital
transformation and innovation.

53
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.840 
And it's focusing on people who want

54
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.600 
to dive
a little bit deeper into the digital

55
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.920 
aspects, but also not forget about
the cultural aspect, it is a combined program,

56
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.400 
which we do together with our
friends at Stanford.

57
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.360 
So there's a trip involved and it's also
running over a period of several weeks.

58
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.520 
And actually, the easiest way to further

59
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.640 
experience design thinking,
is to start to engage as a project partner

60
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.120 
with us here at the HPI School of Design
thinking. Within our academic programs

61
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.240 
we have several opportunities to work
with companies and also not for profit

62
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.800 
organizations, as well as
governmental institutions.

63
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.920 
That actually starts with our Basic
Track, within the Basic Track

64
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.320 
we have an eight-week project partner format, where typically two teams work

65
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.800 
in parallel and also together on one
design challenge that has been designed

66
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.880 
together with us and actually is
also led by one project partner.

67
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.200 
We have also the so-called Advanced Track,

68
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.240 
our second semester,
which is for 16 weeks project

69
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.440 
phase together with project
partners from the outside.

70
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.800 
And it's also a great learning
phase for all people involved.

71
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.800 
And actually, one of the most interesting

72
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.240 
formats we have through the last year,
and it was just developed through the last

73
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.360 
year, is called
the Global Design Thinking Week.

74
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.960 
Yeah.
In those weeks, we actually do

75
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.880 
together with our partners
from the Global Design Thinking Alliance

76
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.200 
and invite in particular
international participants to come.

77
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.040 
So typically we have participants
representing 20 to 25 nations.

78
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.800 
We also team up with our international
faculty members from different

79
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.280 
universities, from different organizations
worldwide in order to dive deep

80
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.800 
into specific aspects
of the design thinking mindset.

81
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.160 
So, for example, how to design for global
impact or also how to lead teams or also

82
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.920 
how to combine humans centered design
with strategic foresight.

83
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.400 
So now it's time to say goodbye and also
to say thank you to all the people

84
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.280 
who were involved in helping us
to get the whole learning course online.

85
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.800 
And first of all, I would like to thank
the person behind the camera,

86
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.760 
Camera Person, he came up with the look
and the whole setting.

87
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.480 
And he was very patient with us, actually.

88
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.760 
And I want to thank the second person

89
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.200 
behind the camera and not for just keeping
us on time,

90
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.040 
but also for doing the graphics design
for this online learning course, that's

91
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.720 
Anja Harnisch,
who was also supported by Tim Huneck.

92
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.440 
And of course, I would like to thank
the people who helped us keeping in time,

93
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.760 
staying at times Stefanie Schwerdtfeger,
Sherif Osman with their clapp's

94
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.800 
and also Martin Schwemmle,

95
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.280 
who helped also shape
aspects of the MOOC content wise.

96
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.560 
At last, but not least,
we actually have to thank

97
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.360 
the whole open HPI team, they're
preparing for us a great platform.

98
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.960 
And we tried to make use of nearly all

99
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.520 
of the environment and we actually
looking forward to continue the work.

100
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.400 
So, good bye.
Bye bye.

101
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.680 
See you soon.

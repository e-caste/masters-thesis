00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.009 
Yeah, hello, it's me again, Wolfram Greis from the European Mainframe Academy,

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.509 
and in the next video clip, I want to talk very briefly

3
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.109 
about the Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF).

4
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.609 
It's more useful to show you afterwards how we work directly on

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.079 
the system. I show it in the next video clip with a demonstration, but just a

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.329 
few information concerning interactive system productivity facility,

7
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.501 
many people just say ISPF.

8
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.766 
And what can be done with ISPF?

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.684 
The most important component of ISPF is an editor, so we can

10
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.280 
can input data, store data, copy, change, delete data, the typical

11
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.599 
use of an editor environment.

12
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.538 
We can develop and test programs.

13
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.849 
And in many cases today, if it comes to the development

14
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.969 
issues this is normally no longer done with TSO ISPF.

15
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.009 
In former days it was really done with such an interface

16
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.225 
as example 20 years ago, the COBOL programs, PL1

17
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.939 
of course, Assembler and so on, were developed with

18
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.409 
TSO ISPF. Normally today we do it with an integrated development

19
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.969 
environment, I come to this idea in the next

20
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.736 
video clip. So the developers normally don't use TSO ISPF

21
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.679 
anymore. We can execute programs we can create, test, execute

22
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.099 
JCL for batch processing, we talked about that in

23
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.219 
one of our last video clips.

24
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.019 
We can call SDSF, it is an important tool, it stands for

25
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.019 
System Display and Search facility.

26
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.639 
In former days it had the name, Spool display and search facility

27
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.209 
because the first idea of this tool was to

28
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.649 
get in touch with spool and can look into a

29
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.509 
spooling environment. What the jobs are doing and

30
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.049 
in which phase we talked about the JES phases in one of the formal video clips,

31
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.239 
in which phase the job is in the moment.

32
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.010 
And we have a lot of user interfaces to do administration

33
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.039 
work, as example, system administration, monitoring, catalog management

34
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.309 
and so on can be done with ISPF.

35
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.832 
We have a storage administration interface, it's called ISMF

36
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.139 
for Interactive Storage Management Facility.

37
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.509 
We have an interface to the security tools like RACF or ACF2

38
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.189 
or other tools. And as example, also database administration

39
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.220 
can be done with ISPF and a lot of more administration

40
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.795 
things to cope with.

41
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.119 
And the ISPF has different

42
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.829 
components and normally when some one says he

43
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.659 
or she walks with ISPF, in many cases, he or she means

44
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.189 
she works with an ISPF/PDF, it's one

45
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.719 
of the components, though the environment first we

46
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.759 
need, of course, is z/OS.

47
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.889 
Within z/OS, TSO is running and within

48
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.809 
TSO we have a special command, the command to invoke ISPF and ISPF

49
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.029 
is then the Environment, the menu driven environment

50
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.579 
for editing and administration things to do.

51
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.377 
ISPF has a few components, and the most important

52
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.059 
component, in fact, is PDF the Program Development

53
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.739 
Facility. This is, as I already said, the component which

54
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.839 
is mostly meant when somebody says

55
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.819 
he's working with ISPF, it's the ISPF/PDF.

56
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.870 
Another component also important is the Dialouge manager,

57
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.429 
it is an interface with a lot of APIs where we can design our

58
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.219 
own ISPF applications and that is why, especially for the administration

59
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.719 
interfaces, it's not just for tools from IBM calls

60
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.639 
or other vendors can include our tools into such an ISPF environment

61
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.899 
with this component Dialouge Manager.

62
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.399 
The other tools are Library Management Facility and the Source Code library manager are

63
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.109 
not that important, especially the source code library manager

64
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.549 
is deprecated from IBM.

65
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.629 
It means it will no longer be developed.

66
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.219 
And many users in between

67
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.809 
also work with more modern

68
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.740 
library management interfaces like GIT or something like this.

69
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.159 
This is the interface, and it's dependent on the environment, this

70
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.749 
is from our education system we work with and

71
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.019 
it can be very different in other installations.

72
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.549 
Though the structure and how you do set up such an environment

73
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.039 
depends on the installation.

74
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.989 
And in many cases, you will get with one of

75
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.489 
these things to select from to

76
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.049 
the ISPF/PDAF. And in our example, if you type

77
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.549 
P, you get to ISPF/PDAF, you'll get afterwards this menu and this

78
00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.079 
menu looks in each and every location, the

79
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.609 
same on each and every z/OS environment, you have this interface

80
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.679 
and this is really convenient because I can

81
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.959 
go to different installations, to different locations and use

82
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.429 
always the same environment, the

83
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.179 
same ISPF points that are here on this binary option

84
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.699 
menu. It's very common to have this in each and every

85
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.870 
z/OS installation.

86
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.409 
We can go into more details on Das name level.

87
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.419 
We can go up to the data set list

88
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.189 
and as example, in this case, we can say E as edit,

89
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.929 
we want to edit a file. We go into the file now and here we see the member

90
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.609 
list. And again, we can type

91
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.499 
A as edit and here we see in this example

92
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.420 
COBOL program that we have now in our

93
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.479 
member list and selected this member

94
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.199 
and this member is the COBOL source code of a COBOL program.

95
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.739 
Again, I will show some more details in a demonstration, not just in screenshots,

96
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.089 
how to get there and how to cope with these different programs.

97
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.679 
For questions and remarks, please use the discussion forum.

98
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.950 
Thanks for attending and see you in the next video clip.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290 
Thank you very much

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.930 
and Sanna is live here with us. Welcome back.

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
Welcome again.

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.490 
Questions - do we have questions in the question answer session?

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.140 
There are two questions - I start with the lower one. There

6
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.130 
is one from an anonymous attendee regarding the multi-model usages

7
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.210 
eye-tracking, capture as seen in the slides. What learning

8
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.160 
scenario would be applicable that allows the incorporation

9
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.630 
with less effort into day to day classroom opinion?

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.910 
So it's about the application and what could be done with

11
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
integration in day to day classrooms.

12
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.720 
That's quite a fancy question because

13
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.180 
I don't think at the moment I wouldn't apply those

14
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.370 
to the classrooms, but I think the time is coming in a few years.

15
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.080 
Currently we are using these different modalities to understand

16
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
some aspects which are not easily observed or we don't

17
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.360 
usually get data with our traditional methods or like observation or looking at

18
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.220 
how students work and what kind of text or discussion they produce but

19
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.650 
to be honest, I think this is something which

20
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.690 
might be coming in a few years because once we

21
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.110 
see the value of using these data channels, we are currently

22
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.160 
exploring that how these data channels tell about something

23
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.700 
important in cognition or metacognition or motivation or emotion.

24
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.030 
We don't know yet. But once we are progressing, I think this data

25
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.940 
might be very valuable for on-the-fly feedback or for teachers

26
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.040 
or for groups to follow the aspect or something like that. So

27
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.840 
looking forward to see.

28
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.870 
Thank you. There's another question from Mar. Can we bring Mar

29
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.780 
in also to answer the question directly or to

30
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.430 
ask the question. First of all,

31
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.120 
hello.

32
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.220 
I cannot activate the camera, I don't know why.

33
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.880 
Hello, do you hear me?

34
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.580 
Yes, yes. Okay, I don't know. I think you don't see me but it's fine.

35
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.480 
The question was more or less related with the previous one

36
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.620 
so I'm gonna change because I had another question.

37
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.050 
One of the things that I found difficult to measure

38
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.250 
when we are analyzing self-regulated learning

39
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.210 
in hybrid learning environments is that it's difficult to trace how this

40
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.810 
regulatory process happens, right, because some of the process

41
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.690 
happen in the class and some other happens at home and I was

42
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.190 
wondering if you have any input on how we could maybe trace

43
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.360 
the self regulatory process in different spaces.

44
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.920 


45
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.250 
I think you have to combine again methods, because what is important

46
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.050 
is self regulation it's not something that you can easily capture.

47
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.490 
Actually regulation is not

48
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.140 
or regulation is not a strategy

49
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.220 
but regulation is awareness that something goes from and

50
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.110 
you need to do something for that.

51
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.620 
There is not the kind of environment channel.

52
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.370 
Some part of that regulation comes from your beliefs like an

53
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.070 
earlier experiences and some part of it comes from how you

54
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.330 
interact with the context and how you see the resources and

55
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.800 
other people around you.

56
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.350 
The concept of self-regulation or the regulation, I think

57
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.550 
quite a lot of people counting our team is really struggling

58
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.310 
to find out kind of metrics how to measure that.

59
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.750 
But I think I would implement different sometimes like even those very traditional

60
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.160 
self-reports, of course they are something to give some baseline.

61
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.800 
But once we are working more and more like very kind of fancy

62
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.530 
hybrid and online environments and when all these traces

63
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.030 
are available and then looking, I am even thinking about

64
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.730 
having different layers about this capturing this self-regulation

65
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.580 
co-regulation or socially self-regulation as a methodological

66
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.370 
point of view. I don't think that there is not yet. We need more work

67
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.840 
to find out especially in these online and hybrid environments.

68
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.210 
Thank you very much for your presentation. I

69
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.600 
hope you are working on that field because we need more research.

70
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.640 
Yeah, we are doing a project so and now we are wondering how.

71
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.690 
Yes, the difficulty is how you make this measurements

72
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.850 
in these different environments right and

73
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.170 
yeah we find some for online but

74
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.990 
we end always like making the proxy of the clicks as the

75
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.750 
behavior and I don't know if it's enough. It's true that we

76
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.340 
have to combine. I would kind of one one way is to add

77
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.850 
these simple situated self reports which you can also implement online.

78
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.770 
When students are working and once they have finished something

79
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.860 
once they are planning or or doing some evaluation. So this

80
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.730 
is a kind of easy way to use this kind of traditional self report

81
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.820 
and easily acceptable to the online as well as a one data channel.

82
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.680 
Thank you very much excellent. As I don't, am not aware

83
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.610 
of any recent question, I chip in because I have one.

84
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.480 
I'm very interested in your

85
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.140 
vision. I mean there's a lot of discussion now in

86
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.220 
hybrid models. So

87
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.750 
there were involved with some work where you look at

88
00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.520 
let's say the strengths and probably also the weaknesses of humans

89
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.020 
and where you can probably complement that with technology,

90
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.080 
like scaling with machine learning models,

91
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.900 
probably doing mass assessment that is in a preliminary stage

92
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.710 
and then you help teachers with that. But I'm interested more in

93
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.810 
is this also the kind of vision you have with GenJet or how

94
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.340 
can you give an example for how humans actually or a more

95
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.110 
a human empowering approach that you,

96
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.950 
so what are the ideas you're following there, are

97
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.070 
you looking for workflows and weaknesses and how this compliments or

98
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.670 
illustrate that?

99
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.120 
We are bringing the research on

100
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:54.910 
how, all the information we know about how people learn, how they interact,

101
00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.030 
all these nuances about emotions and so on. So we try to bring this

102
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.040 
this latest information to the teams who are developing technologies.

103
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.200 
For example, I'm working currently with

104
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.650 
a computing team and we are kind of trying to reach something

105
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.700 
in a very fundamental basic level. So I would say that the approach is that

106
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.760 
instead of taking technology first, we take first our latest

107
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.450 
information about how people learn, understand, interact and all these

108
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.070 
issues and then we we look at from that perspective.

109
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.460 
I know that was not a

110
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:44.160 
but kind of thinking what's behind GenJet. Okay.

111
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:51.740 
Again Sanna, thank you very much for being present here and

112
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.980 
preparing your video, all the work and effort you put into that talk.

113
00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:03.280 
Ithink we can take that to close the evening for after a long

114
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.390 
session distributed time zones. So I guess we see each other

115
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.800 
tomorrow morning again CET

116
00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:19.120 
around nine o'clock, if i'm right the first session starts, or probably even earlier.

117
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.930 
I thank you very much all for attending and for the interesting

118
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.820 
questions and thanks again Sanna. Thank you.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.300 
So now we have learned
a lot about team, the

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.690 
importance of team and collaboration,
and how to set up a team. It's

3
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.680 
not only about one team, but it is
also actually about a team of teams.

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.470 
This is the mode we're practising
for lots of years at the

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.640 
school of Design Thinking for
the learning process but this

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.250 
is also a process, or
a mode which we also

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.400 
highly recommend for company
issues for organisations.

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.420 
And this is again a mode
which is not practised in

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.030 
School, University, and
learning environments

10
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.510 
because of the fully
individual competitive mode.

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.940 
So what does that mean,
a team of teams mode?

12
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
First of all, it actually means to
share not just within a team,

13
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.110 
but also between teams, so that
you can build not just on

14
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.780 
your team members work but
also the other team's work.

15
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.830 
That's what we are practising here
with our student teams, so we have

16
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.220 
that say 8 teams in parallel, every
team has one project partner,

17
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.210 
one objective, one challenge, to work
on. And what they are doing is

18
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.970 
they are doing this in an open context,
so there they have different

19
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.760 
targets, different
challenges, but they share

20
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.200 
nearly every day, they try to
share what they are coming up

21
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.460 
within a very brief moment to the
other teams to get feedback

22
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.140 
from the resources. And this is
so valuable, it turned out this

23
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.280 
is much more valuable than getting
the feedback just from one

24
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.970 
Professor or just from one Lead person
to get this kind of shared input.

25
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.480 
And this also helps us to actually
establish a Culture of Learning,

26
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.650 
where we do empower teams to learn from
each other in an open environment.

27
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.990 
But also a lot of people are
asking us how does it work,

28
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.030 
so if everything is actually
just collaborative where does

29
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.340 
competition comes into play? Is
the competition disappearing

30
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.450 
completely? no, absolutely not.
There is still competition but,

31
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.780 
there is no individual competition
anymore. Because what we're finding out

32
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.830 
in a completely networked
environment we're in right now,

33
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.290 
individual competition,

34
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.350 
if you are focusing on this and
you have a complex problem

35
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.460 
and you want to solve that it never
ends with a very good result.

36
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.810 
So we have to rethink, and this
is a special demand for the

37
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.770 
HR departments we have to rethink
and redesign the incentive

38
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.430 
models in an organisation. We have
to really fundamentally think

39
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.640 
of what do we want to incentivise?
And there are companies moving

40
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.960 
completely away from individual
incentives, just focusing on

41
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.000 
team incentives or company
performance incentives. There are

42
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.050 
even organizations saying we get
completely rid of the individual

43
00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.120 
target agreements. We just blow it away and
it's really successful they're doing.

44
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.130 
And therefore, you are changing
also the way people behave in

45
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.520 
teams, but also across teams,
because you take that

46
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.760 
unfruitful or competitive way of
breaking out of the equation,

47
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:22.710 
and replace it with a constructive way of challenging each other
and building on each other's insights. So it's a new model

48
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.710 
other and building on each other's
insights. So it's a new model

49
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.550 
that we also do call "Co-opetition":
Collaboration and Competition,

50
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.380 
But in a networked organization,
in terms after hard people

51
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.650 
but in a networked organization
to empower people,

52
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.050 
teams and also
innovations.

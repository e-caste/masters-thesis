00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300 
Hello everyone my name is Alex Vea, chief
strategy officer at smowl tech.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.590 
and i'm here today to talk about
how to build trust in learning

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.700 
environments and why is
that so important.

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.730 
corvid-19 is having a huge impact
on education sector and

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.930 
according to unesco more than
ninety percent of total enrolled

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
learners have been affected. as
everything needs to go online

7
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.670 
students are facing a huge acceleration
on their digital transformation

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.130 
what they were thinking to do it in
years is happening in months.

9
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.220 
but with it also some challenges
across the sector.

10
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.670 
for example, how can they improve
their online quality assurance for

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.170 
on-line exams, how they can improve the
integrity and credibility of the same,

12
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.300 
how can they assure that a student
is doing any kind of activity

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.170 
online activity disagreed one
is behaving correctly.

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.060 
here comes a new concept knowing in the market
that is spoken widely sproctoring.

15
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.200 
and why or why are institutions
using proctoring.

16
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.310 
so I mean proctoring is a concept
that he was born more

17
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.770 
than ten years ago and when the only
learning market was already growing

18
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.930 
a lot. and teachers were facing how to
provide hundred percent online learning.

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.960 
in the final key aspect was the online
assessment how can they guarantee

20
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.660 
the online assessment integrity.
so they started doing

21
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.630 
video conferences using skype and
other tools, but then new app

22
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.650 
solutions came up into broader more
efficient and scalable solutions.

23
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.930 
but here online integrity sack
crucial complete to leave

24
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.740 
aggression at the question
liquidy. because it validates

25
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.800 
the student identity and gives
everyone an equal opportunity

26
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.260 
to integrate
they deserve.

27
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.110 
so in this sense a remote proctoring.
it's a key tool for organizations

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.160 
to be able to provide this universal
access to education twenty

29
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.670 
persons. so they can carry out they're
training a hundred percent online.

30
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.930 
and also being accredited and
recognized that the person

31
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.720 
who did that assessment or
course was the great one and

32
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.240 
the one who obtained the knowledge
providing a high level credibility

33
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.820 
to a certification
obtained.

34
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.840 
it helps also to break these
geographical and temporal barriers

35
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.280 
for those who have mobility promised
or don't have enough time

36
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.870 
for or money to attend
fach to face train.

37
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.860 
so in this sense provides opportunity
to those person to continue

38
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.670 
their learning through their
lives and enable them also to

39
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.670 
proof and give the credibility
and knowledge acquired

40
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.410 
creating that trust in the
online learning environments.

41
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's an important aspect and
why proctoring has been

42
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.210 
being implemented in the online learning
world now or these past years.

43
00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.320 
what does it mean proctoring? it means
in the words remote proctoring

44
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.660 
what the teacher already does
some face to face exams

45
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.120 
or whatever kind of activity to do
it online, but time to replace

46
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.540 
that in person monitoring on an
online assessment. and here

47
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.310 
we have a different
kind of proctoring.

48
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.850 
we can't be talking about passive
proctoring activities

49
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.740 
on the understanding computer
or more active restriction

50
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.120 
which would be more like a log done
browser, passive video surveillance

51
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.560 
or active video surveillance of
online live proctoring way.

52
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.370 
and a lot of institutions have been
facing on how to make that approach.

53
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.610 
this is from a survey of US
institutions that have been adopting

54
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.360 
these kinds of solutions and it
says for the first effort a forty

55
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.440 
why 54 percent sorry else institutions
were already. i'm using and

56
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.210 
twenty three percent were
considering planning to use them.

57
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.910 
and regarding concerns here that
the first one is the cost.

58
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.460 
the cost of implementing these tools
now. it is something new. it's

59
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.860 
a new tool that impacts on the
budget of the institution and how

60
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.050 
can they integrate these kind of
tools in order to implement it

61
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.670 
not only in a whole institution maybe
on these assessments on different

62
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.250 
areas that are critical farm for the
institution, also the student privacy.

63
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.700 
it's a big concerns in how the
tools make that approach,

64
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.540 
how to maintain an the security
and privacy of the data and

65
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.880 
how it is managed.

66
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.470 
so in the course where I
present small here what we

67
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.160 
aim is to support institutions to
enhance the quality assurance

68
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.750 
of their own assessments by
providing a tool for that. now we

69
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.470 
provide a tool that enables us to
provide the evidence of what's

70
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.890 
happening during those
assessments in two provided

71
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.780 
institutions on the report, so they can
make decisions based on that evidence.

72
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.710 
so it's really a quality assurance
tool for online assessments.

73
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.590 
you're an ex pretty easy an
example of how it works

74
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.190 
the process which suffers the
involvement of the student,

75
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.160 
then there is this monitoring
through the assessment and once

76
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.100 
the assessment is finalized, then we will
provide the report with the evidence.

77
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.190 
so the teachers or visitors will
have access on the platform

78
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.810 
on their customers platform to
that evidence in order to make

79
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.910 
decisions based on the protocols
and conditions that they have

80
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.480 
the fine for those
assessments.

81
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.690 
grandly we operate worldwide
mainly in europe at

82
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.060 
the american and north america.
here is a thing an example

83
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.300 
of a comparative from last year's
a month april to these years

84
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.370 
we have increased our services on
a nine hundred persent. it's a

85
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.420 
a huge increase, and because it's
a saying mentioned before

86
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.780 
a huge impact there discovery
nineteen on the education sector.

87
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.450 
as everything is to be done
online, it's critical for

88
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.060 
some careers
to have this

89
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.690 
academic integrity. and an example
of that would be for example and

90
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:31.020 
an admission exam for health
students where they needed.

91
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.140 
they were asking for this kind of tools
in order to provide justice and

92
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.490 
and those who would like to cheat,
then they weren't able to know.

93
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.610 
and we focused mainly on key
aspects of our solution. first

94
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.900 
would be the seamless integration,
I mean we pretty much focus

95
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.390 
on to integrate fully our system
in our customers platform.

96
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.020 
so they don't need to go outside
the platform and this needs

97
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.750 
us to provide the best user experience,
not just for the teacher,

98
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.560 
but also for students. and I have
at the same time provide

99
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.290 
a solution that is scalable and cost
efficient in order to be able

100
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.320 
to work with big volume
self of students.

101
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.040 
and a key aspect would be the
security and privacy as we are

102
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.530 
your bank company we have built
from the beginning the solution

103
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.000 
taking into account the accord
on security and privacy

104
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.920 
aspects will fully comply with
the gdp are all the data

105
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.340 
stored in in
europe. and

106
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.400 
it's deleted a once the institution ask
for that noise on a contractual level,

107
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.150 
define when one two the lead
all the data that we have

108
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.200 
a storage in our service. also an
important aspect. there is that

109
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.890 
we match the images that we captured
during the proctoring with

110
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.460 
the codes that the student
has on the platform,

111
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.300 
in order to maintain the
privacy of users as much as

112
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.470 
possible, we don't get a name of
user names or made a sort of

113
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.450 
anything like that. another
important aspect is that

114
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:16.420 
it's a modular customizable
solution. we tried to provide a

115
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.110 
solution that adapts to the pedagogical
methodology of each institutions.

116
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.590 
and that flexibility and he was
asked to provide different

117
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.250 
kinds of security
levels.

118
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.220 
we have two modalities, we work with
either license per exam or per activity

119
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.240 
where you could purchase a
package of exams or a licensed

120
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.230 
producer where we tried to provide
a unique approach and where

121
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.520 
we had our solutions which
pathological mythology that

122
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.190 
the institution has, in here to be
able to follow the same from

123
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.760 
the beginning of the course until the end
in a different kind of activities.

124
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.170 
but the institution
wants to assess.

125
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.900 
we are working as I
mentioned differently

126
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.480 
products to offer to the
institutions the first would be a

127
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.130 
computer monitoring
tool that uses to

128
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:10.450 
monitor and the computer of a
user on real-time detecting

129
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.450 
different events, if they open a
program or if they search the

130
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.860 
net if they do copy paste on a
passive manner. so it can be

131
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.990 
customized to different kinds of
assessments that can be done.

132
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.240 
maybe you enable them to use
excel or another tool,

133
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.580 
then we have a small burst that
is a solution where you can

134
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.270 
add different complements
that you want to use

135
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.010 
to the monitoring, if you want to use
the webcam use combined with the

136
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:41.370 
a computer monitoring tool with
one to face recognition or not

137
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.000 
a audio etc. then we have the
QA , that's more a quality

138
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.680 
assurance solution where we
combine of the algorithms

139
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.540 
with human supervision in order
to provide a moral our soul.

140
00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:01.110 
and we have finally the program's
service or as we want to provide

141
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.940 
it at the customer owns the whole process
as we don't intervene for anything.

142
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.450 
the customer gets in realtime all
the evidence that we are providing

143
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.560 
from the assessment and we don't
process them through the algorithms.

144
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.570 
we work on different use cases
where we could talk about a

145
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.430 
credit only in degrees blended
learning master degrees admission

146
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:27.410 
exams and books and when we have different
views cases with the ie university

147
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.240 
one of the most important business
schools world wide or UOC university

148
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.490 
one of the leading online learning
and institutions. but also

149
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.860 
here we see the different kind of
references. but also i'm on

150
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.040 
the corporate side where we
are working with different

151
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.150 
corporates regarding certifications
training courses recruitment process.

152
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.850 
and where we have seen some
examples for example for pilots

153
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.060 
in the pilot schools or we have
been working with banks like

154
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.150 
cecabank or santander
financial institute

155
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.440 
and regarding our financial
certifications now.

156
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.310 
so just, to sum up, I think in
the future of education

157
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.590 
we need to think on different
aspects. one of them is how we

158
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.810 
are going to work on the new pedagogical
methodology for the learning, I mean

159
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.220 
the rising it's not
only learning.

160
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.660 
we should take the best of
both worlds face-to-face and

161
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.310 
online learning to
combine in both to

162
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.370 
focus very much on education
as a service how to focus

163
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.520 
on the needs of the students,
the users know to so they

164
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.900 
can learn what they want when
they want from the world.

165
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.060 
and an important aspect thus that
the regulation must be updated

166
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.870 
to these new scenarios us right now.
they're online assessments.

167
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.120 
it's not pretty much regulated.
so it's an important aspect

168
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.680 
to take into account for the quality
assurance also on those terms.

169
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.640 
and to sum up, just
mention that

170
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.950 
proctoring, it's not just
proctoring which got

171
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.970 
what is going to enable that nobody
achieves it's the combination

172
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.980 
of proctoring and different mythologies
on how to define those

173
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.550 
assessment. you can do open books,
but you still need to know

174
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.000 
if the person is the correct one
or not. and different kind

175
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.590 
of approaches for this news
online assessment.

176
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.890 
so thank you very much!

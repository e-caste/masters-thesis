00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.110 
2020 has been one of the most
challenging years in modern history,

2
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.160 
it began with
a pandemic

3
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.540 
which has triggered fundamental
gaps in many of the important

4
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.100 
systems that we've
been relying upon.

5
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.060 
It has revealed gaps in
the social systems,

6
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.330 
it has revealed gaps
in health care,

7
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.260 
it has revealed gaps
in education,

8
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.330 
it revealed gaps
in politics,

9
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
and all of these gaps

10
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.740 
require fundamental change, not
just products and services

11
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.180 
but the systems
themselves.

12
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.530 
Designers have a unique opportunity
and I believe unique responsibility

13
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.130 
to address these
fundamental gaps,

14
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.880 
to take the existing situations
and design preferred futures.

15
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.560 
Futures where we have
more social equality,

16
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.070 
where we have
more access

17
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.750 
to just and affordable
healthcare,

18
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.090 
where we have access
to education,

19
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.760 
and of course where we have more
balanced political discourse.

20
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.920 
These challenges I believe designers
can contribute to solve it.

21
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.300 
Now in order for us to solve
them, we need to be thinking

22
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.360 
systematically but we also need to be
thinking about our craft of making things

23
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.370 
finding the balance
between those two

24
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.210 
systems which are very abstract, very
complex and the objects that we create,

25
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.670 
the interfaces, the
products, the services,

26
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.390 
binding those balances require us
to be able to engage in design

27
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.890 
conversations
with each other

28
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.060 
that are filled with
give and take,

29
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.510 
critique as an engine
for learning,

30
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.650 
and most importantly,

31
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.010 
aiming for a shared understanding,
a shared language,

32
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.340 
shared meaning between people
who are involved in designing

33
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.210 
these new systems.

34
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.460 
If we are able to achieve that then
I believe designers can mobilize

35
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.080 
people for collective action and
this is exactly what's needed

36
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.150 
to address the fundamental
issues that had been revealed.

37
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.450 
In this year now it's
not an easy task,

38
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.880 
but what we need to be doing is thinking
about design in different ways

39
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.470 
and that's what this course is
all about, that's what these

40
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.860 
conversations
are all about.

41
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.070 
It's not looking at design of creating more
ideas, but actually getting people engaged

42
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.780 
in co-creating ideas.

43
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.480 
It's not just about visualizing
our ideas and putting more

44
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.120 
post-its on the walls,

45
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.190 
it's all about engaging in constructive
and critical conversations

46
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.030 
that help us learn about the things that we're
making, but also learn about ourselves.

47
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.720 
And if we're able to do that
then i think we can go beyond

48
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.050 
what design has become in
many cases a buzzword,

49
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.060 
a language without any real
substance behind it.

50
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.080 
Design is all about co-creating
shared meaning, a shared meeting

51
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.260 
means that there is a shared understanding,
there's a common language.

52
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.440 
That does not mean that
everyone has to agree,

53
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.610 
but there is more harmonisation,
there's a synchronization

54
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.450 
between the people. They are
engaged in cool designing,

55
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.460 
these new systems, these are the areas
that we need to be focusing on

56
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.520 
as a design community and I truly hope
that this course will contribute

57
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.390 
to opening up ideas, opening up thoughts,
and opening up the kinds of conversations

58
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.000 
that we need to mobilize our collective
strength, to help contribute

59
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.910 
to taking the existing situations
and designing preferred futures.

60
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.600 
So I think what's interesting when
we look at the role design here is

61
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.360 
starting to play more of in an
innovation process, is number

62
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.530 
1, to be able to set out a
more desirable future.

63
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.110 
So within the design thinking literature,
we always quote a requirement

64
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.850 
that anyone designs who changes existing
situations into preferred situations,

65
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.970 
and what a
transition design

66
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.620 
ultimately aims for is changing existing
situations into preferred futures.

67
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.280 
And now those futures, there is
not going to be one future

68
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.130 
but in order to be able to create
multiple futures, you have

69
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.480 
to be able to innovate system it and
if we take an example the system of

70
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.430 
education and you could talk we
could talk about the system

71
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.690 
of healthcare, for example, we
could talk about the political

72
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.370 
systems, but let's take an easy
one, the system of education.

73
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.970 
So most innovators are going to
be working within organizations

74
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.010 
and primarily at organizations
that are providing products

75
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.860 
and services to the
education market.

76
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.600 
They're going to be looking to
innovate, would have a new value

77
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.140 
proposition in offering within
the current business or

78
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.280 
industry that they're working
the ones is education.

79
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.140 
and transition design as it's been
formulated by a Terrier Owen,

80
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.750 
and a few others at Carnegie
Mellon. He would be looking down

81
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.580 
at the products and services of
innovation of education but,

82
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.880 
how do we change the
system of education?

83
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:48.520 
And by system, it's much
more complex than

84
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.210 
an e learning module
or a gaming app,

85
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.400 
I mean this sounds logical,
but the practical

86
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.040 
question that I would
now ask you that is

87
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.040 
what do you see or who
do you see is then

88
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.090 
basically responsible for
it or how do you educate

89
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.050 
an entire group of people
to design a system based,

90
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.450 
because it cannot be done by just
a single person or entity,

91
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.590 
I mean sometimes you have entities
that are so influential like

92
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.320 
apple, they may change ecosystems
or they did in the past but,

93
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.220 
in general, I think it needs to
be a phenomenon of groups. So

94
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.840 
what is your take on that? Yes
so I think that touches on

95
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.870 
a debate that you and I had over
the years here before I get

96
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.350 
to the paper, I'll just address that
question from the point of view

97
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.920 
that at traditional design as an
emerging discipline proposes

98
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.060 
transition design argues
that a designer

99
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:07.920 
has the ability to be able to bring together
the right players in that system.

100
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:18.740 
So it's not at all about the designer
in the stereotypical traditional role

101
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.420 
of experts and I always refer
back to the stereotypical

102
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.420 
traditional role of
the architect.

103
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:32.750 
The architects like Frank
Garry and many others

104
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.720 
they are the ones that are
the driving force behind a

105
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.710 
creative time which is represented
in a physical form and

106
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.890 
so what transition design
argues for that, a designer,

107
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.520 
because they are human-centred,
because they are able to visualize

108
00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:01.940 
and most importantly and this again
is my bias as a trained architect,

109
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.540 
we are actually taught to
think systematically.

110
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.660 
By systematically from the point
of view of architecture we

111
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.130 
are always going to be
looking at the site,

112
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.430 
so where a design is happening, will
always be looking at the use,

113
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.910 
we will always be
looking at materials,

114
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.170 
always be looking at the social
structures that edifice

115
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.450 
finds itself within, we think about
architectural re-use for example,

116
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.980 
how do you take buildings that played a
role in a society that has changed,

117
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.540 
how do you adopt that? And you
can also look at urban design,

118
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:50.560 
is another wonderful example of training
designers to be truly systemic thinkers.

119
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:57.010 
You're absolutely right that changing
system needs to bring people together,

120
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.870 
and everyone who is involved with that
has to bring their expertise but,

121
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.900 
that art of  leadership

122
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.020 
in the sense of bringing people
together for collective action

123
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.190 
that ultimately is what they
decided, because it again

124
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:23.000 
puts aside any architect
that is working in any

125
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.840 
physical environment has to
bring many people together and

126
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:33.870 
be able to negotiate a in a design dialogue,
to be able to create a physical artefact

127
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:40.330 
that represents here a
collective view and

128
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.560 
calling innovation a
better future, a change.

129
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.100 
Now the debate that you
and I always have is

130
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:58.140 
where those ideas come from? Yes i still
firmly believed and even conditioned design

131
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:04.420 
an entire night had a number of
conversations, that a designer is he neatly

132
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.440 
capable of being able to
envision a preferred future.

133
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.540 
Now the challenge of a designer
is that they may fall

134
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.230 
in love with that preferred
future, and and building up a

135
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.500 
very significant cognitive bias
which is called the IKEA effect,

136
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:31.220 
that hinders their ability to perform
that design as a social act,

137
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:37.210 
to bring people together and
converge on a preferred future

138
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:44.030 
which as we know will evolve as
that designs a social dialogue

139
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:49.360 
around a physical object of all
throughout those interactions.

140
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.760 


141
00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.750 
How can someone imagine a future?
so I mean if I look from

142
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.810 
a practitioner point of view
into organisations, I see a

143
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.750 
lot of people struggling to
imagine even tomorrow.

144
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.950 
So because of the constant change,
because of the mortality

145
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:19.010 
of markets in the situation, so
everything is in blur at the moment.

146
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.000 
But how do you then enable people
were not even trained people

147
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.870 
to be able to see something that
is maybe happening in 3,4,5

148
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.160 
or even 10 years from
now on not just on a

149
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.790 
product-level that you have said
but even on a more complex

150
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.230 
level to systemic
level.

151
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.590 
I mean how is
that possible?

152
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:53.290 
So let's take a concrete example,
you asked about my shirt earlier,

153
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.810 
so Ridley Scott wrote and
directed Alien 1979,

154
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:07.760 
and it was a fundamental breakthrough
in a film noir, in space

155
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:14.660 
and a monster movie that had
never been conceived of before.

156
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.380 
It's unlike star wars because you
could argue that George Lucas

157
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.510 
head a number of
inspirations

158
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.960 
for star wars, Chris our
to Campbell mister hero,

159
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:32.680 
but I firmly believe that Ridley
Scott is one of those visionaries

160
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.650 
he looked at the worlds he's been
able to create over the years and

161
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.970 
even blade runner and anything
about gladiator and obviously

162
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.210 
has had a couple
of misses. But I

163
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:54.170 
firmly believed that Ridley Scott's
training at the local college of Arts

164
00:13:54.650 --> 00:14:02.310 
and his capability to be able
to sketch those visions

165
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.890 
in storyboards, if you go online you can
actually see Ridley Scott's sketches

166
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.640 
of storyboard for
all of his felt.

167
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.950 
And you can look at another great example
that is talking about star wars,

168
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:22.020 
Sid Mead took George
Lucas's script

169
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:29.200 
and began those storyboards and
that's what gave rise to the famous

170
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.870 
costume of Darth Vader and
concept of lightsabers. You

171
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:41.770 
can look at some of the storyboards
from my episode number 5.

172
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.910 
empire strikes back,

173
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.600 
fabulous sketches
of sky city.

174
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.230 
So I guess my point is that i
still believe and again this

175
00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:02.640 
is my bias, as you know at that
being trained to visually express

176
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:07.920 
your imagination is a very very
important capability and it

177
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.730 
is something that takes practice, takes
a lot of time. Having said that,

178
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.790 
I'm very excited about the
work that I'm doing at the

179
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.570 
institute for the future,
is learning about

180
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.360 
two very important elements; to
be able to create those futures

181
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.730 
and by the way anything to the
future there are a number of

182
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.970 
science fiction writers
and journalists.

183
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:40.130 
So they also have a craft to
visualize their visions of

184
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:45.480 
what the future could be and at for the
future they compliment that craft

185
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.410 
with two things;
No.1 Signals.

186
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:58.520 
So being able to observe whether some of
the emerging technologies, practices,

187
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.650 
start-ups, behavioural changes
that could be harbingers

188
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.940 
indicators of what the future could
bring. So that I really see

189
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:18.810 
the dangers and predictors also and to
imagine different variations of futures.

190
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.550 
Yeah that consists of the
whole discipline of

191
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.830 
forescience. Joseph, we just talked a
lot about the process, the structure,

192
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:33.660 
this systemic thinking and that
just got me thinking that

193
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.230 
doing design can be messy
from time to time and

194
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.250 
we talked a lot about how to
deal with ambiguity, how

195
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.960 
to learn, how to navigate in a
fuzzy part of the process.

196
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.530 
What is the connection, what is
the relationship between the

197
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.490 
systemic thinking and learning
how to deal with ambiguity?

198
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:05.560 
Yeah, that's right
there the trick .

199
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:13.110 
So as someone who has trained others
in design and also trained others in

200
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:19.160 
ambiguity, resilience,
on creativity as well

201
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.930 
I've kind of come to the point
where I think the only way to

202
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:36.330 
be able to maintain resilience
in a very complex system

203
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.440 
that is going to continue to evolve
and those ups and downs are

204
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.740 
good indicators of the evolution,
assuming that it's moving in

205
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.970 
a direction of a preferred
future, I personally think

206
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:56.880 
the practitioner in that environment has
to have a very high level of presence,

207
00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:03.310 
a very high level of
self-awareness.

208
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:13.470 
To be able to navigate those ups and
downs, to be able to take the clash

209
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.800 
that will come,

210
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.740 
artistically fuse ideas on
the road to convergence.

211
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.270 
I'm convinced certainly over
the last couple of years of

212
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:34.130 
the role of presence, awareness and
I'll add in the S word, spirituality.

213
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.950 
Now these are
also a bit

214
00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.200 
in the buzz word space,

215
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:47.400 
but I really do believe there's
a reason why architects

216
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.780 
really only make
significant

217
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.150 
impact or ability to express
their creative visions

218
00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.000 
when they are much
much older.

219
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.340 
And I believe that

220
00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:10.070 
when they are younger, some of them
succeed but the majority don't,

221
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.960 
because they are too attached to
their ideas, to that future,

222
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.410 
but as you grow older and you gain
that level of presence and

223
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.700 
understanding
of others.

224
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:30.720 
You're smarter about the ability
about the ways to navigate

225
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.610 
through to that point. Two
important elements of the

226
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.740 
mind designing the future is
your capacity to express

227
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.060 
your imagination through
your creativity,

228
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:47.970 
and all the ability to be
self-aware to reflect on yourself

229
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.620 
on the actions, on what's
happening on those surrounding.

230
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.930 
So my question to you and I believe
this is our last question,

231
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.300 
we are approaching the end of our
conversation, so my question

232
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:05.300 
to you would be, what would be your advice
to companies to foster this environment

233
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:11.070 
where they can encourage the employees
to improve their capabilities

234
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.140 
in these two elements.

235
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.410 
Yeah I'm going to
be honest I have

236
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.010 
have an utopian view
and have a dystopian

237
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.240 
to that question. I'll start
with a dystopian view,

238
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.380 
I'm frankly not convinced
that it's possible.

239
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:39.420 
Because of the systems
that have been created

240
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.710 
to sustain
organizations,

241
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.500 
I've certainly spent

242
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.140 
20 years of my
consulting career

243
00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.600 
in the trenches of
those organizations,

244
00:20:54.170 --> 00:21:01.080 
because of the infrastructure
created to keep those systems

245
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:09.670 
viable, I'm just not convinced. And I'm talking
about infrastructure processes of technology

246
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:16.950 
which obviously has an influence on culture,
you throw in metrics and incentives as well,

247
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.840 
I have that dystopian view that
there's nothing they can do

248
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.480 
and just because
I like to

249
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.470 
think of myself as a
hopeful human being,

250
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.900 
and maybe this might be a better
response to your question

251
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.110 
I really think there are
three critical elements.

252
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:44.340 
Number 1, it starts with
that search for meaning

253
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:51.300 
and leadership at all levels that are
interested in searching for meaning,

254
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.030 
both organizationally,

255
00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:02.900 
but also personally there's a better
likelihood.Okay I think the second element

256
00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:11.100 
is that they have to also take the time
to truly develop those capabilities

257
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.330 
which will strengthen

258
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:22.980 
the muscle memory and that means
things like I writing creative, or

259
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.310 
drawing, or modern building
anything is today there is plenty

260
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.770 
of other technologies available
to be able to help that, but

261
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:35.060 
I really believe that taking the time
to develop those capabilities in a

262
00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:40.420 
rigorous way, it's not a
weeklong discussion.

263
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.010 
I think if you have the mindset
for searching for meaning, you

264
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.830 
have the capabilities
of mind and hand,

265
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.550 
then ideally should be at a place
where you've got the stomach

266
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.500 
and the soul if you will, to make
some of those hard decisions.

267
00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.050 
So as an example, rather
than having an week basis

268
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.030 
on an annual basis, maybe that
old peak process has to be

269
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.560 
more like China or
Russia five years

270
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.710 
and that we actually give more
runway for people who have that

271
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.190 
desire to search for meaning and
the capabilities to actually

272
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:24.750 
envision those preferred futures,
to be able to actually

273
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.610 
take the time to make those changes
and that means that shareholders

274
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:38.140 
would have to change their metrics
from the great signal, the GEP,

275
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.320 
so you have the gross domestic
product, that is the metrics of

276
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:49.380 
most modern nations, GEP is the
gross environmental product

277
00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:56.480 
and there is a city in India that
is now tracking GEP, and that

278
00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:02.610 
means they're actually measuring the impact
on their productivity on the environment.

279
00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.880 
And ideally that will
also be central

280
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.290 
so you gotta have the stomach
for this but that means that

281
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.060 
you've also got to be willing to
make some of those fundamental

282
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:21.480 
changes to be able to imagine a preferred
future, to be able to design it

283
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.740 
in a meaningful co-created way
and ultimately comes down to

284
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.500 
your ability to lead
the transformation.

285
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.910 
And that's what you both
of you are aware of

286
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.580 
research we've been doing is on
innovation design and leadership ideals

287
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.180 
and we think those three
elements integrated

288
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.600 
have more potential for
transformative innovation happen

289
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.110 
within organizations.

290
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:55.930 
So let's round it up, today
we spoke with Joseph Press,

291
00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:02.900 
he has a PhD from MIT in architecture,
has been a long extended

292
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:08.120 
period with Delloite in leadership,
cultural transformation and

293
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.300 
many other topics and then
later he joined the centre

294
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:18.370 
for creative leadership and has
been involved in various MBA

295
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.120 
programs around the world with leading
universities like, Polytechnical

296
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.660 
Milano, University of St Galen, but
also Parisian school of design.

297
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:35.000 
and of course he did a

298
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.250 
a lot of projects with large
corporates. So thank you Joseph

299
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:45.060 
for spending time with
us, it's always good

300
00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:50.940 
to have you around and probably
see you soon again in a

301
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:56.150 
physical space as soon as the
pandemic is is over. Hopefully,

302
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.220 
and thank you for the opportunity.
It's always wonderful

303
00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.930 
to have these conversations and
let's see let's continue to help

304
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.870 
paint our existing situations
into preferred futures.

305
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.340 
Thank you very much.

306
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.060 
And thank you to the listeners, we will
see you again as part of the next

307
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.210 
speaker series.

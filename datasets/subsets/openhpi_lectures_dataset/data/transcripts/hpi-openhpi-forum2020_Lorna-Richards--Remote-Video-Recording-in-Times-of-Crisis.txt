00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.620 
Hi welcome to this openSAP presentation. remote video
recording in times of crisis for a stable course production.

2
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.170 
my name is Lorna Richards and I'm
with the openSAP video team.

3
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.270 
in this presentation i'm just going to touch
a little on the background of moving

4
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.080 
from a live video production
model to a remote one. and then

5
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.670 
i'm going to give eight tips or
lessons learned that allowed

6
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.210 
us to continue to deliver our
courses through this pandemic.

7
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.590 
so let's get started.

8
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.850 
as you probably know our education
at open sep is video based.

9
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.850 
with the majority of our videos
being recorded our studio on

10
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.730 
waldorf which you can see pictured
here. we also leveraged our

11
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.240 
sep studio in newtown square
and the one in palo alto.

12
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
president mc we did have a small percentage
of videos that were recorded remotely.

13
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.830 
and this was designed for the
presenter who for whatever reason

14
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.940 
was not able to make it to one of
our studios could be a logistical

15
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.480 
or budgetary reason for example.
so we did have a program that

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.760 
had an end to end process for
how to record videos remotely.

17
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.620 
so when the pandemic hit in march
twenty twenty we were able

18
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.710 
to leverage our program and just take
it from that really small scale

19
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.740 
to cover all of
our videos.

20
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.470 
so i'm just going to give eight
tips or lessons learned on

21
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.830 
how we managed
to do that.

22
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.000 
Tip number one, provide
detailed support material.

23
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.000 
so with remote recording it's really
important to provide detailed

24
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.610 
instructions on how to record
these videos at home.

25
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.590 
we also wanted to provide a
different learning options for

26
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.830 
people. so we have an instruction video
we also have a detailed user guide

27
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.140 
we also have a quick reference
checklist for people to use

28
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.330 
with the end to end
instructions.

29
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.000 
and the great thing about support
materials is they're really

30
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.450 
easy to scale. so it's just as
easy to send to one person as

31
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.110 
it is to a whole
team of people.

32
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.330 
tip number to work closely with
the presenters. so you can see

33
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.960 
your on the screen a comparison
between our live production

34
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.720 
model and our remote model a big
difference is the change in roles.

35
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.230 
so in the live production model
the presenters responsible

36
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.420 
for preparing and delivering their
presentation and the video

37
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.690 
team takes care of all the
aspects of video production.

38
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.780 
in the remote model, the role
of the video team moves

39
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.920 
more into enablement and then
the presenter is tasked with

40
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.820 
essentially turning their home
into a video recording studio.

41
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.260 
and a huge thank you to our
incredible presenters who really

42
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.920 
put in a lot of extra effort
during this time to get all

43
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.450 
these videos
recorded at home.

44
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.800 
so we broke our enablement down
into three parts. the first

45
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.310 
part we've already discussed
which is the support materials.

46
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.530 
the second part is the consultation
phase. so we would get together

47
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.690 
to with all the presenters at the
beginning of the course kick-off.

48
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.790 
and go through how to do this from home.
so we would cover all aspects of

49
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.580 
video production including camera
lighting audio screen capture

50
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.000 
as well as some presentation tips
for how to present on camera.

51
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.110 
in addition we offered a one on
one consultation where presenter

52
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.730 
could get some extra tips or maybe they
needed a little bit more support or

53
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.190 
they had some specific questions
about the equipment or the

54
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.810 
environment they
wanted to use.

55
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.080 
and then the final aspect of the
enablement is the test recording

56
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.060 
where we would ask the presenters
to take a two minute snippet

57
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.360 
of video and send it in and we would
give them feedback on that video

58
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.110 
which brings us to tip number three provide
positive as well as constructive feedback.

59
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.880 
so you can see on the screen
here the sandwich model where

60
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.900 
you provide positive and constructive
and then positive feedback

61
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.450 
and we use this for two reasons.
the first one is that it's

62
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.130 
just a really great way to give
feedback and it encourages in it

63
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.770 
motivates people. the second
reason we wanted to do this

64
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.770 
is because it reduces the back
and forth required. so we found

65
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.160 
for example if we only pointed out
one thing in the first feedback

66
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160 
loop that we needed more and more
feedback loops. because the

67
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.150 
presenter might change the settings.
because they didn't know

68
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.830 
that they had set them correctly.
for example if we'd say you

69
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.340 
need to tweak the lighting and
then not mention the audio they

70
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.540 
might tweak the audio. anyway you
get the idea. it would go back

71
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.810 
and forth and back and forth.
and that could become a

72
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.380 
really really frustrating process for
people. so we really wanted to limit

73
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.000 
the amount of frustration with the
process by giving some really

74
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.290 
specific detailed feedback that
covered every aspect in the

75
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.340 
first feedback loop.

76
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.460 
tip number four work with what
you have. so some presenters

77
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.710 
are video hobbyists and you know
they have great equipment

78
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.050 
that they have access to. and then others
are at the other end of the spectrum

79
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.940 
some might have a quiet place
to record in others might be

80
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.700 
navigating kids dogs traffic. we
even had one situation where

81
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.690 
a presenter needed to record late
at night. because the birds

82
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.370 
in his neighborhood were
so loud during the day.

83
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.330 
the important thing is to just
encourage everyone to work with

84
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.940 
what they have. and also be open
minded some presenters would

85
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.740 
say i think this will work and
even if you it was hard for

86
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.120 
us to picture it. we just say
hey senator test recording if

87
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.730 
it meets our quality and consistency
guidelines and standards

88
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.570 
will work with it.

89
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.080 
tip number five, do not compare
a studio recording with the

90
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.370 
remote recording. this is kind of
obvious but we found it was

91
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.490 
really helpful to think of them as two
different things. different animals

92
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.590 
you know different apples
and oranges if you will.

93
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.920 
now one result of the pandemic
is that people are more and

94
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.200 
more used to seeing videos recorded
at home and in fact over

95
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.980 
the summer even talk show hosts
late night talk show hosts

96
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.430 
were recording from their homes.
and some of the comments i

97
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.090 
would see on youtube were here
really i like the style it feels

98
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.260 
a little bit more authentic. so
people are getting more and

99
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.180 
more used to this and so it's
just a different style and we

100
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.110 
found it really helpful to think
about it in that way. you're

101
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.330 
not going to get a super
polished video. but

102
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.850 
you know it maybe it will feel
more authentic. so we like to

103
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.920 
look at it in
that way.

104
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.710 
tip number six, gives special
attention to audio.

105
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.670 
so having said that people are used
to sort of the home video style.

106
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.790 
audio is really important in these
remote videos and the reason

107
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.300 
for that is on the screen here,
if the audio is good no one

108
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.750 
note will notice it if the audio is bad
it's the only thing anybody will notice.

109
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.720 
so it really is fifty percent
of the equation you have

110
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.580 
to focus on it. and that's why we
insist on people using microphones.

111
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.260 
because if you're not using a
microphone you're going to be

112
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.900 
picking up background noise. and
yes we can add filters and

113
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.080 
post-production. but it's going to make your
voice sound more digitized which will

114
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.760 
reduce the amount of people wanting
to listen to it. it just

115
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.460 
doesn't sound as nice. tip number seven,
stay agile in post production.

116
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.140 
so because in a remote situation,
it's different than in a studio

117
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.420 
where you can control all the
aspects. and in our studio in

118
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.350 
waldorf we even add the shells on
the fly so in a lot of cases

119
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.420 
we don't even need any post-production.
but in the remote scenario

120
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.280 
people are working with lots of
different things in you might

121
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.890 
have to take out some lights a
light switch in the background

122
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.050 
or there could be some color
correction that's required there,

123
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.450 
could be some loud noises in the background
the presenter didn't notice

124
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.130 
the list goes on
and on and on.

125
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.840 
having said that we don't foster
a will fix it imposed mentality

126
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.310 
and that's because in our experience.
it is so much better to

127
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.520 
mitigate any issues during the production
versus the post production.

128
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.260 
you know one little change in
production can save you so many

129
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.040 
hours of trying to fix the
issue which is why we really

130
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.980 
focus on that test
recording.

131
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.720 
having said that though we
do try as much as possible

132
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.480 
to use the post-production as a
tool where we can bring a certain

133
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.940 
videos up to our quality and
consistency standards.

134
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.010 
tip number eight share experiences with the
team to continually update the process.

135
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.920 
the pandemic has expedited the
speed of change into a remote

136
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.930 
world in almost every industry.
so we found that it was really

137
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.610 
helpful and important to share our
experiences. when we're doing

138
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.030 
this on such a large scale, so
many different things came up

139
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.730 
along the way and through sharing
our experiences and looking

140
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:58.130 
at an iterative approach. we were
able to continually update and

141
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.370 
accommodate any changes
that came along the way.

142
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:12.250 
in summary i have shared some tips or
lessons learned on how we openSAP

143
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.860 
managed to continue to deliver our
courses through the pandemic

144
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.040 
by switching from a live video
production model to a completely

145
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.400 
remote one with the help of
our incredible presenters.

146
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.010 
I really hope that these
tips were helpful.

147
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.580 
thanks for listening

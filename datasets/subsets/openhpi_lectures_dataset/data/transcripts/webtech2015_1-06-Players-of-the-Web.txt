1
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.870 
Now let's have a look on the Players of the Web.

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.500 
Who is who in the web.

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.100 
The very beginning is important to say Internet

4
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.950 
as well as World Wide Web have no central control.

5
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.730 
There is no governmental, there is no organization that completely

6
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.570 
controls Internet and World Wide Web. So it's very interesting to see how

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.220 
it nevertheless is able to work.

8
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.700 
How nevertheless without such central control is able to develop.

9
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.940 
So internationally composed from the beginning

10
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.610 
there are many people around non-profit organizations

11
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.650 
interact with the entire internet community to develop the internet technology

12
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.930 
to regulate the technical organization and

13
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.640 
the development of the internet, and this is done in form of a public

14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.450 
standardization process.

15
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.750 
This is very interesting to see because it was not imaginable before

16
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.850 
that such an approach is able to

17
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.640 
come up with such an unique system world wide used like Internet

18
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
and the World Wide Web.

19
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.580 
There is the so-called

20
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.900 
Internet Architecture Board

21
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.730 
which determines the direction and the area in the internet of further development.

22
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.680 
And this internet engineering architecture board

23
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.950 
is organised in the following way. It is organised via so called

24
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.470 
Internet Task Force. This Internet Task Force-

25
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.560 
these are groups of people open to everyone to join, to contribute

26
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.670 
and this task force or each of these task forces

27
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.650 
works on a special question or special family of questions

28
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.460 
to develop status reports and to develop proposals for continued development.

29
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.700 
And this status reports are submitted to the

30
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.100 
IAB- to the Internet Architecture Board. The Internet Architecture

31
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.440 
Board runs mainly two groups of such a task force.

32
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.860 
The first group is IETF- Internet Engineering Task Force

33
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.760 
and the second group is the internet research task force. The

34
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.990 
internet engineering task force is led technically by the

35
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.850 
Internet Engineering Steering Group by the

36
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.570 
IESG and is concerned with the standardization of communication

37
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.210 
protocols in the internet. So all the internet protocols and

38
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.570 
there is a lot of internet protocols for each new service. New protocols are needed

39
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.820 
to connect the service with the internet.

40
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.570 
All this standardization is done in this engineering task force.

41
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.050 
It is a difficult process. It's a long running process. I will

42
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.580 
not go into details but it's very interesting. It works and

43
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.560 
that it works everyday if you switch on internet,

44
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.090 
switch on web and get results.

45
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.450 
Second, a support group for the Internet Architecture Board

46
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.420 
is the Internet Research Task Force and the name already mentioned it:

47
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.910 
research. It is concerned with the research question, with the

48
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.680 
question how internet technology is developed in the future.

49
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.900 
So if we want to have a look on the organization of this Internet Architecture Board,

50
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.790 
then we have the Board and the two groups are the Internet Engineering Task Force.

51
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.560 
Of course it's more important and the Internet Research Task Force

52
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.880 
and the Internet Engineering

53
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.810 
Task Force as well as the Internet Research Task Force. They are composed

54
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.290 
of various working groups or research groups that investigate

55
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.930 
special questions. The Internet Engineering Task Force is

56
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.670 
much larger. So the working groups are composed to

57
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.660 
interact. If they belong to same areas or to same topic areas,

58
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.400 
and in this way all the internet technology was developed, all the continued development

59
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.080 
is organized and its

60
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.080 
magic is that it works in this perfect form.

61
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.080 
Another organization often mentioned when speaking about the

62
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.940 
internet and the World Wide Web is IANA- the Internet Assigned Number Authority.

63
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.580 
Until 1998, this IANA was responsible for issuing addresses on the internet

64
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.360 
and in 1998, is responsible for it was shifted

65
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
to ICANN- The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

66
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.500 
Then when internet become more and more important,

67
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.390 
the need for a structure for organizational basis and structure

68
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.520 
become more and more obvious, and so in 1992 the ISOC- the Internet Society

69
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.050 
was organized, was founded, and was organized as an international

70
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.720 
social superstructure for the organization of all

71
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.470 
that is necessary around the internet.

72
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.890 
And of course the most important task is to set the new standards to gate

73
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.940 
in the Internet Architecture Board.

74
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.430 
When we particularly want to see who are the players on the World Wide Web,

75
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.080 
then we have to mention the World Wide Web Consortium.

76
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.800 
The web consortium was founded in 1994. It was founded at

77
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.410 
the MIT in Boston by Tim Berners-Lee

78
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.390 
and it originally originated from the World Wide Web working group

79
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.190 
of the Internet Engineering Task Force.

80
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.860 
This group could not publish any standards of its own and

81
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.970 
that was a reason to step out of the internet engineering task force

82
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.270 
and to see and is an explanation that the World Wide Web

83
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:10.030 
is so important service in the web- it's a huge service. So they started to create

84
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.770 
its own consortium. The World Wide Web Consortium develops and

85
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.120 
maintains standards that apply to the World Wide Web, for example HTML.

86
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.080 
Cascading stylesheet, XML, SVG, OWL all such things

87
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.270 
were developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. But to mention it,

88
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.390 
it's not an officially recognized organization

89
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:43.180 
and therefore it's also not possible to set official standards.

90
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.820 
Official Standards like ISO norms. Nevertheless in practical life

91
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.830 
the World Wide Web Consortium is a very important institution

92
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:59.040 
that we push forward the development of the World Wide Web by

93
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.710 
proposing standards around the Web.

94
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.670 
So the publications of the World Wide Web Consortium are

95
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.540 
called "recommendations".

96
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:18.110 
They are not official standards but if we look and practice, then they are

97
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.060 
de facto standards and they provide de facto standards.

98
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:29.500 
The World Wide Web Consortium is financed by itself. It is financed

99
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.450 
by membership fees.Everyone- individuals as well as

100
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:42.070 
companies and institutions can become members of the World Wide Web Consortium.

101
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.780 
And since 2009, it has been financially supported by the ISOC,

102
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.480 
by the International Internet

103
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:58.640 
Society and its financed by donations, because the work done by the consortium

104
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.230 
is very, very important to

105
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.460 
continue the development of the World Wide Web.

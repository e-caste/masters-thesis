00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.750 
Welcome to
our new openHPI

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.190 
course about Cyber Security and
in this course we want to speak

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.590 
about cyber threats
by malware

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.630 
and this is an ever growing threat
which we can observe when

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.670 
we speak about
cyber security.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.350 
Over the intervening years we have an
enormous growth in malware attacks, this is

7
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.600 
malicious software.

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.880 
So, alone in twenty twenty

9
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.120 
pushed by the Corona-crisis,
malware was targeting various -

10
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.590 
in particular work from
home software solutions.

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.010 
In many cases people start with
such work from home as solutions,

12
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.760 
unprepared, it was during the
lockdown, it was decided to

13
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.270 
let people work from home and
so a lot of solutions were

14
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.080 
vulnerable and by means of cyberattacks,
in particular by means of

15
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.900 
attacks with malware,
they could be

16
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.920 
attacked.

17
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.480 
So here is a chart
which shows the number

18
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.170 
malware variants
attacking the Microsoft 365

19
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.100 
software, this is the office
software, and here we see

20
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.220 
it's more than three million
different malware variants

21
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.350 
which were designed and which were
used to attack systems only

22
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.230 
to attack the Microsoft

23
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.360 
365 suite
or here is another

24
00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.410 
chart which shows the number of malware
variants targeting mobile devices,

25
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.620 
also more than
one million.

26
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.770 
If we look at the situation,
here we have our internet.

27
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.270 
Internet you remember is a network of
networks and in the internet there is a

28
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.870 
big number of services that are
provided to the user. And the user

29
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.010 
uses services by
connecting to the internet

30
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.150 
by different devices with their
computers, with their laptops,

31
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.940 
with their smartphone or tablets.
So they are using hardware.

32
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.530 
In the hardware there is an
operation system which allows

33
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.110 
to run several types
of applications.

34
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.620 
And the attack by means of malware
from the side of attacker is

35
00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.120 
direct as well to the hardware as well
to the operating system as to the

36
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.700 
various applications.

37
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.390 
And this is also a very
important attack vector, the

38
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.380 
cyber criminals attack immediately
the user itself. This is

39
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.360 
what we call the human factor
and human engineering.

40
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.080 
So malware is a central
attack vector in cyberspace.

41
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.420 
And we have to think and we have to learn
about it because such malicious software

42
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.850 
is a central weapon
of cybercriminals.

43
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.170 
Any device can be
targeted by malware.

44
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.260 
Malware can target the users as well
as the providers, the service providers.

45
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.210 
So home computers could
be targeted, smart phones,

46
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.390 
IoT - Internet of Things devices
such as lamps, fridges, servers

47
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.420 
and websites in
the internet.

48
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.710 
And malware makes it especially
easy for the cybercriminals

49
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.700 
to attack computer systems and
users to break into the systems

50
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.890 
to falsify data, to
steal the data

51
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:29.790 
to force the user to do something which gives
the cyber attackers financial advantage

52
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.590 
or others. So in this openHPI course,
cyberthreats by malware, we

53
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.340 
want to consider this
topic in more detail.

54
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.330 
So in the first wake now we start and will
provide you general information about malware

55
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.060 
attacks. Why is internet an interesting
target for malware attacks,

56
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.580 
who are the attackers on the internet,
how does one get infected by malware -

57
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.720 
these are topics we discuss in the first
week. And then we finish with an excursus

58
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.370 
on Advanced Persistence Threats. These
are the most dangerous and complex

59
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.590 
attacks which of course use malware
components in different situations.

60
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.910 
And then in the second week we
will have a closer look on the

61
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.850 
different kinds of malware. We will
discuss viruses, worms, trojans,

62
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.360 
we will discuss ransomware
and scareware.

63
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.310 
And this is of course very important - we
want to discuss protective measures

64
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:49.820 
against malware. And then we also provide
excurses on firewalls and anti-virus software

65
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:56.340 
to explain how these protection

66
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.070 
systems are working.

67
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.090 
My name is
Christoph Meinel.

68
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.640 
I'm the Head of the Hasso Plattner
Institute and the Dean.

69
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.040 
I have the chair of "Internet
Technologies and Systems" and have a

70
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.910 
very powerful research group
working on that. And in our chair

71
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.480 
we are working on security engineering, on
cybersecurity - how to protect systems,

72
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.420 
but we also speak about learning and
knowledge engineering, digital education

73
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.760 
and innovation research. And in
this coutrse I am supported by

74
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.480 
my PhD students - by
Daniel KÃ¶hler,

75
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.140 
he is working on security
engineering and network security,

76
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.980 
and by Muhammad Ihsan Sukmana,

77
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.790 
his topic is cloud computing, secure
cloud computing, access control

78
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.370 
and enterprise
storage solutions.

79
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.810 
So we would be
pleased if you

80
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.110 
cooperate with us, if you
come to this course and

81
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.190 
if you use the discussion forum to
interact with the other learners

82
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.260 
which are interested in this
topic cyber threats by malware.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.640 
hello everyone and welcome to my presentation video about data

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.210 
informed decision making in different processes.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.710 
i will provide you with details about our work's which aim

4
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.220 
to improve formative assessment processes at scale.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.910 
let us begin with a quick introduction to formative assessment

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.190 
black and williams definition emphasizes the importance of

7
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.160 
collecting data in order to make decisions during teaching
and learning activities.

8
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.730 
in our work it is important to notice that
we focus on feedback for teachers.

9
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.150 
formative assessment is harder for teachers
when the number of learners increases,

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.500 
when it comes to face to face context teachers can't collect

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.930 
nor process a big amount of answers at a glance.

12
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.010 
this is where technology comes into play.
when it comes to questioning a large audience,

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.040 
the most general process that can be found in several technology

14
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.890 
enhanced formative assessment platforms allow teachers to ask a question.

15
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.660 
and learners to provide an answer histograms are then immediately

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.060 
displayed in order to help teachers and learners engage in a discussion.

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.700 
a deeper process which proposes a confrontation phase after

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.740 
the vote is implemented by compare

19
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.720 
by asking the runners to insert the question a second time

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.240 
after the confrontation phase. we obtained these five phases

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.570 
they embedded the two word based process which is implemented

22
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.090 
in measures peer instruction and platforms such as may delight

23
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.570 
developed by celsius' as fork and elastic

24
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.950 
which is the platform developed in our lab.

25
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.240 
the process implemented within this tool is the following

26
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.070 
learners answer the question and provide a rationale as well

27
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.410 
as very confidence degree.

28
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.620 
the next phase begins and learners are asked to give a level

29
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.030 
of agreement regarding russian as written by peers on a five item likert scale.

30
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.270 
they can then answer the same question a second time.

31
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.230 
and finally a histogram about the first
and second vote is shown to teachers,

32
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.420 
as well as each learners rationale.

33
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.170 
these democracies have been designed according to educational theories,

34
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.470 
however they lack data driven feedback to help teachers make

35
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.530 
decisions about how to judge formative assessment sequences for instance

36
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.650 
mazur's states that learners should not engage in peer discussion.

37
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.960 
when the proportion of correct answers is lower than thirty percent

38
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.700 
or greater than seventy percent.
therefore we tackle the following research question

39
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.790 
which feedback for teachers can improve decision making in

40
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.890 
face-to-face formative assessment sequences.

41
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.740 
to address this question we explore a clean data set collected

42
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.370 
from an authentic usage of elastic from twenty fifteen to twenty twenty.

43
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.350 
our first hypothesis is that benefits of formative assessment

44
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.050 
sequences increase when the proportion of correct answers is

45
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.290 
close to fifty percent.

46
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.530 
these benefits are measured.
thanks to the effect size of the

47
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.240 
confrontation on learners' vote this histogram as well as the

48
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.940 
calculated correlations supports our hypothesis.

49
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.410 
our next super physics stated that benefits of formative assessment

50
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.580 
sequences increase when learners consistently rate peers rationales.

51
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.110 
we defined the consistency of peer rating as the correlation

52
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.960 
between the level of agreement of the learner to a piece rationale

53
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.840 
with the correctness of the matching answer.

54
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.730 
these figures as well as the correlation test suggest that

55
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.050 
the effect size increases alongside the consistency of peer rating

56
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.250 
which supports our hypothesis.

57
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.840 
we finally put the third hypothesis peer ratings are more consistent

58
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.090 
when learners confidence degree or consistent.

59
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.030 
similarly to the consistency of peer rating we define consistency

60
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.790 
of confidence degree as a correlation between the degree of

61
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.590 
confidence of a learner with the correctness of their answer.

62
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.770 
these figures suggest a correlation between the consistency

63
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.790 
of peer rating and the consistency of learners confidence degree.

64
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.820 
it is confirmed by the computed correlation which once again supports hypotheses

65
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.230 
based on this finding and on vickrey's model designed to help

66
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.510 
teachers orchestrate formative assessment sequences we managed

67
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.890 
to build an improved model. future work will implement this

68
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.540 
model within elastic and measure its impact on teachers

69
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.850 
decision making and on learners understanding.

70
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.560 
for more details don't hesitate to protector's reader paper

71
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.000 
thank you for intention.

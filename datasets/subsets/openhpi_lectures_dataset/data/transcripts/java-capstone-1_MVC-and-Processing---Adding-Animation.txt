1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.880 
so that's cool but i want to have
something that moves without

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.560 
taking your time you
mean some animation

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.790 
let let's have some
english ok so

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.600 
we have a little bit here
what we need now is

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.410 
the draw method ok we had it all
the time but there was anything

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.610 
in it and actually that's really
important that if you want

7
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.420 
to use the most little
stuff like that you need

8
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.390 
to have the the
promise that here

9
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.820 
because i was doesn't work so
even if there's nothing in it

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.370 
you need that so now
we added something

11
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.710 
in this method you
we'd rather rating

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.630 
and it will be whites because
we're filled with what kind of

13
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.810 
one hundred fifty five
as white and then

14
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.390 
we have it at a random
position between

15
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.270 
zero and one hundred and
on the exposition and

16
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.460 
c one one hundred on y so
it kind of jump around

17
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.240 
it and it's ten but so
that's all we are that

18
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
we learned nothing else
than sol sont run it

19
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.850 
wait a second gs

20
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.660 
same problem again and we can
agree on can we can take and

21
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.390 
the background a strong again as
so it also the test changes

22
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.110 
color that don't go right
i stop you once more

23
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
i think understood we
need to pay the but not

24
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.430 
in the promises right yes that's
it so we need to move this

25
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.180 
line up here and
that's the first

26
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.570 
thing we whole feed back from
you and then in the next

27
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.870 
framework ok so on we
run and we run it

28
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.120 
can take signal yeah but
had such better there's

29
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.200 
how is on that no work
is all conversation

30
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.660 
ok c they are
coming through

31
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.730 
but that's not
really anyone

32
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.350 
the background is all the
way painted overall

33
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.960 
role things we have when we
call the object method fire

34
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.320 
pressing the button and thus
changing your model updating the

35
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.470 
observer updating the model
so yeah the problem

36
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.710 
is with processing you
cannot really do kind of

37
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the classic model you
control so what we

38
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.620 
need to do here and this kind
of what we will also give us

39
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.020 
the as a framework to start
with the project so

40
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.580 
it's minimal but it
gives you kind of

41
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.000 
sort of a model you
control framework

42
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.570 
we need to call the update
method off the use in the

43
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.630 
drawn it doesn't
work another way

44
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.360 
so we go to the counter
that's what we need

45
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.530 
and they don't mean
that we don't back

46
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.630 
three ev and now we need to
called was we can do it like

47
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.620 
this here so is
kind of the

48
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.910 
the was

49
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.490 
called remember
current of

50
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.210 
but we do not have
the come on that

51
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.640 
yes i don't know what is
kind of a little hardly

52
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.330 
handy then we didn't
then we move from

53
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.400 
put push but we won't
we do that so

54
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.710 
i mean what we can do
here all of is we

55
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.560 
say and we need it is
as you remember so

56
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.040 
have a local variable or we
can have local variable

57
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.370 
of current x or
in column here

58
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.790 
kansas where the variable
name we already have

59
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.020 
and is we need to model

60
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.840 
no we are get caught

61
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.870 
now we are pulling again
all the time here is

62
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.570 
that this is ok
what it is

63
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.060 
just noting is yeah
we at the end

64
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.630 
at the very end of this thing
we will come show you how to

65
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.760 
clean them myself ok again
let's save it we run

66
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.730 
it i want to see what happens
so we have the method

67
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.780 
with that it is go look

68
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.660 
turned to on earth at the
counters the behind

69
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.350 
or you are directing
any less kind of just

70
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.250 
to show it that it
it's kind of just

71
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.660 
switch piece

72
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.460 
are there registered
in another order on

73
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.760 
actually that doesn't have
anything what we need

74
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.940 
what we need to do is this
to switch to scales

75
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.410 
you know using the
observer in it

76
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.030 
or when we are using it but it
doesn't help because we are

77
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.250 
painting over a
little yeah

78
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.160 
we already know is the
small yeah it comes small

79
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.600 
black on soul company
to stop here again

80
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.620 
my own soul that's when as the
now we've got kind of a lot

81
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.740 
of self that is obsolete
he always your whole

82
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.200 
observers they are also
thing doesn't have us

83
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.630 
at all anymore so what
we can do here it is

84
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.810 
we goal to the
condyle and we can

85
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:28.720 
remove basically
this on as

86
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.450 
a means but you will
see it will come

87
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.560 
any again when we use not a good
framework so it's not a moving

88
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.670 
that you learned about that
now the counter doesn't

89
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.290 
do is just a little don't
implement the subject

90
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.890 
anymore and we do not know
the for so was also

91
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.460 
obsolete and we don't
need to observe as ok

92
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.720 
so and it is so we can
organize imports

93
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.440 
shift command where the way we
can you shortcut warsaw's

94
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:10.120 
organising imports
is so contra

95
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.190 
we don't need to count
anymore in new

96
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.990 
because we don't
register

97
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.260 
in our we can
remove there's

98
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.750 
no no we can't we still
need to display

99
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.290 
the value yes we separate is it
this plate it's really just

100
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.220 
remove the counter from
the so called yeah

101
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.630 
we i mean we basically we
also could remove completed

102
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.650 
so but we can kind of just
keep it and then we

103
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.450 
just remove this like
that makes a little

104
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.320 
bit easier if you want
to go further and

105
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.390 
cleaning up you can
do that and so we

106
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.690 
were very remove
the counter

107
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.060 
it's or course to to
remove all that

108
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.270 
here we are no
we think we

109
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.980 
know that the observer can guess
we have to remove the subject

110
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:13.000 
to need more
contribution same

111
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.040 
year learn where to
do it all the way

112
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:23.860 
for all the views this
is a really e lee

113
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.250 
impressive demonstration
of how great

114
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.310 
and last but not least the
doesn't it conference long

115
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.290 
but no it to
run what it

116
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:47.800 
hopes of at least
compilers soulless c

117
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.650 
good yes is the there

118
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.660 
have ok that's
it for now

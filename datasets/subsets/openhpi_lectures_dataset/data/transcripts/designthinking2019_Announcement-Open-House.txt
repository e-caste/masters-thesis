00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.960 
So since we are meeting online

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.600 
quite often so far through the last two
weeks, we thought it would be a good idea

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.840 
to invite you to come and visit the D-School physically, come to the HPI.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.720 
Yes.
And there's a great opportunity,

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.720 
we wanted to invite you for Wednesday,
12th of June,

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.000 
to come here either already at around 4:00
p.m. to learn more about our academic

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.560 
programs or
for the meet and greet with us and also other

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.400

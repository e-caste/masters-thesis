00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020 
Welcome to video clip 1.3 in
which we discuss business process models.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.560 
So a business process model is an abstract
representation of a business process

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.410 
serving a
modelling goal.

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.040 
And we have seen a number of business
process models already and

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.060 
this is again the business process
model of the insurance claim process.

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.550 
Now I'd like to discuss with you in
how far the properties of models

7
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.330 
as identified by Stachoviak actually
hold for business process models.

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.650 
They should hold because they are
models and modeling theories

9
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.650 
should apply to all models.
But still you might

10
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.130 
find it quite
interesting.

11
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.130 
Alright look at the mapping
feature in process modeling we

12
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.390 
map relevant aspects of
business processes too

13
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.070 
process models.

14
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.080 
By the way when I say process
models I write process models

15
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.460 
I always mean business process
models sometimes it's a bit

16
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.670 
too many words so I'll just say
process model. And that is,

17
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
there's no difference between a business
process model and a process model

18
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.550 
in this context. Alright so coming back
to the mapping feature what are the

19
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.060 
elements of the real world of
the original of the business

20
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.350 
process that need to be mapped
to the business process model?

21
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.590 
Well its events certain
happenings in the real world

22
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.290 
that have a meaning for
the business process.

23
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.510 
And here we have for instance
the claim received event and

24
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.930 
happening in the real world that is needs to
be mapped to the business process model.

25
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.560 
And other events are here claim
approved and claim rejected

26
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.810 
these specific types of event
we will cover that later.

27
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.090 
Also what are the aspects
of business processes I

28
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.450 
need to map into the business process model.
Actually of course its activities it's

29
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.020 
people are working people are registered
to claim people work in the

30
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.030 
insurance company register the claim,
they get the information

31
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.380 
they use form to fill out the
form to save what they felt out

32
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.620 
in an IT system that might then
realize the register claim activity.

33
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.550 
And then there might be
activities for deciding claim

34
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.600 
Coverage, preparing letter of
approval and preparing letter of

35
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.830 
Acceptance. So events need to be
Represented, activities need

36
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.510 
to be represented but also the
ordering of activities need

37
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.620 
to be represented and decisions need
to be represented and this is done

38
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.450 
by the edges, by the arrows here
between the activities and by

39
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.630 
certain additional nodes which
is these branching node.

40
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.800 
We will come to the specific
elements of process models

41
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.250 
a bit later but here I just want
to explain to you that we

42
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.370 
have the business process happening
in the real world and we need to

43
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.820 
decide quite carefully which are
the elements of the business

44
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.000 
process that need to be represented
in the process model. And this

45
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.880 
realizes the
mapping feature.

46
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.200 
How about the abstraction feature? Well
business process is very complex indeed

47
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.550 
many activities not all activities
need to be represented

48
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.260 
in the process model otherwise we will be
getting really huge process models that

49
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.110 
would be very hard to understand.
So business process model

50
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.480 
abstracts from aspects that are not
relevant for the modeling goal.

51
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.100 
We shortly also talk about the
modeling goal but important is that

52
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.190 
process models are also models
in the sense that they

53
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.550 
have the abstraction feature we
extract from details

54
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.290 
of the original of the process that are
not important for the modeling goal.

55
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.000 
Space is precious. So each model should
have only elements that are relevant

56
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.650 
for the particular model angle. And that's
something to bear in mind whatever

57
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.390 
you are modelling and be very careful
not to fill the space with and

58
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.120 
on required detail. And of course
this process model is a textbook

59
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.440 
type of process model that has just
four activities we've seen in reality

60
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.280 
far more complex models but
still you need to be always

61
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.120 
very precise about what to
represent in the business process

62
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.470 
model and what not to represent
in the business process model.

63
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.330 
We learned that the pragmatic feature
is therefore

64
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.880 
for the model to substitute the original
for particular modelling goal.

65
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.160 
So each this is process model can replace
the business process for a particular

66
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.520 
modeling goal. In our case the modeling
goal was just to understand

67
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.890 
the main steps of this insurance
claim process rather than

68
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.840 
having a discussion about the
process as it happens in the insurance

69
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.690 
company we do an abstraction we
concentrate on these four activities.

70
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.620 
But then we can study on the real world
process just using the simple abstraction

71
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.960 
and to some extent it might or
is it is correct since most

72
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.690 
insurance claim process will
have activities like this.

73
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.460 
Right so we look at an abstraction
but still the abstraction

74
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.410 
can replace the original for the
purpose of the modeling goal.

75
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.660 
So we can say that all these
three properties are really

76
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.810 
also present for
process models.

77
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.700 
We can discuss the pragmatic feature
also in the context of this

78
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.750 
the different activities we do in process
management project, that is process

79
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.890 
Documentation. People working on
process documentation need

80
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.670 
this process model to take a look
at it, to discuss it, to improve it

81
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.650 
and so the model replaces the original
for the purpose of documentation.

82
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.350 
The model can replace the original
also for the goal of process improvement,

83
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.060 
so rather than improving some intangible
process that runs in the organization

84
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.220 
we have a tangible representation,
we have the process

85
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.910 
model and they can add activities,
we can split activities, we

86
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.130 
can add branches, we can delete
branches, things like this to make it

87
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.630 
Tangible. Therefore also
the process model

88
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.440 
can replace the original here
and of course the same holds

89
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.940 
for process automation and
also for process monitoring.

90
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.500 
So is a process model descriptive or
Prescriptive? We were discussing this

91
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.820 
for models in general.

92
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.920 
Okay, take a look at these domain
or at these important

93
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.800 
activities related to process modeling.
Maybe start with process documentation.

94
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.070 
Process documentation -

95
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.880 
in process documentation we take
a look at the original at

96
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.300 
the business process and document it.
So it's a description of

97
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.570 
what is already there, so process documentation
has mainly this descriptive character.

98
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.840 
And the same holds for process
Monitoring. Process models

99
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.040 
also can be used in process
monitoring to show in which

100
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.500 
stage a process certain at a point
in time is, so process models

101
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.960 
describe the state of individual
process instances so to speak.

102
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.030 
And the same holds also a
similar holds also for process

103
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.320 
documentation of course.

104
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.020 
Then we have prose improvement. Process
improvement has also this design

105
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.460 
the idea that I want to create something,
I want to design something new,

106
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.530 
I want to I have a process, I want
to improve it. Therefore it

107
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.510 
has to start with the descriptive
character. When I

108
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.140 
go to improvement it has a
prescriptive character, because once

109
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:28.500 
I improve the process I want to then
automate the process implement the process

110
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.490 
in the organization's approach
improvement has rather a character of

111
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.740 
a prescriptive and character in
terms of business process models.

112
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.970 
Process automation -

113
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:45.660 
in process automation we also
have this prescriptive

114
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.710 
Character. We have the process
model and now we need to realise

115
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.300 
it so we need to connect the interfaces
of the two systems in a way

116
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.980 
that the process is implement
at least the automated parts

117
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.280 
of the process is implemented
like this so it also here it

118
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.550 
has a prescriptive
character.

119
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.680 
So I can say similar to the to
the plan we seen before in the

120
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.480 
previous a video that business
process models can have both

121
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.830 
descriptive character when describing things
for instance in process documentation

122
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.760 
but also has a prescriptive
character for instance

123
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.200 
in the area of process improvement
where I improve a process,

124
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.260 
design or process, improve it and
then this improved process model

125
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.320 
prescribes how the process the
improved process should be executed.

126
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.740 
One of the main goals of process
models is answering questions.

127
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.770 
And I have here an examples of
our insurance claim process

128
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.340 
and I can ask a number of
questions with these.

129
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.310 
So which activities for instance
which activities constitute

130
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.750 
the business process? These are
for activities that make up

131
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.610 
that's let's say make up this business process
plus the activities of the process.

132
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.230 
Which decisions need to be taken or
can be taken in the process? Well two

133
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.490 
decisions can be taken either
approval or rejection.

134
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.890 
Which event starts the process?
Well there is one event that starts

135
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.220 
the process, which is the claim
received. So whenever a claim

136
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.120 
is received this
process has started.

137
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.250 
what is the ordering of events
decisions and activities? Well this

138
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.960 
can also be answered here.

139
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.740 
Which are the possible outcomes of the
Process? Here we see two possible

140
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:34.590 
outcomes the claim is approved or
the claim is rejected. Also these

141
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.350 
questions can be
answered here.

142
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.410 
So these process models provide
these common language

143
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.330 
of all the roles involved in
process management projects and

144
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.960 
they can agree when I have a
process model like this then it

145
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.220 
is quite easy to answer this
question because there is this

146
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.310 
common language.

147
00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.220 
Alright we can ask or we can ask
and answer even more complex

148
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.400 
questions but then the process model
needs to be a bit more complex.

149
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.020 
Here the process it's
a process about

150
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:14.020 
order fulfillment and here
I have three roles so one,

151
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.400 
Organization. We come to the
details of it later so there are

152
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:23.150 
Sales, warehouse management and logistics
and here we see that activities are

153
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.740 
let’s say a positioned in certain
lanes as we call it. And when an

154
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.980 
activity is in a certain lane that
means the respective organization

155
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.900 
or department is responsible for conducting
this activity or for deciding certain

156
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.170 
Things.

157
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.650 
Alright who is responsible for
conducting which activities?

158
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.310 
Well I can take a look at each
of these activities look at

159
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.560 
in which lane it is and can
decide can answer well who

160
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.050 
and which role is responsible for
conducting a certain activity.

161
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.070 
What is also important in many
projects is studying the

162
00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:05.460 
hand over of work. So hand overall
work means I get a result of a

163
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.250 
work firm search and roll take it, work
on it and post it to another party,

164
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.450 
pass it to a co-worker
for instance.

165
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.570 
And whenever this
sequence flow

166
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:25.410 
sorry whenever the sequence flow
crosses lanes

167
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.380 
crosses a lane it's a division
then a handover of work

168
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.180 
Happens. That happens here, that
happens here, that happens here

169
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.100 
Here and here. So we can study
as well even here.

170
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.310 
So we can study the
hand over of work and

171
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.990 
most of you have seen processes
that had let's say

172
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.380 
opportunities for improvement
when there were too many hand

173
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.410 
overs of work, so whenever there is a hint
over of work there's a chance that

174
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.770 
the process is let's say is
delayed by this handover

175
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.250 
so we would not like to have
too many hand overs of work.

176
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.730 
Who takes which decisions in
the process? Also that is

177
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.380 
that is we can see this
here. There is one

178
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.840 
decision here well that's
automatic decision, here is a decision

179
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.980 
and we can say
the management is in charge

180
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.720 
of this decision so we can answer
a bit more complex questions

181
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.970 
and also we can answer questions
related to the occurrence

182
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.660 
of errors and of handling of errors
and that is this part will

183
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.680 
come to that sorry we come to
that in one of the later

184
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.600 
courses or chapters
of this course.

185
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.930 
Right so the question is we have
seen very simple process models,

186
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.080 
we've seen quite complex
process models.

187
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.010 
Should a process model be
simple or complex? Well of course

188
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.280 
by now you know that the answer is
that depends on the modeling goal.

189
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.180 
A process model should be designed
so that it can answer exactly

190
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.690 
the questions it is meant to answer.
A simple and well readable

191
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:09.050 
process models might suffice for
many of them answers we ask,

192
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.350 
to answer using process models.
But some process models need

193
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:18.390 
to answer complex questions, for instance
regarding detailed working procedures. And

194
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.810 
in our projects we came
across quite a complex process

195
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:28.060 
model I’d like to show you here. It
is expressed as an event driven

196
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.640 
process chain is in EPC and
that's part of the process even

197
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.280 
not a complete one that is part
of the process and we see here

198
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.390 
quite a complex process

199
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.720 
structure that has been used for
detailed for in detail analyzing

200
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.350 
working procedures.

201
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.350 
So but still process models
should always be understandable,

202
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.240 
so that there is a limit or natural
limit to process model complexity.

203
00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:04.600 
And depending on the language you use
to express process models there are

204
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.580 
let's say ways to deal with
complexity in terms of

205
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.700 
hierarchical decomposition
for instance and BPMN is

206
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:18.530 
quite good at that. And so that
most BPMN models will have

207
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:24.330 
let's say complexity like this or a
bit more a bit higher complexity

208
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.890 
but not consisting of hundreds of
nodes as the one we have seen before

209
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.890 
using these abstraction techniques
provided by the language

210
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.420 
functional composition
for instance we can get

211
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.750 
rid about of these very
complex structure processes.

212
00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.630 
And that's important because really
people need also to maintain

213
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.970 
Processes, people need to understand
processes and therefore we should

214
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.840 
be aware that process models
would not suffer from too

215
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.220 
much complexity.

216
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:02.150 
Alright that concludes video
clip 1.3. We took a

217
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.300 
look at business
process models,

218
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.240 
defined what business or the
business process model is,

219
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.350 
we'd investigated
whether the three

220
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.540 
properties of features of models
that we know from modeling

221
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.740 
theory really applied to process
models and we can say yes, process models

222
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.450 
support the
mapping feature

223
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.350 
Elements of the originals are
mapped to the process model.

224
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:34.200 
Also the abstraction feature is supported
not all details of the original process,

225
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.310 
business process that around
in the company are represented

226
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.570 
in the model. Only the ones that are
important for supporting the modeling goal.

227
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.330 
We have the pragmatic features
So that the process model

228
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.210 
can substitute the original
business process as it runs in

229
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:57.900 
the organization and in IT can let’s
say substitute so

230
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:03.780 
this or that a complex process that we
have in reality can be substituted

231
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:08.490 
by the process model for
different purposes, for instance

232
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.320 
for process documentation for
process improvement automation

233
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.790 
of process
monitoring as well.

234
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.790 
Process models can be descriptive
or prescriptive. The early

235
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.980 
phases of projects mostly
descriptive. I described what a process

236
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.780 
looks like. Then I go to improvement and
when I go to improvement

237
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.140 
the process model changes
character from a descriptive

238
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.540 
character to more prescriptive
character, since it prescribes

239
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.400 
how the process should
run in the future.

240
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:41.280 
Why do we do process modeling? Because we
like to answer questions and this is

241
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.000 
how we how we conclude
this video clip.

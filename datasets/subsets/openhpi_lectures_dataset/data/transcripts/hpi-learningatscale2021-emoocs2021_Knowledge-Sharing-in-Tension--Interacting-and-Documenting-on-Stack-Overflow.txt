00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980 
my name is Thomas Hellman. and on behalf of my colleagues alain

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.130 
recco markus nivola and tanja osborne. i'm going to present

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.430 
our work in progress paper knowledge sharing intention interacting

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.410 
and documenting on stack overflow.

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.410 
in this presentation i'm going to talk about platform structures,

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.620 
and the practices of knowledge sharing in relation to one particular kind of platform

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.340 
that we argue integrates aspects of forums such as reddit and

8
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.150 
peer production such as wikipedia.

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.470 
stack overflow is a platform that programmers use

10
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.280 
to post questions and get answers and search for
information about programming problems.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.640 
so the question we ask in this work-in-progress is what specificities

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810 
of attention between interacting and documenting on stack overflow

13
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.100 
can be identified.
to answer that question we looked at our interview data

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.130 
at the postings on stack overflow at the metadata of

15
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.600 
interactions on stack overflow and at the

16
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.360 
discussion of the platform on the metadata stack overflow side platform.

17
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.850 
one of the specificities we identified as important here.

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.670 
are the platform mechanics on stack overflow?

19
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.310 
so stack overflow has a major platform mechanical reputation

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.540 
in terms of proportions the reputation score,

21
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.010 
rewards certain kinds of activities more than others and what

22
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.830 
it tends to reward are activities that lead to

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.090 
greater amounts of posting on the platform? what it tends not to reward

24
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.050 
is editing and refinement of the content.
that's already on the platform.

25
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.490 
these platform mechanics produce sort of competing temporalities

26
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.080 
that are connected to the practices of either knowledge sharing

27
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.730 
through interaction or knowledge they're sharing through the sort of documenting.

28
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.850 
and or we can see here is two profiles for two different users.

29
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.220 
the bars the orange and blue bars are the amount of comments

30
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.730 
answers and questions that they

31
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.070 
post on a monthly basis.

32
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.530 
and the red lines continuous lines are their reputation score.

33
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.080 
and you can see that the reputation score curves are relatively

34
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.970 
similar for both those users,
and yet that posting patterns are extremely difficult,

35
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.030 
or extremely different with the top user consistently posting

36
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.220 
throughout their career on stack overflow with their reputation gaining.

37
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.550 
and the lower user on the bottom posting a lot during their

38
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.670 
first few months on the platform, and then trailing off to posting

39
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.230 
very little after that. but their reputation school continues to grow.

40
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.280 
and the reason it continues to grow is because they keep getting up votes

41
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.640 
on content they posted early during their career.

42
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.360 
and in this case what's happened is that over sometimes
a period of seven or eight years

43
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.720 
other users have edited the answers that this user has made to improve them.

44
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.630 
and refine them and keep the knowledge in them up to date.

45
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.770 
so that they continue to be useful to other users and so people have continued to

46
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.690 
upvote those answers with that knowledge in them.

47
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.750 
despite the fact that in some cases, the original poster

48
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.050 
has written very little of what remains of the knowledge that shed.

49
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.110 
to conclude platform mechanics reward a fast pace of interaction

50
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.480 
with users quickly answering each other's questions on stack overflow.

51
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.150 
at the same time distributed editing features make a slower

52
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.530 
temporality of knowledge sharing possible where users refine

53
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.950 
and update information over periods that can span years sometimes.

54
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.190 
well we recognize this as a tension as researchers and members

55
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.740 
recognize it as a concern it may actually be necessary for

56
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.270 
the functioning of this type of platform, because it allows for

57
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.760 
massive amounts of content to be added and also for the maintenance

58
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.420 
of the quality of that content.

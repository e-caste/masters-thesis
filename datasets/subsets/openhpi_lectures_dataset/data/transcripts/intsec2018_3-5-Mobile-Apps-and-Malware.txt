1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.680 
When we introduced
attacks by malware,

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.260 
we mentioned that
malware is not only a

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.610 
problem for computer
systems and laptops,

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.630 
it's also a problem
for mobile systems.

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.660 
So now we want to have
a look at mobile apps

6
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.970 
and malware. Let's start with
reminding of you as there are two

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.630 
popular operating systems
for mobile systems.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.770 
There is on the one side of the Android
operating system, on the other

9
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.080 
side of the IOS
system, and

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.540 
for both operating systems,
there is a huge platform

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.610 
where the users of that
operating system can

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.920 
download apps. This is the google
play for the Android operating

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.470 
system, and its apple app store
for the Apple IOS users,

14
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.520 
and these platforms become
more and more important.

15
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.830 
There is a huge amount of apps
that could be downloaded

16
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.980 
from that platform. So
here is the number in

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.470 
last year from
March 2017,

18
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.120 
there are almost three million
apps which could be downloaded

19
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.970 
from google play
store and there are

20
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.810 
more than two million apps that
are available in the apple

21
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.750 
app store. Here are
some illustrations of

22
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.860 
which version of this
operating system is used.

23
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.200 
So the early versions are of
course much more unsecure than

24
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.240 
the new versions. And here you can
see when we look for an example

25
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.990 
to Android. The last
version is the version 8.

26
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.940 
There is not very much distributed
he the older versions

27
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.750 
five to seven. This is the
biggest amount of people that

28
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.700 
are using this state of
the operating system,

29
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.950 
and the same is true
for the iOS system.

30
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.440 
Here the latest version. It's
used by half of the people,

31
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.120 
a little bit more than half
of the people. And former

32
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.830 
the amount of people that use
former operating system

33
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.760 
versions are relatively large.
And this has consequences for

34
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.240 
the security. So if one
should update the system

35
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.860 
on the latest version, but in
the context of mobile systems

36
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.180 
that's not easy, because
some of the windows

37
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.620 
have a attack to the operating
system which they use some

38
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.850 
the additional
functionality.

39
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.530 
So if there is a new the update
of the operating system,

40
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.330 
this will not work for the
additional functionality,

41
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.150 
so such windows
can only provide

42
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.920 
a updates and not fast enough.
Some basic concepts. As basic

43
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.580 
concept how such an app comes
to such app store and how are

44
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.460 
the other controls
which are behind.

45
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.640 
This publication of an app is a
everyone， every develop around

46
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.820 
the world is invited to develop
apps and what the developer

47
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.860 
must do is to a put his app
which is developed by him

48
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.530 
to such an app store. He must log
in, to the respective store.

49
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.090 
Then the App is
electronically signed

50
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.860 
by the developer, so that's
clear and can not be faked

51
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.260 
that App comes from this
person or this company.

52
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.230 
This is done to prevent,
also to prevent

53
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.320 
an intentional changes. And then
you see a store operators or

54
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.240 
become active. As they
start to review the app.

55
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.500 
Particularly is they
look for malicious

56
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.470 
behaviors whether they
are some are malware

57
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.210 
hidden or some mal
functionality in this app.

58
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.670 
And then the app, if they
have been managed.

59
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.720 
It also is tested then
published and are

60
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.050 
available for download
from the platform.

61
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.980 
The apps on systems on the mobile
devices run in separate environments，

62
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.260 
so unauthorized access to
the data or to other apps

63
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.860 
is in this way prevented.
So using one app

64
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.100 
it's not possible to form
that app to access data

65
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.760 
or to do some interaction
with other apps.

66
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.650 
Of course, there are some defined
interactions. For example,

67
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.260 
that certain data can be received,
but this is controlled

68
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.260 
and exactly described for data
system. So information exchanging

69
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.430 
is enabled. For example,
access to contact

70
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.340 
in contacts data of address
book or is the access

71
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.810 
to some other, for example the
weather information and so on.

72
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.390 
This is defined
through interfaces.

73
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.740 
And when the app is installed,
the user has to exactly

74
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.940 
given allowens. For example,
this app is allowed

75
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.930 
to access data from the address
book. This app is exactly

76
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.140 
loaded to access the
localization or others.

77
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.170 
So the authorization
is done here to

78
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.910 
platforms. You see that
if there is an app

79
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.580 
usage, then the
user can give

80
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.780 
detailed authorizations.
The user

81
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.690 
as authorization, as organizations
loaded to the user

82
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.950 
to determine what information
an app is allowed to access

83
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.540 
from his oral system. So a commonly
requested authorizations

84
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.860 
are for location getting
access to data location

85
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.780 
data, getting access to the camera,
getting access to the camera means

86
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.490 
also, the images which are
taken by the camera,

87
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.150 
access to the address
book and contacts them.

88
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.210 
The authorizations are
requested by an app

89
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.690 
should be checked, should
be that simply say yes,

90
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.570 
it should be checked and
it should be limited

91
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.810 
to set things that are
necessary for that.

92
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.050 
So be careful with the
installation process and make

93
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.810 
responsible decisions
what you are allowed

94
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:15.210 
and what you are not allowed.
Sometimes if you do not allow some

95
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.360 
functions as if you do
allow to some data

96
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.930 
some functionality of the
app, may be affected,

97
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.520 
and someone has to carefully think
whether this functionality

98
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.700 
is more important than giving
existing authorizations writes

99
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.820 
to the app that this
functionality can be used.

100
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.020 
So beside to
both mentioned

101
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:49.140 
app stores, like apple app
store and google play,

102
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.760 
they are alternative app
stores. The great variety

103
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.510 
you can find the
way you can

104
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.050 
download particulary of
falls and treat systems.

105
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.400 
Their many alternative
app stores to be abled.

106
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.470 
But here comes the problem. To
be able to use alternative

107
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:17.110 
app stores. One must allow to
install it from an unknown source.

108
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.310 
and this is every time
dangerous. If you do not know

109
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.270 
what is the source of the
data or other data.

110
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.000 
For example for malicious
functionality or others.

111
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:38.240 
Usually no extensive checks, rather than
are carried out for such alternative

112
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.890 
stores. Here are a list of
such stores where you see

113
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.830 
that they are also
a gave number

114
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.940 
of total samples, and often
also malware functionality

115
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.110 
is found in some of the
apps which are provided

116
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.340 
by this alternative stores. So
you should be very careful,

117
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.620 
on the best way, you're doing it to take
an app from app store on your system

118
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:15.760 
from such alternative app
stores. There is some mobile

119
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.770 
malwares in place.
Malwares that

120
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:27.380 
mainly are used for stealing
money which methods are

121
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.750 
typically used in this a
mobile world by means of

122
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.380 
malware. so for example,
a premium sms are sent,

123
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:42.330 
click fraud is preformed or
look in data are stolen

124
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.640 
particularly for online banking.
But they are more money just

125
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.710 
functionality, for example,
location tracking,

126
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.980 
theft of private data and information,
for example, pictures or

127
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.150 
contacts. Later on, for
example, to publish

128
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.650 
such pictures into mapped to
play with a person or others,

129
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.210 
automaticly downloading
of other apps is done.

130
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.260 
This is a typical
functionality and ideas

131
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.520 
behind malware in
the mobile world.

132
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.400 
here are some examples
of such moblie malware

133
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.890 
text. Mobile malware

134
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:27.800 
then through it is an application
for remote maintenance

135
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.530 
that can be used, can be misused
with malicious content.

136
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.370 
So dense rate was developed with
the intention of by passing

137
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.690 
the google play store or security
check and if someone wants

138
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.190 
to do this. It's clear
that there are bad ideas

139
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.730 
or inter bank, so malware can
be imbedded and distributed

140
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.640 
over benign apps, so apps that
provides something good

141
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.920 
for the people and insists
apps some malware.

142
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:09.270 
So the app contains the
following functions,

143
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.960 
the dendroid apps

144
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.170 
It's possible to intercept
and to block SMS,

145
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.700 
to capture photos, to
capture videos and sound,

146
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:25.000 
to recall the telephone
conversations, to spy out the user.

147
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.160 
Another example of a
mobile and malware

148
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:35.020 
is ExpensiveWall that is a new
version of some malware family

149
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.680 
that trojanizes varies
apps. In september

150
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.340 
2017 security
researchers defied

151
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.760 
50 different infected apps
which were downloaded between

152
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.570 
1 million and 4.2
million times.

153
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.510 
So as a huge number
of people which are

154
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.480 
affected by this malware,
by downloading,

155
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.560 
by downloading apps where
exists an ExpensiveWall

156
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:13.740 
the malware was hidden. So
malware is ExpensiveWall

157
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:19.020 
malware uses a different kinds
of obfuscation techniques

158
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.320 
to weights, google play's
built-in anti-malware

159
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.720 
protection, so the objective
said that malware has

160
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.410 
started to register victims,
to premium services,

161
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:39.450 
to send premium SMS messages to
take out their money without that

162
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.310 
people are aware
of this.

163
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.410 
So Vulnerabilities in the
mobile operating systems

164
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.110 
I have already mentioned this point
when we start to discuss about

165
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:56.430 
mobile malware, not only malware
apps have security risks for

166
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:00.760 
mobile system, but also
mobile vulnerabilities

167
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:06.490 
of an operating system.
So the problem with a

168
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.320 
freely available on
to read system is

169
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.280 
that it's often customized by
a smartphone manufacturers

170
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.620 
that installs their
own functionality

171
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.480 
to get users to be attracted
to buy their smartphones.

172
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.460 
and this addition
original functionality

173
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.160 
makes it difficult to
update operating system.

174
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.270 
So the update for such
a customized system

175
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:43.730 
needs to come from the
smartphone manufacturer

176
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.270 
which have been
implemented

177
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.490 
such customized functionality.
So often and treat update for

178
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.830 
and to read system is
available. But cannot be

179
00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.230 
taken for systems with
this additional

180
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.570 
functionality. Because the
division of functionalities were

181
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:08.650 
destroyed, therefore most
of Android smartphones

182
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.750 
do not receive
extensive updates

183
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.300 
to address the
weakness.

184
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.680 
IOS usually earlier only runs
on app devices like IPhone

185
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.820 
and IPad. So this is simplifying
the development updates.

186
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.920 
So here as soon as about
narrative is known

187
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.720 
and update can be
produced to resolve

188
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.500 
this attack, to
resolve the

189
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:46.340 
attack possibility. So the most
device can receive regular updates

190
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.200 
as long as the device
is still supported.

191
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.040 
Also here we see problems
that many people use

192
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.180 
urge devices that many
people use devices with

193
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.830 
operating system, with IOS
systems which are not updated.

194
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.720 
here are some common
vulnerabilities android systems.

195
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.370 
So the stagefright to
point Vulnerability

196
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.780 
affects the multimedia server
component of Android.

197
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.480 
It makes it possible
to abuse,

198
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.790 
to abuse possible
vulnerability via MMS

199
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:33.810 
messages, and any app
supporting this multimedia

200
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:39.860 
content. See stagefright malware
enables the execution of

201
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.420 
malware and extension of rights.
So there is tension of

202
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.270 
rights without knowledge of the
user, so all android versions

203
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.390 
prior to version 5.1.1

204
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.700 
where vulnerable by
this vulneraty

205
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:03.580 
and if one counts the systems
then more than one billion

206
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:09.430 
devices are affected. This
was an estimation in octobe

207
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.510 
2015 from this
vulnerability.

208
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.850 
So you see the reasons
version is eight,

209
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.410 
So one should update an also
operating systems version.

210
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.390 
Similarly, vulnerabilities
are discovered and patched

211
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.970 
by a google, so every
month up to to a new

212
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:38.380 
two new patches are
available. But you see

213
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.680 
patches are available
two years later,

214
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.710 
then it was seen
and distributed.

215
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.820 
So phone manufacturers do not
apply a security updates from

216
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.440 
google for Andriod systems. Because
we have already mentioned

217
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.370 
functionality, customized
functionality

218
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.230 
and this gives an
additional problem

219
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.480 
that all the vulnerabilities
are already found.

220
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.440 
and that could
be patched and

221
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:15.010 
remain untouched due
to an attitude.

222
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.260 
what are protective measures to
secure, to protect your mobile

223
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.820 
system, first protect data, protect
data in the case of theft

224
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.660 
of the device
in case of

225
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:37.140 
attack, so that you can
restore your data.

226
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.480 
This is a connection data,
this is you messages

227
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:49.020 
and other systems. Then one
should be enable encryption

228
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.450 
as long as possible. One
should use these smart phone

229
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.010 
with the PIN,
his password

230
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.570 
which is needed to unlock. This
prevents if people are able

231
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:10.350 
to steal your smartphone, then
they not immediately have access

232
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.250 
to the data. You're opposing
the data that are stored on

233
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.870 
the device. Then update apps,
update operating system

234
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.580 
as most are reasoned apps
they have a mechanism

235
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.300 
to automatically update as themself
as an update is available.

236
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.680 
But we can switch of
this mechanisms.

237
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.170 
Here to have irregular
updates of the apps

238
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.660 
and of separating system
which should be noted.

239
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.240 
When purchasing devices ensure
that operating system,

240
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.540 
is still supported and corresponding
updates are available.

241
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.470 
Sometimes there are some devices
which seems very cheap

242
00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.490 
to buy this device, but if I
check these devices, but finds

243
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.250 
out that the operating system
which is installed on

244
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:10.100 
mobile devices is not a
resonable one, is an old

245
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.350 
one, and even worse it belongs
to group of versions that are

246
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.370 
no more supported, that
means that are no more

247
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.960 
in patches are provided
for that system.

248
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:29.220 
Then install that's very important
in apps store only from

249
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.140 
trustworthy sources,
install and download

250
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:40.190 
apps only from google play
store, from the apple

251
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:45.940 
store. It because these are
officially stores and

252
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:53.870 
large security mechanism
behind. So if this windows,

253
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.890 
if google or apple knows
that their apps are

254
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.740 
stored and distributed
over their stores,

255
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.580 
then they have a lot of
mechanisms in place

256
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:14.040 
to guarantee that their apps
do not contain malware.

257
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:21.260 
then look closely at
authorizations that requests

258
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.630 
by each app, not simply, if a
s c exactly what's necessary

259
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.690 
which data are
needed to use

260
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:36.770 
a password to be sure
that it's not stolen,

261
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.120 
a password that when
people can theft

262
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.410 
our smartphones that
they can get access

263
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.520 
to your online banking
restricts unnecessary

264
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:53.600 
authorizations. so
similar also only use

265
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.740 
apps set you really need. So
this is a couple of protective

266
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.710 
measures of absolute
security is impossible.

267
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.880 
But if you follows
this advices,

268
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:12.290 
It helps you to have a better
feeling about security

269
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.890 
of your system and if you are doubt,
then with an app said something

270
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.830 
is wrong or you have
not good feeling，

271
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.940 
then search for an alternative
app, if you needed.

272
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.940 
So this will help you
to prevent attacks

273
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.740 
from mobile malware.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.099 
Now we want to discuss the topic, privacy in the context of smartphones

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.535 
and the usage of smartphones.

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.273 
Smartphones are constantly with us, they have become an inseparable

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.670 
companion, they store and generate huge amounts of personal

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.269 
data in all these apps you and I have

6
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.620 
in our smartphones. These are calls, these are messages, our contact

7
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.550 
data, emails and many other more.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.038 
Usage statistics of everything the smartphone does, if you run

9
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.969 
an app, then typically data are produced around that app

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.961 
and a few of them are stored at the smartphone themselves,

11
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.619 
they also are stored in the cloud.

12
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.240 
Behind the smartphone there is movement data, GPS,

13
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.140 
Wireless LAN positioning, GSM location by cellular

14
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.689 
networks and activity data, activity data like from your

15
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.459 
step counters that currently work in almost any smartphone

16
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.609 
using the acceleration sensor.

17
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.418 
So, all this data and you see it's a great variety of data, are produced

18
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.211 
and are stored on your smartphone or on the cloud

19
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.959 
behind that. And in that moment I didn't speak about the personal

20
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.620 
data like photos and videos, which are

21
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.569 
so easy to take with the smartphone.

22
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.930 
What are risk around it?

23
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.467 
So, one risk is the online synchronisation.

24
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.559 
Smartphones often perform data synchronisation over

25
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.120 
the Internet. For example, iPhones with

26
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.330 
iCloud, data are stored in the cloud.

27
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.519 
With Android systems data are stored in the Google cloud behind.

28
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.439 
And this is important because a small smartphone themselves have

29
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.259 
only limited computation and storage power.

30
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.769 
So, the was a huge power of the small devices

31
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.310 
comes from the fact that behind the smartphone

32
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.229 
there are clouds used with a huge amount of computation

33
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.969 
and storage power and without knowledge of the user this

34
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.273 
data are stored in the cloud and are taken from

35
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.810 
the cloud permanently.

36
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.279 
So, all user settings, for example, all applications and all application

37
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.709 
data are also stored online.

38
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.449 
Otherwise your applications would not work and could not be so

39
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.949 
powerful. So online account allows access also

40
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.990 
to other devices, this is a big advantage.

41
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.789 
If you take another device, pad or laptop,

42
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.009 
you can access the same data as with your

43
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.842 
smartphone. So, this idea to

44
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.380 
store data in the cloud behind the smartphone

45
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.139 
has several advantages.

46
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.719 
It allows that even with the small devices limited and computation

47
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.479 
and storage power, huge computation can be done.

48
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.189 
So, the smartphone is only used to send to user data, to the cloud application

49
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.719 
and to receive the results.

50
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.029 
It is also possible by means of this mechanisms that we can access

51
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.249 
our data from different devices.

52
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.848 
If the data would be stored on a smartphone or on

53
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.939 
tablet, then you need to connect it to the smartphone or to this tablet

54
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.769 
to get access to the data. So, this online account provides

55
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.632 
a lot of advantages, data is also safe

56
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.890 
when a local backup is lost, when the device

57
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.469 
get defect and the data can be restored from anywhere

58
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.059 
in the event of loss or damages.

59
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.669 
But there are also disadvantages, for example, the storage of the data

60
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.203 
on the Internet carries the risk of data theft, an attacker

61
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.179 
can install and delete applications, can recover and destroy data,

62
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.569 
can unlock phone and other things.

63
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.541 
So, the control over the data in the cloud is not

64
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.041 
on the same level like the control of data on your device.

65
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.354 
By the way, you cannot switch off this.

66
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.350 
So, the access to the Apple App Store

67
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.816 
or the access to the Google Play store, for example, in order to

68
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.010 
install applications is without an online account

69
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.309 
technically very complicated.

70
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.309 
I would say it's not possible at all.

71
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.129 
So, this mechanism is needed to make to make smartphones

72
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.423 
so powerful as described.

73
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.139 
Let's have a look on an attack example, an attack

74
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.582 
on Matt Honan and an

75
00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:20.759 
author at Wired.com. This is a journal with a lot of technical insights in that world.

76
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.226 
So, here is a writer for that genre and

77
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.168 
hackers used a stolen Apple ID from him to

78
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.079 
delete all data on Matt's MacBook, on Matt's iPhone,

79
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.199 
iPad and also his online backups.

80
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.720 
Let's have a closer look at this attack,

81
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.250 
because it shows where are attack points.

82
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.350 
So, the attackers wanted to take over Matt's Twitter account.

83
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.139 
Twitter account contained information about personal website.

84
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.959 
Using the "whois" service attackers found out matt's postal address

85
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.509 
and private Gmail address.

86
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.469 
This "whois" a service that allows the retrieval and storege of data

87
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.769 
from domain owners. Here in that case, this was the

88
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.109 
data of Matt's personal website.

89
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.408 
By means of the Gmail accounts password recovery, the attacker

90
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.560 
found the email address of the Apple ID.

91
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.327 
The Gmail says "we sent

92
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.329 
an email to.." and then there is a kind of anonymization,

93
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.839 
but the attackers were able to discover full address

94
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.745 
because they know the name of Matt Honan and

95
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.070 
they could fill this missing part.

96
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.119 
Then the attacker knew, they knew

97
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.195 
the name, they knew the postal address, they know the

98
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.402 
private Gmail address and the email for the Apple

99
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.170 
ID.

100
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.220 
With this information, the next step in the attack, the attacker contacted Amazon

101
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.248 
and associates a new credit card with Matt's account

102
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.530 
at Amazon.

103
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.742 
Then the attacker contacted Amazon again, got the password

104
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.810 
restored. This it's possible by knowing the previously added

105
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.616 
credit card number, this is taken for security that the

106
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.829 
one who asked for the password restoring

107
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.069 
that he/she knows the credit card number.

108
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.303 
And then attacker found the last four digits of

109
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.699 
a genuine Matt Honan credit card on the Amazon account.

110
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.040 
The attacker know knew name of postal address,

111
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.199 
private Gmail address, email of the Apple ID and last

112
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.503 
four digits of Matt Honan's credit card number.

113
00:08:08.308 --> 00:08:12.660 
With that information the attacker contacted AppleCare

114
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.954 
and got access to the AppleID by knowing the names, address, email

115
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.279 
address and last four digits of the credit card number.

116
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.109 
This is what the one who requests

117
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.166 
such an AppleID must know and with

118
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.889 
the aid of the Apple ID and access to Apple's mail account,

119
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:41.079 
then the attacker reset, reset the Gmail password

120
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.400 
and then also the Twitter password and deleted all

121
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.220 
data from iPhone, from iPad and from MacBook, from

122
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.440 
Matt Hanon. So, you see a careful interplay

123
00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.430 
between the different services and help had helped

124
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.214 
the attackers to get access to Matt Hanon's

125
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:11.049 
devices and to make Hannon's account

126
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.380 
to delete data.

127
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.279 
Of course, this is a great energy which was spent

128
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:23.199 
to to perform this attack it was a smart

129
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.944 
attack and Matt Hennan reconstructed this and documented

130
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:32.709 
it in detail so that we could show this to you.

131
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.650 
Another risk, our applications, apps that are run

132
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.975 
on smartphone in addition to the online synchronisation

133
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.369 
of the smartphones, each application can synchronise the

134
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.907 
data with its own server because the smartphone and the

135
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.841 
the cloud of the smartphone, as is it is the Apple cloud or

136
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.250 
the Google cloud, they provide the possibility

137
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.019 
for the user to install applications from different

138
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.058 
providers, so also by means of the online synchronisation with

139
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.019 
the Apple or Google cloud, all the data

140
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.820 
to the server of that applications owner are exchanged.

141
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.300 
So, each app, you know, does have different data protection policy.

142
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.512 
They come from different countries, they are in different ways

143
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.360 
careful with the data.

144
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.639 
So apps can, for example, also access user data from other applications

145
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.079 
they can access, sometimes they need to be able to access GPS

146
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.277 
information or camera.

147
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.399 
And this, what kind of other applications

148
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.200 
that can get data access, this

149
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.830 
depends on these so-called authorisations.

150
00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.889 
So, for example, in case of Android operational system, the possible

151
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.124 
required authorisation can be displayed during the installation of

152
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:15.249 
the application. So, here is an example that shows the information

153
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:19.720 
behind and it shows exactly to which data

154
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.549 
is the application has accessed in this case to the

155
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.320 
device and app history, to photos, media files,

156
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:34.201 
to the Wi-Fi connection information to Bluetooth connection information, and to

157
00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:36.519 
device I.D.

158
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.599 
and call information.

159
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.239 
Typically, the user has a possibility to say yes

160
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.009 
or no, if in the course of installation of an application

161
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.259 
is the question, it comes to him/her.

162
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.229 
But for many applications, authorizations' are needed otherwise

163
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.910 
they will not work. Here's an example, Flashlight app

164
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.669 
that wants to have access to camera and location

165
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.570 
information. So, the question is, is it necessary to allow

166
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.849 
a flashlight to get to know where is the place

167
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.310 
that people are user is standing?

168
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.219 
So, in Android it's possible to block individual

169
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.690 
authorisations and this is possible

170
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.800 
at least since the version 6.0.

171
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.543 
So, 6.0 and higher they allow

172
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.939 
here are to, for example, deny in the case of this flashlight

173
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.510 
app,deny location data.

174
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.240 
So, privacy guard on LineageOS

175
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.609 
can have more options.

176
00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.129 
In case of Apple, iOS operating sys tem for

177
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.509 
the smartphone, also Apple iOS allows blocking of

178
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.299 
the authorization in the settings.

179
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.672 
But many users are not aware of this and are not

180
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.740 
critical enough if they allow an application access

181
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.710 
to other data of other applications.

182
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.170 
Every time remember the fleshlight example, which shows that,

183
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.179 
for example, access to the camera or access to the location

184
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:36.100 
data are completely unnecessary for the purpose of that application.

185
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.638 
But the designer of this app often designs

186
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.640 
the app only for the case, only for getting data

187
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.179 
back from the users.

188
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.629 
So, application authorizations only control the access to

189
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:57.270 
the data. So, the Internet access should actually be

190
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.289 
separately controlled for individual applications, for example,

191
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.759 
by using a firewall, but not possible, this is not

192
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.460 
possible with standard tools of smartphones.

193
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.921 
As a user without this information and this

194
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.509 
expertise, it is impossible or very difficult

195
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.649 
to do this. So here, for example, an app

196
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:29.499 
called AFWall+ on android requires route access

197
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.516 
to install such and to select such

198
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.190 
authorizations.

199
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.149 
So, the firewall IP for iOS is only

200
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.049 
available after a jailbreak.

201
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.860 
So, for the typical user, this is not

202
00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.797 
viable and so the typical user has to live with the standard settings and

203
00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.769 
is not able to do individual settings.

204
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.821 
What is unavoidable for the users, the monitoring

205
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.377 
by the manufacturer and back doors.

206
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.559 
For example, here are some examples that happened in the past.

207
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.831 
So, popular example from 2011 was that all

208
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.440 
location data of the iPhone was saved in the

209
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.474 
"consolidated.db" file and then sent

210
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.110 
to Apple. So Apple completely

211
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.870 
gets access to the location data of the owner

212
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.090 
of the iPhone.

213
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.399 
2014, there was another event that become popular

214
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.807 
and shows how problematic situation is with

215
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.140 
privacy in smartphones.

216
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.360 
The developers of the "Replicant", it is a free Android

217
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.300 
distribution, claim that all Samsung Galaxy smartphones

218
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.499 
have a backdoor in the modern software, which

219
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.159 
allows access to the file system.

220
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.190 
In 2016, Xiaomi can remotely install apps

221
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.959 
on customers devices without knowledge and without

222
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.990 
agreement of the devices.

223
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.087 
In 2017, OnePlus2 is sending fine

224
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.130 
grained usage statistics of application usage and users behaviour

225
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.200 
to the cloud. Of course, many of the things are created to

226
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.359 
improve the quality of the service, to improve, to better know

227
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.990 
the user and to adapt

228
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.100 
different offers to the real wishes and needs of the users.

229
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.210 
But this need to be done in in an open,

230
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.349 
transparent way so that the user has a chance to say yes or no.

231
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:11.979 
There are more things that are unavoidable for the users.

232
00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:16.809 
For example, mobile tracking by cellular network and

233
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.250 
data retention.

234
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.950 
In order to be able to make a call to the

235
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:29.170 
cellular network must be able to determine the current cell

236
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440 
of the cell phone.

237
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.499 
For example, to know exactly where is the

238
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.513 
user that wants to make a telephone call,

239
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.838 
what is the closest cell or what

240
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.947 
is the cell he/she is able to locate,

241
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:54.819 
because this is necessary. Otherwise the system could not receive

242
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:59.619 
the call and then to call and

243
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.319 
and provide the connection to the user.

244
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:07.450 
So, the telecommunication providers in most European countries, they are obliged

245
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.550 
to store such traffic data and connection data

246
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.150 
for specific time periods.

247
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.959 
This is in connection with the security question that is public security and with

248
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.520 
the idea to be able to to

249
00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.625 
investigate criminal activities.

250
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.858 
But in this way, data from other

251
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:38.170 
persons is also stored and can be seen.

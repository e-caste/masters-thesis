1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.050 
The internet is really a popular
target for cybercriminals and

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.690 
the question is why such a
global use infrastructure

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.870 
which is used for business,
politics, for communication

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.600 
provides security problems
at all. There are some

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.750 
reasons and one of these reasons
is the internet began as

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.870 
a research project. So it was
never designed for this global

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.360 
usage. It was designed into a
research project, the question

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.310 
was whether it's possible to
provide a network infrastructure

9
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.890 
that makes it possible
to exchange

10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.030 
files, to exchange messages over
computers from different vendors

11
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.160 
with different operating
system and others.

12
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
In this research project which
developed the ideas of internet,

13
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.390 
this was a small research
community, there was a trust

14
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.610 
among these people,
they knew each other

15
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
and for that reason
every time it was said

16
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.890 
let's start first to investigate
the question how it's possible

17
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.080 
to solve the research
question - the communication

18
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.670 
between different systems.
Security was not a primary

19
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.180 
consideration in the development
and one can see this

20
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.220 
if one looks through the internet
protocols because there's a typical

21
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.060 
statement which says here the
security questions are not

22
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
considered in this memo. This are
typical sentence in the RFCs,

23
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.830 
the request for comments
which provide the standards

24
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.620 
for the internet. Another reason
is that there is no single

25
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.270 
organization, no internet
authority, there is no government

26
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.940 
agency or no other
agency and authority

27
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.290 
that control the complete
internet. For that reason

28
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
there is a lot of
possibilities to attack this

29
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.340 
because a lot of security problems
are in this infrastructure.

30
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.210 
And the success of the internet of
course makes it a popular target

31
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.290 
for attacks because of
the huge amount of

32
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.650 
e-commerce offers
and services,

33
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.620 
online banking and others, this
of course is very attractive

34
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.810 
for cybercriminals to
try to use, to misuse

35
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.350 
the security problems of the
internet to get some advantage,

36
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.730 
to break in to data, to steal
money or other things.

37
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.810 
The internet and related
communication technologies

38
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.620 
which are the key technologies
of the modern information

39
00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.840 
society, this is meanwhile
a complete global

40
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.590 
used infrastructure. The explosive
expansion starts in the early

41
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.860 
90s, it starts when
the world wide web

42
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.960 
service was designed which
were used by many people

43
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.370 
since it was so easy
to use the web,

44
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.140 
at least with web browsers,
with graphic interfaces.

45
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.460 
First was designed
by NCSA

46
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.630 
the mosaic browser which
was introduced in 93-94.

47
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.720 
Industry and business make
ample use of the potentials

48
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.800 
of the internet and todays communication
possibilities though the

49
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.950 
internet became a global market -
for commercial activity, for

50
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.400 
private applications.
For that reason

51
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.180 
the success of the internet
makes this such an attractive

52
00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:03.460 
target for cyber criminals.
There are some different

53
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.330 
dangers when one is using
the internet. Some of the

54
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.050 
risks to use the internet and
to use IT technology at all

55
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.210 
is that the computers and systems
themselves provide possibilities

56
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.600 
which give cybercriminals
a chance to break it.

57
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.620 
Another important point
which allow cybercrime

58
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.770 
crimenals to attack the
services and systems

59
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.440 
are the connections of the
systems of IT systems with the

60
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.270 
internet. The third reason
is that many companies

61
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.540 
use internet technologies for
internal communication and for

62
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.410 
internal service. This internally
used internets are called

63
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.350 
intranets. So, all the possibilities
to attack an internet

64
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.010 
provide also possibilities
to attack an intranet.

65
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.760 
The internet is an easy target.
There are billions of entry points

66
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.690 
worldwide. There are millions of
interconnected networks and

67
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.270 
for the different networks, network
administrators are responsible,

68
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.870 
they are responsible for
the security. There is no

69
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.910 
authority which checks security
inside such a network before

70
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.210 
it is allowed to be
connected to the internet.

71
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.810 
There are many design and
programming errors due to the

72
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.380 
very fast development
of new IT services

73
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.120 
and often such programming
errors can be misused by

74
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.910 
the attackers to break into a
system or to do something wrong.

75
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.430 
There is really a large
number of such security

76
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.540 
gaps and often there are hacking
tools which are easily

77
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.190 
available over the internet that
exactly misuse such a security

78
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.770 
gap to give their users the
possibility to break into

79
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.520 
a network or to steal data
or to manipulate data.

80
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.890 
These hacking tools that can easily
be accessed over the internet

81
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.070 
also are easy to use.
So often there is no

82
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.900 
huge knowledge necessary to use,
to misuse such an hacking tools

83
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.250 
and to attack systems
over the internet.

84
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.660 
Here is this chart
shows over the years

85
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.860 
that the knowledge curve that is
needed by the cybercriminals

86
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.420 
to successfully attack
an IT system goes down

87
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.320 
because the tools which support
them are more and more powerful

88
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.180 
often they work in
an automated way.

89
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.750 
Here are different
attacks. So

90
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.560 
in our course we will discuss
various of these different attacks

91
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.650 
and look into more details. But
here in the introduction is

92
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.060 
as important to see that also
un-educated cyber criminals

93
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:29.060 
can perform successful attacks
by using such hacking

94
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.010 
tools available over the internet.
The internet is not only an

95
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.010 
easy target. There
is also provided

96
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.390 
a multitude of targets. The
internet in internet based system

97
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.460 
of many different
targets and risks.

98
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.800 
I already mentioned computer
systems themselves, for example

99
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.050 
the PC, the laptop, the
smartphone, the smart watches

100
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.200 
all are systems and sometimes
manipulations of this system

101
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:06.150 
helps the attacker to
perform an attack

102
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.330 
on system via this IT, via
these computer systems.

103
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.920 
There are local networks and
there are intermediate systems

104
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:21.530 
that connect the different
networks to the net of nets

105
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.250 
as the internet is which
provide possibilities

106
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.370 
for attacks. And the
usage of the internet

107
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.190 
technology inside private
networks - so called intranets,

108
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.480 
make it possible that all the
attack possibilities against

109
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.780 
the internet protocols
can also be applied in

110
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.950 
such private environment for
companies and institutions.

111
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.720 
So, attacks over the internet
are easy to realize,

112
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.870 
can be done with relatively
little detection risk

113
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.750 
and are difficult to
trace. This anonymity

114
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:11.300 
and this possibility to do
this with a small detection

115
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:16.560 
risk is a kind of invitation
for cyber criminals

116
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.660 
to attack systems, to steal
data, to steal identities,

117
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.680 
to misuse banking
account information

118
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.850 
and others. There are increased
opportunities for successful

119
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.730 
attacks on the internet.
To mention a few of them

120
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.350 
first internet has becomes the
central infrastructure of modern

121
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:45.570 
society, so all parts of
society life, all parts

122
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.150 
of business life are interconnected
by means of the internet.

123
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.360 
So the complexity of the
internet, the complexity of the

124
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.690 
internet protocols and the
many many applications

125
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.670 
is constantly growing and we
depend more and more on the

126
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:09.060 
internet, on the right functionality
of all these applications

127
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.780 
that are available over the internet.
The increasing popularity

128
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.670 
of e-commerce offers, of online
banking, shopping, social media,

129
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.470 
e-learning, e-government
and others

130
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:29.240 
make this a popular target
for cyber criminals.

131
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.260 
Often cyber criminals are very
well prepared. So often it's a

132
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:39.970 
form of the organized
criminality and the tools

133
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:46.090 
that are available for the attackers
become increasingly sophisticated.

134
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:51.330 
They become more and more easy
to use, they work in automated

135
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:57.190 
fashion, so that in a short
time with relatively small

136
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:03.070 
knowledge cyber criminals can
use these sophisticated tools

137
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:08.340 
to attack services or
systems over the internet.

138
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.480 
The development of new computer
hardware, but even more the

139
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.760 
development of computer
software, of applications

140
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.480 
that is done in a very
hard competition.

141
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:31.620 
First is a winner. So
there is a very strong

142
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.250 
demand to come with new
ideas with new services

143
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.840 
and this hurry often is
a reason that many

144
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:46.520 
failures, many errors are inside
the new services which provide

145
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.690 
vulnerabilities, which
later on can be misused

146
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:57.350 
by cyber criminals. Most of time
attacks use known weaknesses

147
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.870 
or configuration errors so
sometimes it's said 90%,

148
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.610 
95% of all the attacks
could be prevented

149
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.080 
if the systems would
have been updated

150
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.350 
so that the known vulnerabilities
do not provide more entrance

151
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:23.490 
points for attackers. So the
configuration errors of

152
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:29.090 
the huge systems are often a
problem, there are security

153
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.270 
software installed that
is not been updated.

154
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.440 
So most of the attacks
could be prevented

155
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.560 
if one would
take more care

156
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:45.070 
in this respect. But there is
another reason that cyber attacks

157
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.550 
are so successful. There
is a lack of awareness.

158
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:53.000 
Of awareness and of knowledge
in information security

159
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:59.390 
so only a small number of
qualified security personnel

160
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.590 
is in place, that are responsible
for systems and networks

161
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.380 
so many systems and networks are
administrated by administrators

162
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.780 
which are not a highly
qualified, which do not know

163
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.790 
all the problems that
need to be considered

164
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.180 
to secure a network.
There is another reason

165
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:29.080 
that they regulations are
valid only in a national

166
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:33.070 
frame but here internet
is a global internet.

167
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.880 
So in many things
regulations, they can be

168
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.340 
not considered by moving for
example the system outside

169
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.290 
of the place, outside of the
country, where this regulation

170
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.840 
in place. And
then the power

171
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:58.000 
to enforce legal requirements
is often not well developed

172
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.150 
because in many
countries

173
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:07.360 
they see that this needs to
be increased and powered

174
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:13.750 
often the number of people
in police in criminal

175
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.060 
offices, administrations
are relatively

176
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.000 
small compared to the huge
number of cyber criminals.

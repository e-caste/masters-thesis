00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.080 
Welcome to video clip 1.5
in which we discuss models

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.950 
and instances.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.840 
Each business process model acts as a blueprint
for a set of business process instances.

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.430 
So we have seen in the previous videos
that we want to model to represent

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.720 
business processes as they run in the
organization as business process models.

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.950 
So the business
process models

7
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.790 
can be can replace the real
world business process as

8
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.240 
it happens but the reward business
process happens many times.

9
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.310 
So each time an insurance claim
is received a new business

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.120 
process instance of this
insurance claim is created. So

11
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.540 
for each business process model we have
many instance of the business process.

12
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.980 
So the abstraction feature includes
classification. Classification means that

13
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.350 
the model stands for a whole
class of instances. In our case

14
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.480 
the business process model
stands or represents the whole

15
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.660 
class of all insurance
claim process instances.

16
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.820 
To make that a bit more concrete
there might be three claims, three

17
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.870 
insurance claims of our insurance
claim process

18
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.170 
or business process else's
represents a concrete case in the

19
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.300 
operational business of a
company, I’d like to say.

20
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.040 
And here we have three claims. So
this is just the data written

21
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.570 
as a upple here, so the first
element might be the claim

22
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.400 
ID on 142 the insurance
claimed by Weber. Weber

23
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.330 
might have the customer ID
7671, the

24
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.700 
claim is from the
eighteenth of September.

25
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.340 
This year a road bike has been
stolen and that's the price

26
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.380 
of the road back and so forth.
So we have the three

27
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.080 
claims here the three claims represent
the three process instances.

28
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.510 
And each process instance well
each process innocence behaves

29
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.620 
exactly as specified by the
process model. So let's look at

30
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.190 
the Weber claim. So the Weber claim
is received for the Weber claim,

31
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.040 
the claim is registered, it is
decided and well we decided we

32
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.540 
prepare the letter of approval
and the claim is approved

33
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.660 
Then we can use take a look at
the next process instance.

34
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.490 
In order to do that
I need to erase

35
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.480 
the trace of Weber
and we look at

36
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.670 
we look at the claim by
Petersen. Petersen

37
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.910 
also sends a claim so the claim for Petersen
is received, the claim is registered

38
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.920 
it is decided on the claim
coverage but in this case

39
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.100 
the claim is rejected
and a letter of rejection

40
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
is prepared for Petersen and
sent out as well. So we see that

41
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.360 
each process instance is
represented by a walk through to

42
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.310 
the process model and all these
these instances are really

43
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.010 
independently from each other
running independent from each

44
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.240 
Other They might overtake one another
if a certain checking needs

45
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.090 
to take quite long then others can
proceed independently from the process

46
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.800 
instance from the first
process instance.

47
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.780 
We have seen in the introduction
and also in the first video

48
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.160 
that as clients we trigger
business processes that we know

49
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.280 
can be a bit more precise, in the sense that
we trigger business process instances.

50
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.620 
And again here we see that every
client that sends out of it

51
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.900 
sends a claim to the insurance
company creates a process instance

52
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.390 
on the site or in the site
of the insurance company.

53
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.830 
Sometimes there is a bit of
confusion about models and

54
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.270 
Instances - process models process
instances and I think in part

55
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.340 
it's due to the fact that there
is no visual representation

56
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.880 
of the concrete process instances.
We only look at the process

57
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.440 
models and the process instances
somehow flow through this model

58
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.840 
and therefore it might not always
be very easy to understand

59
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.790 
what a process instance
is. But I think

60
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.950 
I try to communicate what this process
instance is, in the sense that

61
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.050 
each case in the operational
business is represented by this

62
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.300 
process instance and in the previous
slide we had the example

63
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.940 
of the insurance claims by these
three gentlemen whose bikes

64
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.920 
have been stolen. An these three
gentlemen created that each

65
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.380 
process instance.

66
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.990 
We come back to the point of the
missing visual representation

67
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.450 
when we talk about process
simulation later in this course.

68
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.860 
Process simulation
gives us the ability to

69
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.880 
to also visually represents
process instance that is

70
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.150 
also one of the strong points
of using force simulation.

71
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.920 
I’d also like to stress that
terminology is important because

72
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.100 
whenever a number of people with different
backgrounds speaking different technical

73
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.640 
languages need to agree
on a common language,

74
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.840 
terminology of using the language
is very important. So we need

75
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
to be careful when using the term
process. So far we have been quite

76
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.310 
quite sloppy in using the term
process but now we can ask,

77
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.950 
do we mean a process model or
do we mean a process instance.

78
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.870 
So when we hear sentences like do
you have a process for procuring

79
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.700 
material, do you have a process for
that, probably we mean is there

80
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.130 
a documented process model for
that as the documented process

81
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.760 
for that and that is ideally
done in the form of a process

82
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.430 
model often with the textual
representation. In the questions

83
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.650 
is the text representation really
a process model? I would rather

84
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.390 
I would rather see process models
visual process models written

85
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.130 
in a standardised language as a suitable
representations of business processes.

86
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.420 
Another and another saying is did
did the hiring process already start.

87
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.180 
So in this case we probably mean a certain
process instance that the hiring

88
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.400 
process of a certain of a
certain position already start

89
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.580 
We mean a particular process
instance. So we need to be very

90
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.380 
careful whether we need whether we
mean process model or whether

91
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.760 
we mean process
instance.

92
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.010 
We could even say strictly that
there is not such thing as

93
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.670 
a process. It's always either a
process model or some other

94
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.300 
type of process description or
process instance. So you will

95
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.800 
reduce misunderstanding and projects
when you are very careful

96
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.740 
about using the term process
model and process instance.

97
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.690 
And that concludes this short video clip
about process models and process instances

98
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.750 
in which we discuss that
process models are blueprints

99
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.000 
for a set of process instances
with the same structure.

100
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.910 
Process instances represent concrete
cases in the operational business

101
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.640 
of an organization. There is a one
to many relationship between

102
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.930 
models and instances. Each process
model can have an arbitrary

103
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.470 
number of process
instances.

104
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.300 
And we discussed that we need
to be quite strict about

105
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.590 
terminology in the sense that
do you mean process model or

106
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.430 
process instance.

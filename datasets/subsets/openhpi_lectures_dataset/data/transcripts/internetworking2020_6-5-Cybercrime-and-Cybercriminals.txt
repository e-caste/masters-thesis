1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.440 
Let's look in more detail at
cybercrime and cybercriminals

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.000 
in our openHPI course - A
Half Century of Internet

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.910 
When we speak about internet security,
damage considerations are very important

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.940 
but we have a problem with
this cybercrime damages

5
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.920 
it's very difficult to quantify - What is
the value of data? What is the value

6
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.480 
of a password that comes into
the hand of an attacker?

7
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.900 
It's also difficult because of the
huge number of security incidents

8
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.750 
to exactly attribute certain
damages to a certain incident

9
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.400 
or to a certain weakness
of the system

10
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.090 
The diversity of the attacks makes it
difficult to quantify the damages

11
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.120 
Another problem we have is that there is a huge
number of vulnerable systems and application

12
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.640 
which make it easy for an
attacker to abuse it

13
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.010 
so, only a small number
of such vulnerability

14
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.580 
becomes known to the public then
the vendor of this application

15
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.380 
with high pressure produces
an update which closes

16
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.650 
this vulnerability but a few
of these vulnerabilities

17
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.250 
remain undetected and only a
small number of cyber criminals

18
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.690 
and secret service agents
are aware of that

19
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:48.530 
Before we continue, we have to look more
closely to the commonly used security terms

20
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.100 
vulnerability, exploit, malicious code,
target system, security incident

21
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.940 
though a lot of terms and we need to
understand the differences in system

22
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.310 
and I will try to explain it with
an example from the real-world

23
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.470 
Let's look to a prison

24
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.450 
and for the
entrance security

25
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.650 
there are regulations in
that prison and the

26
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.060 
regulation is set, the security
guards in prison only check

27
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.410 
packages for prisoners
that exceed 500 grams

28
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.400 
There is a systematic failure to
check packages below 500 grams

29
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.100 
they do not control packages
below 500 grams and this

30
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.280 
principle failure in the regulation
is called a vulnerability

31
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.750 
A vulnerability provides a possibility
for an attacker to misuse

32
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.580 
and here is an example
of what happened

33
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.940 
An inmate receives a packet with
a cell phone inside the cake

34
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.830 
cell phone - it is
malicious code

35
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.930 
it's not expected
inside

36
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.630 
the cake

37
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.490 
to have something which can
later on used for the

38
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.490 
prisoner to do
something bad

39
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.690 
So, the packet is
under 500 grams

40
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.260 
is not investigated

41
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.340 
this malicious code was
hidden in a package

42
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.070 
under 500 gram and though
it is an exploit, it is

43
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.140 
a misuse of that vulnerability
that comes from the regulation

44
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.890 
of not checking a
package below 500 gram

45
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.540 
So, the prison is
a target system

46
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.120 
it was compromised by smuggling
of an illegal phone

47
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.530 
and this smuggling of an illegal
phone - that's a security incident

48
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.910 
Now, I hope you understood
the different meanings

49
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.870 
of these security terms

50
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.490 
Let's have a real-world example
now in the digital world

51
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.750 
CVE - this is Common
Vulnerability and Exposures

52
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.740 
stands for a database which contains
information about the known vulnerabilities

53
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.420 
So, in this database, there is
one example the CVE-2010-

54
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:50.410 
2553 and this vulnerability
described here

55
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.300 
is a software error in the
media codec in Windows XP,

56
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.540 
Windows Vista and Windows 7; which allows
remote code execution for the attacker

57
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.660 
It's a vulnerability

58
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.090 
An attacker now which want to
misuse this vulnerability

59
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.400 
creates the
following exploit

60
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.900 
The attacker prepares a video
file with malicious code and

61
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.150 
then send it
to the user

62
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.390 
and the manipulated
video is an exploit

63
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.280 
and as soon as this prepared
manipulated video

64
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.640 
is shown or sent
to the codec

65
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:48.590 
then the malware, malicious
code inserted by the attacker

66
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.860 
is executed when the
video is decoded

67
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.380 
For example, to delete
some user data

68
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.660 
and the reason is media codec
contains a software error

69
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.030 
and when an attacker knows how to
misuse this error, then they

70
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.570 
can reach here in that example
by preparing a video that

71
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.510 
is shown by the media codec and
this causes that malicious

72
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.820 
software to be installed on the
system of the user with some bad

73
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.640 
effects, for example,
deletion of user data

74
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.330 
If it is an attack

75
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.760 
then we consider the process
in which an exploit

76
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.920 
that is an exploitation of the vulnerability
is used to attempt to gain access

77
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:51.050 
to a target system. So, an attack is a
successful application of an exploit

78
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:58.310 
and the idea is to get
access to a target system

79
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.070 
to the system of the victim and to
do something there, for example,

80
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.060 
to install malware or others. Let's
consider some possible attacks

81
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.710 
one is the disruption - the idea
of attack is to disrupt the

82
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.170 
proper functionality
of an IT system

83
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.970 
so, that the service can no more
work in a regular way that

84
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:31.660 
some data is manipulated, that
data is deleted or others

85
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:39.230 
Often the attacker aims to
let the IT system crash

86
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.910 
so that no one
can do any work

87
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.160 
Even systems that
have an automatic

88
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.300 
re-start after
such a crash

89
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.580 
often, if they are
not configured

90
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.580 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh if they are not configured

91
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:04.290 
in the right way, they restart
in default settings which are

92
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.450 
known by the attacker and then
the attacker can get regular

93
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.340 
entrance to the system

94
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.780 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

95
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.340 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh as to the system

96
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:19.810 
to view, manipulate, or delete
of data stored in an IT system

97
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.360 
this is the goal
of an attack

98
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:30.330 
So, there are different attacks and we
try a little bit to classify them

99
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.340 
So. it is possible to classify attacks
according to the attack target -

100
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.670 
attack on individuals, attacks on
companies, widespread attacks

101
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.890 
We can classify attacks
according to the attack

102
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:54.020 
intentions, for example, cause damage - Denial of
Service (DoS) or steal sensitive information

103
00:08:54.470 --> 00:09:00.610 
for example, phishing or expose an
embarrassing defacement of websites

104
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.140 
and we can classify attacks
according to the efforts

105
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.730 
It's a simple quick attack, an
advanced attack, most complex

106
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:15.100 
attacks are the advanced persistent
threats which run over months

107
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.850 
If we look to the different
types of attackers

108
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:29.180 
it makes sense to consider what
types of attackers exist

109
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.790 
to see and understand the motivations
and from that to conclude

110
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.490 
What is the goal? What do they want to
do? How can we get protected from them?

111
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.660 
Then, let's start with the
so-called script kiddies

112
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.150 
Script kiddies are young
people, often young people

113
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.600 
driven by curiosity,
profiling by addiction

114
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:57.080 
they have little or no
knowledge of programming,

115
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:02.730 
no knowledge of computer security
but there are very popular

116
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.620 
attack tools available, freely
available on the internet, and they

117
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.540 
play with such attack tools sometimes
very powerful attack tools

118
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.730 
and try to get access to
a system or the others

119
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.050 
Then we have a traditional
class of cybercriminals. They

120
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.940 
are driven by greed
or for profit

121
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.620 
The attacks are carried out on a
large scale often automatically

122
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.410 
to extort information
or to extort money

123
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:43.540 
So, they are induced by personal or
motives, for example, revenge or others

124
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.730 
Then we have
professional hackers

125
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.510 
The ambition here is to spy our
information, discover secrets,

126
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.120 
for example, from
a former company

127
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.050 
new design data, often
driven by competition

128
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.100 
and paid by the
competition

129
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.210 
Then we also see
state attackers

130
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.550 
These are the members of
secret services such as

131
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:24.580 
CIA, NSA, BND, APT40,
APT28, Sofacity

132
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:30.530 
Unit 8200 from
different countries

133
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:37.570 
and here political or
economical motivations

134
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.760 
drives attackers to do something, for
example, to distribute fake news

135
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:52.510 
or other things. So, you see cybercrime and
cybercriminal is a very colorful scene

136
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:59.570 
and we have to know about it before
we are able to protect our systems

137
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.730 
in the right way

Hi and welcome from my side as well. My name is Ferdinand and

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.360 
I'd like to quickly introduce myself.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.130 
About two years ago I finished my masters in Information Engineering and Management

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.740 
and since I'm working as a professional software engineer, currently

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.140 
based in Karlsruhe, Germany.

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.810 
Besides my professional work, I actively and passionately contribute

7
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.730 
to the open source community and also maintain a few projects by myself.

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.920 
With respect to software engineering, my focus is mainly on design and architecture

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.970 
and also implementation of preferably efficient and scalable software.

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.990 
The topic of sustainable software engineering is especially appealing to me

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.580 
as it has potential to actually make a positive social impact with code.

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.290 
You will meet me later in the course. So enjoy and hopefully learn a lot.

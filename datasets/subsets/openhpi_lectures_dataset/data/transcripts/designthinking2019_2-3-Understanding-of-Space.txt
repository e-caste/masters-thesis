00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:08.280 
'Understanding of the Space' is
not just the title of this video

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
but it's also the starting point
of any Design Thinking project.

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.520 
We want you to address Space also
as a Design Thinking project.

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.090 
For this specific reason, we want
to dive into helping you with

5
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.030 
trying to figure
out how to see,

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.880 
how you can develop a new strategic
design to move forward,

7
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.660 
towards a more networked organization by
playing around strategically with your space.

8
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
We will have four different elements
and four different perspectives

9
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.910 
that we're about to use with you. The
first one is about Space as Place,

10
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.150 
and with this dimension, we'd like
you to focus on the understanding

11
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.340 
that size matters. It's
about trying to figure

12
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.790 
out how many square meters do you
need per employee, how many

13
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.870 
desks do you need, how many chairs,
etc., But besides these two

14
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.330 
as quantitative measurements and
also planning instruments,

15
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.280 
it is also about trying to create
an atmosphere that actually

16
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.970 
will be the place where all the things that
are creating your spatial environment

17
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.530 
will be situated in. And this leads to
the second dimension, the Work zones.

18
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.550 
If you look at your organization
from an individual standpoint

19
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.140 
of an employee, it means to identify
the zones where you feel at home,

20
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.260 
that's typically your desk,
your residential work zone.

21
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.540 
The second one is actually Nomadic
zones, places you can go

22
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.170 
to to work at if you don't
feel good or satisfied with

23
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.070 
your current work conditions. And
then there are also the zones

24
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.670 
where you can meet other people either
for regular meetings, Meeting zones

25
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.330 
or for informal meetings, Social
zones. However, if you do look

26
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.560 
at this from the perspective of
a networked organization, it's

27
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.120 
not just the individual employee,
it's also about what kind

28
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.790 
of work zones are you offering
for collaborative teamwork.

29
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.230 
And for teams, you need different
spaces and also different zones.

30
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.140 
You need the space for the team that
also has built-in flexibility

31
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.930 
to adjust and cater
to different

32
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.580 
work phases that
they might be in.

33
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.030 
You also need to understand
that teams also need

34
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.790 
shared spaces where they actually
can present to each other

35
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.980 
and share their work
amongst each other.

36
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.700 
Plus when it comes to
teamwork, there's also

37
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.940 
a zone that is called the
'Make Space', where you can

38
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.030 
start making things happen in
terms of building them. And last

39
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.890 
but not least, is also about the
network space. So in total this

40
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.220 
dimension leads to a combination of spaces
that are good for individual work

41
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.190 
and spaces that are good and cater to
collaborative teamwork. Following

42
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.580 
this on this standing

43
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.100 
the space that we have been
talking about at the end is not

44
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.900 
only characterized by what you put in for
an individual and more specifically

45
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.160 
for a team. Because, the spatial
elements, the furniture, the rooms

46
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.770 
you're providing, the partitions
between rooms you're creating,

47
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.780 
it's just one side of the
coin. More important are

48
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.040 
the consequences these spatial
elements have on our behaviour.

49
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.500 
Because a space can enable us to
become more creative and to

50
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.080 
become also more collaborative.
So therefore, when it comes to

51
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.720 
understanding how a space works, it's very
important to look at the interactions

52
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.820 
a space creates and empowers
people in an organization. And

53
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.040 
finally, it ends up to be the
dimension of Space Ownership,

54
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.970 
and that's also called affordances.
Because ideally, if you're

55
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.330 
creating spaces for teams, but also
trying to understand why they're

56
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.230 
working or why they're
not working,

57
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.410 
an office space that caters for collaborative
teamwork should be self-explanatory.

58
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.420 
So whenever somebody enters that
room either alone or in a team,

59
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.560 
the space should speak for itself
and should make it easy for

60
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.430 
a user, let's say a team
to take ownership,

61
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.600 
to make that space
themselves, to be able to

62
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.200 
shift stuff around to feel more
comfortable in the space.

63
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.030 
These affordances are also a reason
why a lot of the innovation

64
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.600 
labs we see around in organizations
do have the look and

65
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.210 
feel of garages or labs
that are not finished.

66
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.570 
Because with this extreme
design, we want to invite

67
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.330 
a different way of acting and
of thinking that's beyond

68
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.640 
the traditional mindset within
your regular work environment

69
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.850 
and the rest of the organization.
So, therefore, creating that

70
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.820 
different look and feel of a space actually
enables your employees and your teams

71
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.910 
to behave differently
in that space.

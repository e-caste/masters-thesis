00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.390 
Hello everybody, we are happy to
welcome our guest to day Harald.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.630 
Harald is from neXenio. Please,
tell me something about

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.690 
neXenio what are you guys
are working on there?

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.160 
Thank you, yes neXenio is a
spin-off of the Hasso Plattner

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.400 
Institute and we are focusing
on developing new work tools

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.570 
e.g. for collaboration
and remote working.

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.890 
Great, so you know Tom has
already introduced a few

8
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.250 
tools for you to consider when
working remotely and now

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.280 
Harald will guide you
through a journey

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.110 
to support you in
evaluating these tools.

11
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.450 
Thank you Harald. Successful
remote teamwork, in this video

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.720 
i want to focus not only on the team,
which is very important and necessary

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.830 
to have the right people in the
team, but I want to focus on

14
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.480 
the tools, which kind of tools can
support you to be successful

15
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.770 
when you work remote together.
I'm making my session now

16
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.250 
with one of these tools, which
could be an opportunity for you

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.830 
and I don't want to do it alone,
I want to invite somebody to

18
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.820 
make, in a team effort, this evaluation,
to give you tips and hints

19
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.160 
about the evaluation. Therefore,
as mentioned I write

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.810 
Christian who is an expert
in remote collaboration

21
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.490 
he now gets quite easy an e-mail
which is sent out direct of

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.100 
the solution. The solution is
implemented in a homepage so you

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.550 
need only a browser and an Internet
connection. The solution

24
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.850 
supports you to collaborate. Chris
has joined now and I start

25
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.320 
the video session and hopefully
he's joining quite fast and

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.510 
we can start our work to
evaluate the right tool,

27
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.380 
together with you and I say
hello Chris, how are you

28
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.620 
today? Hi Harald, how's it
going, I'm fine thank you.

29
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.420 
I already introduced you to the crowd
as the expert about remote teamwork.

30
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.410 
How can you support me
and our audience here,

31
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.590 
to evaluate the right tools for
making a successful remote

32
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.870 
teamwork? Maybe I can give you
some ideas of what's important

33
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.760 
for me when I work remotely. So
the first thing, I think, is

34
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.740 
having easy access
to tools.

35
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.730 
Usually, I work with a bunch of
different tools around four to five

36
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.880 
and it's always a hassle to
set them up, to use them,

37
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.680 
especially when I work
with external clients.

38
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.840 
So I preferably want
them to jump right

39
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.370 
into it. I think easy access
also fits to what is possible,

40
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.090 
currently, the bottlenecks
should be as easy as possible,

41
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.920 
means everybody has a device in
his pocket or close to his

42
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.490 
environment, which has an Internet
connection and a browser.

43
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.340 
So, I would recommend using
cloud solutions, use something

44
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.060 
like a Software-as-a-service. We
only need a browser and Internet

45
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.160 
connection and can
join quite easily.

46
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.490 
Like we are doing here, currently,
too. Do you have an additional

47
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.800 
idea what kind of tools should
support, or which kind of

48
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.150 
dimension should support this
evaluation of these tools? ...

49
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.650 
I think the tool that i'm using
should be able to visualize

50
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.370 
my thoughts. Usually in a
remote setup it's easy to

51
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.180 
talk to my colleagues through
hangouts, zoom, or whatever,

52
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.200 
But we always have a hard time
documenting these ideas to really

53
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.350 
bring them on paper, and if there's
something that combines it,

54
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.510 
that would be wonderful. ...
I think this is one of the

55
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.000 
big opportunities in meeting rooms
that you have always there

56
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.100 
a whiteboard or a flip chart and
everybody knows how to use

57
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.130 
it, so everybody from the C level
to the blue collar workers

58
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.660 
can access this meeting room and
knows how to open a pen or

59
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.970 
switch it on and switch it off
and how to use a sticky note,

60
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.370 
and that supports to make quite
easy a visualization about the

61
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.290 
specific topic and bring the team
members all on the same eye level

62
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.160 
about the goal, the rules,
the methods and so on.

63
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.840 
... Absolutely .... Something in
addition from your experience what

64
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.450 
you would prefer that
tool should bring with?

65
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.700 
Well as I said before:
communication!

66
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.400 
Since i'm not in the same
room with that person,

67
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.560 
like we are, I'm in
Munich right now,

68
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.290 
I can only see you virtually, so
communication is always a challenge,

69
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.590 
and if i have to use two
different tools in order

70
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.960 
to get the perfect
communication, it's a burden.

71
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.450 
So, I want something that
combines everything basically.

72
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.200 
Communication, there's next to
the audio also video a great

73
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.540 
supporter to work together, we get
more used and used to have video

74
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.230 
conferences, to see us: is Chris
still online? or is he checking

75
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.140 
his e-mail in parallel? This is
something which supports you when

76
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.520 
i'm talking here and he focusses
on my movements with hands and

77
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.770 
with my voice.
Very important!

78
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.930 
Well, what would be nice to have? You
know, you don't work always remotely,

79
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.770 
or? No, twice a week, I'm
in the office actually.

80
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.250 
Are you working then with your
team members only digital, or

81
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.050 
do you use other tools
or equipment in this

82
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.930 
offline analog way? No, obviously,
I still love face-to-face

83
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.300 
communication and working together
with them in the same room.

84
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.170 
It's great, maybe you
did a lot of...

85
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.570 
you probably also did some
workshop sessions...

86
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.920 
People really love to take things
in their hands and to walk

87
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.650 
around and that's fantastic it
can be highly creative doing

88
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.060 
so, but then if you have a remote
team, if you have colleagues

89
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.070 
that work in a different location
it's difficult to share

90
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
these ideas with
them. So ideally, a

91
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.390 
hybrid .. from analog to digital
...having a tool, having a

92
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.130 
process to digitize
my things

93
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.410 
would be a wonderful way.
And that's something I'm

94
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.130 
and still seeking the
perfect solution for.

95
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.110 
And this is something I
want to give you also

96
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.550 
the way, challenge the information
technology, the digitalisation

97
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.690 
guys, that they develop something
for you that you can also

98
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.690 
work analog and transfer this
information quite easily into the

99
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.600 
digital. A couple of hours ago,
I worked with some colleagues

100
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
on a physical white board here,
and I want to share it now with

101
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.740 
you. But you are not here in
Potsdam, where I am located. You

102
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.130 
are in Munich, so i am now uploading
this information. But digitalisation

103
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.080 
already supports you, not
only to upload the picture.

104
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.780 
You can really transfer this
information in the digital way,

105
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.550 
that it's only...not a snapshot
here as example, it's directly

106
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.600 
a solution, where you
can go on with me and

107
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.040 
go into the next phase after
the ideation. Into maybe

108
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.480 
the teamwork related to a
specific method on that.

109
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.310 
So challenge the world or
the digitalisation stuff

110
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.520 
related that it supports you to
have no information kept from

111
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.320 
the analog to the digital world.
Let's summarize our topics here.

112
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.730 
Successful remote teamwork,
Chris mentioned

113
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.410 
having if possible one
tool that supports you

114
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.190 
to collaborate with
the people together.

115
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.550 
Have it available with an easy
access the bottleneck should

116
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.340 
be as small as possible,
Internet connection, browser,

117
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.260 
nothing else to collaborate. Like
we did here with Chris together

118
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.320 
on this interactive
homepage. Visualization

119
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.140 
gives the opportunity to the people
that they both can work remotely

120
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:54.510 
and visualize their point of view
on a specific topic or on a

121
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.110 
specific method. And communication.
Look for tools which make

122
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.700 
it available next to
voice also with video

123
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.030 
to bring the people together
without any noise that they have

124
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.480 
focus on a specific way. Nice
to have would be when you

125
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.090 
have opportunities and features
and functions where you can

126
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.350 
collaborate in the analog and digital
way. Transfer this information

127
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.410 
and work together with
the people in the next

128
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.410 
phase in a remote way without
any information gap.

129
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.930 
This is the hints and tips
that we want to give you,

130
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.050 
hopefully there's something in for
you for the right evaluation...

131
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.830 
and happy team working. Thank you
Chris! ... Happy team working.

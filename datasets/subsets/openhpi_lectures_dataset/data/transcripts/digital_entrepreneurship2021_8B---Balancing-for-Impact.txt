00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.720 
What are the challenges of impact
entrepreneurs? And how do

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.710 
they solve them?

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.880 
Welcome to the next video on impact
entrepreneurship with Valeska Maul and myself.

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.250 
In the previous video, you have
learned about different definitions

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.620 
and concepts of impact entrepreneurship
which is strongly related

6
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.990 
to social or environmental entrepreneurship as well
as entrepreneurship for sustainable development.

7
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.850 
Now, we want to pick up from there and discuss
what distinguish impact entrepreneurs from

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.520 
let's call them "commercial"
entrepreneurs.

9
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.790 
In this context, we want to
discuss the specific challenges

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.440 
impact entrepreneurs have to deal
with. This is what we will

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.330 
cover in the first part of this
video and the second part we

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.130 
will show you some examples of how impact entrepreneurs
successfully approach these challenges.

13
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.710 
So now, let's dive in. First of all,
what sets these entrepreneurs

14
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.530 
apart? What makes them so special?
Of course, the distinction

15
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.030 
between impact or sustainability-oriented
and commercial entrepreneurs is not

16
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.410 
black and white or binary; it's difficult to
define a purely sustainability-oriented venture

17
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.740 
or a purely commercial venture.
Much rather, it is a continuum

18
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.500 
ranging from sustainability-oriented
to commercially-oriented.

19
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.210 
And even at the extremes there are
still elements of both. Nonetheless,

20
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
researchers identified dimensions
that allow for the comparison

21
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.330 
of sustainable entrepreneurs
and commercial entrepreneurs.

22
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.130 
Three possible dimensions
for comparison are -

23
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.120 
mission, resource mobilization, and
performance measurement. Let's

24
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.990 
take a deeper look at each of these
three dimensions. First - the mission.

25
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.860 
The fundamental purpose of impact
entrepreneurship is creating

26
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.660 
positive impact
for the society.

27
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.650 
In more concrete terms, social
entrepreneurs aim at reducing

28
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.070 
people's suffering and
enhancing social wealth.

29
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.410 
Several studies also revealed that
a large proportion of social

30
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.590 
entrepreneurs started their companies,
at least in parts, to achieve

31
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.790 
idealistic objectives and pursued financial
and non-financial objectives simultaneously.

32
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.870 
Depending on the individual case
the social entrepreneur may

33
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.980 
create social as well as economic
wealth or he or she may create

34
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.210 
social wealth with no or
little economic wealth.

35
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.530 
In the latter case, we would also
speak about non-profit companies.

36
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.280 
For ecological entrepreneurs, a
typical aim would be to find

37
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.870 
a marketable solutions to
ecological problems.

38
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.950 
Or earning money while preserving
nature. At the opposite

39
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.170 
end of the spectrum, a purely
commercial entrepreneur would

40
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.370 
aim at creating profitable operations
that lead to monetary gain.

41
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.690 
Again, this contrast is of course
not extreme as it sounds

42
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.780 
in the first moment. Indeed, even the purely
commercially orientated entrepreneur

43
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.120 
does benefit society - by producing
products, services, and, of course, jobs.

44
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.050 
In many cases, creating jobs and
wealth can be the determining

45
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.180 
motivation for commercial
entrepreneurship,

46
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.420 
which, as a result, positively affects
all of society. Nonetheless,

47
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.730 
the mission is a useful dimension
for comparing commercial

48
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.050 
and impact entrepreneurs. The mission will
become evident in entrepreneurial decisions

49
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.880 
and in many cases it also has an
impact on the individual motivation

50
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.010 
of the founder and the employees
in the venture. Finally, the

51
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.490 
mission could also serve as a
guiding principle when tensions

52
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.960 
between sustainability and
commercial orientation occur. Keep

53
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.320 
this in mind, because we will
come back to the occurrence of

54
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.690 
tensions later on in the video.
Second, the resource mobilization.

55
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.240 
A study by Choi and Grey
from 2020 showed that

56
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.290 
more sustainability-oriented
entrepreneurs

57
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.120 
more often avoid external
financing from institutional

58
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.670 
funding sources, such as,
venture capitalists.

59
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.510 
For some forms of social
entrepreneurship this also has to do

60
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.440 
with their legal status as social
enterprises which prevents

61
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.700 
them from drawing on the same capital
markets as commercial entrepreneurs.

62
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.440 
Apart from monetary resources, socially
or environmentally oriented ventures

63
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.400 
also show a different approach to
human resources, in particular,

64
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.060 
with regard to staff
hiring and compensation.

65
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.380 
Studies have shown that non-monetary
compensation often plays

66
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.070 
a more important role in these ventures
compared to commercial ventures.

67
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.200 
The third dimension suitable
for comparison is measurement

68
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.750 
of the venture performance. Given
the social or environmental

69
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.210 
purpose of an impact entrepreneur, performance
measurement presents a particular challenge.

70
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.290 
Traditional commercial entrepreneurs can
typically use quantifiable measures

71
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.240 
such as financial ratios or market
share to measure their achievement.

72
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.310 
In contrast however, social or
environmental goals are often more

73
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.390 
difficult to quantify and measure
because how do you measure

74
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.850 
your ventures' contribution to
social change, for example?

75
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.920 
In addition, impact entrepreneurs often
have a more complex stakeholder landscape

76
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.730 
and social or environmental
objectives are often interrelated

77
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.610 
and mutually dependent from
many external factors.

78
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.110 
Taking all this together these
differences make for a more

79
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.070 
complicated accountability
of impact entrepreneurs.

80
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.420 
All right! Now, let us come back
to an issue we raised before.

81
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.390 
As an overall goal, in the ideal
case entrepreneurs pursue

82
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:51.230 
the so-called "triple bottom line". This
means simultaneously pursuing economic,

83
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.380 
social and ecological goals.
However, a central characteristic

84
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.090 
of impact entrepreneurship is the existence
of conflicts or competing interests

85
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.820 
between social or ecological
and economic goals.

86
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.290 
In simple words, acting in an
ecologically sustainable and

87
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.980 
socially responsible way is
usually rather expensive.

88
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.710 
Just like any other type of
entrepreneurs, impact entrepreneurs

89
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.250 
have to decide on how to
use their resources best.

90
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.390 
The typical entrepreneurial
orientation usually prioritizes

91
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.550 
exploiting opportunities in an
economically efficient way.

92
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.560 
Unfortunately, this often conflicts with the
pursuit of sustainability oriented activities.

93
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.450 
For the case of ecological entrepreneurs, the
ecological logic prioritizes activities

94
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.140 
that address and solve environmental problems
and sustain the natural environment.

95
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.500 
In contrast, the commercial logic prioritizes
efficiency and economic profits.

96
00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.110 
The combination of these often competing
goals presents a challenge to entrepreneurs

97
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.780 
which is sometimes referred as
"conflicting duality" by us researchers.

98
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.520 
Of course, every venture has to
find its own way to navigate

99
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.650 
the "triple
bottom line".

100
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.030 
However, we want to present you
two recent empirical studies

101
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.550 
that investigated the issue
from different angles.

102
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.790 
The first one written by two entrepreneurs
of researchers Belz and Binder,

103
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.180 
analyzed the early stages of the
venture development process

104
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.890 
with a multiple case study
of sustainable ventures.

105
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.310 
They find that impact entrepreneurs
sequentially integrate

106
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.820 
the goals into their
business model -

107
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.430 
they first develop a double
bottom line solution.

108
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.610 
In other words, they start by
integrating a social or an ecological

109
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:46.940 
goal with an
economic goal.

110
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.760 
Next, they develop a triple
bottom line solution.

111
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.170 
For example, take the founders of
Coffee Circle, an online retailer

112
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.020 
for organic fair-trade coffee.
Initially, they developed an only

113
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.130 
and fair-trade business model which would
provide a fair income to coffee farmers.

114
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.390 
Once this business model proved to be viable,
they further developed their business model.

115
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.790 
They chose to trade
only organic coffee.

116
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.130 
Thereby, they wanted to reduce the negative
impact on the environment through pesticides.

117
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.320 
A further interesting study took
another perspective at competing

118
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.640 
goals in impact entrepreneurship
for already existing businesses.

119
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.050 
They analyzed how such make strategic
decisions when confronted with competing

120
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:37.040 
economic, ecological or social
goals. As we said before, every

121
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.410 
venture has to find its own
way to navigate these goals.

122
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.770 
However, the authors could empirically distinguish
between three decision making profiles -

123
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.770 
the singular, the flexible, and
the holistic profile. In the

124
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.410 
single a decision making profile,
one of those three dimensions,

125
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.580 
so either the economic, ecological
or social dimension is dominant

126
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.720 
and overrules the other two
dimensions. In the flexible decision

127
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.990 
making profile, the preferred
dimension changes continuously

128
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.040 
when trade-offs between
dimensions occur.

129
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.410 
For example, when we have to select
a supplier for office material

130
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.240 
a company may choose the most
economical alternative but when

131
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.920 
selecting a supplier for core
materials, the same company may

132
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.890 
choose the most ecologically
sustainable alternative.

133
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.850 
Finally, the third profile is the
holistic decision making profile.

134
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.230 
If a company shows this profile,
they aim to balance the impacts

135
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.330 
equally among the economic,
ecological and social goals. For

136
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.620 
example, when making decisions
about the use of resources which

137
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.840 
could increase their ecological
sustainability, they also consider

138
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.320 
the consequences of this decision for
the social and the economic dimension.

139
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.440 
All three dimensions are given the
same preferences. So, in summary,

140
00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:01.690 
entrepreneurs continuously have to balance
economic, social and ecological goals.

141
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.750 
Sometimes those goal reinforce each other
but in many cases they are trade-offs.

142
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.190 
These trade-offs make impact
entrepreneurship even more complex.

143
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.010 
However, the social and ecological
problems are also a potential

144
00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.850 
source of entrepreneur
opportunities.

145
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.580 
In order to increase the chances to
succeed and to reduce the complexity

146
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.510 
it may be helpful to
set clear priorities.

147
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.150 
Those then serve as guidelines when entrepreneurs
have to make difficult decisions.

148
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.590 
We hope you enjoy the content of
the session and learn something

149
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.070 
about balancing and
holistic and flexible.

150
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.510 
So, if you're ready to learn more
then continue with the next

151
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.460 
video on impact entrepreneurship
where we will be approaching

152
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:53.720 
the outcomes and the future
of impact entrepreneurship.

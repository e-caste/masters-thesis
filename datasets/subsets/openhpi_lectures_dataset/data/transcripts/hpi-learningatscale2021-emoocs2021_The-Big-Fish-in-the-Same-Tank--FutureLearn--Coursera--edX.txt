1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.290 
Thank you then welcome to the panel.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.379 
The big fish in the same tank industry,

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.784 
insights from leading MOOC platforms.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.819 
And I'm thrilled and honoured

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.372 
to have really three of the very, very

6
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.979 
big fish with us today here

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.030 
in front of the lake.

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.540 
We call it Lake Hustle here at

9
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.720 
HPI.

10
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.369 
And we want to use the next

11
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.499 
90 minutes to see what we

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.750 
have learnt as

13
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.250 
providers, also maybe as

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.279 
learners, what the learners maybe have

15
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.280 
learnt.

16
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.135 
What will we take with us from this

17
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.430 
crazy time?

18
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.819 
And if you look at the building

19
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.887 
behind me, that's probably

20
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.425 
you all know by now is this the Hasso

21
00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:44.879 
Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany.

22
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.499 
And right in this building,

23
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.960 
we held the openHPI

24
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.210 
User Forum each year

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.364 
and each year there was someone from

26
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.460 
OpenWHO

27
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.289 
telling us about how they use the

28
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.515 
platform to gain pandemic

29
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.100 
outbreak situations.

30
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.110 
And they told us year for year

31
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.379 
we're going to see a big outbreak in

32
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.030 
the next 20 to 30 years.

33
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.189 
And people in the audience were like,

34
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.974 
yeah, how do you react, I don't know!?

35
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.030 
Yeah, probably maybe

36
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.799 
no one was really believing it.

37
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.290 
And then, like,

38
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.939 
now we look back.

39
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.029 
Hopefully, it's actually looking back

40
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.870 
and not so much looking forward.

41
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.049 
And we seem that

42
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.969 
it has been a great challenge

43
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.559 
for many of us.

44
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.230 
But maybe it's also

45
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.518 
partly an opportunity,

46
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.760 
and especially for

47
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.379 
digital learning.

48
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.989 
We see that, for example,

49
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.999 
in Europe and in the US,

50
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.459 
massive amounts of money are put

51
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.460 
into digitalisation,

52
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.209 
into digital learning.

53
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.969 
And so we have three

54
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.409 
of the big fishes today.

55
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.880 
So we going to see what worked

56
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.760 
well in the past.

57
00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.770 
What are the learnings?

58
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.159 
And we're going to start with a three,

59
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.800 
like intro presentations.

60
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.500 
And I would like to

61
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.980 
ask Justin Cooke.

62
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.099 
He's the chief content and partnership

63
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.100 
officer of FutureLearn

64
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.610 
to give us his

65
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.090 
findings, his look back and

66
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.319 
his look forward.

67
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.659 
And how does it felt the crazy

68
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.605 
last months for FutureLearn

69
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
just as much as yours?

70
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.349 
Thank you, Jan. It's great to be here.

71
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.009 
And I really wanted to sort of give

72
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.689 
you FutureLearn's kind of perspectives,

73
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.739 
really, and take you on a bit of a

74
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.740 
journey, a journey

75
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.397 
that starts really with the power

76
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
of human connectivity and

77
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.289 
unpacks the stories behind the learning

78
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.299 
and how really our social learning

79
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.309 
experience was more important

80
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.486 
now and over the last 18

81
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.789 
months than ever.

82
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.279 
Going to share a little bit about how we

83
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.050 
responded. And we supported

84
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.479 
critical areas rapidly,

85
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.330 
building social communities of practise

86
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.219 
and share some of the impacts

87
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.227 
of that learning how we reach new

88
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.719 
audiences, many of whom were hardest

89
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.119 
hit by COVID, but also

90
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.639 
online learning and how it was offered

91
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.559 
as an opportunity to reskill

92
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.989 
and talk about the opportunities and

93
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.901 
challenges that presented by the global

94
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.169 
digital divide.

95
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.969 
Because we still have, this is really

96
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.039 
the end of the beginning and

97
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.020 
the young digital natives who are

98
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.449 
rising up and their widespread

99
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.312 
optimism about the potential and power

100
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.610 
of online learning.

101
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.889 
And then really, of course, you know,

102
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.160 
what can't be talked enough about is the

103
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.919 
insights that we have to create

104
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.635 
the courses to teach the skills and

105
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.610 
knowledge to change lives in the world

106
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.889 
by working with academic industry and

107
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.289 
government partners to make a real

108
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.149 
impact and change real-world problems.

109
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.570 
So let's begin,

110
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.274 
I think, talking about the

111
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.229 
stories, the power of human

112
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.190 
connectivity. We all saw a huge increase

113
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.139 
on our platforms.

114
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.969 
It took FutureLearn seven years to get

115
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.110 
to ten million learners.

116
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.624 
The pandemics saw us, in

117
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.010 
12 months, go to 17.

118
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.781 
And while insights and drives

119
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.570 
everything that we do, we're really more

120
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.447 
focussed or even more focussed on

121
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.849 
the human beings behind the data.

122
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.309 
Now, when we go back over the past

123
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.679 
year and a bit, we think about the more

124
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.809 
than 1.5 Billion impacted

125
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.810 
learners, countrywide

126
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.889 
closures, massive increases in

127
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.509 
unemployment, entire sectors at

128
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.372 
standstill, and the fact that everyone

129
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.102 
had to move online, everyone

130
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.359 
pretty much had to

131
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.700 
move into isolation

132
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.199 
and this enormous acceleration

133
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240 
shift to digital.

134
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.209 
And it resulted in many, many, many

135
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.680 
millions of learner's stories.

136
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.109 
And I think this quote here about

137
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.755 
how people found respite,

138
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.220 
who found inspiration

139
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.980 
from online learning

140
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.139 
is a great sort of example

141
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.463 
of kind of some of the kind

142
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.799 
of ways in which we've been able to

143
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.970 
respond and help.

144
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
And encourage that sort of

145
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
new form of connectivity

146
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.690 
and collaboration.

147
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.950 
Of course,

148
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.140 
this flashback to February

149
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.820 
and March of last year

150
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.629 
really wanted to share these stories.

151
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.649 
This impact

152
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.059 
that we all had where we have to

153
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.699 
suddenly make that immediate shift

154
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.739 
to online learning resulted

155
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.570 
in huge demand for

156
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.059 
an understanding as to how to go about

157
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.309 
learning new skills in doing that.

158
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.059 
How do you teach online?

159
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.880 
So within 10 days, FutureLearn

160
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.100 
launched how to teach online.

161
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.210 
We had 27 contributors.

162
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.519 
Some of the world's leading educators

163
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.520 
join us.

164
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.359 
We reached within days,

165
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.067 
100 thousand teachers, 10 million

166
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.660 
students were impacted and we

167
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.019 
generated more than 250 thousand

168
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.140 
comments from our cohorts

169
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.086 
of learners on that course alone.

170
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.349 
And I think really that is a great sort

171
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.350 
of example of

172
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.389 
the way that you can respond and impact

173
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.059 
quickly as an online learning

174
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.989 
platform.

175
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.820 
Of course, we saw a huge number

176
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.579 
of courses around

177
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.469 
teaching.

178
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.990 
We had more than 21 million enrolments

179
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.709 
and 30 million comments

180
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.709 
across our teaching portfolio

181
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.419 
during the crisis.

182
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.759 
Of course, teaching was not the only

183
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.279 
area where a rapid response was

184
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.830 
required.

185
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.237 
Again, our

186
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.060 
work in health care, again, a very, very

187
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.300 
strong area for FutureLearn and

188
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.600 
really, I think is brought to life by

189
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.209 
our tackling the coronavirus

190
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.529 
course that we created with our

191
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.449 
excellent partner at the London School

192
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.016 
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

193
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.508 
We built that course in 30 days.

194
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.560 
We had 10 global leading contributors

195
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.199 
and we reached 230 thousand

196
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.939 
health care workers

197
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.220 
and 46 million people

198
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.230 
were directly impacted.

199
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.482 
And again, I think thinking about this

200
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.880 
from a human side of things,

201
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.449 
again, receiving wonderful

202
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.579 
stories from learners

203
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.339 
of the impacts in human terms

204
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.319 
of the learning that we were creating

205
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.359 
across our health portfolio.

206
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.369 
Amazing. As a health care worker, the

207
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.036 
greatest part was the conversation

208
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.149 
with fellow learners and evolving my

209
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.279 
approach through insights from other

210
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.848 
countries, something that we all

211
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.509 
recognise in our institutions

212
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.980 
and our campuses, but also now

213
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.160 
brought to life through social learning

214
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.439 
on our platforms.

215
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.179 
And really, I suppose in a sense, we

216
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.189 
know we feel that in

217
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.856 
terms of FutureLearn and we've not

218
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.269 
just been sort of changing lives, but

219
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.039 
we've actually been helping our partners

220
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040 
save lives.

221
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.819 
And again, another quote that I

222
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.859 
carry with me is from a nurse

223
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.456 
who was redeployed to an

224
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.089 
ITU (Intensive Treatment Unit) unit

225
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.413 
during the pandemic and she

226
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.110 
had no previous experience.

227
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.673 
And she contacted us and told us that

228
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.871 
the course provided her with invaluable

229
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.360 
support. And of course, this is ongoing.

230
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.680 
We've taken our learning to

231
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.184 
the real world through our

232
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.319 
work in the Prakash region of India,

233
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.629 
where our courses can be linked

234
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.010 
to through QR codes.

235
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.955 
And I think our work with

236
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.849 
Johns Hopkins

237
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.210 
and on a

238
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.070 
variety of COVID-19 courses

239
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.079 
really is summed up brilliantly by their

240
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.499 
former dean, Patricia.

241
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:36.987 
She talked about COVID

242
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.859 
being the catalyst to digitalisation

243
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.269 
of the education sector.

244
00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.377 
And of course, it's not just the

245
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.990 
education sector that has been

246
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.230 
digitised.

247
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.410 
And I think

248
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.909 
when we think about the learners

249
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.679 
themselves and how

250
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.830 
their perceptions and adoption

251
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.139 
and awareness of online learning has

252
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.000 
been transformed over this period, that

253
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.100 
we can really start to kind of now

254
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.600 
begin to quantify that sort of

255
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.621 
seismic change that we've all

256
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.536 
seen and been through in

257
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.350 
our recent future, FutureLearn

258
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.659 
and future of learning reports which

259
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.159 
you can download. There are some QR

260
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.569 
codes in my presentation which you can

261
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.570 
access.

262
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.569 
You'll see that more than 50 percent of

263
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.129 
UK adults already believe online

264
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.839 
learning provides similar benefits to

265
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.859 
traditional education.

266
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.989 
And from an employer's perspective,

267
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.643 
they're now 75 percent more

268
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.996 
likely to hire applicants who have

269
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.409 
an online education than before the

270
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.720 
pandemic and of course, the growing

271
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.299 
new generation of Gen-Z and millennials

272
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.844 
are also demonstrating the

273
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.320 
fact that they're not just

274
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.200 
absolutely native to online learning,

275
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:44.842 
but also completely invested

276
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.041 
in actually developing career-related

277
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.510 
skills focused training.

278
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.929 
Two times more than some

279
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.159 
of the older generations.

280
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.919 
And that new generation

281
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.839 
is something that I guess we saw, you

282
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.657 
know, significantly rise.

283
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.989 
This is a coming of age at a time,

284
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.909 
perhaps, to change the world as we look

285
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.370 
to reskill, reboot, build back better

286
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.710 
50 percent of Generation Z

287
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.809 
and millennials believe education has

288
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.029 
the power to save the planet from

289
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.120 
climate change.

290
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.847 
75 percent believe education will

291
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.520 
empower new sustainable technologies

292
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.813 
and with Gen-Z now making up more and

293
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.350 
more of our learners and our platforms.

294
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.999 
This image here is another story.

295
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.059 
This is Caroline Masters, who's

296
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.129 
only one of 50 people who live on

297
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.139 
the Palmerston Islands in the South

298
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.089 
Pacific. I hope to go there one day

299
00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.045 
as one of the most remote places on

300
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.589 
Earth. And she was motivated by

301
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.299 
plastic washing up on the beach

302
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.571 
and she came to FutureLearn to find out

303
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.379 
how to save what's on her doorstep,

304
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.650 
the oceans.

305
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.268 
And this is a certificate selfie

306
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.809 
that she tagged us in completing

307
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.669 
the first of many oceans and marine

308
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.483 
conservation courses that she's taken

309
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:54.950 
with FutureLearn.

310
00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.831 
And of course, this diversity

311
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.119 
of geographic reach is also

312
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.299 
very much a wider diversity

313
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.850 
issue. We've all, again, lived through

314
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.429 
a significant sort of wakening

315
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.349 
up of the world, I think, around and the

316
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.170 
importance of diversity and inclusion.

317
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.219 
And one of the particular kind of

318
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.470 
highlights I wanted to call out was how

319
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.409 
online learning can greatly impact

320
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.509 
that. And this

321
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.735 
is a number of statistics

322
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.502 
from the report, again, that relate to

323
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.869 
women. More than 60 percent

324
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.879 
of FutureLearn's learners are women.

325
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.869 
And 47 percent of those

326
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.642 
believe that online learning

327
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.869 
provides them with greater confidence

328
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.489 
and privacy to perhaps learn without

329
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.490 
judgement.

330
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.749 
45 percent believe that online learning

331
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.070 
can help reduce violence.

332
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.529 
And we saw a massive increase in women

333
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.490 
enrolling, particularly in areas of tech

334
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.009 
and coding of business.

335
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.559 
One statistic I want to share with you

336
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.539 
is that in the U.K.,

337
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.549 
16 percent of

338
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.929 
computer science graduates are

339
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.830 
identified as female on campus.

340
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.250 
But 46 percent of

341
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.599 
FutureLearn's learners identify as women

342
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.710 
on the same courses.

343
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.659 
And I think that's a great illustration

344
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.032 
of us reaching new audiences

345
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.309 
and diverse audiences.

346
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.273 
And, of course, how could we not talk

347
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.749 
about the rise and importance of digital

348
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.828 
skills, whether that's

349
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.290 
about building skills, bridges

350
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.960 
to help people switch sectors

351
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.441 
from moving from being an airline pilot

352
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.048 
to an IT manager or from a hotel

353
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.890 
receptionist to a social care

354
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:34.850 
assistant.

355
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.419 
The skills and the

356
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.719 
digital skills have

357
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.159 
risen significantly in importance

358
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160 
and demand.

359
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.130 
82 percent now of jobs

360
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.440 
in the UK require digital skills,

361
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.989 
46 percent of the global digital

362
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.979 
workforce are looking to make a pivot

363
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.070 
or career transition in the next year.

364
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.126 
How much of that to do with COVID all

365
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.240 
the change we've been through?

366
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.344 
But fundamentally, we're seeing this

367
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.349 
big trend of the average number

368
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.279 
of jobs that we're going to be doing

369
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.129 
through our lifetime, doubling in

370
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.049 
the last 10 years.

371
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.726 
And I think that really builds the

372
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.169 
case for ensuring that we have

373
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.836 
a lifelong learning journey with a

374
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.339 
real emphasis on digital skills

375
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.791 
and, of course, the 21st-century skills,

376
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.909 
as we like to call them.

377
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.821 
The interpersonal skills, the cognitive

378
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.899 
competencies and the learning strategies

379
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.120 
with creative use are equally important.

380
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.789 
And how over the

381
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.830 
period have we seen the creation of

382
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.179 
these courses changing?

383
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.160 
What we've seen here and

384
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.559 
learn is a rise of

385
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.376 
the world of academia and industry

386
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.877 
and government coming together to

387
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.159 
realise the global upskilling

388
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.483 
opportunity with vigilance,

389
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.479 
help identifying the demand

390
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.609 
and the skills gaps, working with

391
00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.178 
industry to provide that subject

392
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.830 
matter.

393
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.410 
Experts, educator

394
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.159 
input, the rigour, the context,

395
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.238 
the challenge of great

396
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.283 
sort of academic input and of course,

397
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.159 
the latter input delivered through our

398
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.299 
social learning experience.

399
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.469 
And we're working now with some of the

400
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.780 
biggest companies in the world, with

401
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.429 
some of the top universities in the

402
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.679 
world to really address these

403
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.809 
big global skills

404
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.610 
gaps and challenges.

405
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.639 
Finally, I just wanted to wrap with a

406
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.349 
couple of perspectives on

407
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.689 
how things have changed from some of our

408
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.909 
partners. This is a great quote

409
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.429 
from Josie Fraser from the Open

410
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.409 
University in the United Kingdom.

411
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.429 
"Only a pandemic was going to move

412
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.840 
people so quickly into the online

413
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.050 
learning space.

414
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.199 
Lots of universities and FE colleges

415
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.880 
were dipping their toes into the water,

416
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.919 
but COVID has forced us to make it the

417
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.240 
primary experience".

418
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.249 
And then a really interesting

419
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.749 
perspective, I think, from Professor

420
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.900 
Mark Brown from Dublin in Ireland.

421
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.069 
There are some that would argue we're in

422
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.687 
the post-digital world, so we need

423
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.369 
to lose the word digital.

424
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.419 
It's just the world we live in.

425
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.419 
So thank you very much.

426
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.619 
Looking forward to the rest of the

427
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.620 
discussion.

Click the QR code and you can access the

429
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.779 
Future of Learning report, thank you,

430
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.230 
back to you, Jan.

431
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.339 
Jason, thank you so much for the

432
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.340 
insights you shared.

433
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.639 
And I think it's very promising and also

434
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.739 
amazing to see the numbers and to

435
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.470 
get an idea of the change we're just in.

436
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.889 
And I would like to proceed with

437
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.104 
Anthony. He is the vice president of

438
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.370 
the EMEA region of

439
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.540 
Coursera.

440
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.389 
Anthony, do you want to share some of

441
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.429 
your learnings and how do you

442
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.720 
experience the last

443
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.530 
months?

444
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.529 
Sure. Happy to do so.

445
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.590 
And it's a pleasure to be here.

446
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.871 
I won't go through a detailed

447
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.276 
slide deck because we had our CEO,

448
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.251 
Jeff, mentioned how to do their opening

449
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.489 
keynote on the first day, the

450
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.169 
conference. So I want to make sure that

451
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.279 
I don't end up repeating what was

452
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.399 
already covered there. But I'm going to

453
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.189 
give you a few of the highlights that

454
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.299 
we've sort of seen over that period of

455
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.199 
time.

456
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.789 
And a lot of the

457
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.729 
impact that we've seen from

458
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.559 
the pandemic will be felt, of course, by

459
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.869 
anybody, I think, working in the online

460
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.190 
learning space in that

461
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.339 
the vast majority of organisations

462
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.679 
suddenly found that they were unable to

463
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.680 
engage with physical

464
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.780 
forms of learning, whether that's a

465
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.329 
classroom-based or a structure led

466
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.710 
training, whatever else it might make.

467
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.979 
And so that, of course, necessitated

468
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.019 
a switch to online

469
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.699 
in the majority of cases, certainly for

470
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.859 
most businesses, and that

471
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.690 
drove considerable growth across

472
00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.729 
the whole community, provided that could

473
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.649 
serve that audience.

474
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.389 
Now, with Coursera ourselves,

475
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.089 
we saw some incredible growth over that

476
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.090 
period of time.

477
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.359 
We now have about 82

478
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.890 
million learners globally,

479
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.410 
30 million of which joined

480
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.549 
in 2020.

481
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.363 
So I was about a 65 percent year over

482
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.659 
year growth. And similarly, in the terms

483
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.739 
of the amount of people who are actually

484
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.929 
enrolling in courses, we

485
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.759 
saw a three-time increase over

486
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.489 
2019 to 77 million

487
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.690 
individual course enrolment.

488
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.820 
So there's a huge appetite for learning

489
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.263 
and we work with institutions.

490
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.879 
We work with businesses, we work with

491
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.739 
government organisations, we work with

492
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.699 
educational institutions.

493
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.084 
And of course, we work with individuals.

494
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.358 
Each of those different groups of

495
00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.359 
stakeholders.

496
00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.269 
All had different impacts as a result of

497
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.259 
the pandemic.

498
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.024 
I think the thing that unites all of

499
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.429 
them is the power of learning

500
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:16.449 
to be a force for good.

501
00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.990 
And that's from both a purely

502
00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.539 
educational perspective and enlightening

503
00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.779 
people and helping people live in a more

504
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.209 
diverse world, a more open world,

505
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.039 
a more appreciative world, but also

506
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.869 
obviously driving the individual

507
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.299 
goals of the individual people, taking

508
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.009 
the courses and the organisations that

509
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.010 
they represent.

510
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.489 
So we saw some

511
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.440 
real drive from businesses.

512
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.439 
There were, of course, those industry

513
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.239 
sectors that were really adversely hit

514
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.509 
by the pandemic in hospitality, space,

515
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.382 
airlines and so on, which were in many

516
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.819 
cases in pure survival mode.

517
00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.009 
And learning, unsurprisingly, wasn't

518
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.010 
their top priority.

519
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.819 
Other organisations that perhaps were

520
00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.069 
able to ride the pandemic more

521
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.629 
effectively or even thrive in that

522
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.953 
environment have absolutely

523
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.619 
seen that they've needed to continue to

524
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.119 
invest in skills and in many cases have

525
00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.309 
accelerated their digital transformation

526
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.289 
initiatives as the world has been

527
00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.869 
forced into an accelerated move into

528
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.849 
that digital space and operating online

529
00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.565 
with all of our consumers, adapting

530
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.809 
to work from home programmes, adapting

531
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.525 
to virtual environments, and that's

532
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.208 
driven a very significant drive.

533
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.319 
And in many cases, those organisations

534
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.035 
had to adapt to mass organisational

535
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.421 
change, if nothing else, and going from

536
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.900 
an office space culture to remote-based

537
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.459 
culture, which meant they had to

538
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.809 
accelerate their investments and

539
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.279 
purchasers, skipped some of their normal

540
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.199 
controls because they urgently needed to

541
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.000 
get things in place to

542
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.309 
exchange for what they perhaps had

543
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.310 
before.

544
00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.339 
Similarly, we've seen some really

545
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.680 
interesting endeavours from governmental

546
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:45.669 
organisations.

547
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.079 
I think there's been a recognition

548
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.059 
that's been put into stark

549
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.640 
focus as a result of the pandemic.

550
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.756 
Many, many people, of course, were

551
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.049 
made unemployed as a direct result of

552
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.609 
the pandemic from industry suffering

553
00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.869 
others who were put into some form of

554
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.438 
furlough or temporary working or

555
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.116 
funded by the government

556
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.650 
to keep people going until businesses

557
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.799 
could get back on their feet.

558
00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.839 
But there was a real recognition from

559
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.653 
many individuals and many governments

560
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.042 
that at a citizen level, the

561
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.809 
skill sets for the citizens as

562
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.489 
a whole to survive and for economies to

563
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.107 
bounce back from their huge debts

564
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.730 
incurred over the pandemic weren't there

565
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.859 
in many cases.

566
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.479 
And so a lot of government programmes

567
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.039 
have been built around workforce

568
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.804 
development programmes to help build

569
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.399 
particularly digital and technical

570
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.709 
skills, to help citizens

571
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.845 
move from roles that are perhaps no

572
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.972 
longer to be available post-pandemic or

573
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.579 
just simply into areas of growth

574
00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.999 
rather than areas of attrition and

575
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.819 
reduction in staff.

576
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.640 
And a lot of those government programmes

577
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.259 
also being very explicitly focussing on

578
00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.269 
people being unemployed as a result

579
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.679 
of the pandemic or struggling to get

580
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.579 
back into work.

581
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.829 
And that's clearly a far better approach

582
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.349 
than trying to manage the costs

583
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.519 
of having a large proportion of your

584
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.259 
citizens not able to access work.

585
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.214 
On a similar basis when you look at

586
00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.174 
the world of education, almost every

587
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.309 
campus was forced into a period of

588
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.569 
closure around the world, something like

589
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.489 
90 percent of all campuses had to close

590
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.434 
and they had to rapidly shift online

591
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800 
learning.

592
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.009 
And you saw a real

593
00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.529 
spectrum of how that was driven

594
00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.912 
and managed to cross across that whole

595
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.039 
sector. So some organisations would

596
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.049 
literally just take a lecture that

597
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.299 
had been done in a lecture theatre,

598
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.369 
record it and put it online - job

599
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.057 
done! We now got online education.

600
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.759 
Others would really recognise that

601
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.379 
engaging with a remote audience, a

602
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.789 
flexible audience, an audience that

603
00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.709 
wants to work in its own time is a

604
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.599 
completely different way of engaging and

605
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.217 
teaching and actually had already

606
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.259 
had some work done in that space or

607
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.089 
rapidly invested in course during the

608
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.499 
pandemic. And it does a really

609
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.500 
innovative things.

610
00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.012 
So it's been a very strong accelerator

611
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.919 
in the education space to start

612
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.380 
transforming it.

613
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.809 
The other thing that we've seen

614
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.430 
particularly and we did a very

615
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.919 
significant engagement with the

616
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.869 
education sector when the pandemic first

617
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.029 
started, we made Coursera freely

618
00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.402 
available to any educational

619
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.290 
institution anywhere in the world for

620
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.599 
virtually the entirety of the rest of

621
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.600 
2020.

622
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.389 
And we had over four thousand

623
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.339 
organisations signed up to utilise

624
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.349 
Coursera to help them manage their

625
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.000 
challenges of providing learning.

626
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.709 
And what was seen as some of the

627
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.376 
insights from those engagements is

628
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.189 
that there's a broad recognition that

629
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.052 
some level of online learning is going

630
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.999 
to be here to say is probably a more of

631
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.769 
a blended model of be some campus to be

632
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.479 
online and certainly won't truly replace

633
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.379 
campus.

634
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.699 
But it's definitely more of a shift

635
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.562 
towards that. A recognition that there

636
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.419 
would be more flexibility needs to be

637
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.420 
put in place.

638
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.071 
And as we look post-pandemic,

639
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.367 
many, many students have lost the

640
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.319 
ability to travel or are willing to work

641
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.150 
part-time to fund their education,

642
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.519 
and organisations have to adapt to

643
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.809 
those new market dynamics.

644
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.819 
The other thing that came out very

645
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.045 
clearly was that students

646
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.169 
are very concerned about career outcomes

647
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.359 
and investing time and money into

648
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.439 
education.

649
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.910 
Given that in many cases, many

650
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.499 
industries are in recession, many

651
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.789 
countries are in recession and heavy

652
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.790 
debt, and they want

653
00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.329 
to ensure that they're going to go to

654
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.369 
university, that when they come out of

655
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.595 
it, that that educational

656
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.242 
path is going to lead to a career, not

657
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.799 
just any career, but also a career of

658
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.759 
choice.

659
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.049 
And so we're seeing a lot of

660
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.329 
institutions also train move into

661
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.431 
more of an element of skills-based

662
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.199 
learning in their educational

663
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.059 
programmes, really trying to ensure that

664
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.709 
people come out with job-ready skills as

665
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.329 
likely to get them into the world of

666
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.800 
work that complements the more

667
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.049 
traditional academic skills development

668
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.549 
programme that happens in an educational

669
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.550 
institution.

670
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.179 
So across all of these different

671
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.429 
stakeholders, we see a real

672
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.319 
opportunity for these different groups

673
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.133 
to come together. I think as you look

674
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.219 
at the world of business, you see people

675
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.079 
going to reinventing themselves more and

676
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.080 
more frequently.

677
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.229 
Technical skills become

678
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.359 
out of date faster than ever before

679
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.549 
with the continual accelerating pace

680
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.380 
of technology and

681
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.632 
individuals in work having to reinvent

682
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.069 
their careers multiple times, having to

683
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.350 
constantly relearn and reinvest

684
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.409 
themselves.

685
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.299 
There's an opportunity for educational

686
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.099 
institutions to be a partner to that and

687
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.949 
really work more closely with the world

688
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.919 
and industry.

689
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.239 
There's an opportunity for government

690
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.430 
institutions to actually help

691
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.718 
fund these programmes, foster an

692
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.509 
environment of collaboration and invest

693
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.499 
at the citizen level.

694
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.579 
And of course, there's an opportunity

695
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.890 
for individuals now to access

696
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.739 
some incredible world-class quality

697
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.719 
content on a wide range of platforms, in

698
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.043 
many cases for free to give

699
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.349 
themselves an opportunity to educate

700
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.879 
themselves whether or not they have

701
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.301 
access to a degree or funding

702
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.665 
or anything else. So in that sense,

703
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.299 
online platforms like the organisations

704
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.589 
you're talking to today can be a great

705
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.779 
leveller for the world, a way of driving

706
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.849 
more equality and access to learning

707
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.850 
opportunities.

708
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.260 
And it makes a real

709
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.359 
difference at the individual level.

710
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.235 
We've seen countless learners whose

711
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.039 
lives have been transformed by having

712
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:45.979 
access to this.

713
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.529 
They've got them back into world work,

714
00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.441 
give them the chance to actually engage

715
00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.069 
in learning they couldn't do in any

716
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.200 
other means and really transform lives.

717
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.539 
So it's a very exciting industry to be

718
00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.469 
part of right now.

719
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.269 
It's going through a huge element of

720
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.230 
change across all these different global

721
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.839 
communities of stakeholders.

722
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.283 
And of course, as the world hopefully

723
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.799 
comes back to some kind of

724
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.869 
normalisation, we will

725
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.010 
see some return to

726
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.222 
person to person trading, face to face

727
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.349 
training. But most organisations

728
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.059 
that feared the move because of a

729
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.099 
backlash have actually found that

730
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.864 
the online programmes are far better

731
00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.339 
than they thought. They're going to be

732
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.049 
far more engaging, in many cases, more

733
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.579 
flexible, more scalable and more

734
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.281 
cost-effective. And so I think that inflexional shift we saw into the industry is

735
00:24:26.282 --> 00:24:27.941 
broadly going to be here to stay and then it'll be about how it evolves and how

736
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.819 
we continue to drive innovation as we

737
00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.820 
go through the years ahead.

738
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.159 
And that's going to be an exciting

739
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160 
journey to take.

740
00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.940 
Thank you, Anthony, for your

741
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.859 
statement. I think there are a lot of

742
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.349 
things we'll follow up in the discussion

743
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.319 
and we will close the

744
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.050 
intro input statement around

745
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.939 
with Anand.

746
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.499 
He's the CEO of

747
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.130 
edX and the stage is yours.

748
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.250 
Thank you, Jan. Let me share my screen.

749
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.170 
I hope you're all able to see my screen.

750
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.320 
Fantastic.

751
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.469 
First of all, thank you for having

752
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.450 
me join the conversation.

753
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.329 
In my discussion,

754
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.277 
I'm going to spend some time very

755
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.319 
quickly talking about the past, what

756
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.369 
happened during the pandemic, but

757
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.840 
focussed most of my discussion

758
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.650 
about what I see

759
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.489 
as the new normal going ahead.

760
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.499 
I'm going to talk about what I

761
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.059 
see as four big shifts

762
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.825 
in the education industry

763
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:37.670 
in the world ahead.

764
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.459 
Before I do that, let me

765
00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.540 
provide a quick

766
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.089 
overview of where we are at an

767
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.200 
edX post the pandemic.

768
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.976 
So, you know, as you all

769
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.430 
know, we're are learning platform.

770
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.250 
But one of the fish I don't know about

771
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.380 
how big a fish, but

772
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.475 
we have grown to about 40

773
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.549 
million learners today

774
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.242 
since the pandemic was a huge boost to

775
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.570 
all the learning.

776
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.089 
We've also worked with a number of

777
00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:08.679 
companies and you see them listed on the

778
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.630 
slide over 1000 companies

779
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.789 
in edX for business.

780
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.326 
And we offer credentials

781
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.330 
like MicroBachelors, MicroMasters,

782
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.740 
and we go all the way from free courses

783
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.930 
to full degrees.

784
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:26.499 
Our content is offered by some of the

785
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.990 
top institutions in the world.

786
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.293 
Companies like Google, Amazon and IBM

787
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.340 
and universities like Oxford,

788
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.109 
Cambridge, MIT, Harvard,

789
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.660 
RWTH Aachen, TUM,

790
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.910 
TU Delft and others.

791
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.230 
To talk a little bit about

792
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.809 
what we saw as we transition into

793
00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.000 
the COVID era and certainly

794
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.150 
COVID was a huge tailwind, was a huge

795
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.029 
win behind the backs of all

796
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.559 
of the providers.

797
00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280 
And we saw during

798
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.390 
the month of April,

799
00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:02.979 
particularly during the first week of

800
00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.599 
April, 10 times

801
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.756 
the number of new registered learners

802
00:27:06.757 --> 00:27:08.799 
come to the platform versus the

803
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.930 
same week just one month before.

804
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.207 
And we added just in the month of

805
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.198 
April, we added five million new

806
00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.039 
learners to edX which equalled the total

807
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.049 
number of new learners that came to

808
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.060 
edX.

809
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.260 
So there's just a huge, huge demand.

810
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.489 
You heard from some of the other

811
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.380 
panellists about how a lot of the

812
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.749 
tech companies responded

813
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.750 
to the pandemic.

814
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.009 
One of the very interesting courses we

815
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.180 
launched very rapidly

816
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.144 
and we did this in the first week of

817
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.950 
March of 2020

818
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.319 
was, a course, on how to use mechanical

819
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320 
ventilators.

820
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.410 
This course, was in collaboration

821
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.542 
with the Harvard and the Massachusetts

822
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.630 
General Hospital.

823
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.140 
And within weeks

824
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.089 
of the course, the course had

825
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.540 
350 thousand

826
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.529 
health care professionals from all over

827
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.147 
the world taking it. And I signed

828
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.709 
up for the course myself.

829
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.579 
And I looked at some of the

830
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.740 
conversations happening.

831
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.420 
You could see an

832
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.679 
OB-GYN from Chennai in India to a

833
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.200 
registered nurse in Brooklyn, the US

834
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.349 
to a surgeon from Columbia,

835
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.570 
all having an incredible conversation

836
00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.952 
and talking about what to do

837
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:21.659 
about COVID.

838
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.489 
And that's what I actually learnt on the

839
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.759 
discussion forum, that when someone

840
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.630 
was suffering from COVID and had

841
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.202 
breathing difficulties,

842
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.380 
but there was a key idea about

843
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.559 
that in that locality, they discovered

844
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.029 
that if you place them on their side, it

845
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.794 
was much better than if you had them

846
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.812 
lying on their back. So it was amazing

847
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.588 
to see real-time at the community

848
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.859 
that was forming and the discussions

849
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.860 
that were happening.

850
00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.969 
Certainly from MOOC providers, it seemed

851
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:50.829 
like the year 2012 all over again,

852
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.319 
this was a picture of the New York Times

853
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.482 
article by Laura Pappano,

854
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.689 
where she talked

855
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.009 
about the year of the MOOCs in The New

856
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.869 
York Times and the same thing happened

857
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.781 
about a year ago where all of the press

858
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.010 
was hyperventilating

859
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.243 
about, "oh my god!

860
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.429 
this is, again, another big year

861
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:09.550 
for the MOOC".

862
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.270 
But

863
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.530 
there was one big difference this time.

864
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.119 
From 10 years ago,

865
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.309 
the big difference was that we've learnt

866
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.310 
a lot.

867
00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.642 
In the last nine years, since the year

868
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.042 
of the MOOC, we had learnt a

869
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:25.710 
lot.

870
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.189 
Through research and through real

871
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.330 
experience, I'll show you two results.

872
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.959 
One thing we learnt was that online

873
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.449 
learning works, blended

874
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.450 
learning works.

875
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.049 
So you see a picture

876
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.579 
of a classroom at San Jose State

877
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.829 
University in fall

878
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.649 
of 2012, actually nine years ago.

879
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.909 
And the same experiment, that blended

880
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.739 
learning experiment was repeated by San

881
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.200 
Jose State in California

882
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.600 
in spring 2013, fall

883
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.750 
2013, spring 2014.

884
00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.829 
And the results are written by Professor

885
00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.086 
Kosrow Ghadiri in 2014, a landmark

886
00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.089 
paper.

887
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.589 
And they showed that the blended

888
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.630 
learning, the failure rate

889
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.720 
in discourse at the State University

890
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.209 
fell from 41 percent to nine

891
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.219 
percent four semesters in a

892
00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.220 
row.

893
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.919 
These are some impressive real results

894
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.140 
for blended learning, and

895
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.627 
this was shown multiple times, 41

896
00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.999 
percent failures to nine percent

897
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.279 
failures compared to the year before

898
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.689 
or compared to the more traditional

899
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.690 
model.

900
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.800 
Another experiment.

901
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000 
We did this at MIT,

902
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.279 
where this wasn't blended learning,

903
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.999 
this was pure online learning,

904
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.609 
a campus class of circuits, and we did

905
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.619 
this twice in the fall of 2016 in

906
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.090 
spring of 2017, where half the

907
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.885 
class took a fully online

908
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.469 
MOOC on edX for credit on campus.

909
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.360 
So campus students, about 40 of them,

910
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.309 
took a fully online

911
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.069 
MOOC on edX and they were given credit

912
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.180 
on campus at MIT.

913
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.563 
The other half of the students took a

914
00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.049 
fully in-person, course taught by campus

915
00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.050 
professors.

916
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.959 
And these results were published by

917
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.822 
Marshall in 2017, a researcher tracked

918
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.400 
the study. It was an edit.

919
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.785 
It was an A/B test, to my

920
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.690 
knowledge, one of the landmark A/B

921
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.466 
tests of purely online, but purely

922
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.190 
in-person for campus students.

923
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.010 
And mind you, this happened

924
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.453 
three years before COVID,

925
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.380 
2017.

926
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.949 
The online students reported less stress

927
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.269 
than the campus students are like the

928
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.309 
flexibility, we also give them the

929
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.540 
same exam at the end.

930
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.070 
An exam performance was within

931
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.660 
experimental error, similar.

932
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.520 
So these results have been coming out

933
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.481 
three years before the pandemic, so at

934
00:31:35.482 --> 00:31:37.599 
places like universities and so

935
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.609 
on where experiments like this have

936
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.199 
happened, they were very comfortable

937
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.729 
going fully online because they had

938
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.319 
these results that showed that online

939
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.209 
learning worked, blended learning

940
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.210 
worked.

941
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.303 
These are the result from the MIT that I

942
00:31:49.504 --> 00:31:51.023 
shared. So this time around, it

943
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:52.670 
was very different.

944
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.289 
And so now let me talk about the future

945
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.630 
and talk about four big shifts

946
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.302 
that I see happening for the future of

947
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.420 
learning.

948
00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.950 
First, I see a big shift

949
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.200 
to online lifelong learning.

950
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.422 
So at edX, we conducted a major future

951
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.460 
of work and education survey,

952
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.282 
and first of all, one result

953
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.559 
was that 58 percent of the respondents

954
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.599 
and these are not edX learners, this is

955
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.669 
broad participants around the world.

956
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.956 
58 percent said that COVID-19

957
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:25.829 
will cause them to seek additional

958
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.830 
education.

959
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.649 
And what is particularly interesting for

960
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:29.875 
eMOOCs is that 45 percent

961
00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.699 
are more likely to enrol in an online

962
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.729 
course that will help improve

963
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.769 
their career prospects, so the future

964
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.479 
of work and learning are really, really

965
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.480 
coming together.

966
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.999 
They want people to improve their career

967
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.489 
prospects and they want to take online

968
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.490 
courses.

969
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.599 
We also conducted a survey of the

970
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.369 
students that were coming to edX during

971
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.139 
the pandemic and asked them, why are you

972
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.140 
coming to edX?

973
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.260 
And what was amazing was that although

974
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.249 
38 percent were coming because they

975
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.509 
wanted to learn something new.

976
00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.494 
A significant part of the learners

977
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.669 
were coming for the same reasons as

978
00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:03.629 
before.

979
00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.459 
25 percent were in existing jobs, wanted

980
00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.460 
to upscale.

981
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.939 
11 percent of the people had been

982
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.829 
unemployed or furloughed because of the

983
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.594 
pandemic and they wanted to come out

984
00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.050 
better and get a job.

985
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.890 
16 percent were students replacing their

986
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.079 
college or school education.

987
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:21.350 
I want to point to Maggie.

988
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.720 
Maggie was

989
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.678 
furloughed. She was working with

990
00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.240 
Postmates.

991
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.420 
And Postmates is a company

992
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.192 
that has a lot of couriers that

993
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.279 
from delivery services,

994
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.690 
huge gig economy workers.

995
00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.180 
So they partnered with edX as part of

996
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:42.709 
edX for business, and they made

997
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.669 
available edX courses for all of their

998
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:45.670 
employees.

999
00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.369 
And they had done it before the

1000
00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.269 
pandemic.

1001
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.890 
But after the pandemic, they made edX

1002
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.916 
courses available both to existing

1003
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.420 
workers and furloughed workers.

1004
00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.280 
And Maggie is one example student.

1005
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:58.647 
She actually took the course, the

1006
00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.509 
professional certificate programme from

1007
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.424 
Technical University Munich (TUM),

1008
00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.520 
right close to where you are in

1009
00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.454 
Six Sigma and Lean and

1010
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.584 
she got a job at Amazon where she is

1011
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.869 
now succeeding and

1012
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.489 
doing very well and taking even more

1013
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.497 
courses. Just an amazing, amazing

1014
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.809 
story that really warms the heart.

1015
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.049 
The second big shift that we see for the

1016
00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.269 
future is a shift to short

1017
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.270 
modular courses.

1018
00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.738 
This shift is already happening, but we

1019
00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.503 
are seeing a huge, bigger shift, the

1020
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.691 
skills focussed short modular programmes

1021
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.061 
where particularly during the pandemic,

1022
00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.899 
people wanted to take short programmes

1023
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.999 
so that they can come out stronger after

1024
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000 
the pandemic.

1025
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.149 
And in fact, 26 percent

1026
00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.499 
of those surveyed said they wanted to

1027
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.539 
seek additional education that

1028
00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.039 
would be safe during an economic

1029
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.679 
downturn or would be pandemic proof.

1030
00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.269 
And you see all the amazing,

1031
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.849 
all the important upscaling topics that

1032
00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:55.850 
people wanted to take.

1033
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.949 
And they're looking for

1034
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.329 
short future proof programmes.

1035
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.869 
I see that being a major second

1036
00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.570 
big show.

1037
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.429 
Third big show, and this relates to

1038
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:06.430 
campuses.

1039
00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.682 
I see a huge shift in blended learning

1040
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160 
on campus.

1041
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.810 
So in this chart.

1042
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.090 
I'm showing you my prediction for the

1043
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.724 
adoption of blended learning on

1044
00:35:17.725 --> 00:35:18.725 
campuses.

1045
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.609 
I want you to focus on the green

1046
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.523 
outline here, I call it the

1047
00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.472 
inverted pan curve.

1048
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.020 
If any of you are joining from

1049
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:31.267 
India knows Hindi, it's the "ulta

1050
00:35:31.664 --> 00:35:32.979 
tawa (inverted pan)", it's the

1051
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:35.780 
"ulta tawa curve", it's inverted pan.

1052
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:37.870 
So the leap of the pan on the left-hand

1053
00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.359 
side was adoption of online learning

1054
00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.979 
before the pandemic, virtually zero.

1055
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.940 
During the pandemic, it shot up.

1056
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.562 
So before the pandemic was BCE

1057
00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.469 
(before the COVID era), a joke!

1058
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.595 
After the pandemic, it is CE (COVID

1059
00:35:50.668 --> 00:35:52.413 
era), we went to the base of the pan,

1060
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.211 
which is nearly 100 percent online

1061
00:35:54.212 --> 00:35:55.212 
learning.

1062
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.159 
And as we come out of the pandemic, this

1063
00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.385 
follows vaccination rates

1064
00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.170 
have increased.

1065
00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.169 
Universities will try to go back to the

1066
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.089 
old normal, but they'll never be able to

1067
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.340 
go back to the fully or not.

1068
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.909 
That's the neck of the pan.

1069
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.150 
In the future, I see the future

1070
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.280 
go towards the right to the panhandle,

1071
00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.079 
which will be roughly 50 percent

1072
00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.265 
blended, 50 percent online.

1073
00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.439 
As we talk to a lot of our university

1074
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.269 
partners, they're telling us that

1075
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.323 
they're never going back, that online

1076
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.469 
learning and blended learning is going

1077
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.479 
to be the new normal on campuses.

1078
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.399 
And I see by 2025, I see

1079
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.390 
50 to 40 percent of online or

1080
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.409 
blended learning happening on campuses

1081
00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.410 
around the world.

1082
00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.219 
This is the third big trend and

1083
00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.360 
there's real reason for this.

1084
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.549 
I'm showing you a picture of Mark

1085
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.619 
Branom. He's a faculty at a

1086
00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.429 
community college in California called

1087
00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.050 
City College.

1088
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.769 
And a lot of universities

1089
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.689 
have real trouble transitioning to

1090
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.309 
online on-campus for blended learning

1091
00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:52.480 
because they don't have the resources.

1092
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.119 
And he says that it's really hard work

1093
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.189 
to transition to online learning because

1094
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.599 
they don't have the digital materials.

1095
00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.229 
So we had this huge demand from

1096
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:03.219 
universities and community colleges all

1097
00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.229 
over the world, and in rapid

1098
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.601 
response, we launched edX online campus

1099
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.240 
last year.

1100
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:10.750 
Today, we make edX online campus

1101
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.596 
as a way for college and community

1102
00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.829 
college and university students to sign

1103
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:15.830 
up their students on

1104
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.457 
edX. And we have made a catalogue

1105
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.843 
of courses available, 100 percent for

1106
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.959 
free, including certification,

1107
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.059 
100 percent for free, for registered

1108
00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.949 
students at universities anywhere in the

1109
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.719 
world. So if any of you are part of any

1110
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.339 
university in the world or college or

1111
00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.159 
community college, you can come to

1112
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.409 
Google edX online campus and you can

1113
00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:36.782 
sign up all your students to

1114
00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.319 
take a catalogue of courses in edX

1115
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.630 
online campus completely for free,

1116
00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.610 
including certifications.

1117
00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:43.899 
Free!

1118
00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.879 
And today, we already have over a

1119
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.949 
thousand institutions all over the world

1120
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:50.169 
now are taking these online courses

1121
00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.170 
for their campus students.

1122
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.619 
And finally, the fourth big shift that

1123
00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.869 
I see is shift to soft skills

1124
00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.359 
also called power skills for corporate

1125
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.360 
learning.

1126
00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.070 
So in 2019, before the pandemic,

1127
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.733 
we looked at the top 15 courses taken

1128
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.911 
by corporate learners on edX, these are

1129
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.010 
B2B learners.

1130
00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.489 
And the usual courses were amongst

1131
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.679 
the top 15 list, computer science,

1132
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.379 
data science, machine learning,

1133
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:17.390 
business.

1134
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:19.679 
But if you look at 2020 during

1135
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.150 
the pandemic, we saw that soft

1136
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.520 
skills courses, this is for

1137
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.441 
B2B. Soft skills courses made

1138
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.451 
the top 50 list - leadership,

1139
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.074 
communication, the amazing

1140
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.400 
emotional intelligence course,

1141
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.030 
happiness at work from

1142
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360 
Berkeley and so on.

1143
00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.029 
Many of these courses began to make

1144
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.030 
these top lists.

1145
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.349 
And so I see that for

1146
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:44.280 
people who are in companies,

1147
00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.289 
they're going to be taking more and more

1148
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.760 
of these human skills types of

1149
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.229 
courses in the future.

1150
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:50.669 
I see this as a major shift for the

1151
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.670 
future.

1152
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.849 
And finally, to close, this

1153
00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.050 
is going to be the new normal.

1154
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.054 
This normal is a good thing, blended

1155
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.639 
learning is a good thing, short

1156
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.079 
programmes and credentialing is a good

1157
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.119 
thing, moving

1158
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.409 
to soft skills is a good thing, these

1159
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.410 
are all good things.

1160
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.039 
So my message to the world is, let's not

1161
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.719 
fight it. This is the moment for true

1162
00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.720 
transformation.

1163
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.869 
Let's embrace it and let's make it

1164
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:15.870 
happen. Thank you.

1165
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.109 
Thank you, Anant, for this

1166
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:22.059 
impressive vision

1167
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.489 
and probably it's not so much of a

1168
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.560 
vision, but it's like a short term

1169
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.100 
prediction.

1170
00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.019 
Let me start with a few questions,

1171
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.639 
but I'm also going to invite the

1172
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.349 
audience if you want to have, if you

1173
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.239 
want to pose questions, you can do so in

1174
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.240 
the Q and A session of

1175
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.340 
the webinar.

1176
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.070 
And we will pick some

1177
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.619 
during the next phase

1178
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.620 
of the panel.

1179
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:48.170 
Also, if you want to put them in person,

1180
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.380 
you can raise your hand in the chat

1181
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.999 
and we can pick some people to

1182
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.729 
audit or like,

1183
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:55.730 
yeah, tell them with

1184
00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920 
your own voice.

1185
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.400 
So we get some of the

1186
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.483 
digital world bridged and be at least

1187
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.100 
a bit in person to person.

1188
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.719 
And let me start with Justin.

1189
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:10.120 
I think you mentioned that

1190
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.969 
all the other benefits we have in the

1191
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.199 
world of digital learning

1192
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.300 
that we can scale

1193
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.209 
and that we have this speed and we can

1194
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.280 
also respond with special classes

1195
00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.809 
like you showed for teachers.

1196
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.469 
And you also mentioned social, social

1197
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.350 
learning and social experiences

1198
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.300 
within the online learning world.

1199
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.059 
Do you feel that

1200
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.659 
like today, where everyone is like

1201
00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.729 
a pro in attending

1202
00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.445 
video conferences and using digital

1203
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.030 
tools in

1204
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.509 
their work-life, that this also

1205
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.949 
impacted and changed the way

1206
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:50.396 
social learning and interaction in

1207
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.870 
MOOCs are taking place?

1208
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.969 
Oh, yeah, absolutely, I think

1209
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.099 
like everyone has spoken already

1210
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.289 
today and we've seen a rapid

1211
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:02.290 
adoption of

1212
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.429 
skills that we've

1213
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.900 
used in the real world online.

1214
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.010 
And now that has been accelerated.

1215
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.489 
I think fundamentally

1216
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.059 
when we're together meeting in person,

1217
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.154 
hopefully, next year we'll be having

1218
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.800 
conversations, will be asking questions,

1219
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.260 
will be getting expert

1220
00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.410 
sort of insights and

1221
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.909 
sharing knowledge between us and

1222
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.130 
collaborating face to face

1223
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.289 
as we would in our institutions and on

1224
00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.130 
campus. But I think we've

1225
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.809 
sort of seen a kind of a shift of

1226
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.099 
those sorts of kind of techniques

1227
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.460 
online. And some of us have

1228
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:41.902 
been using those those those

1229
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.190 
skills for some time in our

1230
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.160 
kind of leisure time

1231
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.709 
with our social media platforms.

1232
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.689 
But we've now applied

1233
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.340 
those skills to

1234
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.170 
learning.

1235
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.539 
Then maybe let me stick to

1236
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.179 
this idea and maybe also to the idea

1237
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.709 
of Anant who said, like, we going to

1238
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:04.837 
have like 50-50 blended

1239
00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.090 
learning in the future

1240
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:09.419 
and being like all of

1241
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.224 
you provide platforms that come from

1242
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.300 
this scalable approach.

1243
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:17.389 
What does it mean for the further

1244
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:19.280 
development in terms of

1245
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.110 
the platforms you built

1246
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.409 
when we kind of see this different world

1247
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.820 
of learning in the future?

1248
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:27.409 
Anant, maybe you want to take?

1249
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.499 
Sure, I think, remember

1250
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.840 
the results that I showed you for

1251
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:32.850 
blended learning.

1252
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.380 
One of the first results in

1253
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.509 
the history of online learning was the

1254
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.127 
earliest results of a real study.

1255
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.649 
A real A/B test happened at San

1256
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.329 
Jose State starting in the fall of 2012.

1257
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.399 
This was within six

1258
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.439 
months of the MOOC movement starting, we

1259
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.939 
already had a blended learning test

1260
00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.320 
because we knew this was very important

1261
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.414 
and they ran the test four semesters

1262
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.315 
in a row and

1263
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.488 
since then, we knew that blended

1264
00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.129 
learning was important and we have been

1265
00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.319 
developing feature after feature on

1266
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.999 
the edX platform for the past eight or

1267
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.029 
nine years for and to

1268
00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:07.090 
support blended learning.

1269
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.059 
Any number of features allowing

1270
00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.650 
professors to run A/B tests,

1271
00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.355 
creating highly rigorous assessment

1272
00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.010 
types, enabling

1273
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:18.936 
you know, we've gone so far beyond

1274
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:21.039 
multiple-choice today that there are all

1275
00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.040 
kinds of

1276
00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.103 
features and benefits that people can

1277
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:26.829 
get from blended learning.

1278
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.900 
And because the platform is open source,

1279
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.749 
we now have 55 different assessment

1280
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.609 
types on edX contributed heavily by the

1281
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.659 
whole open source community.

1282
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.980 
So I think that

1283
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.369 
blended learning has already been

1284
00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.281 
factored in quite a bit, but I think we

1285
00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.999 
will see a lot more happening in the

1286
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.230 
future. I'll give you one example.

1287
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.019 
When we launched edX online campus, which

1288
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.210 
is meant to support blended learning,

1289
00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.442 
one of the features we implemented was

1290
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.580 
that it is integrable

1291
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.989 
with campus systems, with campus

1292
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:58.090 
elements like we created

1293
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.269 
the LTI, the new LTI

1294
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:02.766 
support for integration with campus

1295
00:44:02.767 --> 00:44:03.971 
elements. And that's just one example so

1296
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.830 
that faculty could use campus

1297
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.192 
elements like Blackboard or Canvas or

1298
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.434 
Moodle and so on, as well as a MOOC

1299
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.419 
system. And so we are trying to create

1300
00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.429 
interoperable systems that will

1301
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.739 
work across these boundaries.

1302
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.880 
Let me follow up on this idea,

1303
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.431 
if we're coming to a world where we see

1304
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.179 
more interoperable system.

1305
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.649 
Do you feel like, you

1306
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.339 
said you're going to have like an LTI

1307
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.959 
integration into campus management

1308
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.329 
systems, if we take this thought

1309
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.750 
one step further and

1310
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.622 
combine it with you have your personal

1311
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.629 
wallet and you have your credentials and

1312
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.345 
you can you can collect credentials

1313
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:46.889 
from different platforms and then maybe

1314
00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.869 
have I don't know, and you also said

1315
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.339 
we're going to have like more smaller

1316
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.390 
modules of learning.

1317
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.119 
Did you see also a trend to

1318
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.099 
be or do you see people moving from

1319
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.011 
platform to platform and cherry picking

1320
00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.189 
things?

1321
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:00.562 
And how do you react to this

1322
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.999 
trend of being more self-serving

1323
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:04.660 
learners?

1324
00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:09.863 
You know, Jan, I think it is already

1325
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.979 
happening.

1326
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.891 
I think what is happening with learning

1327
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.389 
is that it's becoming unbundled.

1328
00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.346 
You know, I wrote a blog

1329
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.519 
in the Huffington Post many years ago

1330
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.289 
called "If You Google

1331
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.080 
Unbundled Education", Unbundled,

1332
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.885 
already talked about where learners

1333
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:28.850 
are looking more and more from modular

1334
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.270 
programmes that they can stack.

1335
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.535 
The learning on multiple platforms

1336
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.829 
already they are learning on campus

1337
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:37.139 
and on online platforms and,

1338
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.449 
you know, creating stackable pathways,

1339
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.579 
innovated very heavily with

1340
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.619 
MicroBachelors and MicroMasters where

1341
00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.690 
people can take a standalone credential

1342
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.909 
and then they can continue the degree on

1343
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:48.930 
campus or online.

1344
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:50.993 
Today we have about a dozen

1345
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:53.356 
degree programmes on edX, and most

1346
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.769 
of them have a modular MicroMasters

1347
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.465 
component that they can take.

1348
00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.339 
And if they want to stop, they can stop.

1349
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.959 
If they want to stack it up and do more,

1350
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.939 
they can do it. So I think we'll see

1351
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.753 
more and more of unbundling, more and

1352
00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.890 
more people mixing and matching.

1353
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.479 
And I think one of the challenges

1354
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.489 
I would like to pose for this group here

1355
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.159 
in particular, for the

1356
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.930 
fish in the tank, is that, frankly,

1357
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.879 
this whole industry will be a little

1358
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.429 
fish unless people can all agree

1359
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:21.949 
on coming up with ways in which

1360
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.877 
credentials can be stacked across

1361
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.320 
multiple universities and players and so

1362
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.900 
on. And right now it is insane

1363
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.989 
where everybody has their own thing.

1364
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.529 
So I think there needs to be some kind

1365
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.539 
of, you know, communication and

1366
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.579 
chatter about how we can work together

1367
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.690 
with common credentials.

1368
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.560 
I totally agree.

1369
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:40.319 
And actually, this is my job I'm doing

1370
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.399 
now for the German government.

1371
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.869 
So this fits very well.

1372
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.472 
Maybe, Anthony can take this

1373
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:47.009 
one.

1374
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.869 
If we have different roles now, we have

1375
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.610 
the role of the content producer, the

1376
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.730 
platform provider, but probably

1377
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.659 
we also need something like the mentor

1378
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:58.610 
and that recommendation

1379
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.620 
cross-platform.

1380
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.829 
Is that a risk for the big

1381
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.389 
platforms or is that a challenge

1382
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.590 
or an opportunity?

1383
00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.189 
I think almost everything is an

1384
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.190 
opportunity.

1385
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:11.219 
I would just say broadly in how you're

1386
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.569 
in it and how you actually adapt and

1387
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.009 
apply to it. I think one of the

1388
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.823 
challenges that people do face is, of

1389
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.609 
course, that the concept of choice

1390
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:19.469 
overload, that there is so many learning

1391
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.090 
options in front of them, like

1392
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.159 
how would you decide what is the right

1393
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.826 
thing to do, how you deciding what

1394
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.994 
structure and what kind of stackable

1395
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.843 
format and how you work through other

1396
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.733 
things? And so absolutely you do need

1397
00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:31.780 
guidance.

1398
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.959 
Even at a company level if you roll out

1399
00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.099 
a learning programme, you just give

1400
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.629 
people access to lots of content.

1401
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:38.129 
You'll get very little adoption because

1402
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:39.989 
people need to have recommendations, the

1403
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.639 
guidance to understand what's the right

1404
00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.810 
path for their outcomes.

1405
00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.770 
And from a user perspective,

1406
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.840 
if you are a learner, you're trying to

1407
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:48.989 
develop a skill set.

1408
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.242 
So you are generally not the person in

1409
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.799 
the position to evaluate whether the

1410
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.149 
course you're taking is actually going

1411
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:56.099 
to be able to deliver that goal for you

1412
00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.011 
is the right course or is good quality.

1413
00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.949 
So you need something else.

1414
00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.429 
Now, obviously, companies,

1415
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.959 
MOOC providers will have their

1416
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.999 
strategies for representing how

1417
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.779 
and why their content is great quality,

1418
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.939 
either because of the way they select

1419
00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.280 
content, they build it, they bet it

1420
00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:11.339 
whatever else it might be.

1421
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:13.829 
But they do also think talking to that

1422
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:15.869 
point about like unbundling of content

1423
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:17.459 
and how things will happen, I think we

1424
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.224 
are starting to see something in the

1425
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.970 
educational sector and I think

1426
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:22.799 
we're going to see this replicated in

1427
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.659 
businesses and government departments as

1428
00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:25.660 
well, is that these

1429
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.769 
institutions who are trying to bring

1430
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.530 
together a learning programme to deliver

1431
00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.500 
sort of outcomes and leveraging multiple

1432
00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.949 
content providers are going to

1433
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:37.049 
be taking more of the role of saying

1434
00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:38.969 
we're going to be able to curate from

1435
00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:40.439 
what's available in the marketplace.

1436
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.149 
We're going to put a kind of credential

1437
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.310 
over the top of it all, going to give it

1438
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.030 
like a quality stamp or

1439
00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.340 
a degree programme.

1440
00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.899 
But we're not going to be wedded to the

1441
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.279 
fact that we have to develop everything

1442
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.149 
ourselves.

1443
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.219 
We can be open to third party content,

1444
00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:55.049 
but we're going to play a much greater

1445
00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.629 
role in contextualising the relevancy

1446
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:59.279 
of that content within their local

1447
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.110 
domain, within that degree circle,

1448
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.149 
within the individual country,

1449
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:04.949 
territory, geography and the kind of

1450
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.719 
aspirations and ages of their students.

1451
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.441 
And it's that kind of move to, I think,

1452
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.449 
of having organisations

1453
00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.165 
that are the guides that help bring

1454
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.829 
stuff together and package things into

1455
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:19.090 
something that can be recognised by

1456
00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:21.744 
government programmes, by businesses

1457
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.449 
looking to hire people where

1458
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.489 
it could be something that might be

1459
00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:28.115 
content from edX, content from Coursera,

1460
00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.138 
content from FutureLearn, and content

1461
00:49:30.139 --> 00:49:31.259 
from other parties, as well as home

1462
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.029 
grown content, everything else, but is

1463
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.279 
packaged into a programme that has some

1464
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.260 
kind of external valid recognition

1465
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.719 
that can be used to deliver career

1466
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:39.749 
outcomes.

1467
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:40.889 
And I think there is going to be an

1468
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:41.890 
evolution that way.

1469
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.190 
I think, as Anant said, you know,

1470
00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.180 
you can't operate in this world in total

1471
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.305 
isolation and try and own the whole

1472
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.279 
space. It just doesn't operate that way.

1473
00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.959 
You have to recognise there are multiple

1474
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.960 
choices.

1475
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.929 
And what some of the things we'll be

1476
00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:56.699 
trying to do is Coursera to represent

1477
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:58.829 
the elements that we think we can

1478
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:00.959 
provide most value to and why

1479
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.579 
we think those are the most valuable

1480
00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:03.719 
components of what we bring.

1481
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.494 
But it's a very rare set of

1482
00:50:05.495 --> 00:50:07.161 
circumstances that you can fix the

1483
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.109 
whole problem through any individual

1484
00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.110 
supplier.

1485
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.549 
Yeah, if I can just jump in and build

1486
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:14.726 
on it, I think it's it's

1487
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:16.820 
a great point. And I think

1488
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.579 
the initiatives that we're sort of

1489
00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.079 
working on at the moment, we're seeing

1490
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.969 
the most sort of traction in are exactly

1491
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:24.783 
as Anthony is describing, where we're

1492
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.469 
taking a mix of sort of industry,

1493
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.199 
academic, professional body,

1494
00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.659 
governmental sort of input.

1495
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.699 
And we're bringing together these

1496
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:36.691 
parties together to build out

1497
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.309 
the programme.

1498
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:40.489 
So they're addressing and achieving

1499
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:41.769 
the kind of outcomes that we're all

1500
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.495 
looking to achieve. We were running

1501
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.671 
several at the moment, one in financial

1502
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.169 
services and Fintech, for example,

1503
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.449 
which is in response to a government

1504
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:52.489 
in the UK's review of the sector.

1505
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.899 
And then we're bringing all of these

1506
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.209 
parties together to identify

1507
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.340 
kind of the what and the how

1508
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.429 
we're going to achieve the outcomes

1509
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.559 
from the government sort of initiative.

1510
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.128 
And I think this sort of kind of

1511
00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:07.730 
multifaceted sort of approach

1512
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:09.130 
is absolutely the right one.

1513
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.250 
And wherever possible, of course, you're

1514
00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.193 
are trying to also encourage a degree

1515
00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:15.379 
of standardisation as well.

1516
00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.605 
And to Anant's point, the

1517
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.609 
common micro-credential framework that

1518
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:21.521 
was established in Europe, you know, is

1519
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:23.599 
a good example of how we're

1520
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.099 
trying to bring people together to kind

1521
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:27.530 
of deliver kind of credentials

1522
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:29.249 
that follow a common standard.

1523
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.152 
Yes. So I think clearly, you

1524
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.949 
know, as Anthony said, no

1525
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:35.959 
one individual platform is going to be

1526
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.330 
able to solve this, this is a seismic

1527
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:39.919 
sort of shift that we're all trying to

1528
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.449 
take. And we're better we're better

1529
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:42.450 
doing that together.

1530
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.959 
What I ask myself of, you know,

1531
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:49.219 
providing like special

1532
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.249 
open campus solutions

1533
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.599 
or offers for the universities

1534
00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.760 
and you also providing this, let's say,

1535
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.129 
label or certificate on top of

1536
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:59.130 
a certain programme.

1537
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.675 
How is the reception of traditional

1538
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:03.030 
universities?

1539
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.239 
Are they getting scared because they

1540
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.240 
see that education

1541
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.619 
is changing or how is the relation?

1542
00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:12.980 
I mean,

1543
00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:14.690 
go ahead,

1544
00:52:16.449 --> 00:52:17.859 
Sorry. Maybe I can take a quick crack at

1545
00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:18.860 
that.

1546
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.589 
I think there's a mix, but whenever you

1547
00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.329 
have innovation and fast moving

1548
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:24.549 
industry, you will always see a bell

1549
00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:26.289 
curve. There will be the early adopters

1550
00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.400 
who love it and they will be the

1551
00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.489 
others that absolutely hate it.

1552
00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:32.889 
But then the vast majority in the middle

1553
00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:35.751 
are initially ambivalent, but

1554
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:37.979 
then gradually they move in the

1555
00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.369 
direction that will benefit them.

1556
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.289 
What we are hearing from universities is

1557
00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.290 
that, they

1558
00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.829 
know that they need to create a lot more

1559
00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.239 
online content and they just don't have

1560
00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.318 
it, and their students

1561
00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:50.079 
are already coming to us and learning

1562
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.099 
whether it's from companies or

1563
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.521 
universities, their employees

1564
00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:54.810 
or learners are already coming to edX

1565
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.889 
and learning in the thousands and tens

1566
00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:57.890 
of thousands.

1567
00:52:58.090 --> 00:52:59.903 
And so they know that there is a tide

1568
00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.409 
flowing already and that they need to go

1569
00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:03.410 
with the tide.

1570
00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:04.830 
As an example, we work with

1571
00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.849 
several universities.

1572
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.349 
One example is university in India,

1573
00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.780 
where they offer

1574
00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.910 
to their students a

1575
00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.354 
MicroMasters programmes so that when

1576
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.189 
the students graduate with a bachelor's

1577
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:19.719 
degree, they can also have a

1578
00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.830 
MicroMasters from

1579
00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.949 
a university like Dalston Solar

1580
00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.597 
Engineering or Berkeley Marketing

1581
00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:26.859 
Analytics.

1582
00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.575 
And so these are examples where the

1583
00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.239 
students becomes much more employable.

1584
00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.089 
Similarly, many faculty have now begun

1585
00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:36.070 
to use edX online campus courses

1586
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.659 
on their campus, almost like a textbook.

1587
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.899 
And so the professors are looking at

1588
00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.219 
this like the textbook model.

1589
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:43.960 
They are not seeing it as,

1590
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.979 
taking their jobs, but they're seeing it

1591
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.659 
as a textbook way to help them in their

1592
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.829 
jobs. I mean, can you imagine, as a

1593
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.299 
professor, if I get a whole bunch of

1594
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.966 
exercises and problem sets with my

1595
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.830 
students and I don't have to grade them,

1596
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:56.999 
it makes my job as a professor so much

1597
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.739 
better. But I can spend more time with

1598
00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.269 
my students, mentoring them and helping

1599
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.270 
them.

1600
00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.310 
Justin, do you want to add something?

1601
00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:11.159 
I think a significant number

1602
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.630 
of our university partners are

1603
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.976 
very keen to collaborate

1604
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.250 
with industry.

1605
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:20.159 
They say that it's a common

1606
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.329 
sort of request and they're very

1607
00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:22.604 
receptive to conversations

1608
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.109 
that we have with them about helping

1609
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:26.969 
ensure that what they're creating

1610
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.409 
is relevant.

1611
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:30.149 
And that can obviously take many, many

1612
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:31.150 
different forms.

1613
00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:32.662 
And one can be a simple sort

1614
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.030 
of expert educator providing

1615
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.040 
deep sort of practical kind of

1616
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.499 
real, real world sort of input into the

1617
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.659 
courses. In other cases, it's a question

1618
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.277 
of sort of endorsing and the kind

1619
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.589 
of the content that they're creating, in

1620
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:48.260 
some cases co-creating.

1621
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.189 
And, of course, you know, what we're

1622
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:51.905 
also seeing is is the flip of that,

1623
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.360 
which is where we're working with

1624
00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:56.232 
industry partner on creating learning.

1625
00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:58.080 
And then we want to bring in a

1626
00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.329 
university partner to kind of provide

1627
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.859 
that rigour and context and challenge

1628
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.959 
that I spoke about earlier.

1629
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.195 
So it's not in all cases,

1630
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:06.349 
clearly, because there's still a huge,

1631
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:08.739 
huge demand for research dissemination

1632
00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.739 
and widening access and so forth.

1633
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.540 
But in terms of the particular kind of

1634
00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:14.525 
universities that we're seeing very

1635
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.229 
much to kind of what Anthony was talking

1636
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.847 
about in terms of of the rise and

1637
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:20.129 
importance of kind of the

1638
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:22.199 
skills and knowledge for the jobs

1639
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.089 
of tomorrow universities,

1640
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.920 
that is something that we're seeing

1641
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.480 
significantly on FutureLearn.

1642
00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:31.289 
Let me stick to this organisational

1643
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:32.460 
level for a minute.

1644
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:35.159 
Anthony, you mentioned that you saw a

1645
00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.139 
big difference in how different

1646
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.420 
industries reacted,

1647
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:41.500 
also because they were struggling with

1648
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.520 
different problems.

1649
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:45.360 
But do you also see that

1650
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.749 
companies and organisations and maybe

1651
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.367 
also governance are more learning

1652
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.682 
from each other and from the benefits,

1653
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.409 
or does anyone or

1654
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.940 
everyone makes their own

1655
00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.441 
experiences? So how much like

1656
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.031 
I don't know, how much is this the good

1657
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:03.320 
word and the spread?

1658
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:05.579 
Do we need to work on this also in the

1659
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:06.590 
research community, maybe?

1660
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.589 
I think people do learn.

1661
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.300 
I mean, there's a natural learning frame

1662
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.809 
that comes because people come from

1663
00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:14.770 
other organisations and they bring their

1664
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.829 
expertise as people naturally move

1665
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.449 
around the world of work

1666
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.076 
and they learn through third party

1667
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:22.979 
organisations like those bringing in

1668
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.509 
examples and case studies of what's

1669
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:25.799 
worked well in different environments.

1670
00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.090 
And I don't really think that's

1671
00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:29.009 
fundamentally change the result of the

1672
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.719 
pandemic. I think the only thing I would

1673
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.533 
say is change slightly is that people

1674
00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:33.689 
have had more opportunities to do

1675
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:34.730 
virtual things.

1676
00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.112 
They preferred more frequent

1677
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:37.830 
opportunities to engage with things

1678
00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.059 
because you have the travel and

1679
00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.259 
logistical elements of it.

1680
00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.122 
So that's created perhaps more options

1681
00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.939 
to hear from case studies and stories.

1682
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.062 
So I don't think it's shifting in that

1683
00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:49.435 
sense. I think what there

1684
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.456 
is a recognition is that

1685
00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.329 
the world is becoming much more

1686
00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.519 
digitally focussed for obvious reasons.

1687
00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:58.769 
More and more organisations are going

1688
00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:00.179 
through digital transformations that has

1689
00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.199 
been accelerated.

1690
00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.659 
And there is a broad

1691
00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.669 
view, I think, that regardless whatever

1692
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:08.099 
industry you're in, the two major

1693
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.569 
things that lead to competitive

1694
00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.432 
advantage are your people on the skill

1695
00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.584 
sets that they have to bring to bear

1696
00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.569 
for the company and the way you can

1697
00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:16.739 
utilise technology.

1698
00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:18.209 
And so I will always describe any

1699
00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:20.369 
company as a tech company powered

1700
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.329 
by people.

1701
00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:22.949 
And you got to really focus on those two

1702
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:24.659 
dimensions effectively to drive

1703
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.660 
competitive advantage.

1704
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.546 
Now, a lot of companies are moving

1705
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:30.344 
to cloud, a lot of companies are moving

1706
00:57:30.345 --> 00:57:32.129 
to the digital media transformation,

1707
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:33.130 
engaging with a

1708
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.411 
population around the world that's very

1709
00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:38.369 
used to being stuck at home, having to

1710
00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:39.809 
engage with suppliers and online

1711
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:41.669 
capacity in a remote capacity and so on.

1712
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:43.169 
And what that effectively means is you

1713
00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:44.840 
open up the world to competition.

1714
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.289 
This is actually true for universities

1715
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:47.639 
as well. By the way, in the sense, as a

1716
00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.300 
student, if you don't need to be on

1717
00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.179 
campus all the time or even a lot of the

1718
00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.949 
time, you can kind of literally go to

1719
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:54.299 
any university anywhere in the world.

1720
00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:55.839 
So it changes the competitive dynamics

1721
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.840 
of the landscape.

1722
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.859 
On the business level, is becoming more

1723
00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.509 
globally competitive than ever before

1724
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:02.250 
because so much is happening digitally.

1725
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:04.739 
And if you don't adapt to that

1726
00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.309 
and move with that, that's a challenge.

1727
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.030 
What we tend to see is that

1728
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:11.969 
there's a lot of talk about how

1729
00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.345 
skills and the skills gap

1730
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:16.041 
and the skills challenge is a CEO level

1731
00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.249 
agenda.

1732
00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:18.909 
And I think that's broadly too true in

1733
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:20.269 
that sense is a real concern.

1734
00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.589 
The challenge is that most organisations

1735
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:24.640 
are not skills companies, the

1736
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:26.579 
manufacturers or retailers or

1737
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.199 
travel agents or whatever they may be.

1738
00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.659 
And their core expertise

1739
00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:32.522 
is not building necessarily a learning

1740
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.920 
culture or a skills first company.

1741
00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:37.229 
And so they typically

1742
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:38.230 
look to the L and D (Learning and Development)

1743
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:39.390 
department to drive it.

1744
00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:41.009 
But often, whether the budget or the

1745
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:42.299 
power, the accountability to make it

1746
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.211 
happen and you have this real challenge

1747
00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:46.229 
at the company culturally and

1748
00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.809 
kind of from the race top of the C

1749
00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.879 
Suite isn't designed to

1750
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.860 
embrace that world of change easily.

1751
00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.269 
And it becomes a real

1752
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.639 
challenge for organisations to figure

1753
00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.340 
out how to make that journey through.

1754
00:58:58.350 --> 00:58:59.579 
And that's where I think the most

1755
00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.169 
guidance to support is needed because

1756
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.934 
it's actually adapting your business

1757
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:06.059 
to be a tech and people business,

1758
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.524 
regardless of industry rather than a

1759
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.529 
retailer or a banker or whatever else it

1760
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:12.570 
might be. And I think that's the kind of

1761
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:15.239 
core element of shared learning

1762
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.859 
that industries have the opportunity to

1763
00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.193 
learn from each other from, because no

1764
00:59:18.194 --> 00:59:20.249 
matter what industry you're in, that's a

1765
00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:21.839 
common challenge that everybody is up

1766
00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.212 
to. And if you want to learn

1767
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.529 
from someone and you are a retailer and

1768
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:26.579 
you want to find out whether a financial

1769
00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.246 
institution is doing, if you're in

1770
00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:29.399 
separate industries, most people are

1771
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.530 
very, very happy to share.

1772
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:31.949 
It's more when you're talking directly

1773
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:33.119 
to your competitor that you tend to be a

1774
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.809 
lot more withholding information.

1775
00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:37.199 
So I think because of these global

1776
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.449 
common themes around improving skill

1777
00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:41.489 
sets across organisations are all

1778
00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:43.289 
relevant to everybody, there's certainly

1779
00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:45.119 
much more opportunity to learn from

1780
00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.529 
peers in the marketplace in a

1781
00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:47.660 
non-competitive environment.

1782
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.530 
Great, thank you, then maybe we have two

1783
00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:53.869 
audience questions and I'm going to

1784
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:55.229 
read the first one, which is

1785
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.950 
from Mathias, and he's

1786
00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.599 
asking, "when looking at the new demand

1787
00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.670 
of soft skill courses in 2020,

1788
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.889 
what capabilities, personal attributes

1789
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.179 
and attitudes should work as

1790
01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.232 
scientists/engineer/teacher have

1791
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.727 
in the world of the new normal?"

1792
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.357 
So maybe Anant, as you introduced

1793
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.400 
the world of the new normal, you can

1794
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:14.730 
have the first take.

1795
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:17.540 
Sure, you know,

1796
01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.209 
soft skills are better known as power

1797
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:21.860 
skills, than human skills.

1798
01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.331 
What we're seeing is that we have quite

1799
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.370 
a few courses.

1800
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.479 
We also have a professional certificate

1801
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.919 
in soft skills from RIT

1802
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.189 
on edX and some of the most popular

1803
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.839 
courses and soft skills that will become

1804
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.849 
important for engineering

1805
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.079 
and scientists and so on are the

1806
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.489 
following - Teamwork.

1807
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.200 
Collaboration.

1808
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.977 
Communication and presentation skills.

1809
01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.780 
Storytelling.

1810
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:50.411 
Emotional intelligence.

1811
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:52.050 
Critical thinking.

1812
01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.794 
So these are just examples

1813
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.976 
of seven skills that are

1814
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.899 
critical soft skills.

1815
01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.950 
And what's interesting is that

1816
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.004 
you can learn this and you can learn

1817
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.965 
this completely online, and some of

1818
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:06.119 
these courses are incredibly popular,

1819
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:08.610 
particularly with businesses,

1820
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.489 
because often times when I go to

1821
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.869 
a MOOC site and I'm an individual

1822
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:13.870 
learner.

1823
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.390 
I don't know any course on emotional

1824
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:18.670 
intelligence, you know, I think

1825
01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:20.349 
I'm pretty emotionally intelligent, but

1826
01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:21.459 
I didn't know that I need to learn that

1827
01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.589 
stuff. And so what we're seeing

1828
01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:25.300 
is that employers are creating

1829
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:27.309 
waiting lists for their employees and

1830
01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:28.929 
saying, look, we want all of you to take

1831
01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:30.309 
these courses in collaboration with

1832
01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:31.310 
people.

1833
01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:32.799 
And frankly, I think another really

1834
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.940 
important skill will be

1835
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:36.819 
remote work. How do you learn remote

1836
01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.480 
work skills and remote learning skills?

1837
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:40.632 
We just launched a course from Harvard

1838
01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.749 
Business School on,

1839
01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:43.989 
you know, on edX.

1840
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.930 
It's become wildly popular on

1841
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.697 
remote work and particularly with

1842
01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.613 
enterprises. How do you work remotely or

1843
01:01:50.614 --> 01:01:52.050 
how do you create remote cultures?

1844
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:53.769 
There's a revolution happening and you

1845
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:54.770 
can learn.

1846
01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.039 
Anyone wants to add something.

1847
01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.060 
Justin or Anthony?

1848
01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.709 
Yes, I would actually agree with

1849
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.119 
pretty much everything Anant just said

1850
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.889 
in terms of that need for it.

1851
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.239 
But if you look at those communities

1852
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.249 
specifically and I've talked with

1853
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.671 
a lot of CTOs and CIOs and so

1854
01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:13.350 
on, and what most

1855
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:16.519 
companies have historically focussed on

1856
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.840 
is clearly the tech skills.

1857
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.939 
But if you look at engineers and data

1858
01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.851 
scientists and all of these individuals

1859
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.049 
and their value is the companies,

1860
01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:25.399 
the value was translating there and

1861
01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.959 
their understanding of technology and

1862
01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.429 
data into business outcomes.

1863
01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.319 
And that can't happen if you can't

1864
01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.179 
translate your understanding technology

1865
01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:33.679 
to a business audience that's not

1866
01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.690 
grounded in that tech.

1867
01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:36.739 
And so it does need those communication

1868
01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:38.389 
skills. It needs those storytelling

1869
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.349 
capabilities.

1870
01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:40.729 
It needs, you need to have the emotional

1871
01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:42.249 
intelligence skills, diversity,

1872
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:43.699 
understanding how to work with

1873
01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.161 
cross-functional teams, how to work with

1874
01:02:45.267 --> 01:02:46.399 
remote teams, how to work with teams

1875
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.599 
that are embedding technology into the

1876
01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600 
way they operate.

1877
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:50.989 
And what we've seen is that individuals

1878
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:52.313 
who are out of work looking

1879
01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.443 
to get into work tend to be

1880
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:56.929 
focussed on the technical skills, the

1881
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:58.399 
skills that are the obvious skills you

1882
01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.839 
need to do to perhaps do a career

1883
01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.799 
change.

1884
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.739 
But individuals who are in work and

1885
01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:04.639 
company programmes have a much better

1886
01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.769 
blend of the hard skills and the soft

1887
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:07.759 
skills. And I tend to call them more

1888
01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.229 
human skills because I think soft skills

1889
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:10.489 
always has this connotation that some of

1890
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.319 
them are not as valuable as the

1891
01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:13.929 
more technical orientated skills.

1892
01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.289 
Actually, there's some of the most

1893
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:16.956 
important and critical skills that

1894
01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.360 
you can have.

1895
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:20.089 
And what tends to happen in the

1896
01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.707 
technical domains is if you don't

1897
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.919 
have those quality human skills

1898
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:26.809 
behind you and you start becoming

1899
01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:28.459 
into more positions of authority and

1900
01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:30.530 
leadership, many, many people

1901
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.149 
sort of fail in those roles because they

1902
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:33.469 
can no longer rely purely on the

1903
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:34.519 
technical expertise.

1904
01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.109 
Those human skills become more and more

1905
01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:37.482 
critical as they become part

1906
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:39.559 
of a cross-functional leadership team.

1907
01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:41.089 
And that's where many of these people

1908
01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:42.439 
end up failing because they haven't been

1909
01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.149 
supported by their organisations

1910
01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.157 
that I think has become much more

1911
01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:47.869 
aware in the marketplace.

1912
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.429 
And that's been a much bigger focus on

1913
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:50.606 
ensuring that programmes

1914
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:54.139 
that are delivering cross-functional

1915
01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.849 
skills development are holistic in

1916
01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:57.420 
nature. They're not single threaded.

1917
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:59.030 
It's not just about the tech skill or

1918
01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:00.619 
the data skill of a pure job-related

1919
01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:01.549 
skills.

1920
01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:03.169 
It's about a broad set of skills that

1921
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:04.309 
allow you to operate in a

1922
01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:06.319 
cross-functional, very integrated

1923
01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.986 
business that relies on technology

1924
01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.159 
and skills to power it.

1925
01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.739 
And that's becoming a much

1926
01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:15.229 
more common way of building programmes

1927
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:16.230 
as we go forward.

1928
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:20.249 
I think it's interesting that Mathias

1929
01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.619 
also used the word capability,

1930
01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.237 
and I think there's a distinction

1931
01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:26.099 
potentially from a skill to a

1932
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.569 
capability. A skill is something that

1933
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:29.429 
you learn to do and go do it.

1934
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:31.194 
You know, learning how to do a video

1935
01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:33.659 
conference on Zoom, for example, a

1936
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.579 
capability isn't really a specific skill

1937
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.197 
that fits into a given situation.

1938
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.210 
It's more of a sort of deep-rooted

1939
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.369 
ability that can be applied in many

1940
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:43.559 
contexts. And I think that's

1941
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.940 
the way that we think about sort of

1942
01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:46.709 
that, that the kind of the power skills,

1943
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:48.569 
the soft skills, more on capabilities in

1944
01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:49.769 
the sense there, what are the

1945
01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:52.199 
capabilities that we need for the 21st

1946
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.200 
century. And I think

1947
01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:55.435 
many of the kind of those

1948
01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.830 
that have been shared already are

1949
01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:00.360 
applicable. I mean, I would add their

1950
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.219 
design thinking, for example, their

1951
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.409 
digital fluency, a

1952
01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:06.449 
sense of of well-being, which

1953
01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:08.460 
I think is is significantly kind of

1954
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:10.610 
under looked having an awareness of risk

1955
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.440 
and mitigation,

1956
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.134 
others and leadership at all levels,

1957
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.819 
as well as something that we're really,

1958
01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:19.939 
really keen to kind of develop the

1959
01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:22.380 
future because it's applicable whatever

1960
01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:23.910 
stage you are in your career.

1961
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:28.389 
Thank you. Then there's another

1962
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.919 
question from the audience, from Matt.

1963
01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.660 
And Matt, if you want to un-mute

1964
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:35.730 
yourself?

1965
01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.039 
Yeah, sure. Can you hear me?

1966
01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:38.749 
Yes. Yes, we can.

1967
01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:40.110 
Very good.

1968
01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.039 
It was a question in response to

1969
01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.439 
announce an encouraging

1970
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.600 
statement I must say that

1971
01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:50.463 
we're going to first go see in bricks

1972
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:52.820 
and mortar universities are swing back

1973
01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.429 
to classical teaching approaches,

1974
01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:58.159 
but by 2025, possibly

1975
01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.039 
a move to a blended approach.

1976
01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.398 
And I was wondering if

1977
01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.129 
there are any opinions of what's going

1978
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.389 
to drive them, isn't going to be

1979
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.909 
student-driven demanding

1980
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:09.889 
this new methodology, or is it going to

1981
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:11.689 
be more faculty-driven

1982
01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.329 
because of the cost savings or

1983
01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:15.669 
practicalities of it?

1984
01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.929 
You know, I think, great question, Matt.

1985
01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.639 
I think there'll be multiple reasons,

1986
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:23.910 
not just one reason.

1987
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.380 
I'll tell you a quick little story.

1988
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.054 
Before COVID, most faculty

1989
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.039 
at most colleges and universities

1990
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.899 
that had zero experience with online

1991
01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.089 
learning, and when you have zero

1992
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.805 
experience with something, you tend

1993
01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.049 
to not like it because you never tried

1994
01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:42.250 
it. Heck, you know,

1995
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:46.749 
growing up as a child, you

1996
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:48.519 
know, I thought non-vegetarian food was

1997
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.779 
terrible because I've never eaten it.

1998
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.369 
But once I tried it, I said, wow, this

1999
01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:53.360 
is great. But I'm a lifelong carnivore.

2000
01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:55.840 
And so now I'm not trying to

2001
01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:57.439 
equate dietary habits

2002
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:00.129 
with online learning, but

2003
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:02.049 
the same thing happened in online

2004
01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:03.716 
learning where the whole world was

2005
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.110 
forced to learn online learning.

2006
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.590 
And as the story goes

2007
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.579 
at a faculty meeting and

2008
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.269 
a colleague said that

2009
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.719 
"my first lecture that I gave today,

2010
01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:17.219 
my first online lecture, was

2011
01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.836 
my most engaged

2012
01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:22.420 
lecture I've given the whole semester".

2013
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.229 
And so faculty are realising the

2014
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:26.879 
advantages of it, students are liking

2015
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.469 
it, and so I think the short answer to

2016
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:30.629 
your question is that surveys

2017
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.580 
are showing that more than two-thirds

2018
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:35.189 
of the students want more digital

2019
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:36.719 
and blended learning on their campus.

2020
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:39.989 
Two-thirds and more faculty are saying

2021
01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.179 
that they want to teach and offer more

2022
01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:43.109 
online learning.

2023
01:07:43.110 --> 01:07:44.972 
So I think when both the suppliers and

2024
01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.596 
the consumers are by the

2025
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.047 
two-thirds majority are demanding

2026
01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.510 
more of it in the future.

2027
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.215 
You know what's not to like about it.

2028
01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:55.540 
Thanks.

2029
01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.260 
Matt, are you happy with the answer?

2030
01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.199 
I am happy. Let's give it a few years

2031
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.849 
and we'll see what happens.

2032
01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.959 
Bob, you call the other audience, feel

2033
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.669 
free to still raise questions and

2034
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:10.670 
picking apart.

2035
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.550 
Let me maybe shift the perspective.

2036
01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:14.580 
All three of you are also having, like,

2037
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:16.722 
big tech companies.

2038
01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:18.290 
So how was

2039
01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.465 
COVID changing the company culture,

2040
01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.650 
the way course production took

2041
01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:25.279 
place?

2042
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:27.750 
And what of these things that changed

2043
01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:29.799 
talking about organisations who

2044
01:08:30.010 --> 01:08:31.359 
maybe go back or not?

2045
01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:34.359 
So how will this change the way

2046
01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.010 
your company being

2047
01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.169 
work in the future?

2048
01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:39.999 
And maybe Justin you can start.

2049
01:08:42.109 --> 01:08:44.350 
Yeah, I think managing

2050
01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:46.309 
I think it is what no one's going to, I

2051
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:47.478 
think, dispute the fact that sort of

2052
01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:49.219 
managing company culture

2053
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:51.219 
became harder.

2054
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:53.659 
And I think, you know, as a sort of

2055
01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:56.249 
an education company empowered, enabled

2056
01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:58.429 
by technology, fast-growing, you

2057
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:59.739 
know, that is key.

2058
01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:00.975 
I mean, many, many, many.

2059
01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:02.749 
I think we've reached an inflexion point

2060
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:04.220 
now where more than 50 percent

2061
01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:05.891 
of our employee base has

2062
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.810 
joined us since

2063
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.166 
the COVID. So we still haven't met

2064
01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.939 
many of our colleagues face to face.

2065
01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:16.350 
So I think that's sort of I

2066
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.619 
kind of a point that we all sort of, I'm

2067
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.620 
sure, very aware of.

2068
01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:21.390 
I think ultimately as leaders, you know,

2069
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:23.179 
we've got to completely rethink about

2070
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.459 
our strategy of distributed

2071
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.319 
teams together in different

2072
01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.959 
ways, team building

2073
01:09:30.439 --> 01:09:32.350 
that quality, quality kind of connexion

2074
01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.119 
that you get from

2075
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.549 
the corridor collisions and

2076
01:09:38.210 --> 01:09:39.709 
that it's certainly kind of that the

2077
01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:41.749 
more younger or

2078
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:42.779 
more of newer members

2079
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:45.889 
of the team, they really relish

2080
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:47.929 
that thought, that face time. So, I

2081
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:49.449 
think is it's been a real, real

2082
01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:51.919 
challenge, I think ultimately, you know,

2083
01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:53.498 
we from a practical perspective,

2084
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.193 
you know, we've like everybody,

2085
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:58.279 
we have to rapidly rethink the way

2086
01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.335 
that we were undertaking kind of course

2087
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:01.586 
production of our studio

2088
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:03.525 
and production teams

2089
01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:06.432 
were incredible. And we talked earlier

2090
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:08.899 
about the speed, in fact, the speed

2091
01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:10.669 
with which we're able to kind of bring

2092
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:12.319 
causes onto the platform now, as you

2093
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.029 
know, is exponentially faster than it

2094
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:15.030 
was pre-COVID.

2095
01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.359 
So that was a huge challenge

2096
01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.360 
for them to overcome.

2097
01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:20.869 
They innovated during a

2098
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:22.779 
time of real crisis.

2099
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:24.829 
So I'm very, very proud

2100
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:26.419 
of the team in terms of thinking

2101
01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.189 
differently, innovating

2102
01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.559 
not just the how, but also the what in

2103
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.750 
terms of capturing content

2104
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:34.729 
from educators from all over the world

2105
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.500 
and coming up with new ways of doing so.

2106
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.215 
So, yeah, they would be my kind of two

2107
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.419 
main points, the cultural side and then

2108
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.135 
the kind of practical kind of rapid

2109
01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.319 
sort of innovation on the physical kind

2110
01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.390 
of distributed remote sort of

2111
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:49.909 
production side of getting content

2112
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:51.170 
onto the platform.

2113
01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:55.310 
Anthony, do you want to share?

2114
01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.139 
Yeah, I think from our perspective,

2115
01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.300 
you know, we were quite an office-based

2116
01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.539 
company prior to the pandemic and

2117
01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.669 
I think large pockets of the company and

2118
01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:07.300 
me included, really kind of felt that

2119
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.089 
that was the right way to foster high

2120
01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:10.462 
growth, high energy, lots of

2121
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:11.559 
collaboration and so on.

2122
01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.689 
And of course, we had to switch like

2123
01:11:12.690 --> 01:11:14.550 
everybody else to a remote-based company,

2124
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.279 
and we very much embrace that.

2125
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:17.729 
So we're not going to change that when

2126
01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:19.229 
we go back. We're very much adopt to

2127
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:20.520 
those principles of being a remote-first

2128
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.560 
company. Employees who work for

2129
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:24.539 
Coursera can be remote if they wish to

2130
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:25.540 
do so on a permanent

2131
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.760 
basis.

2132
01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.250 
And we see us of re-envisaging

2133
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.859 
of one office space is going to be for

2134
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.029 
us in the sense it's not going to be a

2135
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:34.990 
place you come to, to just sit at a desk

2136
01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.959 
and do your work is very much going to

2137
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.871 
be an innovation and collaboration hub.

2138
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:40.709 
It's a place to foster team building,

2139
01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:41.710 
social connections,

2140
01:11:42.810 --> 01:11:45.209 
working together and projects and

2141
01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.886 
embracing, try to embrace both, try to

2142
01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:49.379 
embrace the flexibility that online

2143
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.299 
gives you the ability to move really at

2144
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.560 
speed and collaborate

2145
01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:55.409 
across virtual teams and regions in the

2146
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:56.410 
more effective way.

2147
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:58.919 
But recognise that people still have a

2148
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.488 
need to connect with people at a

2149
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.529 
physical level and to meet in person and

2150
01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:03.979 
to talk and things can happen.

2151
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.029 
Those contacts are much, much easier to

2152
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.999 
manage in a physical setting.

2153
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.009 
And of course, people need

2154
01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.140 
probably from a well-being perspective.

2155
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.669 
So that's been a big shift for

2156
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:16.070 
us, I think, as an organisation.

2157
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.819 
The other thing, of course, we're seeing

2158
01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.199 
is that just the very nature of the

2159
01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.510 
growth as simply as Justin said,

2160
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:23.819 
probably half plus the workforce has

2161
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.040 
joined since we were virtual.

2162
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:28.799 
We've had huge investments made in

2163
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.711 
our capacity to support the huge growth

2164
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.740 
of our learners, we've changed

2165
01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.449 
technology, we changed approaches.

2166
01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:35.189 
Lots of things have been optimised to

2167
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:37.109 
work in a more virtual, faster moving

2168
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:38.110 
world and so on.

2169
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.510 
So we've built a whole raft of different

2170
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.899 
internal processes of how to

2171
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.729 
work in this environment

2172
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:47.399 
in a way that still tries to embrace our

2173
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.199 
culture and our values and retain what

2174
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.999 
we think is great about our business and

2175
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:51.989 
our culture.

2176
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:53.819 
But recognising that we have to adapt

2177
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:56.219 
and moving into a world where

2178
01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.140 
we can take the best of both elements.

2179
01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.704 
Now, I think, you know, I don't have

2180
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:03.950 
much to add.

2181
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:05.270 
I totally agree.

2182
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.566 
You know, as others, edX move to a

2183
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:09.189 
completely remote culture

2184
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:12.119 
of it with which work

2185
01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:14.199 
to be turned on a dime in early

2186
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.200 
March, but

2187
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:17.619 
it's important to note that even before

2188
01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:19.569 
that, we had quite a few

2189
01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.930 
off-site locations.

2190
01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:23.199 
We have a pretty big office in

2191
01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200 
Barcelona.

2192
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:25.250 
We have people in

2193
01:13:25.251 --> 01:13:26.826 
the UK, people in India. And so there's a fair bit of remote work happening

2194
01:13:26.827 --> 01:13:28.507 
already. And then we found that last year, even during the pandemic, despite the

2195
01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:39.459 
huge growth in enrolment and the big demand,

2196
01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.969 
we've been able to meet the demand.

2197
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:42.999 
And we worked very efficiently in

2198
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.189 
a remote only model.

2199
01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.029 
And so even at edX,

2200
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.129 
our direction is very much

2201
01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:52.990 
a hybrid approach where

2202
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.699 
there will be an office and you can come

2203
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.779 
into work if you choose to.

2204
01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.329 
But, you know, you could spend

2205
01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:00.495 
a substantial fraction of your time

2206
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.919 
being fully remote and working remotely.

2207
01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.589 
But, you know, at the end of the day, I

2208
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:07.629 
think employees

2209
01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:09.729 
are going to make the call, which is if

2210
01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:11.151 
you are a company that forces

2211
01:14:11.770 --> 01:14:14.229 
people to come into work on a routine

2212
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.729 
regular basis, you would not be able to

2213
01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:16.629 
hire too many people.

2214
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:17.920 
I think the world has changed.

2215
01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.010 
I think workers and employees

2216
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:22.510 
also like working remotely.

2217
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.189 
I don't have to commute in.

2218
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.053 
Previously, I used to spend two hours

2219
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:28.855 
a day driving

2220
01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.119 
30 miles from Weston to Cambridge

2221
01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.049 
in the US, and so now I'm getting

2222
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:37.549 
those two extra hours, I can use that

2223
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.180 
for whatever I want. I can do more work,

2224
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.445 
I can do more Zoom calls.

2225
01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:42.739 
I can go for a walk, do some gardening.

2226
01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.089 
I can hang out, I can eat, I could

2227
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:45.090 
sleep, but who knows?

2228
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:48.020 
So my sense of the world has changed.

2229
01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.119 
And if employers

2230
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:52.669 
don't meet employees and people

2231
01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:54.619 
where they are, I think

2232
01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.815 
that you will be left with not many

2233
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:57.870 
employees either.

2234
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.400 
Right, agree.

2235
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.853 
And we look back at COVID and we look

2236
01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:06.220 
at you mentioned your courses for

2237
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:08.209 
the health industry

2238
01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.939 
and we see, if you look at the research

2239
01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:14.609 
part, that we had a massive

2240
01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:15.699 
increase of the speed

2241
01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.210 
that research takes place.

2242
01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.749 
We had a vaccination

2243
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.122 
within that, I don't know, a

2244
01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.339 
few months with some technology

2245
01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.922 
that was there for

2246
01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.300 
a few years now.

2247
01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.759 
How was your working with the

2248
01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.039 
research world in

2249
01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.132 
this COVID era?

2250
01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.840 
Did you also fell that it

2251
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:40.680 
was more faster because

2252
01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:43.199 
you could visit more

2253
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.689 
virtual conferences or

2254
01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.640 
do you also miss the

2255
01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:50.069 
sitting on a conference table and having

2256
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:52.020 
some good ideas over a glass of wine?

2257
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:55.529 
Who wants to take it?

2258
01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.239 
Maybe I can take a first crack at that.

2259
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.539 
When we founded the edX in 2012,

2260
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.279 
it was founded on three pillars, three

2261
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.139 
major missions - increase access to

2262
01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.140 
learning.

2263
01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:07.886 
Second was to improve education in

2264
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.020 
quality.

2265
01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.359 
And third was research.

2266
01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:13.239 
From our founding days, our view was

2267
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.770 
to build an open-source platform.

2268
01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.456 
And in my open speech, I

2269
01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.579 
called it "the Linux for Learning".

2270
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:21.870 
I talked about how this would serve as a

2271
01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.870 
particle accelerator for learning,

2272
01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:25.569 
and we've abided by that stance.

2273
01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.770 
Our platform supports generically

2274
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:30.139 
so many features for research, things

2275
01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:31.520 
like A/B testing and so on.

2276
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:33.529 
And we also routinely make research data

2277
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:35.149 
available to all our member

2278
01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:36.150 
universities.

2279
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:37.909 
And what we've discovered is that for

2280
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:40.129 
the past four or five

2281
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:41.729 
years, as

2282
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.258 
one of the researchers

2283
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:46.760 
did a study, over half the papers

2284
01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.232 
at many of these MOOC conferences

2285
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:50.748 
were using edX data.

2286
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:52.520 
And so now, with the increased

2287
01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.859 
access to data, we are seeing even

2288
01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.479 
greater increase in

2289
01:16:57.230 --> 01:16:58.660 
usage of data and research.

2290
01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:00.619 
So we continue to support research and

2291
01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:03.289 
view ourselves as a platform, a particle

2292
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:04.313 
accelerator for learning.

2293
01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.550 
Now to the concept of conferences.

2294
01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.989 
Should you be at a conference?

2295
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:11.322 
I think it's a trade-off, on

2296
01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.819 
the one hand, if it's remote, you can

2297
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.229 
attend more conferences, you can give

2298
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.945 
more talks and listen to more talks

2299
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:18.649 
and so on.

2300
01:17:18.930 --> 01:17:21.259 
But I think what I miss is that I miss

2301
01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:23.539 
the evening or

2302
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.829 
other parts of conference where you sit

2303
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:26.539 
down on a cup of coffee at a cafe

2304
01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:29.569 
and have a beer or a coffee

2305
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.280 
in Europe or whatever.

2306
01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.169 
I really, really miss that missing

2307
01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:34.399 
meeting, meeting colleagues.

2308
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.977 
And to me, I don't think we found

2309
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:39.290 
a good way to create that social

2310
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:42.530 
connection over a cup of coffee or beer,

2311
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:44.100 
depending where you are.

2312
01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.230 
Anyone wants to add

2313
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.240 
something.

2314
01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.400 
I mean, I completely agree with Anant on

2315
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:56.296 
the coffee points, and I think you

2316
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:58.649 
only realise how much you missed it when

2317
01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:00.729 
you start to experience it again.

2318
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:02.579 
And I think as we

2319
01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.917 
hopefully continue to unlock here

2320
01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.619 
in the United Kingdom, you know, I

2321
01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:08.840 
look forward to those moments.

2322
01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:09.989 
I look forward to having a coffee with

2323
01:18:10.050 --> 01:18:10.919 
Anant soon.

2324
01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.989 
I think in terms of specifics,

2325
01:18:12.990 --> 01:18:15.020 
in terms of research, sort

2326
01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.979 
of I think there are two things that

2327
01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.980 
we've sort of seen.

2328
01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:19.797 
One has been obviously the growth

2329
01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:22.000 
of the platform that the rise in

2330
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:24.599 
the kind of usage of online platforms

2331
01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.949 
means now that research

2332
01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:29.250 
is reaching an even broader, wider

2333
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:31.469 
demographic. And that's fantastic in

2334
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:33.609 
terms of our academic partners.

2335
01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.299 
I think the other flip side to that is

2336
01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.339 
also that what we've seen is a huge

2337
01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.410 
growth in the kind of

2338
01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.029 
the commentary

2339
01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.375 
and the kind of collective learning

2340
01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.229 
that's going on in these courses.

2341
01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:47.798 
You know, if you think about our

2342
01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.241 
teaching portfolio, we had 30

2343
01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:52.155 
million comments on our teaching

2344
01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:54.130 
course is over COVID.

2345
01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:56.729 
And many of our academics, many of our

2346
01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:59.189 
faculties are relishing this opportunity

2347
01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:00.856 
to be able to engage with a broad,

2348
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.540 
wide, diverse learner

2349
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:05.489 
base to bring that sort of

2350
01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:07.680 
back into their study.

2351
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:09.389 
And so, in a sense, that sort of

2352
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:10.829 
research thing is a little bit of a

2353
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.660 
flywheel in a sense in terms of

2354
01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.939 
now kind of academics genuinely

2355
01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.069 
recognising that sort of this

2356
01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:19.109 
is a brilliant way of it being

2357
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:21.270 
kind of part of their study.

2358
01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.239 
You know you know, a quick little

2359
01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.318 
anecdote, you know, as

2360
01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:29.310 
I talk to my good

2361
01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.239 
colleagues from the FutureLearn and

2362
01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.129 
Coursera, and I'm good friends with

2363
01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:35.199 
Simon Nelson and good friends with Jeff,

2364
01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.599 
with Simon, for example, I think we

2365
01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.600 
became good friends.

2366
01:19:39.130 --> 01:19:40.719 
We went to a conference and I think it

2367
01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.500 
may have been the open

2368
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:44.010 
edX conference or maybe eMOOCs.

2369
01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.440 
And

2370
01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.000 
then we happened to run into a bar and

2371
01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:50.919 
we hung out and we talked for like four

2372
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.720 
hours and just chatted and

2373
01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:55.390 
became good friends, you know, and then

2374
01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.390 
just, you know, I ran into him and you

2375
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:59.459 
wouldn't believe it in Moscow and know

2376
01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:01.119 
I think you need to meet people in

2377
01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.120 
person at least once.

2378
01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.539 
And once you do that, you can

2379
01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.220 
become friends and you like each other

2380
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.719 
and then you can meet each other

2381
01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.679 
virtually after that.

2382
01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.299 
But I think you need to have one face to

2383
01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.979 
face meeting. I don't know what it is,

2384
01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.989 
but, you know, it's maybe it's

2385
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:15.430 
in the water, maybe to the beauty.

2386
01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:16.730 
I don't know.

2387
01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:20.281 
Yeah, I would agree with a lot of that.

2388
01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.090 
I think I think what was

2389
01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.460 
interesting about the pandemic and the

2390
01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:26.963 
so much changed force at one point in

2391
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:29.030 
time is that you had huge communities of

2392
01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.757 
people that were suddenly open to

2393
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:32.199 
engaging to figure out how to address

2394
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.200 
this collectively.

2395
01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.319 
And so when we

2396
01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.629 
did the Coronavirus Response Initiative

2397
01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.189 
for Education, we engage with 4000

2398
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:40.749 
institutions, which could never happen

2399
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:41.979 
in any of the circumstances.

2400
01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:43.419 
We engage with like 100 different

2401
01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:44.547 
government departments.

2402
01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.329 
We run a programme for our businesses,

2403
01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.129 
every single group of stakeholders we

2404
01:20:48.130 --> 01:20:48.999 
integrated with.

2405
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.666 
We had some kind of programme that

2406
01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.543 
brought in a huge number of

2407
01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.489 
stakeholders, an incredible amount of

2408
01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:57.029 
data in volumes and capacities

2409
01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.569 
that you would never seen before and

2410
01:20:58.570 --> 01:20:59.769 
often through new dimensions and

2411
01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:00.759 
bringing new insights.

2412
01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.130 
And that was that was really powerful.

2413
01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.799 
The flip side of that, of course, is you

2414
01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.209 
don't have the opportunity to directly

2415
01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:09.079 
interact with people in a kind of ad-hoc

2416
01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:10.899 
way, as you say, over coffees, dinners,

2417
01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.519 
et cetera. You know, you think about the

2418
01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.629 
audience. Listen to this.

2419
01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:15.850 
If we are at a conference and this

2420
01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.679 
was the next thing was a coffee break,

2421
01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.699 
you know, people would walk up to

2422
01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.106 
panellist's and say, "Hey!

2423
01:21:20.107 --> 01:21:21.180 
I like that comment", you make a chat

2424
01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:23.101 
about this, you can't really do that in

2425
01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.549 
the virtual world. It's very hard to

2426
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:26.439 
facilitate. And so you miss all of that

2427
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:28.692 
inspired conversation, the ad-hoc, the

2428
01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:30.259 
thinking that happens after an event

2429
01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.389 
where you want to follow up with somebody

2430
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:32.949 
in person, connect with them, make

2431
01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:34.460 
new connections.

2432
01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.339 
None of that stuff happens really in the

2433
01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:38.229 
virtual world unless you try and force

2434
01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:40.141 
it to go. And that's very, very hard to

2435
01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.529 
do. So there's

2436
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:43.779 
some great pluses.

2437
01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:45.039 
There's definitely been some negatives.

2438
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.079 
I for one, cannot wait to be going out

2439
01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.260 
and meeting people again and joining

2440
01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.779 
some conferences and face to face and

2441
01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.979 
networking with some colleagues and

2442
01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.449 
peers and competitors and so on.

2443
01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.910 
I think it's a great way to

2444
01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.049 
connect and learn.

2445
01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:58.149 
And, you know, there's only so

2446
01:21:58.150 --> 01:21:59.679 
long you can do 12 hours of back to back

2447
01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.419 
Zoom calls every day for a year or so.

2448
01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:03.159 
It has a little bit of a wearing effect.

2449
01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:05.439 
I do agree.

2450
01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.320 
And I think there are funny similarities

2451
01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:10.779 
here in between like the world of

2452
01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.069 
conferences and the world of online

2453
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:13.869 
learning where we want to probably take

2454
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:15.839 
the best both of all worlds.

2455
01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.506 
So maybe I want to attend like ten

2456
01:22:17.770 --> 01:22:18.789 
conferences in a month.

2457
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:21.129 
But the two, when I go in person,

2458
01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:23.319 
because I know they have the best coffee

2459
01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:25.498 
because it's in Italy or whatever.

2460
01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:28.269 
The reason to go to the conference is

2461
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:29.359 
all about the coffees, nothing.

2462
01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:30.650 
The speakers or the thoroughness.

2463
01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:32.029 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

2464
01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:33.060 
whoa. Don't forget the beer.

2465
01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:39.640 
Let me go back to

2466
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:41.979 
we talked about the new skills that

2467
01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.109 
we are going to need in the future

2468
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:45.220 
for this new normal.

2469
01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.109 
Do we also need new forms of assessment

2470
01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:52.510 
or new forms of like

2471
01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.120 
course formats to be able to

2472
01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:57.370 
train those skills?

2473
01:22:57.730 --> 01:22:58.730 
What do you feel?

2474
01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.879 
What's on your on your secret backlog?

2475
01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:03.819 
Well, let me jump in quickly on that

2476
01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:04.899 
one. I think there are two things.

2477
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:05.929 
I think one is that I

2478
01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:09.009 
think people are interested in assessing

2479
01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:10.629 
their skills. People don't always know

2480
01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:12.099 
what level of skills they are compared

2481
01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.011 
to, say, their peers or the rest of the

2482
01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.460 
world and how that might correlate.

2483
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:16.914 
Companies also don't necessarily know

2484
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:18.489 
what skill sets people coming up with.

2485
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:20.229 
And I think companies are also looking

2486
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:21.847 
to be able to bring people in, if

2487
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:23.229 
nothing else, to address issues of

2488
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:25.539 
diversity and equity around the world,

2489
01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:27.378 
to not just default to a degree,

2490
01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:30.039 
as that is the defining

2491
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.419 
quality of what a new new hire should

2492
01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:33.282 
be. But to look at what are the skills

2493
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:34.640 
they bring in from their life experiences.

2494
01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:36.571 
So I think the assessment is absolutely

2495
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.050 
part of the agenda, whether

2496
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:40.329 
that has to be done by a content provider

2497
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.399 
simply to assess or they have to be

2498
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.599 
brought together or not, those are just

2499
01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.600 
business decisions.

2500
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:47.739 
But I think it's definitely a core part

2501
01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.689 
of it. I think the other thing that we

2502
01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:51.069 
are certainly very focussed on with

2503
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:53.319 
Coursera is that there's no single

2504
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.879 
modality that will work for all forms of

2505
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.069 
learning and video-based learning

2506
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.689 
with some assessments and some reading

2507
01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:00.579 
materials is great for lots and lots of

2508
01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.379 
audience is not the only way to engage.

2509
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.819 
And in many forms of learning, you

2510
01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.889 
actually need much more hands-on apply

2511
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:06.909 
forms of learning where you actually

2512
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:08.289 
want to directly interact with

2513
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:09.729 
technology. You want to get your hands

2514
01:24:09.730 --> 01:24:11.310 
into coding when the practise stuff.

2515
01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:12.837 
So having opportunities

2516
01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.369 
for learners to engage in a real-world

2517
01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:16.749 
safe scenario like off-production

2518
01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:19.029 
systems, we want to work with real-world

2519
01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.262 
technology and actually apply the

2520
01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:22.569 
learning that they may have learnt

2521
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:23.509 
through a MOOC.

2522
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:25.399 
I think bringing that together with an

2523
01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.289 
on the job training and coaching is what

2524
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:29.119 
really rounds it off as a way to

2525
01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.710 
actually develop those skills.

2526
01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.372 
You know, what's interesting Jan

2527
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:36.829 
is that, you know, we always talk

2528
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:39.079 
about introducing online learning into

2529
01:24:39.710 --> 01:24:41.779 
universities, and that's what

2530
01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.729 
I think we need to think about the

2531
01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:44.840 
opposite as well, which is

2532
01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:47.329 
how do you how do we bring an in-person

2533
01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:49.339 
interaction or in-person work

2534
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:50.696 
into a MOOC?

2535
01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.640 
And I'll give you one example.

2536
01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.149 
We launched a course on tiny machine

2537
01:24:56.150 --> 01:24:57.740 
learning, one of the hottest subjects,

2538
01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:01.609 
tech skills going on today, a tiny

2539
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:02.610 
machine learning from Harvard.

2540
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:04.970 
And what they did there was

2541
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:07.459 
it's got MOOC stuff, of course, but they

2542
01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:09.589 
also partnered with

2543
01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.199 
a good company

2544
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.510 
and they come out with a little kit.

2545
01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:16.939 
It's a little kit.

2546
01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.860 
And they're supplied that kit

2547
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:20.479 
so people can get that.

2548
01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:21.799 
It's a little piece of hardware.

2549
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.509 
And so people can go and play around

2550
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:25.569 
with sensors. And a kid can use tiny

2551
01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.799 
machine learning at home in a little kit

2552
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:29.910 
tomorrow. And so there are ways in which

2553
01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.626 
we can bring in the maker learning

2554
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:34.279 
and in-person learning and teamwork

2555
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:36.079 
into MOOCs as well.

2556
01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:38.569 
We also launched the teams in edX where

2557
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:40.849 
you can where we have a future,

2558
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:43.129 
where the instructor can create

2559
01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:44.929 
randomised teams or let the students

2560
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:46.558 
select or otherwise create small

2561
01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.530 
groups of people that can work

2562
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:50.306 
together and collaborate

2563
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:53.030 
and create social spaces together

2564
01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:55.909 
within the MOOC. So I think we're seeing

2565
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:57.649 
more and more of

2566
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:59.779 
these, what you might call in-person

2567
01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.152 
kind of activities happening

2568
01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.110 
within the MOOCs as well. So maybe MOOCs

2569
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:04.350 
are going blended too.

2570
01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.729 
Imagine a blended MOOC.

2571
01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.129 
Maybe we should call it a book.

2572
01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:11.800 
I completely agree with both of these

2573
01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.659 
excellent sort of insights there.

2574
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:15.970 
I'd just add, I think, you know, from

2575
01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:18.088 
a building on sort of Anant's last

2576
01:26:18.130 --> 01:26:19.929 
point, we're big, big believers in the

2577
01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.399 
sort of the peer assessment side of

2578
01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.360 
things. But also, I think going forward,

2579
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:25.509 
we're very interested in

2580
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:27.279 
the capstone. I think the capstone is a

2581
01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.409 
great form of sort of assessment.

2582
01:26:29.410 --> 01:26:31.569 
And because it enables us to be

2583
01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.010 
multifaceted and it can

2584
01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:35.659 
deal with many of the

2585
01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.349 
challenges and even sort of outlining in

2586
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:40.359 
terms of being that being not based

2587
01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.770 
around more kind of

2588
01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:45.129 
tech or highly, highly of

2589
01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:47.931 
specific but specialised sort

2590
01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.289 
of skills. So I think we're going to see

2591
01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:51.970 
a lot more sort of capstone kind of

2592
01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:53.740 
style sort of assessments as part of

2593
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:55.829 
our products going forward.

2594
01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.939 
Great. So if I look at the

2595
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:02.899 
clock, we're reaching the end of the

2596
01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.189 
panel time already.

2597
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.159 
Maybe I will give you the chance for

2598
01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.810 
closing word.

2599
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:11.989 
And maybe this could

2600
01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:14.419 
also include if you go back

2601
01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.831 
pre-pandemic, what would be your advice

2602
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:18.270 
to yourself

2603
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:21.409 
or what do you take

2604
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:24.427 
from this session and Justin if

2605
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:25.550 
want to start?

2606
01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.369 
I think I think the thing that sort of

2607
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:29.546 
I'm reminded of is, just

2608
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:33.199 
still after what has been an incredibly

2609
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.523 
challenging and accelerated

2610
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:36.735 
sort of period of time in

2611
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:39.319 
the world of education and online

2612
01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.594 
learning, is we still very

2613
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:43.252 
much at the beginning in terms of even

2614
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:45.169 
with the impressive size of

2615
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:47.600 
the fish joining me today,

2616
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.449 
we're talking billions

2617
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.579 
and billions of learners out there

2618
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.619 
in the world that we want to work with.

2619
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:56.929 
So I think that's what kind of gets me

2620
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:58.596 
out of bed in the morning in terms

2621
01:27:58.970 --> 01:28:00.350 
of kind of I think the kind of

2622
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:03.289 
if I knew now what I knew then, I'd say,

2623
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:05.359 
hang on to your seat belt, Justin.

2624
01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:07.729 
You're going to get through this would

2625
01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:09.494 
probably be the advice, certain sort

2626
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:10.879 
of moments.

2627
01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.619 
It wasn't quite as clear as that.

2628
01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.580 
And I didn't always see the light at the

2629
01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:15.660 
end of the tunnel.

2630
01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.660 
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2631
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:19.770 
Anthony?

2632
01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:21.850 
I would simply say

2633
01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.409 
that it's been

2634
01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.155 
a privilege to be part of a company

2635
01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.909 
that could thrive in the pandemic, but

2636
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:31.870 
also have such kind of positive societal

2637
01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:33.752 
good impact through the lens of online

2638
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:35.339 
learning and be able to impact people's

2639
01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:36.649 
lives in such a positive way.

2640
01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:38.230 
And there's so much

2641
01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.800 
negative talk about the pandemic.

2642
01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.109 
I think it would have been great

2643
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:44.579 
pre-pandemic if we could have been a

2644
01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.229 
little bit all set up to be focussing on

2645
01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:47.930 
some of the positives of the change that

2646
01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.890 
is inspired and this driven and

2647
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:51.539 
actually bringing together so many

2648
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.353 
different stakeholders in educational

2649
01:28:54.090 --> 01:28:55.979 
programmes which have a true

2650
01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.303 
transformative power for the

2651
01:28:58.050 --> 01:28:59.618 
world. I think that's an amazing

2652
01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.399 
place to be. And I would just

2653
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.750 
told myself that it was

2654
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:06.294 
something to appreciate while you're

2655
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:07.770 
going through the more difficult times.

2656
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:09.940 
Thank you so much.

2657
01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:11.890 
Anant, your last words.

2658
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.053 
You know, I got to pick up on a quick

2659
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:15.870 
comment from Justin, which is that

2660
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:18.180 
you look at the world has,

2661
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:20.990 
you know, billions of people and here we

2662
01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:22.289 
are addressing

2663
01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.750 
tens of millions of people.

2664
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.519 
You know, if you look at edX, if you

2665
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.925 
combine the learners on

2666
01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:30.104 
edX plus Open edX,

2667
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:32.583 
we are at about 100 million

2668
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:35.243 
learners around the world and that is

2669
01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:36.490 
still

2670
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:39.269 
just a little over one percent of the

2671
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:40.270 
world's

2672
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:42.610 
population.

2673
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:45.779 
So, therefore, we may think we are big

2674
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.799 
fish in a little pond.

2675
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.853 
But I promise you, we are little fish

2676
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.239 
in the world and a lot more to do.

2677
01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:54.120 
So my message pre-pandemic

2678
01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:57.033 
would simply be that online

2679
01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:59.140 
learning, as well as remote work,

2680
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:02.274 
is going to be here to stay, and the

2681
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:04.500 
sooner we can get ourselves used to it,

2682
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.580 
the better. It's a good thing.

2683
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.400 
So we should prepare the world for

2684
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.409 
mining, both online and in-person,

2685
01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:12.390 
whether at work or in learning,

2686
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:14.729 
and the blended model of work and

2687
01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:15.779 
learning to be the future.

2688
01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.139 
Thank you. I think what I've seen today

2689
01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:21.051 
is not three big fish in the same tank,

2690
01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.060 
I think it's an ocean of possibilities.

2691
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:25.109 
And I see three fishes clearly

2692
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:26.188 
heading a division and

2693
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.279 
the new normal. So I'm thrilled to see

2694
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.142 
what the next year will bring and also

2695
01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.239 
what your three platforms will bring to,

2696
01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:35.849 
like, foster this change.

2697
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.301 
Thank you so much for joining

2698
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:39.070 
this panel.

2699
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:40.909 
Stay safe and talk to you soon,

2700
01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.689 
maybe in person next year.

2701
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:44.430 
Thank you all. Thank you.

2702
01:30:44.490 --> 01:30:45.369 
Thank you. Thank you.

2703
01:30:45.370 --> 01:30:45.739 
Bye bye.

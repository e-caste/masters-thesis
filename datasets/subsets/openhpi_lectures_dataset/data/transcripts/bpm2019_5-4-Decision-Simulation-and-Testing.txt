00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.160 
Yeah welcome to video-clip
five point four in which in

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.550 
which I want to show you a
simulation of our decision model.

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.000 
We have created our decision
model in the previous video and

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.880 
now we want it simulated. Therefore
you need just to click on

5
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.800 
the or select the model in
the process explorer.

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.250 
Click on edit and here you have the possibility
to simulate the decision diagram.

7
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.190 
The other way would be if you are
already in the diagram it is

8
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.730 
the explorer yeah and
the editor sorry

9
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.280 
you can simply switch to simulation
in the upper right corner.

10
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.000 
And now we are in the
decision simulation

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.230 
and as we can see here already
is our decision model behind

12
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.360 
so we can scroll
through the

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.160 
model. But more importantly we can
already see the inputs we have defined

14
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.520 
as data inputs in our decision model.
So in sum we have eight inputs

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.380 
and all the eight
inputs lead to

16
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.450 
to the data fields and it depends
on the data type itself

17
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450 
what kind of value we
need to provide.

18
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.090 
So the age for example
is a number value.

19
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.500 
And we've said that if
someone is under eighteen

20
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.220 
that leads directly to the result
somewhere that the person

21
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.600 
is not eligible for insurance. So
we have here the input section

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.550 
and on the right side we can we
have the output section and the

23
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.920 
output section delivers already the final
output because it's okay criteria

24
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.730 
that someone is
not eligible.

25
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.500 
When we scroll up in the decision
model we can also see the

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.180 
progress bar. The
progress bar

27
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.750 
shows or indicates if
the decision could

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.580 
could have been made completely or
still further input is needed.

29
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.730 
And actually of course
in the sub decisions

30
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.110 
they are still further input
needed to make the decision but

31
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.180 
since we have said that the age
itself is in KO criteria we

32
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.650 
have already the final result from the
sub decision umm top level decision

33
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.810 
which yeah which is indicated
by the green progress bar.

34
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.990 
But let's play around with the
more realistic scenario that's

35
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.300 
for example someone
comes in who is

36
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.000 
and thirty and then of course
everything is still possible.

37
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.820 
This is what we can see here it
shows all three possible results.

38
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.950 
We need to define for that will
provide for the input. So

39
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.020 
on the one hand we could say
that the airbag equipment is

40
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.820 
I don't know the car has maybe
only a drivers airbag,

41
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.140 
still everything
possible.

42
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.230 
The car's value
is maybe

43
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.750 
need to buy the number
here three thousand

44
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.180 
dollar, the person has
not been convicted

45
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.030 
of a DUI,

46
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.100 
the car is not on the list
of yeah high probability

47
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.000 
list but imagine the person was
involved in the past in one accident.

48
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.170 
Ok still everything
is possible.

49
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.080 
In two violations.

50
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.140 
Ok that's that enough we can
already say that the person

51
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.520 
has reached a
certain score.

52
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.280 
Let's provide the last
input here is not

53
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.520 
um yeah i started driving in a
driver training at leads to

54
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.380 
a certain score of eighteen for
example and we've defined the

55
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.430 
decision model that a score of eighteen umm
eighty leads to the final decision that

56
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.190 
someone's eligible
for insurance.

57
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.790 
And now it's gonna be interesting
if we change some values

58
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.120 
we can say now imagine that the
person with the car has a full

59
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.200 
airbag front and side
airbag is for example

60
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.280 
twenty thousand
dollar car.

61
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.180 
no accidents of worth so far but
unfortunately the person was convicted

62
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.670 
convicted of a DUI.

63
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.030 
That leads to the case that
the manager needs to review

64
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.220 
the case in order to decide if we
want to insure the person or not.

65
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.350 
The simulation has some
more features. It's not

66
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.640 
only able to show the set of inputs
and map to the to the output.

67
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.530 
When we scroll down
a bit we can even

68
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.290 
trace which
rule applies

69
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.100 
in which decision. So we've
said that for example

70
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.000 
the person has reached a score
between one hundred hundred fifty

71
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.180 
that leads to the final results
the review is necessary. But how

72
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.990 
how we come to that
score for example.

73
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.990 
Therefore we need to
scroll down a bit

74
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.750 
and we've said that
someone is eligible

75
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.910 
gets zero points but leads the
status uninsurable of hundred.

76
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.890 
So um yeah we have an interesting
situation here. The automobile

77
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.290 
is totally fine but the
driver because of the

78
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.950 
conviction leads to the status
uninsurable therefore needs

79
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.170 
to be decided by the manager if we
want to insure the person or not.

80
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.420 
We can even go down a bit more to
see why the car is eligible.

81
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.790 
And we just yeah we just have
the situation here that

82
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.440 
the risk or the
insurance potential

83
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.790 
is actually not extremely
high and also not not high

84
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.660 
therefore for all other cases which
doesn't meet this top three

85
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.780 
business rules therefore though
they they automatically

86
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.010 
eligible. This is what the first hit
policy the first hit policy indicates

87
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.220 
and so on. So we can scroll through
every single decision to see

88
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.170 
which rule is applied
to the case.

89
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.110 
And if you do not want to simulate
the entire decision diagram

90
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.320 
you can even click on

91
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.650 
for example a particular sub
decision and then we are only

92
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.520 
able to see the inputs which are
really needed to make this

93
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.350 
decision. So let's say here to
determine the driving record category

94
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.970 
we only need
three inputs.

95
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.870 
The record category right now with
the existing inputs is high risk

96
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.770 
but we can see when we
delete the existing ones

97
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.380 
that it can end in
high risk or normal.

98
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.790 
So you don't need to simulate the entire
model, you can also simulate the

99
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.680 
partial the subdecisions and
provide the input step by step.

100
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.310 
Alright that's
basically

101
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.920 
the simulation. There is
also another feature

102
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.110 
which is called a test lab and
when you switch to a test lab

103
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.460 
this allows you to divine to define
existing test cases. So for example

104
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.540 
you already have your standard
cases i would say typically

105
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.850 
for the company and you expect that for
example the case that someone is eighteen

106
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.920 
has no airbags as a car of two
thousand euro his convicted leads

107
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.580 
the result of the
review is necessary.

108
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.930 
If this is the
case if the

109
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.750 
expected result is exactly the
same as a calculated result

110
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.220 
we could get a green check and
if someone later the logic

111
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.690 
has been changed for example
you can simply check if

112
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.720 
all your test grade cases are still
green. If not for example the

113
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.570 
logic has been changed and
someone changed the output to

114
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.530 
the model to let's
say this is not

115
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.140 
the output would be now review necessary.
Then we would get for example the

116
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.500 
red cross. And when you enter
the test I think you can see

117
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.520 
in all of all any of your defined
twenty test cases or more

118
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.850 
umm three of them get the red
cross that indicates ok

119
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.020 
someone has changed the
logic and we need to check

120
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.050 
if the rules are still valid or
if we need to change something.

121
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.020 
That is easier
instead of

122
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.160 
using the simulation to test all
different cases by providing

123
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.910 
the inputs again and again. You can
simply provide the input one time

124
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.830 
and just compare the expected
result with the calculated one.

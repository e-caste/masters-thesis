WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430 
all right. let's suggestion while you're downloading and find

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.460 
them. let's kick off the session hopefully by the time we get

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.990 
to the video we'll have it ready.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.290 
so welcome everybody to the second paper session of learning at scale.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.180 
i'll be your moderator for this session which is themed by the region

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.500 
where the work is from which is the US west coast.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.290 
humans are very good at at recognizing patterns and so i try

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.720 
to find a pattern in the papers even though they were clearly not

9
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.780 
put together by some content of the paper.

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.590 
but the commonality seems to be that it focuses on stakeholders

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.590 
not necessarily the students, but either the instructors or

12
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.820 
instructional designers domain experts or maybe even university

13
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.630 
administrators looking for which models to buy and what questions to ask

14
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.650 
and how we can use data in order to improve

15
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.190 
the experience the quality of the content, the learning experiences

16
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.910 
the models that are put out there.

17
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.280 
so that's my best attempt at finding structure

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.240 
in a set of four excellent papers that we'll have presented today.

19
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.590 
so let me start by introducing our first speaker

20
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.250 
was kavana ramesh

21
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.560 
together with latin vermette and shawna.

22
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.590 
and the title of the talk is setting up troubleshooting

23
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.240 
and innovating on the delivery of online instruction a case study

24
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.340 
of an LMS q and a forum.

25
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.790 
and one thing that i just found

26
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.250 
fascinating about this work is the use of, it is a clever use

27
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.680 
of the covid19 shock that we've all experienced and

28
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.830 
trying to figure out what data is really useful for gaining insights.

29
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.120 
and i think the neat thing about this work is that

30
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.810 
it realizes that you know it led a lot of people to ask questions

31
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.450 
that are otherwise hard to observe, and it uses that data set

32
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.030 
to glean a lot of insight.

33
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.310 
so without further introduction. i'll hand it over to

34
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.250 
Kavana Ramesh and the video that she presented.

35
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.030 
thank you so much for the wonderful introduction.

36
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.230 
i'm not sure who is going to be playing the video, but i just want

37
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.570 
to say thank you so much and i look forward to getting your

38
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.310 
questions and feedback afterwards.

39
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.900 
everyone, i'm Kavana Ramesh from the ixlab at the school of

40
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.410 
computing science at simon fraser university.

41
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.550 
i'll be sharing with you some of our recent work on how instructors use

42
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.640 
their learning management systems for setting up troubleshooting

43
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.470 
and innovating on the delivery of online instruction.

44
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.800 
first i want to share with you some context about canvas, a

45
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.490 
learning management system or lms that's widely used globally

46
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.400 
with four thousand institutions worldwide and thirty million global users.

47
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.870 
LMS like canvas tend to have a wide range of features and

48
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.460 
a steep learning curve for many instructors.

49
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.630 
this problem became even more difficult this past year as many

50
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.750 
instructors had to move their courses to fully online teaching

51
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.900 
on very short notice and often with very little support.

52
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.590 
popular lms is like canvas tend to have online help communities,

53
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.430 
like the canvas community forum which has five hundred thousand users,

54
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.830 
and these are available for instructors to ask questions about how to use

55
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.560 
different features or set up their courses. these communities

56
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.760 
can be a great tool to support instructors with LMS says especially

57
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.660 
as it's been harder for many instructors to access and learn from their colleagues.

58
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.870 
however we don't know much about how the

59
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.790 
lms communities get used for troubleshooting and support learning.

60
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.360 
and we lack insights into what types of issues get discussed

61
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.730 
and what extent instructors are able to find the relevant answers they're looking for.

62
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.630 
to address this we want to look into the following question,

63
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.680 
how do instructors use these online community driven help forms

64
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.910 
to collaboratively learn and troubleshoot their lms.

65
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.010 
our approach to this question was to first conduct a mixed methods

66
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.350 
content analysis of two hundred and fifty form posts sampled

67
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.170 
from the canvass community question form in mid 2020.

68
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.910 
when many instructors were transitioning to online teaching set-ups

69
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.630 
often for the first time.

70
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.860 
or what did we find out? through our analysis we identified three key things.

71
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.500 
firstly we identified the high level types of questions being

72
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.950 
asked by instructors and segmented based on this.

73
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.240 
we found three cross-cutting themes the types of issues that instructors were discussing.

74
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.590 
and we also attempted through analysis to identify some of

75
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.950 
the kinds of questions that tended to get answered and which

76
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.890 
questions were not being answered as effectively in the form.

77
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.220 
in this video i will focus on two and three, but for more info

78
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.210 
on part one please refer to our paper.

79
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.070 
let's discuss now some of the key themes for types of issues

80
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.660 
we observed in our sample of posts.

81
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.830 
the first theme that we observed were issues where an instructor

82
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.900 
would simply indicate an end goal for how they want to set up their course,

83
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.320 
or asked a question about how to do a basic setup task in their lms,

84
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.190 
like simply uploading a syllabus or for the course and posting

85
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.310 
it for their students.

86
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.560 
the next theme we observed were issues that surrounded adapting

87
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.670 
or working within the lms to facilitate a shared learning experience

88
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.670 
between instructors, students and in some cases even their parents.

89
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.210 
and these concerns were often regarding resolving disparities

90
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.110 
in what a student sees versus what the instructor may have actually intended.

91
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.950 
the final and most prevalent theme were those that tended to focus on

92
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.140 
innovating beyond the basic uses of the lms or utilizing new features or integrations.

93
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.410 
this makes sense when we consider how many instructors were

94
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.320 
migrating course content from in-person to online.

95
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.920 
often needing to integrate new tools or modifying existing

96
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.480 
tools to support new tasks.

97
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.840 
and having to adapt or customize the lms to support unique instructor needs.

98
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.020 
like in the following example,

99
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.980 
sometimes instructors would need to match their lms or modify it

100
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.320 
to suit a particular instructor goal.

101
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.100 
i usually have on site hands-on anatomy lab practical's with

102
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.010 
the covid19 crisis. i need to do this online, can i limit

103
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.140 
the time for each question station to one point five minutes and allow students

104
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.530 
to return to the stations that they flagged for ten or more minutes?

105
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.900 
these kinds of issues were those where an instructor sought

106
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.300 
to adapt or customize their lms to suit the particular need

107
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.780 
or goal that they have more effectively.

108
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.270 
but how are these questions and issues getting actually
answered within the form.

109
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.260 
well, we attempted to identify some of this.

110
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.810 
we observed that about eighty percent of questions received an answer,

111
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.480 
but what do we learn about the other twenty percent.

112
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.380 
well, we noticed that questions about basic set up most often

113
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.660 
did receive an answer.

114
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.230 
and this makes sense with how forms have been supporting these

115
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.240 
kinds of questions in the past, but for posts about innovating

116
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.550 
or innovating on the current lms nearly a third of them received

117
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.120 
no replies at all.

118
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.530 
what does this mean for instructor's ability to find support

119
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.920 
for their lms issues?

120
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.790 
it's clear from our work that there is certainly value in community

121
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.650 
based learning and the form did provide answers for majority of issues.

122
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.080 
but instructors need spaces for supporting each other,

123
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.300 
perhaps having smaller communities,

124
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.090 
or sub communities would be more beneficial for some instructors,

125
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.070 
to address their complex issues.

126
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.690 
and there's clearly more need for support for more complex customisation

127
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.980 
to suit more unique instructor needs.

128
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.700 
we are starting to see some projects that tackle some of the issues we've identified,

129
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.990 
for example recent work on customizer a tool that allows instructors to access

130
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.140 
social support for customizing canvas courses within the application.

131
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.700 
but clearly more work is needed in the space to fully address

132
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.470 
the complex widely varying needs of instructors
and their online courses.

133
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.510 
overall we see a lot of opportunity to improve instructor's experience with lms

134
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.130 
and other software by drawing upon each cia interaction design research.

135
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.110 
and summary we provided various insights and how instructors

136
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.560 
use their q a forms to set up troubleshoot and innovate their online instruction.

137
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.820 
we thank you so much and please feel free to check out our paper here.

138
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.500 
thank you clap.

139
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.030 
audibly for everybody,

140
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.630 
thank you for that presentation.

141
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:18.680 
let me please use the raise hand feature if or put your question the

142
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.140 
chat either way is fine

143
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.770 
to ask a question for  kavana,

144
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.360 
one  question that i can

145
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.870 
let me ask my question briefly and then i'll guess you can

146
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.450 
which is that did you see any effects in terms of effect that

147
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.950 
people were expressing i mean the quote that was

148
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.650 
put out there seemed very neutral

149
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.830 
in tone or were the instructors more frustrated or were they

150
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.220 
generally positive excited about the experience was there any

151
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.720 
pattern that you noticed in terms of the effect that they presented?

152
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.720 
that's a very interesting question.
and i think our approach initially was

153
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.730 
to, because we kind of conducted a quantitative

154
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.390 
grounded theory and qualitative grounded theory analysis of the content.

155
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.910 
much of the time i was initially trying to discern more of

156
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.040 
the question type being asked and not so much the feeling or the sentiment.

157
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.620 
but i'm especially looking into some of those scenarios that

158
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.650 
we discuss in that third theme of innovating upon teaching practices

159
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:29.780 
or asking questions about a particular possible feature, or a solution

160
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.970 
that they are finding may or may not exist is often when i

161
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.810 
would see that frustrated tone.

162
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.840 
and kind of frustration with either the limitations of canvas as an element

163
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.930 
or frustration that there wasn't a better way for them to search for

164
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.400 
a solution for their problem.

165
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.760 
so for instance one of the question types that we

166
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.880 
noted in that first at high level segmentation

167
00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.940 
were questions that said kind of something around where a feature was?

168
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.420 
does this feature exist where can i find it?

169
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.960 
and these are i think some of the cases where i would see kind

170
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.040 
of like more of that effect come through that

171
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.130 
sense of frustration.

172
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.910 
thank you for that response.

173
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.060 
Ken, yes super interesting.
i am curious about whether you saw it

174
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.990 
in the questions that were answered in the innovation category

175
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.150 
were there any patterns there or are any surprises

176
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.060 
or any particularly good insights about innovation?

177
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.460 
absolutely i think one of the things that we did observe especially

178
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.880 
when we consider again that time period in which we sampled.

179
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.490 
and time where some of these new tools are being integrated into canvas.

180
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.670 
some of them you might be familiar with studio,

181
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.340 
zoom of course, maybe collaborate some other on my lecture tools

182
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.070 
that we did notice a good amount of the posts in that section

183
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.930 
surrounded some aspect of sort of video in combination with teaching.

184
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.780 
and i would say that

185
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.650 
though those questions tended to

186
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.040 
not get answered to some extent. there were also a lot of

187
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.430 
verified canvass form support for these new tools, because they

188
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.690 
were kind of being added into cannabis i think from the top down.

189
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.260 
there were kind of links that could be offered to guides for

190
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.440 
how do i integrate studio into my platform and start the process of

191
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.740 
of best practice with the online video instruction.

192
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.660 
so i would say there are definitely patterns in some

193
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.040 
of the questions that did get answered which kind of line up

194
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.710 
with some of our expectations. i think,

195
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.910 
based on that time period. Great,

196
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.450 
then in the chat who's asking can you speak on how canvass interface

197
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.810 
the canvass interface and it's infrastructure and potential

198
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.060 
changes that happen to it may have affected what questions teachers asked.

199
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.980 
absolutely for some context as well and at the time period

200
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.230 
in which we sampled, i think we did pick a time in which

201
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.250 
there was it was sort of the early stages of adapting to the online teaching environment.

202
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.560 
and so there were certainly changes to the campus interface that were

203
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.470 
happening rapidly during that time especially with regards to

204
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:27.860 
video tools and options like that, on the side of the form however we did

205
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.640 
sample at a time where the form looked a little bit different

206
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.130 
than it does today. it doesn't have as much segmentation based

207
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.590 
on the role of the person posting a question. so currently there's

208
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.210 
kind of more opportunity to ask a question to people within

209
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.710 
your same kind of role. so an instructor can ask other instructors etcetera.

210
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.440 
and so i would say definitely there were parts of

211
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:56.270 
both the canvass forum being changed over time that we can't

212
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.510 
really speak to whether those changes may have affected the way that

213
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.250 
instructors get their questions asked today.

214
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.340 
hopefully they get answered better, now that they have certain

215
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.890 
opportunities to ask those questions directly.

216
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.590 
and also within the infrastructure of canvass definitely

217
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.340 
new features being added or new tools did affect i think to

218
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.160 
some extent the kinds of questions that would get asked around something new that

219
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.440 
an instructors were trying to learn at the time.

220
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.330 
definitely especially around that again those video tools, i would say,

221
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.460 
be the focus there. that make sense that your questions.

222
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.680 
I see question from Mar.

223
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.850 
Mar, do you wanna john ask your question elaborate a little on it.

224
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.920 
yeah, yeah thank you. honor this presentation. i wanted

225
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.960 
to ask if the those questions that were regarding the innovation

226
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.610 
were more technical for addressing this innovation or were

227
00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:03.040 
more explaining their innovation sharing the idea of
what they wanted to do.

228
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.210 
because i think this should be interesting, right.

229
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.320 
it's a way of sharing what i'm doing and how i'm designing?

230
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.610 
absolutely, i think if i understand you correctly i think

231
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.700 
there was definitely more

232
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:23.470 
sort of best practice and context setting and explanation behind

233
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.510 
not just simply what they've changed, but maybe why does it

234
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.020 
impact their teaching in a positive way, why do they need to do this to

235
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.470 
execute maybe an aspect of their teaching in person that needs to be

236
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:42.050 
transferred effectively to an online format.
so definitely inside of the

237
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.780 
responses and discussion around.
some of that innovation

238
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.610 
would be that inclusion of sort of best practice for instructor,

239
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:56.540 
not just simply like i know i change the code here in canvas to

240
00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.590 
to create a certain change, but more of like that why behind why

241
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.500 
this should be a good solution for other instructors,

242
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.170 
and that definitely lines up with

243
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.570 
a lot of the things that we saw across the board within all of.

244
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.990 
thank you, can i add only one thing running yeah okay.

245
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.870 
um i wanted to share with you an article with.

246
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:24.290 
i think it's interesting. i'm gonna put it in the chat.

247
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:30.440 
these article talks about learning design and

248
00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.300 
how people well how  teachers

249
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.920 
have problem with the cognitive love load, controllability confidence

250
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.800 
in the technology when addressing all these. and i was wondering if you

251
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:51.120 
saw analyzer you could maybe analyze this data from this perspective,

252
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.810 
for example probability of cognitive love,
because i know that some of the

253
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.440 
teachers when they are new

254
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.970 
they spend a lot of time learning about the tool,

255
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.340 
but not thinking about how to these,

256
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.570 
cut off a little bit. that is it paused for everybody else

257
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.150 
yeah i think mar is got cut out.

258
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.290 
i'm sorry about that. i was just going to say

259
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.100 
in response to that discussion.

260
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.900 
my coauthor layton is here and

261
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.400 
the tool that we mentioned at the end of the presentation is actually a

262
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.820 
context sharing tool that he kind of speaks to around

263
00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.640 
kind of sharing customisation the process of learning.

264
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.320 
so if there is anything you wanted to mention about that

265
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.730 
idli before to you respond.

266
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.420 
i see i can also ask the clarification question in the chat.

267
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.210 
kind of a follow up to my previous one.

268
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.330 
do you want me to say it out loud.

269
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.630 
so i'm just giving it a read, but either way, either way's fine.

270
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.800 
oh okay,

271
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.480 
so kind of my understanding correctly sort of the

272
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.240 
the innovation would be

273
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.940 
elements of their instruction that they would have to do

274
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.080 
like kind of integrate into the canvas form for students to

275
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.650 
pet the passively learning is that right?

276
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.810 
yeah i guess you know the mention of video as innovation

277
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.860 
certainly has been part of what we've been seeing in online learning.

278
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.470 
but having student there's also this lot of research on various

279
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.840 
forms to encourage more active learning,

280
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.080 
not just passively watching a video, but actively engaged in

281
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.420 
answering some driving question, you know they think pair share

282
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.730 
in the classroom or clicker questions or

283
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.110 
you know online formative assessments, you know and linking

284
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.760 
formative assessment questions into canvass is non-trivial

285
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.740 
especially if you want to get the data into your grade book.

286
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.820 
and that sort of thing. but i was probably just like where are people

287
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.000 
you know generally in your sample with respect to thinking about innovation

288
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.650 
that goes beyond passive learning support to more active learning support.

289
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.980 
i see, yeah i would say that's a really interesting perspective

290
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.080 
on and i appreciate your question.

291
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.420 
i think that in some ways it makes sense with

292
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.830 
a lot of the challenge i think is that generally speaking, i think

293
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.940 
a lot of those questions that kind of went unanswered around innovation

294
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.180 
were some of the times in which

295
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.120 
an instructor might be trying to model the engagement

296
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.310 
active learning engagement scenarios that they are creating in the  classroom

297
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:55.980 
after transferring that directly into the lms in a way that's effective.

298
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.920 
even looking from the example that we shared in our presentation.

299
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:04.180 
and so it definitely would say that that piece

300
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.780 
of trying to model  the kind of best practices for learning in the classroom.

301
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.280 
we did kind of see a lot of questions around that and then

302
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.110 
at times those questions were not getting answered very well.

303
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:21.020 
I would say that i can't speak to too well too much around how much

304
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.700 
of the questions tended to be about passive versus

305
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.130 
active learning. i think from  my background lens i didn't

306
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.920 
think about learning in that way. and so it's very interesting to

307
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.530 
see your question and kind of approach our data maybe in a different way,

308
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.810 
maybe in that way in the future as well. thank you.

309
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.620 
let me let me thank kavanaugh once once again for her work

310
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.120 
and for answering our questions.

311
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.990 
thank you for the active discussion, we'll move on to the next

312
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.740 
paper in the session which is

313
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.030 
presented by karen wang.

314
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.990 
the title is automating the assessment of problem solving practices

315
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.060 
using log data and data mining techniques.

316
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.190 
one of the interesting takeaways for me from reading the paper was

317
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.480 
does the value of being able to observe what students are doing

318
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.580 
in addition to just having a lot of log data about what they're doing.

319
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.980 
and so she'll be addressing that further in the video.

320
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.790 
hi, my name is caren wang,
i have a phd candidate at the graduate school

321
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.990 
of education at stanford university.

322
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:30.890 
In today's talk i will be presenting our last research measuring

323
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:35.220 
college students' problem-solving practices using interactive simulations

324
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:40.490 
with a specific focus on lock data and data mining techniques.

325
00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.500 
in this video presentation i will be addressing three big questions.

326
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:54.690 
first what practices are involved in science and engineering problem solving.

327
00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:01.300 
second what features can be extracted from the log data of

328
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.750 
students solving an interactive task embedded in a science simulation.

329
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.840 
and third how useful are these features in predicting problem solving performance

330
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.940 
and evaluating specific practices.

331
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.880 
problem solving is an important goal of education.

332
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.760 
the national research council has listed practices related to problem solving

333
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.300 
at the core of the next generation science standers.

334
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:36.430 
these practices are related to what scientists do to investigate

335
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.280 
the natural world and what engineers do to design and build systems.

336
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.710 
a large part of scientists and engineers jobs involve solving complex

337
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:53.780 
real world problems, yet exactly what practices go into problem solving.

338
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:58.070 
it's still question yet to be fully addressed by research.

339
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:06.750 
with these questions in mind our lab has undertaken a research program to characterize

340
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.420 
measure and teach scientific problem solving practices using

341
00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.400 
fit interactive simulations.

342
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:20.340 
to characterize and measure the practices used by scientists and engineers

343
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.490 
to solve authentic complex problems. we must first explicate

344
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:30.350 
the characteristics of authentic problems in science and engineering domains.

345
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.990 
these problems are open ended have much more solutions and unknown solution paths.

346
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:43.380 
they're complex involving many steps require planning and can not be solved

347
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.030 
by following a set of prescribed rules.

348
00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.490 
they're knowledge rich reaching the goal requires the selection
and application

349
00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.640 
of domain-specific knowledge.

350
00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.290 
with these characteristics of authentic problems in mind we

351
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:05.570 
designed and developed a set of interactive tasks using the fet simulation platform.

352
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.810 
the circuit construction kit simulation provides an accurate model

353
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.990 
based on ohm's law for every circuit constructed.

354
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.300 
a circuit configuration is hidden behind a black box,

355
00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.210 
and this problem solvers job is to figure out
what it is by constructing circuits

356
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.810 
and using measurement tools.

357
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.820 
in its deep structure the black box problem resembles the troubleshooting

358
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.320 
problems that scientists and engineers encounter in their work,

359
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.290 
such as troubleshooting an experiment that did not work as planned

360
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.050 
or debugging a software.

361
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.530 
the problem solver needs to decide what data to collect, how

362
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.580 
to collect the data and how to interpret the data

363
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.980 
using relevant content knowledge to come up with a solution.

364
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.170 
this task allows us to capture students' problem-solving process

365
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.420 
beyond what is possible with traditional paper and pencil tests.

366
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.640 
In our lab's previous work studying how experts and novices

367
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.190 
solve the black box problem.

368
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:15.510 
we used qualitative research methods to identify eight practices

369
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.900 
that are important for solving complex real world problems.

370
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.090 
these practices are clustered around two categories,

371
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.250 
execution practices and reflection practices,

372
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:33.170 
execution practices refer to what students do when solving a problem

373
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.220 
including defining the problem in their own words

374
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.850 
breaking the problem into small parts,

375
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.400 
collecting the data recording and interpreting the data.

376
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:49.820 
reflection practices refer to how students reflect about what to do

377
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.120 
when solving a problem,

378
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.460 
including reflecting on problem definition and assumptions

379
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.390 
reflecting on knowledge reflecting on strategy,

380
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.980 
and reflecting on their solution.

381
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.960 
identifying and scoring evidence of these practices

382
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.810 
and think aloud protocols are time consuming and labour intensive.

383
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:18.800 
in this study we explore how to effectively and efficiently measure these practices

384
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.050 
using log interaction data.

385
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.690 
the following research questions are addressed.

386
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:32.100 
first what features can be extracted from the log data of students

387
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.860 
solving an interactive task embedded in a science simulation.

388
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:42.710 
and next, how useful are these features in predicting problem solving performance

389
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.210 
and evaluating specific problem solving practices.

390
00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.920 
the procedure of this study is as follows.

391
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.190 
when participants came to the lab they first went through informed consent,

392
00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.690 
and were then given a brief tutorial to learn how to construct circuits

393
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.260 
using the simulation and refresh their knowledge about ohm's law.

394
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.730 
participants were asked to think aloud and were given fifteen minutes

395
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.030 
to work on the problem.

396
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.850 
when the time is up or when they reached a solution within fifteen minutes,

397
00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.750 
they recorded their solution on a piece of paper.

398
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:26.410 
we use the solution scores as a proxy for
participants' problem-solving performance.

399
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.660 
their solutions were scored using a rubric that assesses the solution

400
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.990 
in three dimensions.

401
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.280 
did they identify the correct structure of the hidden circuit?

402
00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.120 
did they identify the correct component?

403
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:45.270 
in this case two resistors in a wire and did they identify

404
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:51.100 
the correct values for the components?
in this case ten and fifteen ohm resistors.

405
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:55.910 
each dimension has a sub score ranging from zero to two,

406
00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.840 
making the total score ranging from zero to six.

407
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.350 
the goal in this study is to evaluate students problem solving process

408
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.320 
beyond their final solutions.

409
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.900 
to this end, we turn to the lock data or trace data which captures

410
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.070 
every mouse click, cursor move,
and user initiated actions in the simulation.

411
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.440 
the image here shows five log events out of an average of two

412
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.240 
hundred and thirty thousand events generated by a single participant

413
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.930 
in the fifteen minute task.

414
00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.960 
however the large amount of log data does not automatically

415
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.070 
translate into meaningful patterns of students' problem-solving practices.

416
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.350 
to make sense of the log data we wrote a python script to extract

417
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:50.390 
information from the jacen file containing
participants' raw interactions.

418
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.240 
the log data was first pursed into a time stem to sequence

419
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.150 
of actions taken by participants in solving the black box problem.

420
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.140 
for example adding a light bulb to the hidden circuit at a wire,

421
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.810 
at a battery, use a vote meter.

422
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:14.870 
then aggregated individual actions into a count of electrical

423
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.070 
components and measurement tools used.

424
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.010 
these features form the first set of action-based features

425
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.920 
to be used as independent variables in a regression model predicting

426
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.450 
students solution scores.

427
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.360 
this table presents the best fitting model using action-based

428
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.870 
features to predict students solution scores.

429
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.960 
none of the action-based features is a significant predictor,

430
00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:46.040 
and the only significant predictor is students' education background in physics.

431
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.230 
students who have taken higher levels of physics courses are

432
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.700 
more likely to score higher.

433
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.980 
the adjusted r squared of this model is zero point one six.

434
00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.930 
indicating that only sixteen percent of the variance in the

435
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:02.820 
solution scores is accounted for.

436
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.380 
the question is can we do better than this?

437
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.760 
through qualitative observation of students' problem-solving process,

438
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:16.100 
we noted that the type of circuits built by students were closely

439
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.340 
related to the practices used by them to solve the problem.

440
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.020 
this knowledge led us to extract a second set of knowledge grounded features

441
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:30.190 
by parsing the log data into distinct episodes of constructing circuits

442
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:34.340 
taking measurements and pausing in between these episodes.

443
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.690 
specifically most of the circuits built by students

444
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.780 
fell into two categories.

445
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:45.810 
simple circuits that connect two terminals, and complex circuits

446
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.250 
that connect more than two terminals at a time.

447
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.360 
the knowledge grounded features including the number of circuits constructed

448
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.860 
pairs of terminals connected by simple circuits,

449
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.650 
percentage of circuits that were complex

450
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.710 
different types of vote meter readings and meter readings,
and pause time

451
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.370 
are used as independent variables in a linear regression model

452
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.680 
to predict students' solution scores.

453
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.940 
the model using knowledge grounded features has an adjusted

454
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.820 
r square of point six o.

455
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.240 
indicating that sixty percent of the variance in solution scores

456
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.190 
can be accounted for by the model.

457
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.810 
a subset of the knowledge grounded features are significant

458
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.170 
or marginally significant predictors of students' problem-solving performance,

459
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.180 
including the pairs of terminals that were connected by simple circuits.

460
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.960 
the percentage of circuits built that were complex.

461
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.020 
the n meter readings and pause time after using the n meter.

462
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:57.930 
in addition knowledge grounded features are also significant predictors

463
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.490 
of a specific problem-solving practices.

464
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.640 
the effectiveness of these practices were first coded by two researchers

465
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.840 
using a rubric developed in previous research.

466
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.100 
in the regression models

467
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.830 
the knowledge grounded features accounted for seventy seven

468
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:20.510 
percent of the variance in the scores measuring the practice of decomposition,

469
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:25.040 
sixty four percent of the variance in the scores measuring

470
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.760 
the practice of data collection,

471
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:31.760 
and fifty eight percent of the variance in the scores measuring the practice

472
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:32.910 
of data recording.

473
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.610 
in summary this study made the following discoveries:

474
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.930 
knowledge grounded features extracted from the log data are

475
00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.530 
better predictors of problem solving performance than action based features.

476
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.050 
knowledge grounded features also provide important evidence

477
00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.680 
for evaluating specific problem solving practices

478
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.490 
including decomposition, data collection and data recording.

479
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.940 
many people are involved in making this study and analysis possible

480
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:15.090 
there are my adviser karl, shima and our student research associates require

481
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.480 
Ana, Max and Christian.

482
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:22.270 
we also like to thank the fet development team and the moore foundation

483
00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.400 
for their support.

484
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.110 
I welcome your questions and comments, thank you.

485
00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.270 
thank you for the presentation.

486
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.950 
I like the switch of the microphone as well, half way through latos.

487
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:44.120 
so questions please feel free to raise your hand if you want to ask

488
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.370 
a question. i'll put it in the chat.

489
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.010 
either one, either one is fine.

490
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:57.030 
i've got one that i'll start off with which is about the action-based features.

491
00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:02.130 
and i wonder if the thought that i had when i was reading,

492
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.620 
it is you know if you wanted to give the action-based features a real shot.

493
00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:10.120 
you could give some other researchers who do educational

494
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.340 
data mining work on a regular basis that log data and the outcomes.

495
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.440 
and go well try your best and then compare that to the knowledge-

496
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.060 
grounded features in order to

497
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.060 
have even more of a stronger a stronger case to say

498
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.240 
the knowledge grounded features really outperform the actual

499
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.080 
based features, if you don't know

500
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.870 
what you think about that and how do you think the two the

501
00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.680 
two different versions of features compare.

502
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.700 
that's a great question René.

503
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.610 
so we actually started we did a lot of engineering and modeling

504
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.620 
with the action based features, but i think one

505
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:54.480 
fundamental limitation in education data mining is the dataset size.

506
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:58.210 
if we want to try something like

507
00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.440 
a deep neural network like long short term memory which actually

508
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.120 
accounts for not just one single action but a cluster of actions

509
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:09.190 
kind of modeling that context going forward, you need a lot of data.

510
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.970 
and that's something that i think we as educational

511
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.990 
data mining researchers simply don't have the luxury, like the

512
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:18.280 
computer vision and they'll be people, because they could easily

513
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.760 
have half a million data set, you know just like, that and for us

514
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:26.660 
the data collection especially collection of high quality data is very expensive.

515
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.490 
if we can get thousands of students that would be already like

516
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:36.770 
a dream come true, but so to have that half a million data sample

517
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:41.220 
size is just so beyond our reach, is something that's kind of one limit

518
00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:48.670 
why it's hard to  make those more deep neural networks work.

519
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.220 
and that's why feature engineering is so important.

520
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.040 
but you know in the future if we have the task in lunch through

521
00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.790 
a  MOOC  perhaps we would have finally the data set

522
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.390 
that we need to not make that possible.

523
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.830 
that's a great, that's a great point, and i think the scalability

524
00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:13.410 
as you say comes with having the good features identified with a smaller sample.

525
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.800 
and then you could provide feedback based on that

526
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:20.550 
in a larger scale setting in line with the name of the conference.

527
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:26.390 
ah that's it. i see ken had a question.

528
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:32.130 
you not around on, my screen ok, i want to ask you a question.

529
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.170 
i think that's super interesting karen.

530
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:40.240 
i'm wondering if you might productively combined some more

531
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.390 
qualitative or theory driven analysis approaches

532
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.290 
with along with the quantitative, it's super interesting.

533
00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.590 
and perhaps you've done more of it and you can elaborate.

534
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.350 
but you know, i'm thinking for example like

535
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:56.280 
what one thing i was influenced by a lot is when mickey chee,

536
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.460 
first discovered self-explanation the way she did it as she

537
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:04.160 
split her sample into those students who had been successful learners.

538
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:07.830 
and those who had been less successful learners,

539
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.060 
and ask well what did the successful learners do

540
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:15.380 
that the less successful ones didn't. right, in and self-explanation

541
00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.090 
was the answer right and that was a great discovery in it and

542
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.920 
i kind of like that strategy you know regression sort of does that.

543
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.610 
but it doesn't in a much more kind of continuous way,

544
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.650 
now i wonder about doing that in a more you know sort of qualitative

545
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:32.060 
like it in broader strokes what is it about those who succeed.

546
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.700 
and we've used this strategy in other situations sometimes

547
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.780 
with quite surprising results where we thought the issue was more strategic,

548
00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:43.520 
but what we found is it was a richer knowledge base that explained

549
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.920 
the difference between succeeders and failures.

550
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.590 
In some ways i was disappointed because we were looking for

551
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.470 
general problem solving answers,

552
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.820 
but that's the cool thing about science sometimes.

553
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.310 
is it tells you something different than what you thought.

554
00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.670 
yeah so i don't know have you tried anything like that?

555
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:07.050 
that's a great suggestion and it's kind of we did that

556
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:12.210 
in the expert novice comparison in the earlier study where we looked at

557
00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:17.020 
how you know phd students and faculty members solve a problem

558
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.290 
versus students in introductory physics courses.

559
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.570 
so and i think  you've also pointed an important issue which is just hard to

560
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:29.230 
untangle the conceptual knowledge and problem-solving practices

561
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.560 
when you have an authentic problem in science and engineering domains.

562
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:37.130 
but we did see that the experts were better at data collection

563
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.260 
in a sense that they would systematically build

564
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:45.820 
simple circuits across each of the six pairs of terminals.

565
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.230 
and they would collect the meter readings and meter readings

566
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.870 
and then use ohm's law to solve the resistance.

567
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.540 
but what was interesting was how,

568
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.920 
how they so the experts kept a very systematic notes of their data.

569
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.750 
but what was surprising was our log data wasn't able to pick up

570
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.100 
that data recording practice by looking at the pause time after

571
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.990 
the voltmeter and end meter. so the pause time after taking

572
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:18.280 
measurement went up to be a significant predictor for students' data recording scores.

573
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.060 
so to us that was quite interesting,

574
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.410 
because the algorithm or the log data cannot see when the students

575
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:28.860 
are stopping to taking notes or using pen and paper.

576
00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.770 
but somehow it figure out the pause time was actually an indicator of that.

577
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.050 
really discovering the point of the pausing.

578
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:46.010 
i saw there was another question, i think it was

579
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.490 
young kuen did you have a question.

580
00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.170 
how did it get answered.

581
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:57.100 
yeah, yeah sure i thank you for your presentation and i have a question about,

582
00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:04.720 
like have you considering about generalize the

583
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:10.600 
log data processing pipeline to other domains for

584
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.590 
example programming task solving?

585
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.160 
yeah do you have any suggestions of such kind of generalization,
thank you.

586
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:25.100 
thank you for the question. and yes as i've shown in one of the slides.

587
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:29.790 
it's really data mining innocence that we had eight gigabytes

588
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:33.600 
of log data and then it turned into a csv file of like a hundred
kilo kilobytes.

589
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:40.090 
or so and i think the challenge with processing

590
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:42.900 
distilling features from logdata

591
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:48.230 
is the kind of in the educational setting is you need to

592
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:52.490 
have access to direct observations of what the students are doing.

593
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.820 
i'm so for that,

594
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.560 
i think having qualitative observations videos to go back to

595
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.960 
really helps a lot. and then the action based versus

596
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.900 
knowledge grounded feature. i think that's another

597
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:11.240 
kind of generalizable principle in a sense that allows the

598
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.110 
time when we have the log data,

599
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:18.760 
our first kind of approach is always.
well, let's see if we can replicate

600
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.470 
what the students did in the study orwhat they did when programming and

601
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:27.560 
kind of get those discrete actions.
but turns out that when

602
00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.790 
you have a smaller data set, you need a higher level of abstraction.

603
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.140 
so if you think about the proximity to the raw data,

604
00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.270 
the action based feature was closer versus the knowledge ground feature

605
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:42.210 
represent a higher level of abstraction. and i wrote that would look at

606
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.850 
that will look require us to look at the unit of analysis differently.

607
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.950 
instead of say the unit's discrete actions one by one,

608
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:56.930 
perhaps our unit should actually be a test trial of data collection or

609
00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.230 
in programming case a trial of would students wrote a function

610
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:03.350 
to then test it out.

611
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.460 
so i think it just requires us to to have a lot of quantitative observation

612
00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:13.010 
ahead of time before delving into the data, because you could

613
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.010 
easily get lost in a kind of data driven or

614
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.460 
a data guided processing. but without that higher level,

615
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.640 
or a higher level of abstraction that actually allows you to see

616
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:26.530 
beyond the discrete actions.

617
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.610 
thank you for that karen and

618
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:35.550 
for the work. and we'll move on to the next

619
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:41.640 
prisoner which will be a life presentation.

620
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.300 
Benjamin is presenting his slight life perfect what one of us.

621
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.680 
i've started providing my my one one cents take away from all of these

622
00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.850 
what really fascinated me about this one is just how useful

623
00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.710 
such a simple tool is as differential item functioning right.

624
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.170 
it's something that's been around for so long, and it's been

625
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.930 
used by a group of people, but its value much more exceeds what

626
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:10.450 
it has been used for traditionally and
i think this work really shows that.

627
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:11.870 
so i can take it away.

628
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.130 
thank you very much.

629
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.820 
so i am benjamin Xie, i'm a phd candidate at the university

630
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.610 
of washington seattle a university which acknowledges the coast

631
00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:25.360 
salish people of this land the land which touches the shared

632
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.670 
waters of all tribes and bands within the duwamish pileup suquamish

633
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:33.050 
tulalip and muckle shute nations and i am very excited to share

634
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:36.540 
the work that i've done with my colleagues from the utep information

635
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.110 
school college of education dub group as well as with nonprofit
code dot org.

636
00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.150 
so we use test scores for a lot of things so universities use

637
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:49.500 
test scores for test such as the computer science exam to determine,

638
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.620 
if a student should get into a university or major.

639
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:55.500 
teachers use tests for some purposes such as grading and students

640
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.970 
use tests to self assess what they know and the results can

641
00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.390 
affect their self-efficacy and sense of belonging us.

642
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.590 
but how do we know how good our tests are.

643
00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.520 
so how different people interpret and
use test scores is really important.

644
00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.120 
but at the end of the day tests are imperfect measures of knowledge at best

645
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.370 
should understand how good a test is we have to make a few

646
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:17.660 
assumptions, so following item response theory or IRT from

647
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.330 
the field of psychometrics. we can assume that student knowledge.

648
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:23.020 
and question difficulty are in the same continuous dimension.

649
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:26.690 
so say we have questions a b and c where a is the least difficult

650
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:30.990 
question and c is the most difficult and say we have two students michel and jorge.

651
00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.870 
and they answer these questions.

652
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:37.510 
based on their responses to these questions we can estimate their knowledge levels.

653
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.610 
so michelle's knowledge is somewhere between b and c,

654
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:42.900 
because she got question b correct and c incorrect.

655
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:47.130 
and by a similar logic jorge 's knowledge is somewhere between a and b.

656
00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.040 
now so we want to look at a group of students who reported

657
00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.420 
as male and a group who reported as female. all students got

658
00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.950 
questions a and c correct. so we would then expect them to get

659
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:03.310 
b correct as well. and say all students reported as male did

660
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.870 
get be correct as expected.

661
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.300 
but say we observe that most students who report as female

662
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.660 
got question b wrong.

663
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:14.630 
so this is a toy example that demonstrates differential item functioning or dif

664
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.340 
where students have a similar knowledge level,

665
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:21.680 
but different groups gender in this case perform differently on an item,

666
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:27.430 
question b in this case. so diff is a technique to identify potential test bias,

667
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.940 
or bias in test questions.

668
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.780 
so when i was saying traditionally diff has been used for a

669
00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.700 
while traditionally. it's been used as a filter.
so you can imagine

670
00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.770 
a testing service such as

671
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:43.590 
es using diff to identify potential bad question that they

672
00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.040 
want to remove and not use in a large scale standardized test

673
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.850 
like the GRB for example. but rather than use diff as a filter,

674
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.950 
this study really want to explore like what if we could use DIF

675
00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.680 
to try to inform how equitably we teach.

676
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.590 
the data on DIF can help us identify or substantiate these

677
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.970 
nuanced patterns of disparities or bias, but we actually need

678
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:08.730 
domain expertise of stakeholders such as students teachers and curriculum designers

679
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.250 
to actually interpret and use these findings to address inequities

680
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.490 
so that classic problems like data signals this thing.

681
00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.400 
but we don't actually know what to do with it unless we have that domain expertise.

682
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.420 
so this paper explores how domain experts curriculum designers in this case.

683
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.830 
might be able to interpret and use gender and race based DIF

684
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:28.560 
for equity related goals.

685
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.130 
so for the study i partnered with code dot org a nonprofit that

686
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:37.020 
dedicate to inclusive computing education and we analyzed responses

687
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:40.990 
from about twenty thousand students from who used the middle

688
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.880 
school cs discoveries curriculum.

689
00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:47.920 
the seventeen questions that i analyzed are either matching

690
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.780 
questions or multiple choice questions, so in stark contrast

691
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:55.900 
to the work that karen was talking about
these are closed form questions. they're all

692
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.740 
either entirely right or entirely wrong. there are two types.

693
00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:02.420 
there's a matching question that required students to place

694
00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.100 
options in the correct location and multiple choice questions

695
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.890 
that required students to choose one or two options.

696
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:14.140 
for quiet our quantitative analysis focused on checking for

697
00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.540 
potential test bias by gender and race for each test question.

698
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:22.210 
we say that a question is biased if on average a student from a disadvantaged

699
00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:26.460 
group is at least five percent less likely to get that question correct

700
00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:29.260 
compared to a student of similar knowledge from the other group.

701
00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.830 
so this the equivalent of checking for statistical significance

702
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.780 
with a medium- or large effect size.

703
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.390 
we found that two questions disadvantage students who reported

704
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:40.680 
as female compared to students who reported as male.

705
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:44.700 
so here's an example of a trace plot showing you the probability

706
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.980 
that a student of a given knowledge level on the x axis would

707
00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:52.320 
get this question correct. and then what we see here is that gold

708
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:56.350 
solid line representing the probability that a reported female

709
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.850 
student would get this question correct

710
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.110 
is always below that dotted

711
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.730 
dark green line which represents the probability the reported

712
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:08.760 
male student get it correct, which is to say that there is uniform dif.

713
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.250 
so reported female students across all knowledge levels have a

714
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.190 
lower probability of getting this item correct compared to

715
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.420 
a reported male students of equivalent knowledge level.

716
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:23.020 
and then of those seventeen questions we also found that most disadvantaged

717
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:28.680 
african AHNP students are include african such black hispanic latin ex

718
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:33.920 
native american alaska native and pacific islanders students,

719
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:37.270 
when compared to WA students who are white and asians students.

720
00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:43.070 
so put together we can say that students of equivalent knowledge,

721
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.590 
but different genders or races would actually score pretty differently

722
00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.470 
on the cs discovery's assessments.

723
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:54.480 
so as a whole this test disadvantages AHNP and reported

724
00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.090 
female students the most and advantages WA students the most.

725
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.690 
so if you see this is a simulation that we ran

726
00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:05.380 
for students of three different knowledge levels low average and high,

727
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:11.030 
if the the entire test was unbiased we'd expect all the groups to

728
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:15.520 
match up with the line with the vertical lines. but what we see is

729
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:19.810 
AHNP and female students and reported female students in particular

730
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:26.010 
are most disadvantaged, and then WA students white and

731
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.340 
asian students are most advantaged.

732
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.690 
but this all doesn't tell us the cause of this bias or what

733
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.180 
we're supposed to actually do about it at all, said understand

734
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.610 
that we conducted a remote workshop where seven coder curriculum designers

735
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:41.970 
interpreted this dif data. all this was in an effort to understand

736
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:42.940 
this new way of using

737
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:48.270 
to use DIF to improve equity in learning by informing domain experts

738
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:52.490 
of potential issues of bias. so here are a few high level takeaways

739
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.190 
by definitely point you to the paper to read more about our findings.

740
00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.860 
so one was that curriculum designers considered how test design

741
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.540 
may have introduced bias with some identifying matching type

742
00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.740 
questions disadvantaging students reported as female,

743
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:09.420 
since is probably the the nearest match which is looking at who's

744
00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.140 
disadvantaged and looking about what about these questions,

745
00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.130 
what is the similarity between these questions,

746
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.120 
identifying maybe the design of this question is introducing bias.

747
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.920 
designers also considered how the curriculum may or may

748
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.490 
not have prepared students for the test questions. so in one

749
00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.920 
case curriculum designers acknowledged that commenting code

750
00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.230 
was a skill worth learning, but may not have been taught well

751
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:33.220 
prior to this question.

752
00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.590 
so considering this was considered how specific this relationship

753
00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:40.980 
between the test and the curriculum design and how a mismatch

754
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.670 
there can contribute to bias,

755
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.500 
where kind of bias towards those who have preparatory privilege.

756
00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.230 
so it is very much like commenting code is important, this test

757
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:52.420 
question may be a fair assessment of how to comment code,
but we actually

758
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:56.580 
may not have covered this well in the curriculum.
so this question may bias towards

759
00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.140 
those who have are familiar with commenting code before

760
00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.240 
this curriculum.

761
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:08.300 
so this is really a towards a broader vision of iterating towards

762
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:11.710 
a more equitable learning experience, and that requires measuring

763
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:15.030 
factors we cannot easily into it and using domain expertise

764
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.790 
to contextualize these findings with understanding that we

765
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:18.840 
cannot easily measure.

766
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:24.530 
so there's a lot of potential future work related to this involving

767
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.450 
engaging additional stakeholders, so especially teachers and students

768
00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:32.260 
using human-centered AI tech techniques to enrich data with domain expertise.

769
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.660 
and actually perhaps using deaf as a technique to monitor the

770
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.010 
effect of potential interventions such as AI changes to teaching practices

771
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:41.990 
or curriculum design.

772
00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.640 
so in the spirit of pride month i did want to share one finding

773
00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.190 
which also serves as yet another reminder that data without context

774
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.180 
definitely can invite misinterpretation.

775
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.350 
so here are two trace plots which show the probability that

776
00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:00.520 
learners of different groups will get a test question correct given different

777
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:03.430 
later knowledge levels, so similar to the trace plot shown previously.

778
00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:06.900 
so here there's three groups groups a b and c. and these two

779
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:12.100 
plots show that this question unfairly advantages group a the solid red line

780
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:15.000 
when compared to the other two groups, so if we had three three

781
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.290 
students of the same knowledge level the student from group

782
00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:20.590 
a would perform better compared to students from groups b or

783
00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.820 
c of equivalent knowledge level.

784
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.770 
so these groups are actually reported gender of students,

785
00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:32.590 
so the data driven result here is that students who reported as non-binary

786
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.920 
have an advantage for this item as well as for others.

787
00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.990 
and that we must make changes to better support students who

788
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:43.380 
report as male or female, because non-binary students have an advantage.

789
00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:46.920 
so if you feel like something isn't quite right we did too.

790
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:50.410 
because as a mountain of computing and stem education literature

791
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:53.730 
detailing the minority zation of non-binary students.

792
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:56.700 
so we consulted with learning scientists and critical scholars,

793
00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:00.010 
and found out that coming out as non-binary in primary school

794
00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:03.310 
is a constant and challenging process. and that a majority of

795
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:06.350 
non-binary students may have been assigned female at birth.

796
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:10.030 
so the evidence driven results is that our data and labels

797
00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.380 
may not reflect the identity of students.

798
00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.560 
so the more accurate statement is that the data driven result

799
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.820 
is actually misleading, because of a lack of context. and that we can

800
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.620 
probably better to replace that with a more contextualized evidence driven finding

801
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.220 
that suggests that data on non-binary students for our study

802
00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:30.270 
may not reflect student experience. so that saying analyzing data is dangerous,

803
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.760 
and we should consult with domain experts to contextualize

804
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.500 
and validate our supposed findings.

805
00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:39.010 
there's a lot more in this paper that i encourage you to look at.

806
00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:42.330 
but the main take-away is this that data can really help us

807
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:45.550 
identify the existence and the extent of biases or disparities.

808
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:51.290 
but it is really up to  i say we should lean on and work with domain experts

809
00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.310 
to help us identify the causes to actually take the equitable action.

810
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.370 
again link to the full paper and access supplementary materials

811
00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:03.590 
at b and j i x i e com slash las twenty one. i'm legally obligated

812
00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:06.250 
to inform everyone i run into that i'm on the job market seeking

813
00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.750 
postdoc and research scientist opportunities and would love to chat.

814
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.620 
and i'll conclude by listing a list of four questions that

815
00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:16.810 
keep me up at night that can perhaps inspire some discussion and ideas.

816
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:23.550 
thank you Ben, for sharing your work with us and

817
00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.210 
the inspiring questions. and

818
00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.240 
all the shout-outs to

819
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.920 
the land on which you're doing the work as well as pride month.

820
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:35.340 
we've got some questions in the chat.

821
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:39.190 
first one,

822
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:45.360 
and he asked why only if students from a disadvantage group

823
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.900 
scored worse? what if students from an advantage group scored

824
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.770 
worse i think that was in context of the slide you were presenting

825
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:53.030 
at that time.

826
00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:58.780 
right yeah yes we definitely took a critical approach to acknowledging that.

827
00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:03.050 
i think it is written in paper that within computing education

828
00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:08.790 
especially within the US. there are there is a dominant group including

829
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.410 
predominantly white and asian men students. and then there are

830
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:15.420 
also students who are who have been historically minoritized.

831
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:18.930 
so we really wanted to focus on these understanding of these minorities groups

832
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.290 
in particular especially because they don't make up most of the data.

833
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:25.220 
so they're often left out because there isn't enough sample

834
00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:28.070 
size of them for statistical significance. so it's actually

835
00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:31.510 
maybe the first example of using of the exploration of not

836
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:35.760 
the experiences of non-binary students for with laying to test bias.

837
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.570 
and then we found that like those

838
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:42.810 
findings the data made may deviate from our expectations, because

839
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:45.410 
non-binary students may not feel comfortable reporting

840
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:47.480 
their gender identity

841
00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:50.330 
on this online platform.

842
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:54.450 
thank you for addressing that,

843
00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:58.620 
as another question i see in the chat, and then i've get it apartment.

844
00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:02.990 
from kimberley who asks what was the background and demographics

845
00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:04.970 
of the curriculum designers.

846
00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:08.680 
yeah you know fantastic question i think the positionally of

847
00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:12.610 
the curriculum designers is really important consider, it was

848
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:15.140 
reported in the paper. it was

849
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:21.170 
a group that was diverse in gender and ethnicity. so there included

850
00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:25.400 
women and non-binary participants and then also

851
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.530 
some people of colour, there was

852
00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:33.040 
definitely some evidence of kind of people bringing in their

853
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.820 
positionally in the consideration

854
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:36.850 
of this findings.

855
00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:40.480 
i'm not sure which part of the quotes may or may not have been coded or

856
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:41.880 
had not been to review this

857
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:46.100 
paper, before it was published but there were some tensions about like the

858
00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:49.950 
is addressing like the design of this test question maybe kind

859
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:53.140 
of missing this broader point of there are these broader systemic

860
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:58.260 
oppressions that exists and addressing like test bias like.

861
00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:01.420 
it may feea band-aid to a much broader

862
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.010 
problem which we totally acknowledge.

863
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.190 
i'll permit ask a question.

864
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:13.240 
can you hear me or see oh.

865
00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:17.680 
benjy nice presentation. yeah, i think.

866
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:21.010 
you have some nice data that confirms some of the things that we know

867
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:24.120 
are intuitively. you know, it's kind of nice to back that up. by

868
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:27.670 
doing this analysis i was wondering you know, have

869
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:29.820 
you thought about like what kind of interventions, could we

870
00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.460 
explore you know at any level is it like tools,

871
00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.260 
or like pedagogical approaches like

872
00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.490 
you know how do we remove despise clearly? it is a big problem,

873
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:42.950 
so if you have any insights and thoughts?  yeah yeah. i think

874
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:46.410 
the kind of the first thing i say is like i personally don't

875
00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:49.200 
know which is why i'm like super excited to be continuing this

876
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.850 
partnership with code.org, because the next step here is working

877
00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:55.320 
with the curriculum designers. and also just talking with the

878
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.500 
teachers and perhaps even students try to understand like, hey

879
00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:02.820 
this is what this data suggests, what do you think we can

880
00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.700 
do about it because i think there's things that can be done

881
00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:09.910 
like at the test design curriculum design as well as in the professional learning setting.

882
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.670 
just because code org has this unique opportunity where they

883
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:15.710 
control the curriculum as well as professional learning.

884
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:19.040 
but at the end of the day there's obviously a lot of factors

885
00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:22.860 
that are kind of like societal and beyond the scope of like

886
00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:28.130 
what may happen in a classroom.
so it is thinking about i think there are like

887
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:33.450 
equitable interventions and then also longer harder discussions

888
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.610 
related to more like systemic justice that

889
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:40.660 
i don't think a couple tweaks to a curriculum design here and there will

890
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.280 
truly address. so it's a trap some equitable interventions through

891
00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:48.690 
working with the domain experts and then also

892
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.260 
broader discussions about like what a more just learning experience looks like.

893
00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:57.370 
certainly i think,
there's a lot of interesting things that could be explored.

894
00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.580 
thank you, thank you question.

895
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.470 
really did you want to ask a follow- up?

896
00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:06.330 
yes possible.

897
00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:12.810 
yes. super great presentation and the land grant. and i

898
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.190 
thank you so much for that especially work equitable

899
00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:20.040 
around equity diversity and inclusion.

900
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:24.710 
so my question is, i'm wondering because this was with code.org

901
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:28.550 
data, and so in some ways it's kind of an extracurricular

902
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:32.440 
kind of activity of those who participate in it, and so what

903
00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:36.030 
do you think for you talk about ts and like the fact that this

904
00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:38.610 
differential like that's we're looking as far as the questions

905
00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:42.120 
and those high states test what do you think are the findings that

906
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:47.490 
they can use for their question questions of something that's more high stakes?

907
00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:52.330 
it's kind of yeah, yeah so i'll say can two things one code.orgs

908
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.820 
certainly known for their our code they put a lot of effort

909
00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.520 
into that. but the data we analyzed was actually like about

910
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.890 
like a traditional like term like a quarter semester long course.

911
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:05.330 
so it is supposed to be like a curriculum. this was the data

912
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.690 
was collected pre pandemic.

913
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.810 
and i guess related to ets. it's a very different context because

914
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:15.900 
ets is very their vat they're committed to making sure

915
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:20.390 
their test scores are valid for use of like for kind of like high stakes use.

916
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.780 
so they are very much like

917
01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:25.910 
their test questions are top secret their exact scoring is

918
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:28.150 
top secret except for like  they're like their trusted

919
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:29.670 
circle of people that they consult,

920
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.310 
whereas code ord everything is open there's all those there's

921
01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:35.810 
certainly arguments made that these questions are over exposed,

922
01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:38.340 
because it's the same questions being used over and over. it's

923
01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.920 
not actually hard to find the answers answer guides online or check

924
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:45.900 
the answers online unfortunately. so just a very different context.

925
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.750 
but i think there's an opportunity because with this openness

926
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.420 
comes an opportunity to engage the stakeholders that a company

927
01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.930 
like mts would have a lot harder time doing so, because they

928
01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:59.810 
have to keep the exposure of their items so

929
01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.730 
so secret. so to speak, so i think just like a with this openness

930
01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:06.470 
comes this opportunity to engage more people.

931
01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:09.790 
but yes i guess to answer your question specifically for like, if i

932
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:12.570 
talk to somebody from bts. it's just like how do you engage

933
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:16.490 
more stakeholders recognizing that you are working in a much more constrained problem

934
01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.290 
than a researcher in a nonprofit group is.

935
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.360 
i think we have time for one more question.

936
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.470 
i saw ken had a hand up.

937
01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:31.540 
i don't want to always be asking questions, but i always have

938
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.540 
them because these talks are great. oh

939
01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:38.100 
ben, it's great talk. and i'm really glad you're bringing psychometric

940
01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.400 
techniques to learning at scale, because

941
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:44.830 
i think there is a lot of work that's been done on that.

942
01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.740 
it seems worth highlighting and i think you made this point, but

943
01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.230 
i just want to be sure because when diff is found the bias

944
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:54.070 
may not be in the test per se right?

945
01:01:55.290 --> 01:02:00.310 
the bias could be for example in the differences in learning opportunities

946
01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.420 
historically that lead to what might actually be real

947
01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:08.990 
meaningful and important differences especially with respect to

948
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:13.580 
your goal of thinking about how to improve curriculum going forward.

949
01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:15.810 
i wonder if you could

950
01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:20.870 
say more about that particular line of hypothesizing to look at the

951
01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:24.400 
potential differences in the history of

952
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.020 
students' learning opportunities.

953
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:29.750 
yeah, yeah i think so.

954
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.260 
thanks for a question. and yeah i guess i'll begin with definitely

955
01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:37.930 
like i use the shorthand re-use DIF and test bias interchangeably,

956
01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:42.280 
but diff is evidence the more nuanced diff is evidence of potential

957
01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.900 
bias. and diff might not even be a bad thing.

958
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.390 
there's a classic example within european nursing assessments

959
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:54.840 
that there are questions that consistently disadvantage against reported male test-takers,

960
01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:58.730 
and those are often questions related to babies in early childhood

961
01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:02.250 
taking care of infants, and the consistently they've looked

962
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.390 
at these questions and say this is knowledge that it's very

963
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:05.920 
important that a nurse should have.

964
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:09.410 
but there are some societal biases related to

965
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.090 
child rearing that like where that societal bias exists in

966
01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:17.200 
this question. but in the assessment that they keep it.
because it's an

967
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.380 
important knowledge to have. so it's one of those like there

968
01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.880 
might be diff and you could just find.

969
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:24.980 
so we need to keep it there.
perhaps there's something we change about the

970
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:28.680 
the preparation or training. but yeah i think

971
01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:33.090 
ryan baker and his colleagues recently put out a really great paper on

972
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:40.170 
bias in algorithmic bias in education brunel. so i think

973
01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.950 
also has a paper out somewhat recently about that as well.

974
01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:47.550 
but i use a kind of at a high level as a framing from the

975
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:52.060 
older one about bias in computer system from botti friedman which is that.

976
01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.370 
there are these pre-existing biases that exist regardless of what we do.

977
01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.830 
there are technical biases that we introduce whether through

978
01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:01.230 
learning experiences we create or systems that we create.

979
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.850 
and then there's these emergent biases which is the intersection

980
01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:08.020 
of the pre-existing biases with the new technical system and

981
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.470 
these emergent biases we really can't design for because kind

982
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:14.340 
of by definition they emerge. so i think it's a constant question

983
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.310 
of like we should work really hard to design equitably.

984
01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:20.900 
but we also have to realize that it doesn't end at déploiement.

985
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:24.390 
we have to be constantly checking and iterating.
so i wish i could say like

986
01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.580 
kind of like same thing for like validity we wish things to

987
01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:29.610 
just be valid in one shot we got it. but it's this constant

988
01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:32.160 
process of like how do we continue developing evidence to say

989
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.110 
that this is a fair use of this instrument or the score's.

990
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.430 
great. let me thank ben once more for his work and

991
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:45.590 
the questions and for bringing it to letting it scale.

992
01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:50.620 
and that brings us to the final presentation of the session

993
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.440 
which will be presented by ray j.

994
01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.870 
and i am obligated to mention that this work was nominated

995
01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:02.790 
for a best paper award which feels very weird, because

996
01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:04.910 
i'm on it and i'm chairing the session myself, but

997
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.490 
good job ray j and and hannah. so with that i'll let you present live,

998
01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:15.170 
and then we'll have twelve minutes or so for questions at the end.

999
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:23.250 
thanks René, so however one my name is RenZhe YU,

1000
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.860 
appear to come to university of california irvine.

1001
01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:30.900 
this paper title should college of prediction models include protected attributes

1002
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:34.700 
i mister clapper is a collaborator for from the future funny lab

1003
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:37.390 
university with hensley and a professor and.

1004
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.850 
so in higher education it has been a long term long-time challenge to keep

1005
01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:48.440 
a degree seeking students on track and complete. this flawed

1006
01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.370 
simply showed that the overall graduation and retention rates

1007
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:56.190 
in the us over the past decade, which tells us that over a fifth

1008
01:05:56.190 --> 01:06:00.210 
of freshmen would drop out just after their first year of enrollment

1009
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:03.950 
and nearly a half of them will not eventually graduate. and

1010
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:06.830 
these figures are even worse for students from more disadvantaged

1011
01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:10.820 
backgrounds, such as those who wrote or wrote at two-year community colleges.

1012
01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:15.880 
on the other hand it is a kind of a global issue that their

1013
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.120 
limited financial and human resources and institutions which

1014
01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.990 
make it challenging to take preventive actions that are timely

1015
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:26.050 
and targeted at the right students.

1016
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.440 
in this context coupled with the increasing use of digital technologies on campus,

1017
01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:37.330 
data assisted drop- a prediction has rapid growth not only at

1018
01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:41.080 
a course level but at the institutional level as well. and this

1019
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.990 
is then such as the core signals that produce the gps advise network

1020
01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:49.610 
stay in the site use various they use various student records

1021
01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:53.350 
to predict whether a student will drop out of a course or a program.

1022
01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:56.950 
and then instructors academic advisors and others

1023
01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:03.550 
can more efficiently identify students need and invested invest the appropriate resources.

1024
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.620 
to accurately identify who might be dropping out, especially

1025
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:12.880 
at an early stage, a controversial issue is whether the underlying

1026
01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.530 
predictive model should include protected attributes which

1027
01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:20.390 
by definition are characteristics based on which discrimination

1028
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:22.150 
is prescribed as illegal.

1029
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:26.230 
the public attention to structural racism since the last year

1030
01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.850 
has also put a spotlight on this issue in education as discussed

1031
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:33.730 
in this recent blogpost from Simon.BuckinghamShum.

1032
01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:42.060 
so the controversy exists, because for one thing including protected

1033
01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.610 
attributes can capture systematic inequalities in the educational

1034
01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:49.060 
environment of different student different student groups in the past

1035
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:52.590 
which may well apply to future students from the same group.

1036
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:57.210 
on the other hand historical stigmas and stereotypes could

1037
01:07:57.210 --> 01:08:01.460 
carry over to future students and reproduce existing inequalities

1038
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:04.600 
when the predictions are used for real world actions.

1039
01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:10.070 
in this context we try to examine the inclusion of protected

1040
01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.030 
attributes in college dropout production in the real world setting

1041
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:18.210 
and evaluate how this inclusion affects the overall performance

1042
01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.390 
and the fairness of the predictions.

1043
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.930 
specifically we construct a model

1044
01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.960 
to predict drop-out after the first year for over a one hundred

1045
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.930 
thousand online and residential students at a us university over seven years.

1046
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.170 
this university is a public hispanic service institution which

1047
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:43.270 
means that it is brought access to this to students within the state

1048
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.790 
and serves a high proportion of students from minority groups,

1049
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.610 
such as ethnic minorities first generation found

1050
01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:52.320 
first generation students.

1051
01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.790 
the predictors we use include four protected attributes, gender

1052
01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.930 
first generation college student status,

1053
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:05.920 
indicator for underrepresented ethnic minority, and indicator for financial need.

1054
01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:10.910 
other predictors include incoming characteristics such as economic history,

1055
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.340 
and student college records in their first semester.

1056
01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.880 
we separately try two prediction algorithms.

1057
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.310 
logistic regression which is more interpretable and greater

1058
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:30.280 
great impostor trees which is more complicated and supposedly better performing.

1059
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.780 
as in the actual use case we use historical data to train the

1060
01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:37.250 
model and test on the most recent cohort.

1061
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.680 
three metrics are used to evaluate the different aspects of the

1062
01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.190 
prediction performance.

1063
01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:49.640 
for each algorithm and in roman format we train two identical models

1064
01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:52.310 
one with all four protected attributes

1065
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:57.210 
which we call aware model, and one without them which we call blind.

1066
01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.700 
in this table we report the performance of each model by the three metrics.

1067
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:06.100 
and the difference between the two models in the delta column.

1068
01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:10.570 
here we see that for example for online drop-out prediction

1069
01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:14.510 
with great implicit trees. the protected attributes do not have

1070
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:15.710 
much of an influence.

1071
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:19.720 
and actually this is the same case for all other scenarios.

1072
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:25.170 
for the more important fairness piece we see for we define

1073
01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:29.290 
fairness as where the model trained on the population has equal

1074
01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:34.010 
performance on different subgroups which is also known as equality

1075
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:35.450 
of opportunity in the literature.

1076
01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:40.570 
so we compare the prediction performance for each pair of protected attributes

1077
01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.860 
and in this plot we plot the performance difference for each comparison.

1078
01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:50.810 
for example this little part shows that the male students are

1079
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:54.390 
suffering marginally low predicts lower prediction accuracy

1080
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:58.290 
than female students in both aware and blind models.

1081
01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:02.620 
and more importantly this difference is similar between these

1082
01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:06.410 
two models which speaks to the influence of including versus

1083
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:10.510 
absolute excluding protected attributes which is the focus of this study.

1084
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:15.710 
extrapolating to all different scenarios and metrics the overall pattern

1085
01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:18.180 
is that while there are performance

1086
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.280 
differences between protected attributes in most cases.

1087
01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:26.770 
this fairness or bias or bias level is not much affected by

1088
01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:29.590 
the inclusion or exclusion of protected attributes.

1089
01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:35.920 
because the final prediction results are gotten by the economizing

1090
01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.270 
the raw predictive probabilities would take a step further

1091
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:43.830 
to examine whether the from models place students differently

1092
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:46.590 
on the raw probabilities doctrine.

1093
01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:52.190 
we then plot the distribution of ranking change for different student groups

1094
01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:58.080 
as an example of how to interpret is plots.
on this left plot shows that

1095
01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.820 
after including protected attributes from line to a where.

1096
01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:06.970 
female students are assigned higher probabilities higher

1097
01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:11.620 
female students are assigned higher dropout probabilities than male students

1098
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:17.050 
as we see that as we see that their probability distribution

1099
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:20.240 
is more skewed to the right. what this means is that

1100
01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.340 
after we check the true drop out  rates on the

1101
01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:30.640 
aware model tries to close the existing gaps in this predictions, because

1102
01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.790 
they're assigning higher probabilities of

1103
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.490 
drop out for those that are having actual actually lower probabilities

1104
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:39.240 
in the dataset.

1105
01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:45.510 
actually this behavior holds true across all scenarios

1106
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:49.070 
wherever you see remarkable differences in all of these sub-plots.

1107
01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:52.220 
there are somewhat large existing gaps

1108
01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.070 
in the actual drop out rates.

1109
01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:01.450 
given the controversy between capturing historical inequalities

1110
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:05.460 
and reinforcing stigmas when it comes to including protected attributes

1111
01:13:05.970 --> 01:13:09.740 
we think that this behavior is actually making positive contributions

1112
01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.900 
to fairness and equity of the drop out predictions.

1113
01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:18.530 
so overall our results suggest that including protected attributes

1114
01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.910 
has a marginal contribution to fairness although that contribution

1115
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:26.270 
is too small to change the final decision of the models

1116
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:31.190 
four from here we still recommend that we still recommend including

1117
01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:34.570 
these protected attributes for drop out prediction in the wild.

1118
01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:39.540 
in order to respect structural inequalities in the existing higher education system.

1119
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:44.030 
and actually the institution we examined does a decent job

1120
01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:50.160 
of closing existing inequalities in drop out as reflected by somewhat smaller

1121
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:53.350 
gaps in the actual dropout rates

1122
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.190 
in cases with more pronounced demographic gaps and dropout rates.

1123
01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:00.550 
the marginal marginal contribution we identified might well

1124
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:02.550 
turn into significant benefits.

1125
01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:08.470 
in addition our visual approach presents a flexible way of

1126
01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:13.190 
auditing fairness along multiple dimensions with regard to multiple protective attributes.

1127
01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:17.590 
this is especially useful given that  the fairness goal

1128
01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.370 
is eventually dependent on the specific application scenario.

1129
01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.970 
finally our comprehensive analysis reveals the general challenge of

1130
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.160 
accurately predicting drop-out using standard institutional records

1131
01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:33.650 
which is reflected in the not so

1132
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:41.810 
performance in our analysis and actually many other previous studies as well.

1133
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:45.230 
therefore we also called for more research on improving the

1134
01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:48.570 
fairness of drop-out predictions empowered by both decades

1135
01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:51.720 
of higher education research and cutting edge algorithms.

1136
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.080 
so that's it for the presentation and you can check more technical details

1137
01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:00.930 
in our paper. and thank you we welcome any questions and comments.

1138
01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.250 
thank you for the great presentation and

1139
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.470 
please raise your hand if you have a question or posted in

1140
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:13.840 
the chat. i see we've got one raised hand

1141
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.880 
and could you ask the first question

1142
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:27.110 
can you hear me now?

1143
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:33.860 
sorry hello jackie can you ok ok i thank you so much for the presentation

1144
01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:38.630 
and basically i have two questions the first whys

1145
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:45.550 
what is the distribution of the protected attributes

1146
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:48.650 
data and my second question is,

1147
01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.920 
what is the reason behind you choose the

1148
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:58.090 
logistic regression model and also the agreed in both tree ?

1149
01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:04.740 
is  therefore a interpretability or and why don't you choose any

1150
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.680 
for example a deep learning based model for prediction, thank you.

1151
01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:15.410 
ok thank you for questions. so for the first question.

1152
01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.490 
we have a table in the paper but now i don't have a screen

1153
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:22.570 
to pull that table, but overall this institution, because it's a

1154
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:28.740 
large proportion of no students from disadvantaged backgrounds actually all those

1155
01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.680 
identifiers for all those identifiers for disadvantaged background, like you know

1156
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:37.170 
represent minority for rich college students or students who

1157
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:40.270 
are in financial need. they're pretty high in the data set. they

1158
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:43.840 
can account for mostly california thirty to forty percent of

1159
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.090 
the total student population.

1160
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:48.090 
so that's your response to your first question.

1161
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:54.590 
and in terms of second question, so overall our goal is not

1162
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:56.280 
really to say ok we tried

1163
01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:00.520 
with us whether this cutting edge algorithm performs better than the other.

1164
01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:06.420 
there is our focus is on whether including this protected attributes

1165
01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:09.960 
would make a difference on the prediction up on the prediction outcomes.

1166
01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:13.360 
so a kind of like choose like to commonly used

1167
01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:19.190 
like probably probably among the most commonly used algorithms

1168
01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:24.120 
as the one representing the class of algorithms that are more interpretable, and one

1169
01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:29.190 
representing the more complicated less interpretable algorithms, but no

1170
01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.200 
which are better

1171
01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.250 
performing.

1172
01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.880 
great our as see another question from ido.

1173
01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:48.460 
great thanks i question that i apologize if i missed something.

1174
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:52.300 
i wonder about the differences in their predictive models.

1175
01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:56.640 
because i wonder what proxies replaced the

1176
01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:01.500 
sensitive criteria that you took out, and were there essentially

1177
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.890 
the ones where had similar performance, because i just found

1178
01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:08.170 
really strong proxies that mean the same thing but just are

1179
01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:09.150 
not labeled the same.

1180
01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:13.300 
so which bible's came up when you took somethings out.

1181
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:19.260 
so that's a good question.

1182
01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.610 
so i'm not sure about the

1183
01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.960 
specific range of variables you're asking about,

1184
01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.940 
cause for this study we're focusing on the cluster of all the

1185
01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:36.210 
other four productive attributes. for since no including versus exclude them

1186
01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.130 
we didn't really tap onto the specific effect of

1187
01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.870 
each of these variables. so i think that's that would be that

1188
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:49.140 
would be an interesting extension that we looked to see and also

1189
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:52.400 
not only for these four productive attributes, but for other

1190
01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:59.370 
predictors in the model as well to examine the effect of individual

1191
01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.000 
predictors. thanks.

1192
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:09.540 
just one thing to add to that is that it wasn't anything else

1193
01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.560 
was taken out. we did check whether all the other variables

1194
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.280 
could explain the variables that were taken out and how much

1195
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.970 
those variables themselves explain. and at the end of the day

1196
01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:21.580 
even though we know there are achievement gaps along many of

1197
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.290 
those dimensions, they're well established but in terms of predictive power

1198
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:28.650 
they're a drop in the bucket compared to most of the other

1199
01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:32.170 
variables that are available in these models and so. yeah what

1200
01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:34.940 
i'm curious about is how

1201
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:40.290 
you paid good attention to the impact that using these features

1202
01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:43.870 
has on the way we label people and we talk about

1203
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:49.980 
systematic biases etcetera. now maybe by removing these protective features in.

1204
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.560 
and loading their information and other features,

1205
01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.010 
we actually describe this language.

1206
01:19:56.830 --> 01:20:00.290 
yeah and and read the discussion that's good bad. and then

1207
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:03.710 
what's interesting is to see which other features actually take the load.

1208
01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:07.670 
because maybe there's other groups that we should identify more attention to,

1209
01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.880 
so if there's another feature that carries a lot of the load.

1210
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.750 
maybe we should pay more attention to what's going on there,

1211
01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:17.770 
and look for this for systematic discrimination biases along

1212
01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:19.150 
these features that were left in.

1213
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:25.180 
yeah i think they responded a little bit to that in our paper we have

1214
01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:30.330 
we actually do some like checks on whether all the other predictors

1215
01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:31.270 
in the entire

1216
01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:38.710 
encode not the four protected attributes, because if they encode information

1217
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:43.650 
on all of these group grouping variables i went actually when

1218
01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:48.180 
i actually removing the the protective science in the blind. now we

1219
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.410 
do some no formal checks on them. but overall we've

1220
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:57.990 
found marginal evidence i think there's only one of the four

1221
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.420 
protect attributes which is gender i believe. the

1222
01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:09.060 
wise only know if we use all other predictors to predict his four

1223
01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:13.670 
protect attributes separately. and only one model has something like predictive

1224
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:16.040 
power, which means saying that these four groups

1225
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:20.390 
are somewhat like independent of other variables we include

1226
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.920 
was great work. and great presentation and actually one of my

1227
01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.450 
colleague she was in their stanford research group.

1228
01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:38.020 
she did some study looking at students performance gaps in

1229
01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:41.580 
introductory stem courses and it turned out that that demographic

1230
01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:46.020 
gap really got washed become insignificant when you add in the incoming preparation.

1231
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:50.190 
so i'm curious in your model where you had the other variables

1232
01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:52.920 
like incoming preparation college GPA. and

1233
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:57.570 
i don't know what are the other variables that end up being

1234
01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:02.040 
the significant predictors and what which one has the most

1235
01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.840 
effect in predicting the dropout.

1236
01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:08.700 
thank you for the question. so here we have a list of all the

1237
01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.240 
variables there but i think most of the variables you mention

1238
01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.840 
are included in the model and the non-productive attribute

1239
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:19.440 
predictors. we didn't really like no specific

1240
01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.390 
look at the predictive power of every single

1241
01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:28.030 
predictor which was not nice especially for the non-productive attributes,

1242
01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:35.340 
not necessarily the focus of the study say

1243
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.810 
no we didn't check the relationship with drop out, but there are

1244
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:44.670 
some of them are having some you know demographic differences

1245
01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:50.390 
like me but like what i respond to to either like that

1246
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:54.330 
the  relationship between demographic variables and these

1247
01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:58.590 
other predictors are somewhat weak in our dataset.  which i know is

1248
01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:03.340 
johnny not a case in a lot of institutional settings is overall

1249
01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:08.450 
we do observe a lot of like demographic inequalities in the past,
so yeah.  Yang Kun ?

1250
01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:20.620 
oh okay yeah just a follow- up question.

1251
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:27.100 
a clarification question, yeah i wonder when you

1252
01:23:27.710 --> 01:23:33.480 
exclude the protect. i mean the protected attributes

1253
01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:39.750 
or did you just exclude them or you'll replace them with some are,

1254
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:41.500 
for example the mean,

1255
01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:45.710 
i mean replace the whole attribute with the same value

1256
01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:51.100 
a what is your master then always simply remove them, but i

1257
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.650 
think you know that the other the attorney of approach that you mention were

1258
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:58.250 
essentially what would be essentially equivalent.

1259
01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:01.480 
ok, thank you.

1260
01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:07.940 
then removing them all one thing it doesn't really add to any prediction

1261
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:09.080 
power.

1262
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:19.010 
great i think if there are no other questions. and i don't see any

1263
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:23.690 
and thanks karen for sharing she must paper.

1264
01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:29.220 
that will conclude this fantastic session i want to thank all of the

1265
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.640 
speakers today for a great set of presentations.

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.950 
Congratulations you have made it. This is the end of the section

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.170 
on how to write efficient programs and how to produce efficient hopefully sustainable code.

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.720 
Let us wrap up the section with a quick recap.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.770 
The journey of writing efficient programs starts with choosing

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.560 
the right technology for the right purpose.

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.990 
There are different aspects to consider and speed and efficiency

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.690 
is only one of them. To find a good compromise especially with

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.060 
regard to the programming language.

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.820 
With regard to architecture find a good compromise between

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.270 
understandability and maintainability of your code,

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.920 
and speed and efficiency on the other hand.

12
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.780 
Aim at structuring your application as modular as possible

13
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.850 
to improve scalability and therefore also efficiency.

14
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.150 
Think about where physically it makes most sense to compute what.

15
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.210 
Always be aware of the computational complexity of the applications,

16
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.020 
especially with very high level languages, think about what

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.680 
a simple looking one line function call may cause in the background under the hood.

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.850 
Use a cache to keep values that don't change

19
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.490 
and always choose appropriate data structures.

20
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.810 
Lists for instance are the most obvious but not always the best choice.

21
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.010 
With regard to optimizing application for storage and network usage,

22
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.760 
make sure to only take what you really need.

23
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.180 
Have more than just one quick thought about caching and compression

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.960 
and utilize the create development tooling out there.

25
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.930 
Overall with regard to sustainable programming a rule of thumb

26
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.390 
is to keep the eighty twenty principle in mind.

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.610 
What I mean by this is, while developing you should always have

28
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.460 
the technical efficiency of your code in mind and this includes

29
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.120 
every stage of your development process, however also don't

30
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.990 
try to over engineer things or optimize every little detail as it just

31
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.990 
may not be worth the effort.

32
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.330 
Because remember resource efficiency is more than just the

33
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.810 
efficiency of your code.

34
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.790 
Thanks a lot for following along. We hope that you have enjoyed

35
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.960 
the section as much as we did, and hopefully you have learned

36
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.160 
a few things about efficient and sustainable code. Thank you.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.250 
When we consider digital identities
in our openHPI course, we have

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.680 
also to think about the online service
and the data these online services are

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.060 
collecting. Of course we said the
digital identities, these are

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.550 
a number of attributes that need
to be stored with the service to

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.900 
recognise us, to remember us. But this
data, also the service also collects data

6
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.930 
to provide a better service, to give
the answers we are looking for

7
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.140 
in different ways. And in this way
a number of data are stored

8
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.940 
together with our digital
identity, or stored

9
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
that the service knows
more and more about us.

10
00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.180 
And this is a question what can the
service do with this data and

11
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.890 
how we are secured or protected that the
data the services are not misusing.

12
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.190 
For example selling
our data. So for the

13
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.190 
consumer protection there are
different laws which allow the users

14
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.990 
more transparency. In Europe this is a
Digital Data Protection Regulation,

15
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.590 
the GDPR and in USA it's the California, for
example in US, in California,

16
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.700 
there is a California Consumer
Privacy Act. So in the different

17
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.590 
states there are different
such regulations.

18
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.040 
And this regulations give the
consumer some rights - rights to know

19
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.670 
at least to know what personal data
are stored with the service and

20
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.010 
how the service is using

21
00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:02.130 
this data. And of course the user
is also allowed to request that

22
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.420 
his personal data
are deleted.

23
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.340 
Consumers may also request a
copy of their stored data.

24
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.380 
A copy of that in a common electronic
form that they really have the chance

25
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.920 
to understand what kind
of data are stored,

26
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.130 
the data that is stored by the
user and the data that is stored

27
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.500 
about the user when the
user is using the service.

28
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.270 
So let's start with looking at some
examples. And we begin with looking

29
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.890 
to Google. In Google there is a
service takeout.google.com

30
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.990 
and here the user can see the
data of google services

31
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.000 
which are stored, personal data which
are stored with the services.

32
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.170 
There are, by the way, more than fifty one
different google products which are covered

33
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.190 
and it depends a little bit
out when you ask

34
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.390 
which data are stored in the
service from the product and

35
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.220 
which is affected and ranges sometimes
in a very short time, the

36
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.330 
data can present to you
sometimes it needs a day.

37
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.440 
For example there are data stored by
the user in the calendar, in gmail,

38
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.310 
in google drive and there are data
stored by the users themselves

39
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.390 
and there are also data stored
about the users, what activity

40
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.770 
he is doing or what's
the location history

41
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.510 
in the gmail service, what
is the payment history

42
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.580 
of this person. So
a lot of data

43
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.640 
are collected by the services to
provide the service in the right way

44
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.870 
but also to know, to better
know the user and

45
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.900 
to eventually see what the user could
be interested to make some offers.

46
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.480 
So if we look to
my activity,

47
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.020 
here for example in youtube
or in search or gmail,

48
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.170 
then one gets such
kind of information.

49
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:34.030 
So here for example I watched this
in youtube this video exactly

50
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.170 
on this date in that time and
it was a usage of youtube.

51
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.730 
Or here it's an email. So
there was a search for HPI

52
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.020 
this was done in July
and this was

53
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.460 
eventually to send an email.
So what has been searched, when

54
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.440 
it has been searched and in which
google product it was searched

55
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.910 
this kind of information they
are presented to the user.

56
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.070 
If we look to google maps here, then
one can reveal a lot about the user.

57
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.100 
Here is his
movement through the

58
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:29.520 
world. So it is clear because here as
in most cases the localisation sees that

59
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.650 
the user is walking or staying.
So then it's possible for

60
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.810 
the service to conclude
the user lives in Berlin.

61
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.100 
Here are for example travelling
by train connection to

62
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.920 
come to another place.

63
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:54.180 
One sees then for a while that the user
was staying in Münster. So the

64
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.950 
visit of Münster, all
this kind of data

65
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.820 
can be revealed out of a location
service, a location service in a car,

66
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.110 
a location service in a smartphone,
so all our movements are tracked.

67
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.030 
It is necessary to do this
because it's a car and the

68
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.080 
service wants to show us the route and
so the service needs exactly to know

69
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.610 
where you are. So with a smartphone
you want to get a call

70
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.060 
whatever place you are, so the
service exactly needs to know

71
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.130 
where you are.

72
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.000 
Similar with google pay. Here
it's payment information that

73
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.550 
is collected. So for example here
with google pay, it was used

74
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.920 
to attempt a contactless payment
at a certain place with the

75
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.620 
data, with the product, with the location,
with the details, the price

76
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.590 
and when this was and connecting
this information with google maps

77
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.220 
gives exactly the information -
it was here in a

78
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.040 
shop in the Berliner
street in Berlin.

79
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:19.180 
So it is easy to connect these data,
to learn more about the person

80
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.390 
and in that way persons need at
least to have the right to

81
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.700 
see what data are available, what data
are in the hand of the services

82
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.360 
and the user need also to
have the chance to say stop,

83
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.010 
I want to have
my data deleted.

84
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:44.280 
For the services on the other side many
such services make a second business

85
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.270 
by selling this data, in particular if
this is a service that is cost free.

86
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.210 
Let's have a look to another
example to facebook, facebook.com

87
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.790 
and your personal
information.

88
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:07.570 
This shows the relations between friends
and this relation is not available,

89
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.840 
it's harder for competitors to use
a data take out. Here we have

90
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18.590 
by the user we have the posts, the comments,
the pictures he stored the data

91
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.160 
and the facebook knows about the data,
knows about the user, about his login,

92
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:31.610 
about his or her search history
and of facebook activities.

93
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:39.190 
And also here you can get information
about your data. For example

94
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:46.460 
session update, with which IP address
and which browser and which cookies

95
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.580 
the session was started and also
of facebook activities

96
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:59.050 
can be seen because other websites
share their data with facebook. Here

97
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.860 
for example with the
newspaper FAZ.

98
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:11.680 
Fitbit - fitbit another service. Fitbit
stores all data in a cloud. Here are

99
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:19.020 
how you move about, all your activities,
the sleeping heart rate,

100
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.640 
the restlessness. So a
lot of physical data

101
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.210 
are stored about
a person, are

102
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:34.570 
shown to the person. But at the end
are on the side of the service.

103
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:42.650 
Due to the consumer protection laws,
these data has to be made available

104
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:51.210 
to the user. So this includes data
that has been stored about users

105
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:58.630 
but hidden behind a paywall. For
such data it's also, the

106
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:03.380 
user has a right to see this. Here
you see such information.

107
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.210 
The request duration if you ask
the service to send you the data,

108
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.420 
then you have to wait
a number of days.

109
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.430 
On the one side it's not so easy to
access the data, on the other side

110
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.290 
the services are not
too much interested

111
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.410 
to show you the data
they have about you.

112
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.560 
Tinder - another service in the
internet. All messages and in

113
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.700 
particular all activities
are stored with tinder.

114
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:42.260 
So opening the app, sending
a message all is stored.

115
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.710 
Such swipes, likes
or pass or matches

116
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.890 
all is known to
the tinder

117
00:10:51.890 --> 00:11:00.140 
service and then of course tinder can
make proposals to you, tinder can

118
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:07.640 
conclude things, tinder can sell data
to other service providers. They

119
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.760 
have very very personal
information in their hand.

120
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:19.410 
So data inquiry - there are many
different sources and formats.

121
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.800 
So open source tools are
available for the visualization

122
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:32.150 
of these data. Beware, keep an eye
that these tools don't reuse

123
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.720 
don't monetize
your data

124
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.860 
particularly if this
data are freely available, if this

125
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.630 
services and software
is freely available,

126
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.360 
then you have to ask yourself how
they could finance this service.

127
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:56.420 
And there is a big possibility that
the the service is financed by

128
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.960 
the data the service has
collected about its customers.

129
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:08.170 
It's also interesting what can
be discovered about services.

130
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:14.010 
When you are asked to give you
an overview about your data,

131
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.280 
you see and will be surprised how
many things they have stored

132
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.750 
and you had no
idea about it.

133
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:27.740 
So what did you find out about
your data? Please check with

134
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:33.120 
the services you are using, find this
functionality and get a feeling

135
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.350 
for the amount of data
and the specific

136
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.340 
which specific data are stored
with the different services. Ask

137
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.410 
yourself what is necessary, ask
yourself whether it's worse

138
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.290 
to give so much data to a
service compared to

139
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:58.470 
compared to what a service
brings for advantages to you.

140
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.760 
So it's really very important to
be centralized about the data

141
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.430 
collection of
online services.

1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.749 
Let us summarise our thoughts about privacy in

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.780 
the new world, which is characterised by the

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.485 
possibilities, by the possibilities that is provided by

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.519 
the digital technologies.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.041 
We leave digital traces, this is what we saw in all the contributions

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.199 
in that week, we leave digital traces as soon as

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.149 
we are using digital services, digital instruments.

8
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.490 
So, we leave traces, for example, with our movement data, the

9
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.929 
mobile tracking, otherwise, these services will not

10
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.982 
work that help us, for example, to show our routes when we

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.499 
are walking or driving.

12
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.678 
The Wi-Fi data, the fitness trackers with GPS

13
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.549 
connections, the RFID, all such devices

14
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.906 
produce movement data which tell us where we

15
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.689 
are in which moment.

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.219 
Shopping, shopping leaves a lot of digital traces.

17
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
The bonus systems which are offers, various cards,

18
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.410 
credit cards, other cards, price comparison

19
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.069 
portals that are visited by the people.

20
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.037 
All this data,

21
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.358 
it tells something what we are doing, what for, what

22
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.740 
we spend, our money, what articles of interest.

23
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.332 
Also, when we do some activity in

24
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.574 
the health area, a lot of data is produced and

25
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.930 
it can be collected. For example, the usage of this fitness trackers

26
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.269 
as a usage of smart watches pedometers in

27
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.590 
the smartphone, they tell a lot about our health,

28
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.489 
about our fitness, about what we

29
00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.339 
know, about our activities, what we are doing and how we are feeling.

30
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.229 
And what the data are, what kind of data are collected

31
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.574 
in that moment when we are doing some activity?

32
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.789 
Our files, our emails tell

33
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.709 
a lot about ourselves, and all these files and emails

34
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.629 
are stored in various cloud systems are stored

35
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.949 
in the email system. And who gets access to this?

36
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.071 
You can get a lot of data about us, but

37
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.399 
this is not enough. We leave the child raises also when we communicate

38
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.229 
with our friends. This is a very big and

39
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.999 
large data producing thing, the usage

40
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.999 
of social networks, email providers.

41
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.038 
I already mentioned the voice over IP services like from Skype

42
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.990 
and others. The synchronisation of connected in our smartphones

43
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.999 
synchronisation means the data are stored in the

44
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.389 
in the cloud so that they can be back up and us.

45
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.229 
So when we think

46
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.990 
in the area of smart homes, then the presence and the activities

47
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.539 
in such a smart home, it gives a lot of information about us, the smart

48
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.289 
home devices, smart home metres, smart

49
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.990 
TVs and others, but also if we use browser and

50
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.031 
then a lot can be found out about our interests, how we use

51
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.719 
the Internet, what we are interested in, what kind of services we are interested search

52
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.610 
engine, Facebook, Twitter and other elements and webpages, data retention.

53
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.319 
All this gives and tells something about us

54
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.069 
in very fine grained details.

55
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.740 
So the question is.

56
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.289 
What is critical?

57
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.509 
The question is that many of us collect the data.

58
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.158 
Of course, is necessary. Otherwise the service could not be of

59
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.629 
us the operation of the various service.

60
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.990 
It could not done. And the users like the service, they

61
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.970 
loads of service to their smartphone, for example, to count

62
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.149 
the number of steps to see whether they have enough movement.

63
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.040 
So many of the collect the data need to be

64
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.339 
produced and need to be available to the service provider.

65
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.750 
Otherwise service provider could not offer the service.

66
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.920 
So mobile tracking is an essential feature for any

67
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.439 
mobile network. If the mobile network does not know where I am,

68
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.179 
then they cannot connect me to another.

69
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.189 
Do not connect the telephone call to another person.

70
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.420 
So the storage of customer and transaction data for cash payments

71
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.729 
are necessary. Of course, for security reasons, the cloud service facilitate

72
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.474 
back up and restore data as well as collaborate over the

73
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.970 
Internet. And this needs that they have access to certain data.

74
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.109 
Social networks enable us to communicate in a very convenient

75
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.690 
way with friends, but they produce a lot of data.

76
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.360 
And the problem is that often the privacy violation

77
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.740 
becomes a problem through a correlation of said data

78
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.360 
to correlation of the data from different sources.

79
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.783 
So, for example, an employee and employer knows

80
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.709 
the salary of a person and knows his address, the person address and

81
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.850 
has a lot of information about its about employee.

82
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.040 
Its revenue agent knows that person goes away

83
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.959 
for a weekend trip and is a bank or the online

84
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.312 
store. Know that there is a purchased a valuable

85
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.810 
asset. And if all this information

86
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.310 
come same time into a head of a gang of datasets,

87
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.899 
then they have access to all this information.

88
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.029 
Then they know that you are home with this attractive asset.

89
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.829 
Is a nobody there at the weekend

90
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.350 
where the owner are travelling.

91
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.200 
So correlating the different things it gives it

92
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.190 
gives information, for example, for a break in and

93
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.759 
try to steal this asset or another

94
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.193 
example for such kind of correlation.

95
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.829 
A engineer has recently paid for their hospital stays.

96
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.089 
You by means of his is he called from the bank.

97
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.430 
Now, the funds are now one to apply for credit loan

98
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.720 
from the bank with a ten year maturity.

99
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.489 
You can imagine if the bank has access to the data and

100
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.769 
considers this this application, then

101
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.989 
probably they will not be willing to give such a credit loan.

102
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.769 
So the data and the knowledge of the data

103
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.529 
gives people that have access to this data a

104
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.060 
lot of power, a lot of power, which has

105
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.720 
immediate impact on the person's life.

106
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.759 
So there are some central data collection points.

107
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.949 
So the question who had who has the possibility and

108
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.389 
who is able and who has the power and the computing power that's necessary

109
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.589 
and who has access to the data to correlate personal data?

110
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.419 
Of course, the large I.T. companies have this possibility and

111
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.077 
they have the ability at companies like Google, like Microsoft,

112
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.534 
like Apple, for example, Google has access to the search

113
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.309 
queries when people are using the Google search machine.

114
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.320 
The Google has access to all data on Android phones

115
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.476 
because of this synchronisation, because of steps that

116
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.679 
are of us and others.

117
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.110 
Google has access to watched and favourite videos

118
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.190 
because Google has complete access to YouTube.

119
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.520 
Google has access to the information which are sent away.

120
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.239 
I email for from all the people

121
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.450 
that are using Gmail platform

122
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.844 
Google has. Data from Google Maps, so Google knows where

123
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.559 
people are going. All this data are

124
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.559 
in the hand of one company.

125
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.897 
This is not only Google's is the other big providers.

126
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.889 
Microsoft, Facebook, Apple have a lot of access of different data sources.

127
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.499 
So to complete this data from Google Drive, cloud storage,

128
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.365 
for example, Google Docs, all this is what Google knows

129
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.220 
from the people which use that services.

130
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.940 
And if you see the amount of services provided then and

131
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.029 
compare what you are using, then you see there are different

132
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:02.360 
data sources that are available to the

133
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.399 
people inside Google.

134
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.607 
Also, Internet and telecommunication providers have access to a

135
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.249 
lot of data providers need to have this access to connect

136
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.433 
you to the Internet and all the data you receive from the

137
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.519 
data. All the data you send away as a data may be accessed

138
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.309 
by the Internet and telecom providers.

139
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.299 
Also, state state

140
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.447 
actors like Secret Services and police have

141
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.030 
access to a lot of data they can request or they can monitor data

142
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:46.799 
from multiple locations, for example, from banks, from Internet providers, mobile

143
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.328 
network providers. And it depends a little bit from the legal situations

144
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.581 
of different states. Sometimes they have more possibilities

145
00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.509 
to access this data, sometimes since data are more restricted.

146
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.309 
For example, in Germany, they are relatively they are relatively

147
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.970 
large restriction for that Secret Service and

148
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.259 
police station in US,

149
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.682 
the U.S. intelligence service like NSA

150
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.580 
or CIA and Secret Services from all the

151
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.899 
partners of U.S. and U.K. and Australia as they

152
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.700 
have supported the possibility to collect a large amount of data,

153
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.070 
a large amount of data like Visa, MasterCard, data, Microsoft, Google, Facebook

154
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.261 
and many of the large Internet service companies which were

155
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.489 
active and developed and promoted in the US because

156
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.259 
in case of danger, in case of investigating

157
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.059 
criminal act, the legislative, it allows the

158
00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.359 
US Intelligence Service or the US

159
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.340 
FBI to access such data.

160
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.600 
So there is a big programme. I mentioned this in some of the videos, the PRISM programme,

161
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.489 
which became known which from which the activities

162
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.970 
became known by the Snowden

163
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.759 
whistleblower. And also it became known that

164
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.239 
with the organisations as a corporation, with

165
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.650 
the German intelligence agency, the Peace

166
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.749 
Corps programme.

167
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.973 
So what to conclude the conclusion is

168
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.429 
the correlation of act early nonconfidential data can

169
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.809 
lead to a violation of privacy.

170
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.869 
All this data we mentioned or many of the states

171
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.450 
that we mentioned are publicly available.

172
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:59.369 
But if one brings them together and if one correlates them,

173
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.200 
then a violation of privacy can be the result.

174
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:10.019 
So often it's not clear which data is relevant for privacy

175
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.200 
protection. This is a big problem.

176
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:17.279 
And so one advice is to minimise data

177
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.989 
data from your data about you wherever possible.

178
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:27.390 
Only share and give out as a data set are really

179
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.129 
required for the usage of a special service or for the

180
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.190 
usage of a specific operation.

181
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.419 
A responsible user must seek person, a compromise

182
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:47.429 
person, a compromise between payment of usage by

183
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.659 
modern technology by giving and the payment is giving personal data

184
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.910 
and protecting it his or her privacy.

185
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.169 
So data is the new gold

186
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.850 
is a new currency to pay services to pay,

187
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.919 
to pay operations. But you have to be clear and you have.

188
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.589 
You have to decide whether you want to use the service,

189
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.230 
thinking that in order to use the service, you has to provide

190
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:25.179 
a private data, then it is a big problem.

191
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.550 
A lot of data is collected and stored not only nationally,

192
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.090 
for example, banks, e card providers, police, secret services,

193
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.490 
but also by companies, by companies and intelligence agencies

194
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.059 
in third party countries.

195
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.350 
And the problem is concerning privacy.

196
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.840 
There are very big differences in the

197
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.219 
legal frame in different countries.

198
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.499 
So the different nations of our

199
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.480 
different national legislation in the point of data protection,

200
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.309 
in some countries, there are very strong regulations that other countries are weak,

201
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.059 
weak regulations for data protection.

202
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.450 
And the Internet is a globally is a global.

203
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.309 
It's a global network. So it's very simple to place certain

204
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:26.100 
services to locate certain service in nations with law

205
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.279 
and no regulation of data protection.

206
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.869 
So it is one of the sense of our whole course

207
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.850 
to give you the information you need to make decisions,

208
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.036 
whether it makes sense to use a service, whether that,

209
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.720 
you know, price for it's a surprise are the data you are spending

210
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.050 
so you can make your decisions.

211
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.820 
Is it worth to use a service?

212
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:01.429 
Giving my data for that, so we hope that this kind

213
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.243 
of digital alignment will help you in

214
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.100 
the future to take care and to be able

215
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.919 
to protect your privacy as much as you like, in

216
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.919 
the same way to make use of the potentials of the new digital

217
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:19.929 
world.

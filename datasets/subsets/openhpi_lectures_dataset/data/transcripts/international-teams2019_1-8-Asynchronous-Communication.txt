00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.330 
Ok Tom, we have discussed about
synchronous communication.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.190 
Now, there are asynchronous
communication methods as well.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.660 
So what tools are available,
and what is this about?

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.650 
The most popular
tool that you

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.610 
probably all know about and
every one of us has used

6
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.720 
that since ages is
email. So email is

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.660 
the tool that you think about
normally if you're talking about

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.430 
asynchronous communication.
But as we think

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.290 
email is well known, we don't
need to discuss that a lot.

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.390 
So, we rather would like to
talk about other tools that

11
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.240 
are in our opinion also

12
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.400 
very important for asynchronous
communication, and

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.160 
all of these tools go in the
direction of documentation.

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.020 
Sharing documentation

15
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.680 
within your team. If we're
talking about documentation

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.610 
we mean different things that
can be documented and we will

17
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.000 
be discussing different tools
that can be used to document

18
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.460 
these different things. And what
these "things" are

19
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.310 
is what we will be talking about
now. So, a couple of tools that we

20
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.200 
selected and that we want to show
you are forums, wikis, and kanban

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.240 
boards. Just a selection,
there's definitely

22
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.540 
more out there and as always you
will be welcome to contribute.

23
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.390 
So, let's start
with the forums.

24
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.910 
I think forums are a great tool
to document the discussion of

25
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
ongoing processes. So, you
are working on something,

26
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.490 
you want to discuss it
with a colleague,

27
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.030 
and you want to keep this, ...
you want to document this

28
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.590 
discussion. So, normally, if
you would be working in the

29
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.430 
same office we maybe would
join in front of the same

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.840 
monitor and then we
would discuss about:

31
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.400 
"ah maybe we could
do this like that, and

32
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.320 
do this like that, and do this like
that". And then afterwards,

33
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.350 
the whole discussion is lost
are because it's just

34
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.730 
between the two of us and if one
of us leaves the company or

35
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.490 
if one of us forgets about
what we discussed.

36
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.840 
Yes, to me that happens all the
time.... So this is a big

37
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.100 
advantage now with remote work,
because everything then will

38
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.880 
be digitalized and it will be
available permanently, even if

39
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
the people are leaving...
Exactly, and you can

40
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.440 
actually do that even if you're
not working remotely, you can

41
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.730 
do it also in the office if
everybody's in the same place.

42
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.770 
So you have a way to

43
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.780 
record or to document
this process

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.160 
what you've been talking
about, how things will be

45
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.490 
changing, and what what needs
to be done on certain things.

46
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.900 
For example, in the in
the area of software

47
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.760 
development you have a
lot of these tools.

48
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.250 
Mostly in
combination with

49
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.810 
software development
organisation tools,

50
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.980 
source code repositories, for
example, or tools to manage

51
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.230 
these source code repositories.
We will be talking about source

52
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.420 
code repositories in another video...
Let me ask you something about

53
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.790 
that, because I'm a afraid in terms
of security and privacy, and I want

54
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.870 
to know if I've documented something,
I am sure that other people

55
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.770 
are accessing that, but people can
modify this, this can be deleted, etc.

56
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.400 
So, is there any kind of control?
Rules, roles and stuff like that in

57
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.490 
this kind of tools? Yeah, normally
you can definitely do that.

58
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.220 
It needs to be
configured,

59
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.090 
and you can give certain
people certain roles. You

60
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.120 
can be a developer and you
can work on the code,

61
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.580 
can replace it. You can be a
manager and you can do a couple

62
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.630 
of things more, or you can
be just sort of a visitor

63
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.040 
that is able to read
the code and comment

64
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.310 
on the code but you cannot change the
code. This is really important!

65
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.580 
We listed a couple
of tools here,

66
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.550 
one example, actually is openHPI, so
we have a discussion forum there

67
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.390 
as well, and you would use that
for the ongoing process of

68
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.040 
learning. If you are
discussing about

69
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.430 
certain things that we've
been talking about here.

70
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.300 
this would be an example for
that, but there's more.

71
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.310 
Particularly in the area
of software development

72
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.500 
but in many other areas as well.
There's an abundance of

73
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.980 
tools out there. We've been
talking about forums, and

74
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.770 
we want to talk about wikis
now. Wikis are more

75
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.340 
for documentation of a
completed process.

76
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.370 
So this is something that
you have already done and

77
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.820 
you want to say, well, this is
the final state and this is

78
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.670 
where we ended up. To make it a
little bit more complicated,

79
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.700 
wikis also often have a
discussion forum included.

80
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.750 
So, you then again can
can iterate on that

81
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.930 
and discuss about
this documentation.

82
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.120 
This "final"
documentation that you want

83
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.880 
to put out there, and maybe you
got something wrong and one

84
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.060 
of your colleagues can add
something, can make a comment on

85
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.690 
that, and then you can fix it.
Ok, so far you've talked about

86
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.730 
discussions. Now, is there
something available

87
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.150 
to visualize the status

88
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.540 
of a process, and then can
define who is doing what and

89
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.240 
what is happening there? The
stages of a project you

90
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.860 
mean? Exactly! So for example,
one of these tools are kanban

91
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.620 
boards. You often have
them, if you if you're

92
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.520 
not working remotely, many
companies have them in

93
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.130 
the kitchen for example..
On the wall..

94
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.070 
As a board with sticky posts
on there, so that everybody

95
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.370 
is able to see, uh i mean it depends
on the size of the company

96
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.020 
and how many people are in the kitchen,
so that everybody is able to

97
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.690 
see what is in the
backlogs, things that

98
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.740 
should be done at some point
but haven't been assigned

99
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.890 
to a to developer or to someone
yet to who will be taking care

100
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.630 
of that. You have some
issues that are

101
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.370 
already in progress, so they
are assigned to someone.

102
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.110 
Someone is working on that, or at
least supposed to be working

103
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.150 
on that. You have some issues
that are in review.

104
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.680 
So, they are actually
more or less done, and

105
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.860 
within this discussion process
that we've been talking about

106
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.020 
in the beginning, the
forum, for example.

107
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.880 
Then some others are in test or
finally something is done,

108
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.070 
and you can see that as well.... Ok,
but this this has nothing to do

109
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.460 
with any scheduling process, it's
just a status where are the

110
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.550 
tasks not when to be achieved.
Exactly, so it's basically

111
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.520 
the status. You can add dates
to that as well. Normally,

112
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.570 
these boards come in
combination with other tools,

113
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.700 
in which you can also define
milestones, in which you can define

114
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.620 
dates and schedule
things.

115
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.960 
There are many
tools out there

116
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.420 
allow you to define
these things or set

117
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.900 
up something like that,
also in an online tool.

118
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.050 
That is documenting

119
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.910 
the project state.

120
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.760 
So great, this is a really
nice insight because some

121
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.760 
people they don't really know why
should I make a documentation.

122
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.810 
It is because of the risk
of losing information.

123
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.050 
In traditional offices,
as you said before,

124
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.560 
we may talk and everything is gone.
But now with the remote team work,

125
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.570 
there is a bit more force in having
to document this information,

126
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.590 
in order to share this information. I
believe out there in the community,

127
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.800 
there are some experiences in
using this kind of tools.

128
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.160 
Would you recommend other tools
for the use of documentation?

129
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.700 
Please, join the discussion we
were looking forward to that.

130
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.790 
Thank you Tom ....
Thank you Salim.

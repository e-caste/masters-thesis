00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.950 
In our openHPI course - A Half
Century of Internet; now we want

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.200 
to discuss the question - why the
internet is such a popular target

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.280 
for cybercriminals?

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.270 
There are a couple of reasons
which make it so attractive

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.780 
for cybercriminals
to attack internet

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.680 
There are billions of entry points
across the globe, so, it's much easier

7
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.280 
to attack the internet than
to attack a physical house

8
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.900 
or a company or
other things

9
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.620 
There are millions of interconnected networks
and for the security of the networks,

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.740 
the network owners are responsible.
We have the immediate systems

11
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.350 
which interconnect different
networks to the internet and on

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.220 
all these intermediate systems there
is a possibility to check and see

13
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.870 
what's going on in the internet
and eventually also to attack

14
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.910 
this thing. There are many design
and configuration errors

15
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.970 
in the protocols, in the IT
systems, in the applications

16
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
which can be misused
by the attackers

17
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.690 
The large number of vulnerabilities, these
are mistakes in the software design

18
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.390 
since all mistakes in the configuration
will make it easy for cybercriminals

19
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.260 
to attack the internet and to
misuse data or services or assets

20
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960 
It is easy to access
and use hacking tools

21
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.280 
The hacking tools are available
on the internet, so even people

22
00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.890 
that have no good understanding from
the technique behind such attacks

23
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.570 
they can attack users and
companies by means of such tools

24
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.790 
So, here this statistic shows that
the sophistication of the attacks

25
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.080 
increases while the required
knowledge of attackers decreases

26
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.000 
So, this red line shows these are
more and more sophisticated

27
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.830 
attacks that are applied by the attackers
but attackers themselves - the knowledge

28
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.270 
is decreasing. How this
contradiction could be explained?

29
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.980 
The attacker uses various
sophisticated attack tools

30
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.050 
and the attackers
themselves do not

31
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.510 
need so much knowledge, they only need to
know how to apply this attacker tool

32
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.710 
Why security is such a big problem on
the internet and the digital world?

33
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.840 
So, to understand this we have
to remember that the internet

34
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.350 
started as a
research project

35
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.660 
The task of the
research project was

36
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.180 
to find out whether it's
possible to interconnect

37
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.890 
different types of local networks
to interconnect computers

38
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.140 
and with different operating
system and they make it possible

39
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.080 
that they exchange data. So, in
such research projects, typically

40
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.580 
were run in a small research
community, everyone knows the other

41
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.920 
and trust the other, so this
was a close community with

42
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.160 
a manageable and
trustworthy users

43
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:57.840 
So, when they made their research work
to find out what kind of construction

44
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.380 
would be helpful to allow this
exchange of information

45
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.870 
then security was not a priority. So,
first, they looked on the functionality

46
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.170 
and tried to find out how we can
make this in the best way;

47
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.670 
so, they designed the internet protocols
and typical statement in the

48
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:26.550 
RFCs, in the standards, security
issues are not covered

49
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.750 
in this memo. The idea was
- this security features

50
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.420 
can be installed when the basic
principles are found and are clear

51
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.880 
So, the internet is a network of
independent computer networks

52
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:53.550 
there is no authority or entity or
a government that can control

53
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.800 
the entire internet, that can control
the internet is used in the right way

54
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.790 
although this is something
which, in fact, the security

55
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.920 
on the internet and which
make it so difficult to

56
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:19.210 
to guarantee that data and that
communication on the internet is secured

57
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.680 
If you look to the internet today then the
internet and related communication strategies

58
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.790 
are key technology of the whole
modern information society

59
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.720 
So, from the small research
project, the results were used

60
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.430 
people were happy to be able to
use the results of this project

61
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.130 
So, the small research project became
more and more important and popular

62
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.400 
and now it's the basis of
all our modern society

63
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.940 
It's important for the industries, it's
important for business, it's important

64
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.860 
for the health sector, for
private life so it is

65
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.440 
very attractive for commercial use as
well as for private applications

66
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.800 
and this attracts computer crimes,
particularly, the commercial

67
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.670 
use of the internet has led to an extreme
increase in computer and cybercrimes

68
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.330 
What are the risks
of the system?

69
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.020 
There are a number of risks that came
from the computer systems themselves

70
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.080 
then another class of risk came for
interconnecting the computers via the internet

71
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:52.020 
and the third class of risk comes from the
fact that many companies, many organizations

72
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:59.130 
use the internet technology inside
their corporate intranets

73
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.970 
So, many attack points on the
internet made it easy for the

74
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.150 
cybercrime people
or hackers

75
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.980 
to run such attacks and
to perform such attacks

76
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:22.510 
So, in the computer systems themselves, for
example, PC, laptop, smartphone, tablet

77
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.460 
the attackers can try to
attack some functionality

78
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.510 
then they can attack when these devices
are connected with the internet

79
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:41.240 
when one connects these devices with
the internet and with other networks

80
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:50.070 
and then they can perform such attacks
when private networks, the intranets

81
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.380 
are used in companies, are used in
institutions or in private life

82
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.810 
for their attacks

83
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.900 
And there is a wide range of
different attacks that are applied

84
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:12.090 
So, internet attacks are relatively
easy to implement, particularly,

85
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.280 
by means of the tools that are
available in the internet

86
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:22.460 
They have a relatively low detection
risk and they are difficult to track

87
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.080 
So, if we looked for the
attractiveness and successfulness

88
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.390 
of internet attacks then
there are a number of

89
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.930 
properties or number of

90
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:43.460 
things that make this possible. So, the
internet is the central infrastructure

91
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:48.740 
of our modern society for business,
for institutions, for education

92
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.720 
sector, for private life and the
complexity of the internet protocols and

93
00:08:54.060 --> 00:09:00.560 
many applications are constantly
increasing. Every time new applications

94
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:06.450 
come to the market, often, they
have some failure which needs

95
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.070 
to be detected and
repaired afterwards

96
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:16.490 
So, the dependence on the internet
by business, by administration

97
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:23.380 
and also society, it's becoming
more and more extensive

98
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:30.080 
and attackers are all well prepared,
often, they are organized and

99
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:36.080 
they have powerful hacking tools
which they use for their attacks

100
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.340 
and these attack tools are becoming
more and more sophisticated

101
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.970 
I already showed such statistics
and they are quite easy to use

102
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:53.760 
so they enable bigger attacks also
for attackers with lower knowledge

103
00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.760 
Then, there is a rapid growth
in e-commerce applications,

104
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.650 
in online games, in streaming
services for video and audio,

105
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:11.980 
in social media and it's
so easy for the attacker

106
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:19.070 
because there is an absence and a lack
of information security awareness

107
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.190 
on side of the users, so, many
users, we will see this later,

108
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:30.370 
do not take care about internet
security, they present their data

109
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.990 
relatively open, they do not choose very
big passwords and do other things

110
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.330 
Although the number of qualified
specialists on information

111
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.910 
security and system, and
network administration

112
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.540 
it's low. It is difficult to
find such administrators

113
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.480 
and such specialists
on the market

114
00:10:52.750 --> 00:11:00.120 
Global internet regulations are very
difficult, typically, for regulations

115
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:07.930 
we have only the nations which are
responsible. So, in such a global internet

116
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:13.260 
there are no powerful
institutions which can

117
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.040 
define regulations and can see that the
people are also following these regulations

118
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.790 
For the United States,
it's very difficult

119
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:32.630 
to formulate such regulations and to
make laws it's almost impossible

120
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.800 
and for that reason, the power to
enforce legal requirements is missing

121
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.570 
although we can do this on a national
level but in this global level

122
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.100 
it is very difficult

123
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:54.490 
So, fast development is another
reason for the attractiveness

124
00:11:54.490 --> 00:12:00.160 
successfulness of internet attacks.
The fast development of cycles

125
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.990 
of computer and
network technologies

126
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:09.970 
with new applications - all these
developments create many vulnerabilities

127
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.940 
that can be misused by
the cyber attackers

128
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.710 
Here, is an interesting
figure, it is said that 99%

129
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:26.270 
of the attacks misuse
known vulnerabilities

130
00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.170 
configuration errors

131
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:35.090 
where counter measures or safeguards
would have been possible

132
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.250 
So, the users are lazy with
a system they do not

133
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.320 
update their
security systems

134
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:54.100 
They use applications with strong
vulnerabilities, so, this is a big issue

135
00:12:54.350 --> 00:13:02.590 
and provides this colorful
scene of different attacks

136
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.660 
against institutions, against companies,
against people in the internet

137
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:14.210 
So, it's really an area we have
to look into the details and

138
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.240 
we have to discuss how we
can protect our systems

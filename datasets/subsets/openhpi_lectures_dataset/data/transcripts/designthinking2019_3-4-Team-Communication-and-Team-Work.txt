00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.720 
In this video, I would like to talk about
Teamwork, but also more specifically about

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.880 
team communication and also
shared leadership in a team.

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.080 
Because when it comes actually to real

4
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.720 
teamwork, what counts are the interactions
we have amongst team members.

5
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.800 
And most of the interaction are actually
verbal because we do talk to each other.

6
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.880 
We will also give each
other nonverbal clues.

7
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.040 
So if we now do dive into a team,

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.400 
withing Design thinking and Design
innovation teams in a networked

9
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.880 
organization, I would like you to focus
on this specific aspect together with me.

10
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.160 
So when it comes now to teamwork and team
communication and design thinking teams,

11
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.720 
there are 3 key principles
that we want to highlight.

12
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.880 
The first one is Active Listening.

13
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.720 
And this one is actually about
when a team engages in a communication

14
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.920 
and a conversation that each team member
does listen to what the others are

15
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.680 
saying, without any pre-assumptions in his
head and also without thinking as

16
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.480 
a reaction to what to say
to that statement, what to do with it.

17
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.880 
So active listening actually puts you

18
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.400 
in more into that observant stage of mind
for a few seconds, for a few moments.

19
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.480 
So it's a little bit the principle
of think before you talk.

20
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.000 
The second principle is about feedback,

21
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.960 
or as we rather prefer to say,
about feed forward.

22
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.560 
In Design Thinking teams you will

23
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.640 
encounter typically many, many situations
where we'll give each other feedback.

24
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.520 
And we do so in order also to help us grow

25
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.440 
as a team because we are accomplished to
create a solution for a common mission.

26
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.360 
So therefore, also the feedback we give
the feed forward,

27
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.800 
typically follows the notion
of stating something positive first.

28
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.320 
So something what you liked about somebody
or a team communication situation.

29
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.320 
And then secondly, what do you wish for?

30
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.680 
So what could be improved? What could be

31
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.800 
done differently next time y
ou are going to address this issue.

32
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.040 
And this positive, constructive,

33
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.960 
feedback culture that we do establish is
also the teamwork culture we do establish.

34
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.560 
Because we want to learn from each other

35
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.480 
in order to be able to grow each
other's potential within that teamwork.

36
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.400 
The third principle is about creating
a language of empathy

37
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.120 
that actually relates back
to the nonviolent communication approach

38
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.040 
by Marshall Rosenberg.
Because language matters.

39
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.880 
Whatever your express can harm others,
it can touch.

40
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.440 
And we'd like to actually take this
into consideration when we do create

41
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.920 
a fruitful and also compassionate
team communication.

42
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.480 
How does that work?
Pretty simple.

43
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.520 
Instead of saying, I don't like this,
we should do this.

44
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.080 
You phrase that statement that comment
within your own individual perspective.

45
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.920 
By, for example, stating an observation

46
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.440 
first, saying,
"I have observed that we have been

47
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.800 
discussing that issue now for 20 minutes"
and then giving the reasoning behind.

48
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.640 
"And this really makes me annoyed,
because I think and I feel that we're not

49
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.040 
investing our time in the relevant
questions."

50
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.320 
And the third is then actually making
a suggestion to the others, "So what if we

51
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.720 
take a five minutes break and then split
up into teams in order to sort out our

52
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.440 
discussion on this issue in smaller
groups?" And with this approach,

53
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.080 
we do create an inviting
atmosphere of letting each other express

54
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.840 
their thought and opinion in a not
harmful but hopefully fruitful way.

55
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.880 
Why are we so interested in team

56
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.920 
communication? You may wonder or may have
already started asking yourself.

57
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.400 
It's actually about achieving our common
goals when it also comes to a team work.

58
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.000 
It's about a project, It's about a task,

59
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.400 
and it's more specifically about a design
challenge we want to together accomplish.

60
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.560 
And for this, we want to put a team
into a high performance status in terms

61
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.920 
of tapping into their potential of team
effectiveness, but also team efficacy.

62
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.000 
So team efficacy is a concept we use

63
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.320 
that actually ties back to self efficacy
introduced by Ulbrich Wanderer t

64
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.240 
hat actually is, first of all,
the own capability of achieving goal,

65
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.280 
of also accomplishing a task, and
also the believing.

66
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.320 
And that's applied to the team level.

67
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.240 
And in order to do so, we have
to experience these team situations.

68
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.400 
And we also have to model to ourselves

69
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.160 
this behavior that actually helps
us to move forward all together.

70
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.640 
Team effectiveness.

71
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.040 
How can we actually achieve
this in Design Thinking teams?

72
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.080 
Well, actually, by a different
concept of leadership.

73
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.880 
We don't apply the typical model

74
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.520 
of Delegate and Control,
of Divide and Conquer to our teams.

75
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.400 
Instead, we are building our teamwork
and also the communication in teams

76
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.120 
of a conceptual understanding of team
leadership as teams leadership or to be

77
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.280 
more specific and concrete,
shared leadership.

78
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.280 
Shared leadership is actually not about
just self managed teams,

79
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.800 
because self managed teams could also
apply a leadership style that is,

80
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.040 
anything goes or I just have a say and you
don't. So therefore,

81
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.360 
in contrast, shared leadership actually
builds on the influences the mutual team

82
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.720 
members have on each other when
it's come when it comes to leading.

83
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.280 
It's about literally taking turns in terms

84
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.800 
of communicating,
influencing and also directing each other

85
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.600 
through different work stages,
work modes within a given project team.

86
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.200 
With this approach,
we are better able actually also

87
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.280 
to achieve what we have been defining as
a team that is committed to a common

88
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.840 
purpose and also to achieve commonly
defined goals within their project work.

89
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.320 
And also of research that actually has

90
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.080 
been proven to be very successful
for a specific type of teams.

91
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.440 
There is a typology of teams that has been
defined by Hollenbeck that actually

92
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.360 
describes the teams we are looking at
as being the ones that are diverse.

93
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.080 
So they have a relatively high
differentiation on the skills side.

94
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.880 
They are not a team that will work

95
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.800 
together for the rest of their
lives. They are also not a crew.

96
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.160 
So they are a team that has
a moderate time horizon.

97
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.560 
They are going to spend together
on working on a project,

98
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.560 
plus that the third one is that they also
have a moderate authority differentiation.

99
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.640 
And for these three dimensions combined,

100
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.760 
that leads actually to a specific
description of a Design Thinking team.

101
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.200 
The concept of shared leadership
seems to be the most effective form.

102
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.320 
Another point that we also want to address
on a more practical level,

103
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.200 
because we already have been talking about
the communication within the team,

104
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.880 
is actually also
a key and simple guide of team speak.

105
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.760 
So when it comes to have a practice
of nonviolent communication and also

106
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.640 
an open feedback culture,
it's also about building on each other.

107
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.880 
So that means the principle of 'Yes And'

108
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.080 
is a key one when it comes
to design thinking teams.

109
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.360 
And we want you actually
to remember that a

110
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.640 
nd to keep that in mind.

111
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.880 
But we also want you to challenge
with a new perspective

112
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.520 
because a Yes And attitude,
even if it leads to building on each other

113
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.640 
from time to time, has to be challenged
because that might lead to further refine

114
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.520 
your idea. But you also
want to develop a new one.

115
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:43.480 
So besides that principle of Yes And,
we also encourage teams from time to time,

116
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.880 
specifically when it comes to decision
making phases to disrupt themselves,

117
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.320 
to start questioning instead of Yes And,
asking themselves What If.

118
00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.720 
Yes And I like this idea,
But What If we consider now another one.

119
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.720 
In order to open up a new thread

120
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.480 
of thought and also a new thread of
teamwork and maybe even also new ideas.

121
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.640 
So to sum it all up and then this is about

122
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.880 
creating a new way of interacting
and working together,

123
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:23.920 
but also establishing a new communication
and somehow also language of team speak

124
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.160 
that will empower teams to perform
better and also to work better together.

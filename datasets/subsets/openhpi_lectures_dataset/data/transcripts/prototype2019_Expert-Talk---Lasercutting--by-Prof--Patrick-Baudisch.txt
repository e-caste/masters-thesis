00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.760 
Hello! My name is Patrick
Baudisch and I'm a professor

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.550 
here at Hasso Plattner Institute.
And I would like to tell you

3
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.720 
about rapid prototyping, in
particular using lasercutters.

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.720 
So in this first picture I brought
you here, everything you see

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.420 
in this shot, is made using the
software I'm going to tell you about,

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.140 
so including tables and
guitars for example.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.260 
So the reason we started
looking into this is

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.110 
because today, development
and innovation

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.980 
have a different flavour than
they used to twenty years ago.

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.550 
Twenty years ago people used to
spend more time making software

11
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.120 
systems, apps, website, stuff like
that but today you have more

12
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.180 
services that actually have a
physical component, for example

13
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.340 
like a robotic arm or
something electronic,

14
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680 
a lot of mechanical components.
The go-to technology for these

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.170 
things tends to be 3D
printing. And 3D printing

16
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.210 
has a huge benefit which is:
it's very simple to model for

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.710 
3D printing. You get a lot of
very simple-to-use editors for

18
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.350 
3D printing. But the downside
is if you look at how

19
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.940 
3D printing works, I'll just let
this run here for a couple of

20
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.590 
seconds, you get some sort
of a sense that it takes

21
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.450 
quite a while. Now there's some
fast 3D printers, but if

22
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.580 
you try to produce something
of a decent scale,

23
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.560 
you will find that at
the end of the day,

24
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.540 
fabrication is the bottleneck.
You can express your idea very

25
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.450 
quickly but fabricating the
thing will take a long time

26
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.180 
and that really holds innovation
back. If you're in a situation

27
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.290 
where you're having a meeting
in a couple of hours

28
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.910 
with a customer and you would like
to bring a physical prototype,

29
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.760 
3D printing is typically not an
option, except if you print

30
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.470 
something very, very small. So for
that reason we started looking

31
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.180 
into competing technologies.
So here is a technology

32
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.980 
called lasercutting, and as you
can see it's very distinct

33
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.020 
from 3D printing in the
sense that it produces

34
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.440 
entire plates at once. So I'll
let this run a little longer.

35
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.050 
So at this arm,
there is a laser

36
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.100 
and it's cutting out these plates
and because it doesn't have

37
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.330 
to assemble material, but it
just cuts it out, it actually

38
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.310 
is quite a bit faster. So
fabrication with lasercutters, as

39
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.860 
a matter of fact, is very fast.
And a lot of things, kind of the

40
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.970 
size of a physical prototype that
you would take to a meeting

41
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.490 
can be fabricated in something
like twenty minutes.

42
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560 
The main limitation of
lasercutting in contrast is the

43
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.840 
fact that it's very difficult
to make the models.

44
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.130 
So if you look at this
video one more time,

45
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.340 
all these little angles that
form these joints that you

46
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.850 
need to assemble the model, used to
be made by hand and in software

47
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.040 
like Illustrator. You would
actually go and draw these little

48
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.040 
angles. Now this takes a long time
and so you find yourself in

49
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.850 
a situation where in 3D printing
the bottleneck is the fabrication

50
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.030 
and in lasercutting the bottleneck
used to be the software.

51
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.200 
And that's exactly where we
try to come up with a new

52
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.540 
solution, with the system
that we call Kyub.

53
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.760 
So the main idea behind Kyub
is that you can take,

54
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.920 
you can design a physical
prototype, in this case a mock-up

55
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.100 
of an espresso machine, and the
software will actually break

56
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.850 
this down into those joints
that you need to manufacture.

57
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.470 
The model I'm going to show you
in a second, how it's made

58
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.880 
takes about two minutes to design
and can be fabricated in

59
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.410 
an hour including
assembly. So that means:

60
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.670 
if you get a phone call at twelve
o'clock that you have a meeting

61
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.080 
at one, you still have time to
make the physical prototype

62
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.150 
and show up to the meeting
with the physical prototype.

63
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.530 
So here's what the software looks
like, it's a web-based system.

64
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.820 
This is sped up by a factor of four,
so instead of thirty seconds this

65
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.150 
in reality takes about two minutes,
and you can see you're building

66
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.500 
in a kind of a Minecraft
like of way, where you're

67
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.220 
assembling little building
blocks that merge into the

68
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.480 
whole, but you can still modify
everything using these

69
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.480 
push/pull tool, you can texture
things, you can add your own custom

70
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.420 
textures to it. And the last
thing I'll do here is,

71
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.160 
I'm gonna add a little
drain at the bottom.

72
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.230 
So this may be my prototype, maybe
for meeting where I'm explaining

73
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.900 
new innovations that I would build
into this espresso machine.

74
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.850 
But now I can actually go to my
meeting with a physical prototype

75
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.780 
in very very little time. So that
is the main idea behind Kyub,

76
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.050 
We've used it to design a lot of
things ranging from tables,

77
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.880 
furniture, guitars, stuff like that,
and what used to be the main

78
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.960 
downside of lasercutting, which
is the slow modeling speed,

79
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.490 
with the addition of Kyub actually
is kind of overcome and

80
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.280 
as a result the combined system
of fast modelling using Kyub

81
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.350 
and fast fabrication
using laser cutter

82
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.930 
results in the world's
fastest modelling system.

83
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.460 
It's the only system the world
that actually allows you to

84
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.860 
create a physical prototype in
the time before a meeting.

85
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.090 
Thank you so much.

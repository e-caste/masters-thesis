00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.520 
In our openHPI course Confidential
Communication in the Internet,

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.340 
now we consider some Crypto
Patents and Standards.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.990 
In daily practice, cryptography
plays a very very important role

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.230 
so new cryptographic knowledge
it's a very interesting

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.400 
research topic, new cryptographic
knowledge and procedures are published

6
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.210 
in scientific publications,
in journals and

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.800 
conferences or they are
applied for patents.

8
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.330 
The cryptographic process to apply
such cryptographic methods,

9
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.390 
this of course must be interoperable in the
context of various applications. Internet

10
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.130 
applications come from different
people, there are many services

11
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.440 
which you want to interact with so
this cryptographic means and tools

12
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.740 
need to be as much as
possible interoperable.

13
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.420 
And to achieve this, various
specifications and fixations

14
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.260 
need to be done, these are called
standards and of course, the

15
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.100 
software companies need to
agree on the standards.

16
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.700 
The standards then also

17
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.200 
be adhered to the various software
providers, and a standard

18
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.620 
becomes a standard and becomes
successful if many software providers

19
00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:47.730 
apply as a standard and design tools
that can deal with this fixation

20
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.170 
of cryptographic
process.

21
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.880 
So, the use of cryptographic methods and
implementations in crypto products

22
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.800 
especially in hardware and software should be carried out
in compliance with relevant standards whenever possible

23
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.640 
So, here are some very
important crypto patents,

24
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.140 
so, many cryptosystems and
crypto algorithms are patents.

25
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.540 
So, here are the

26
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.390 
five most particular important
crypto patents, the first is

27
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.410 
DES block ciphers, we discussed this
in the first week of our course

28
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.990 
of symmetric encryption which
is today no more considered

29
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.450 
secure enough. Then the first public
key patent was the Diffie-Hellman

30
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.450 
key exchange, which solves the problem
for securely exchanging secret keys

31
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.310 
in over an unsecured media so this also
can be considered as the beginning

32
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.240 
of the asymmetric

33
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.900 
encryption methods development. Then
the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack and PKI

34
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.450 
patent became very important with
PKI description first time,

35
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.360 
then the Tree authentication method
which was introduced in 1982

36
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.820 
for dealing with such hierarchical
structures and then of course

37
00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:40.290 
RSA asymmetric encryption and a signature
standard which was introduced in

38
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.390 
1983.

39
00:03:44.112 --> 00:03:49.540 
There were a number of other significant
crypto patents for example,

40
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.240 
a patent for the generation of RSA
prime numbers, you remember RSA

41
00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.590 
was based on the
factorization problem, so,

42
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.130 
for the private key one needs to
know two huge prime numbers

43
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.660 
and these huge prime numbers are
multiplied and for an attacker

44
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.300 
he only can break the

45
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.360 
encryption system when he
is able to defactorise

46
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.320 
this product.

47
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.850 
Then the One-Time Signatures is
a very important crypto patent

48
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.230 
which was introduced
in 1989 by Merkle.

49
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.750 
The IDEA cipher was introduced in
1993 and it provides a symmetric

50
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.870 
encryption method.
DSA signatures

51
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.140 
which was introduced in 1993. Then
Modulo Arithmetic Processing Chip,

52
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.520 
today it's a
very popular

53
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.950 
elliptic curve cryptography, here
as the first patent was done.

54
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.510 
And then IBE, the Identity Based
Encryption method which was

55
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.390 
introduced in 2007.

56
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.100 
If we look at other
crypto standards then

57
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.550 
there is the American institution for standardization,
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology),

58
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.700 
so, important security
standards of NIST is AES,

59
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.850 
the advanced encryption standard,
the successor of DES,

60
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.310 
the symmetric encryption
method which was,

61
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:50.307 
which nowadays is a successor of DES and is used in
many fields of symmetric methods for encryption.

62
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.370 
SHA family, so we discussed several
hash algorithms from the SHA family,

63
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.410 
the SHS, the Secure Hash Standard, which
defines the use of hash functions

64
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.310 
and the DSA standard which provides
algorithms for digital signatures.

65
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.250 
Then other important security
standards which became important in

66
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:26.240 
the environment of banks, this is the DES
standard, nowadays no more considered

67
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.460 
secure, than the
PIN management

68
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.480 
standard which is
described in the

69
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.207 
ISO 9564 and ANSI standard,
the signature standard,

70
00:06:41.307 --> 00:06:48.570 
banks when they interact with
others, they recognize signatures,

71
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.730 
certificates, how the certificate should look
like, you see there are different standards

72
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.980 
for the certificates used in the
environment of banks and this is

73
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.440 
only the peak of the iceberg of the many
other crypto patents and standards

74
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:15.190 
which are important
to survive

75
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.420 
in our digital world.

1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.840 
So let's altogether try
to zoom out a little

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.160 
bit, try to get a bigger picture of
the situation we are in right now.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.980 
With all those devices, the pieces of
glass we are all carrying around,

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.860 
with all the Artificial Intelligence,
with the internet, with big data,

5
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.060 
and I started using a very
simple picture which I found

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.640 
on the internet, describing that kind of world
it should be, actually three dimensional,

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.470 
and should be pulsating and moving
and so on. But let's stay

8
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.670 
with that two dimensional
version right now,

9
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.920 
I was trying to find for
myself, a visual metaphor

10
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.370 
for the big transformation we're
in and also I try to help myself

11
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.100 
to find a way to manoeuvre
better, in this highly

12
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.950 
connected world. Because I found
out I was trained not to

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.980 
be interconnected.

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.450 
And while it was one of this
defining, trying to find a picture,

15
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.660 
I was moving around in my
flat and has ended up at

16
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.600 
my bookshelf and
I looked at the

17
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.090 
Brockhaus the encyclopedia which
I was using as a young person.

18
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.600 
as a school kid, as a student,
quite often. So the

19
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.040 
the books look a little bit
damaged, but I noticed the level

20
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.290 
of dust on top of those books.
And that made me think, because

21
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.160 
I started thinking of do i not
want to know anything any more?

22
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.970 
If I look at
those books

23
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.180 
and yes, of course, I want to know
every day new things and I'm using

24
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.840 
not the Brockhaus
version,

25
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.640 
the analogue version, the linear
version. anymore, I am using

26
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.160 
the network version of knowledge
aggregation, which is

27
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.640 
visualized in this piece of glass,
in front of me. So with those

28
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.230 
pieces of glass, we are always
using the network version of

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.400 
knowledge aggregation, like Wikipedia or
Google, or the whole internet to search

30
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.100 
and to look for new things. I
kept standing in front of

31
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.810 
the bookshelf, because
that whole structure,

32
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.050 
the twenty books reminded
me of something.

33
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.210 
Whenever we start

34
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.890 
a project, together with a student project
partner, together with professionals,

35
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.790 
where we started the workshop,
usually there's the CTO or the

36
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.100 
CIO, Chief Digital Officer,
or the CEO approaching

37
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.410 
us and I always ask them, "Please draw
me a picture of your organization".

38
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.940 
And they go to the whiteboard
and they do a thing which ends

39
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.430 
up like this: "Yes we have
departments and we have management

40
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.900 
level one, level two, and then
we have the board up there,

41
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.940 
and I asked them to look at the
whole thing, then I draw two

42
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.250 
letters A and Z in
the structure.

43
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.320 
Indicating that this is the structure
of the analog world, this

44
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.820 
is a Brockhaus structure. And if you
look at it what happened to Brockhaus,

45
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.520 
Germany's best and most
known encyclopedia, up and

46
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.340 
running for two
hundred years,

47
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.300 
It stopped printing in
2014 because it was

48
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.710 
not used anymore. And this
is what I'm using as

49
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.180 
as an example for things
which are disappearing

50
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.660 
in the digital world. And then what
I do, I draw the other pattern,

51
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.200 
underneath the Brockhaus
pattern better and this is

52
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.630 
a network pattern. And I'm stating, "This is
the pattern of the twenty-first century."

53
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.410 
And then, usually, the response
is yeah, I didn't think of it

54
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.120 
like this, but you're probably
right. So, then, the question is,

55
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.860 
How do we get out of that old
traditional structures which

56
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.700 
are still defining more than ninety-five
per cent of all our organizations.

57
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.230 
How to get out of this, how to
get the people and the whole

58
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.550 
organization move towards a network
structure. And we all have

59
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.900 
to be aware that this is not an
easy task. This is not something

60
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.700 
which you can do in one day
or deliver in ten days,

61
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.480 
or even a year if you are
representing a large organization.

62
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.450 
I would position myself on that
arrow very high up, I'm moving

63
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.760 
with design thinking, for about
twelve years now. But I'm

64
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.190 
still learning, I still find myself
stuck in the old structures. And

65
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.780 
then we start discussing
together, how to get the whole

66
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.560 
organization move from the upper
pattern to the lower pattern.

67
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.760 
I would state that, "With design
thinking, the three core

68
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.780 
elements which we
are addressing

69
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.880 
throughout our learning process here,
it is probably the most holistic

70
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.090 
approach and the most holistic
framework you can get so far.

71
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.920 
To help yourself, and your
organization, your people,

72
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.950 
to move out of that old thinking pattern
and habits towards the new ones.

73
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.950 
So I found out over the years
that, this simple pattern helped

74
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.290 
so many people to understand the
severe change we're in right

75
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.860 
now. And that is not an easy thing, that
is not something a little bit different,

76
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.240 
but it's really fundamental
difference. So I decided to write

77
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.580 
a book about that, which is
called "Network thinking".

78
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.140 
And while I was writing the book, I
got in touch with Peter Spiegel,

79
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.560 
a Berlin-based futurologist. He
was looking at the pattern

80
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.830 
and we started discussing about
that, and he introduced a

81
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.520 
very nice term. He was stating
that the old pattern is

82
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.420 
we can call it the pattern
of the IQ world, the

83
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:04.270 
Intelligence Quotient or the I qualities
world. When we measure this single

84
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.550 
intelligence or this single person,
and the outcome is just one number.

85
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.490 
And we do the same thing in our education
systems, in schools, and universities

86
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.400 
all the time. A little bit more in
detail, but yes, we're still using

87
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.010 
that kind of IQ mode. And he
was coming up with great

88
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.770 
three new letters, he was saying the
new world we are moving towards

89
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.810 
is defined through WQ, through the WE qualities. And I loved
these three letters from the very first moment, because

90
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.140 
it was the shortest version I've
ever heard of the description

91
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.790 
of what we are doing since yours with
students, and with participants,

92
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.490 
here at the School of
Design Thinking.

93
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.650 
We try to generate a new kind of quality,
through collaboration quality and

94
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.100 
actually we don't have measurement
instruments for this up to now.

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.410 
Let's look at an example from the real world.

2
00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.330 
In 2012

3
00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:11.790 
a team of students at the HPI School of Design Thinking

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.230 
in Potsdam were given the challenge of finding innovative solutions

5
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:19.240 
to empower nurses who work in mobile clinics

6
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:23.780 
in rural South Africa to monitor their patients better and more conveniently.

7
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:26.400 
To tackle this challenge

8
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.070 
the team followed the nurses in the Western Cape

9
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:30.300 
region in South Africa

10
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:32.700 
as they visited their patients.

11
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:34.610 
The team observed that

12
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:36.960 
the nurses would spend a lot of time on the road,

13
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:38.110 
taking different routes,

14
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.740 
because their patients were farmers

15
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:41.780 
that were spread around all over to region.

16
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:44.520 
Also, the nurses had no tools

17
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.910 
to figure out the number of patients in each farm.

18
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:49.670 
So they had to visit them all to make sure

19
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:50.850 
no one is left out.

20
00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:52.660 
By immersing themselves

21
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:55.470 
in the daily routine of the nurses, observing them

22
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.260 
as they did their jobs and listening to their stories,

23
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.200 
the team discovered that despite their crucial role,

24
00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:03.920 
the nurses lost a lot of time searching

25
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:05.700 
or waiting for their patients.

26
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:09.520 
So the team realized that in order to empower the nurses,

27
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.250 
they need to save them time

28
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.670 
and connect them with local farmers in an efficient way.

29
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.110 
During their research

30
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:17.760 
the team also realize that

31
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.000 
although many farmers didn't have smartphones,

32
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.400 
cell phones were widely used and SMS based solutions

33
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.130 
were quite popular in the region

34
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.890 
at the time. This insight led to the creation of „Summo“,

35
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:32.240 
a low cost SMS based communication service

36
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.970 
that is designed to bring nurses and patients

37
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:37.830 
together in an efficient and convenient way.

38
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.050 
The patients could register to summo

39
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:42.670 
by sending an SMS with the name of their farm.

40
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:43.960 
The patients’ phone

41
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:47.410 
numbers are clustered based on the location of their farms.

42
00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:50.250 
When the nurses know their exact arrival time.

43
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:53.060 
they send out aan SMS to the farm they're heading to

44
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:54.340 
and Summo notifies

45
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:57.170 
all the registered cellphones in that farm cluster.

46
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:01.260 
This low-tech, low-cost service saves the nurses

47
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:04.040 
one of their most important resources: time.

48
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:06.450 
So by going to the field

49
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.640 
and learning about people we wish to design

50
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:12.100 
for, we bring their needs and desires early on

51
00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.950 
into the problem solving process.

52
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:16.520 
In this way, we can make sure that

53
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.310 
our solutions will resonate with them,

54
00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:20.390 
are relevant to their context,

55
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:22.000 
and create value for them.

56
00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:26.300 
This course will introduce you to the first phase of the design

57
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.510 
thinking problem solving process:

58
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:31.150 
Exploring needs and finding design inspiration.

59
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:34.560 
There are many techniques that designers, ethnographers,

60
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:36.150 
and user researchers apply

61
00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:38.900 
to gain insights into people's lives and needs.

62
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:40.130 
In this course,

63
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:41.700 
we will introduce two basic,

64
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:43.500 
but very powerful methods

65
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:44.950 
and practice them together:

66
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:47.720 
Observation and Qualitative Interviews,

67
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.040 
Remember that our goal in design

68
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:51.150 
research is to learn

69
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:53.430 
things that are beyond our own assumptions.

70
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:55.130 
We want to learn about people’s

71
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:57.910 
hidden needs and gain insights into their lives.

72
00:02:58.361 --> 00:02:58.980 
For this,

73
00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:02.530 
what we need from you is to be curious and open-minded.

74
00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:04.550 
Have fun learning and exploring!

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640 
Ok Tom, now it's time
to talk about tools.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.370 
What is there available for
communicating ,for collaborating?

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.670 
Yes, so we will be talking about
a couple of different tools

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.830 
in the next four
to six videos.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.220 
We will be talking about
collaboration tools,

6
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.960 
tools that enable virtual a
collaboration for remote teams,

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.590 
and we will be starting with
a tools for synchronous

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.060 
video communication.

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.860 


10
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.480 
We will also be talking about
text-based communication

11
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.540 
later, but now we
will be focusing

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.550 
on video tools. So, advantages
of video tools are that

13
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.650 
they have a very strong
communication channel.

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.790 
So, you have the gestures, you have
emotions in your facial expressions.

15
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.660 
You have the verbal
communication obviously,

16
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.760 
You can also share your screen,
can show the other people

17
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.450 
what you you are
currently doing,

18
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.890 
and you also can record
such a session, so, that,

19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.600 
for example, team members
who are not available

20
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.800 
for a certain meeting
can watch afterwards,

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.020 
and can see how certain
decisions have been made

22
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.230 
and why you do things and
what you've been deciding.

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.090 
Of course, where there's
advantages, there's always

24
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.360 
disadvantages as well.
To set up such a

25
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.500 
video meeting, requires something to be done.
It's not that you have one of these tools

26
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.950 
running all the time in the
background, and you just like go

27
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.570 
there and say "Hi Salim, are
you there, can you join?"

28
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.150 
You have to schedule
something, you need to plan.

29
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.120 
So they are
particularly good for

30
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.430 
certain kind of meetings. And
also you have a privacy

31
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.480 
intrusion actually if
you're working at home,

32
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.090 
depending on whom you're
talking to, actually,

33
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.540 
in the video communication,
if you're talking to

34
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.400 
a customer, for example, it might
be different and if you're

35
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.850 
talking to your colleague that
was sitting next to you in your

36
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.610 
office for the last ten
years. Or if you're talking

37
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.910 
to your boss that might
also be different.

38
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.600 
So, you might want to consider
what is happening behind

39
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.340 
you because it's not only you that is
visible. So, when is it good to use

40
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.000 
a video meeting, is there
any particular case where

41
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.670 
you would recommend
to use video?

42
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.740 
I mean, I would use it
for a for meetings

43
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.560 
where you have scheduled
a time anyway.

44
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.130 
Like, for example for a kick of
meeting, if you don't have the chance

45
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.650 
do that really face to face,
because that is something that

46
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.150 
I would, at least from
my experience, always

47
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.700 
prefer to have this
first initial meeting

48
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.180 
really in person, and then
later on switch to the

49
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.420 
to the remote meetings. So
monthly meetings, weekly

50
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.220 
meetings, daily meetings that
you have maybe at the start

51
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.770 
of each day, depending on the on
the structure of the team and

52
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.790 
the communication
structure that you have

53
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
decided for. Video tools
are very good for

54
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.950 
that. There's one issue, one a
technical issue that we currently

55
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.600 
often have to deal with,
that is bandwidth.

56
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.350 
So, I don't know whoever has
done a video meeting before...

57
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.340 
I know what you mean... it often
happens... it slows down,

58
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.920 
suddenly, the audio starts
crackling, and then you have

59
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.200 
to turn of the video and then
it's not a video meeting

60
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.530 
anymore... but if i compare a video
chat with a normal (face-to-face)

61
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.710 
meeting,  i have also

62
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.030 
documents and i have
some stuff, can i

63
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.470 
also use this stuff in the video
meetings as well to present

64
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.160 
something to the other people?
Yeah sure, I mean you can share,

65
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.450 
it's not just the video, there's more,
you can share your screen and stuff

66
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.450 
more, you can share
your screen and stuff

67
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.140 
like that, so this is possible.
A couple of tools that

68
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.020 
you can use, and this
is a very small

69
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.610 
selection, just random tools
that we've been using in the

70
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.840 
last time, none of them pays
us for mentioning them,

71
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.120 
and this is a couple of tools
that we we want to present,

72
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.960 
but we actually want
to invite you to

73
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.770 
suggest the tools that
you are using .

74
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.730 
So, we try to categorize
them into free

75
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.450 
services that you just can, use
and into enterprise solutions,

76
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.280 
and also into open source solutions
that you can run on your

77
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.870 
own premises. What's the difference?
Well there's a lot of differences,

78
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.730 
actually. The main advantage
of the free services,

79
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.250 
of course: it's free. You don't
pay... you don't pay for it.

80
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.930 
And this is also what often
happens if you don't provide

81
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.620 
the correct solutions, the
solutions that you need for your

82
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.050 
organization to your team (in time). Then they
will go and get something, and mostly go for

83
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.030 
free solutions and
the problem with a

84
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.500 
free solution, I mean sometimes
they're a little bit

85
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.030 
not so easy to use, not always,
but often, they have a limited

86
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.750 
number of participants, etc.,
but this is not the

87
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.290 
real issue here. If your employees
just start using them because

88
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.730 
you didn't provide them something
else, the thing is who's actually

89
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.020 
listening? You never know, I
mean... who's in the back...

90
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.080 
who's in the back?

91
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.040 
We had this thing with
a Skype, Microsoft

92
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.140 
where it suddenly came out that
is not kind of just machine

93
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.710 
learning that's going on but
there's somebody listening there,

94
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.780 
and I think we're a similar
article about Siri a couple

95
00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.440 
of days ago people are
listening to that.

96
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.570 
I mean, if you're working in a
team you might be talking about

97
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.060 
company secrets, might
be the next projects,

98
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.460 
you might be talking about
things that you don't want

99
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.830 
anybody else to know about. So,
you really should be careful

100
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.420 
uh using them (free plans, free online tools).
If you work in an open source project

101
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.510 
and everything is just
available anyway

102
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.440 
it might not be an issue.
So, a couple of examples

103
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.710 
that we have in this in
this area are Skype,

104
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.860 
many people know that,
Google hangouts are also a

105
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.380 
solution like that, or an open source solution
jitsi.meet, which is also available

106
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.020 
as a free service
online.

107
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.140 
When do you use that?

108
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.290 
Normally, if you don't have a
budget, if you're working

109
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.970 
on student projects
for example,

110
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.510 
if you have small teams, so they
don't get into these limitations.

111
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.350 
And particularly, and
this is really the

112
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.520 
most important thing, if the
tool's privacy level conforms

113
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.970 
with your company policy or project
policy in this particular

114
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.450 
point. So, if you have
something that you don't

115
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.570 
want to tell everybody, don't use
these tools... But then what to use?

116
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.230 
I mean there's enterprise
solutions they come with a

117
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.490 
higher level of security or you
have open source solutions

118
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.780 
you have closed source solutions,
you can run them on your own

119
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.740 
premises, you
can use them

120
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.720 
as a cloud service as well.
The problem with them is,

121
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.370 
you have to pay for them...
So, you pay for privacy

122
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.470 
let's say... you pay for
privacy... not all the time but

123
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.980 
mainly, because if it is a closed
project it's not it's not an

124
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.820 
open source, then you don't know
really what is happening in

125
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.790 
the bag... Yeah ok, I
mean you need to trust

126
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.820 
the companies that
provide them.

127
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.990 
It can, because you pay
per user and per month,

128
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.630 
depending on the size of
your team, it can get

129
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.910 
quite expensive.
They often have

130
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.640 
particular prices for
educational solutions,

131
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.930 
for example, if you're
working in this area.

132
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.230 


133
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.440 
The players are well known,
so it's often Microsoft,

134
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.940 
Office365, has a lot of

135
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.070 
solutions in this
area, Cisco, Google,

136
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.230 
many others that offer
such solutions.

137
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.410 
Of course you need to
be able to pay for

138
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.090 
that, the budget needs to be
there, you have large teams and

139
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.250 
you have something that you want
to be kept inside of your

140
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.660 
company. I can listen from you
that security and privacy

141
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.420 
are the main differentiators
in this field when

142
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.910 
you want to select... of course the
price... but in the end you are

143
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.780 
going to pay more if you want
more security, reliability, and

144
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.280 
privacy. Is there any
alternative option?

145
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.780 
You can go for an open source
solution, which also

146
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.990 
dives into this privacy
and security thing.

147
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.660 
In this case it's not
about the price,

148
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.770 
or in the end, it is also
about the price because

149
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.060 
you need to run everything
yourself, you need to maintain

150
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.450 
these solutions, you need to
administrate these solutions,

151
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.290 
you have a set-up
effort, it's not

152
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.320 
just already there, you need to
do something about that, you

153
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.400 
need to have the right people to
do that the right expertise

154
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.910 
in your company to do that ...
technicians... technicians.

155
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.620 
But you have the full
control in the

156
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.170 
end ... and it's open
source then i know what

157
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.840 
is happening with
everything in the back...

158
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.150 
If you have someone who is
able to read the code

159
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.840 
and then, of course, you
have the community

160
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.960 
so it's open source, everybody
can see what is happening then,

161
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.420 
if there is something fishy
going on in these tools, there

162
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.110 
would be someone to make it
public, sooner or later.

163
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.060 
Perfect Tom. A really nice overview
on the different options

164
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.440 
that we can to select from.
Again, privacy and security are

165
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.330 
the main issues, of
course, related to the

166
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.660 
pricing, I believe outside in
the community, there are

167
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.610 
many tools that the people are
using for video conferencing,

168
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.750 
For sharing tools, why
don't you join us in the

169
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.280 
discussion, and a please comment,
and we would be really happy

170
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.080 
to discuss with you what is
the situation currently.

171
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.590 
Thank you Tom,
thank you Salim.

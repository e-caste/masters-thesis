00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.570 
In our openHPI course Cyberthreats by Malware, now we want to discuss

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.840 
different types of malware. We want to speak about viruses, worms and trojans.

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.930 
There is plendy of malware and there is a huge number of

4
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.390 
cyber attacks every day, the news report about a new case of cyber attack

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.500 
against human, cyber attack against companies, against services and these cyber

6
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.050 
attacks are performed by very different types of malware.

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.330 
And for that reason we want to take a closer look to

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.310 
the different types of malware

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.670 
that are possible and what is useful is to differentiate malware

10
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.890 
into different groups. And traditionally

11
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.970 
speaking about malware, one speaks about viruses, one speaks about worms

12
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.500 
and trojans and these are very specific types of hardware

13
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.390 
but today it is challenging to do this because today see the most recent

14
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.920 
attacks they use many functionality of these different types of malware.

15
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.160 
So when we speak about viruses, worms and trojans, then these terms

16
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.290 
were brought up back in the 1980s and defined different pieces

17
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.060 
of malware. Today the malware developer use many different approaches

18
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.510 
and pieces of code to make malware more efficient.

19
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.380 
They use the different functionality of this

20
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.270 
mentioned malware. Today it is hard to differentiate current malware into this original

21
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.990 
types. But in the following we will introduce all the original types of malware

22
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.640 
and differentiate them based on how malware

23
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
spreads. So let's start with viruses.

24
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.370 
Viruses often are used as a synonym for all kinds of malware.

25
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.950 
You can see this when we speak about anti-virus systems, which

26
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.020 
need to be installed on each computer.

27
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.740 
This anti-virus software is not only to prevent virus attacks, it also

28
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.280 
is useful to prevent attacks with other malware but it is simply called

29
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.270 
anti-virus software. So if we have a closer look, virus is a malware

30
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.380 
that is characterized, that it spreads locally on a computer.

31
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.150 
A computer is a host, it could also be a smartphone

32
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.220 
or a tablet. So if this malware reaches a host

33
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.380 
computer or a smartphone, for example by inserting a USB stick

34
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.320 
it can infect the system in different ways.

35
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.990 
So some malware may need human interactions, so that a human

36
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.720 
clicks on some point or or follows a link or

37
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.450 
does other actions. Other

38
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.430 
viruses spreading rely on abusing vulnerabilities

39
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.690 
or errors of the software, of the applications that are installed

40
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:35.430 
on the host. So they use and spread and infect this host autonomously.

41
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.630 
In this same sense malware then spreads through different files,

42
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.630 
to the programs, to the data, to the processes and

43
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.410 
at the end the computers the system is affected.

44
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.040 
The severity of such virus attacks

45
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.870 
that are caused by the malware by the malware viruses

46
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.730 
range from causing annoying effects

47
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.340 
not too simple but not nice to have,

48
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.400 
up to damaging data, damaging software or even hardware.

49
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.170 
So often there is no clear definition. Viruses often are used

50
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.250 
as a generic term for all kind of malware. I mentioned this already.

51
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.430 
There is another type of malware - these are the worms.

52
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.280 
The worm is a malware that can spread its copies over the network

53
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.010 
and in the internet. So in that way, the infection of a new system

54
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.740 
is often started automatically by abusing vulnerabilities of certain software

55
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.370 
that's installed on the computers that are reachable over the network.

56
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.980 
Sometimes also here human interactions are necessary to start this spreading effect.

57
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.820 
Sometimes it works without such human interaction.

58
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.850 
Often worms have similar characteristic like viruses.

59
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.230 
They have also the ability to spread in a system.

60
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.030 
Because they spread through a network, worms spread faster than viruses.

61
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.260 
Here is an example the Code-Red in 2001

62
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.680 
this is the infection

63
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.030 
speed. Hopefully you can see this. You see if we have starting from a simple

64
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.750 
system, here is seen how it works. So within one day, so

65
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.330 
we are on July 19th,

66
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.840 
more and more victims around all the world are infected by this code.

67
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.250 
Within one day, here you see victims meanwhile are

68
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.010 
three hundred and fifty thousand starting from a few infected systems,

69
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.790 
worm spread over the internet and within a couple of hours

70
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.670 
it infected a huge part of the

71
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.240 
computers around the world.

72
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.370 
To give you an example for such a worm, I

73
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.980 
will shortly introduce the ILOVEYOU worm. It becomes very

74
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.610 
very popular. It was a worm that misused social engineering techniques

75
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.560 
to infect other systems

76
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.980 
and the infection was performed via email.

77
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.610 
There was a mail sent to other users

78
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.410 
with the statement "I love you".

79
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.630 
So in this mail the subject was ILOVEYOU and then there was an attachment.

80
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.900 
And the attachment of this email was an alleged love letter.

81
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.180 
A love letter for you and you see it's a little bit

82
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.570 
difficult and cumbersome

83
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.620 
if you consider this ending of this letter.

84
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.520 
So this letter contains we can see it here a visual basic script

85
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.230 
and this script was executed,

86
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.570 
executed malicious program code in the moment when the attachment is opened.

87
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:39.120 
So the file extensions of course were hidden, were not displayed otherwise people were

88
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.050 
wondering, I would say, oh what's that. No it was not displayed.

89
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.070 
So a lot of people clicked on this attachment, opened the attachment

90
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.690 
and at that moment they started the infection

91
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.740 
by the worm that are in this basic script written and sent.

92
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.920 
And the idea as a functionality of this ILOVEYOU worm was

93
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.340 
that the email address book of the infected victim was misused

94
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:19.730 
and misused in a way that the letter itself distributed to all the people

95
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.300 
in the email address book of that user.

96
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.740 
So other users often which are known to the user get a letter

97
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.590 
I love you and

98
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:38.750 
try to see what is that foreign message and then they

99
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.530 
open the attachment and in this moment,

100
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.860 
the worm, the infection was started.

101
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:55.830 
Another malware was the Safety Mask. Very recent in the Corona situation.

102
00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:02.710 
The construction was done very similar to ILOVEYOU.

103
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.410 
And here you see what you get it was particularly for smartphones,

104
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.150 
get safety from corona virus by using face .

105
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.230 
Click on this link, download the app, and then order a mask.

106
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.170 
Particularly in the beginning of the corona pandemic,

107
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:28.190 
people get this information and they clicked and

108
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:35.390 
in that moment they start the download and the installation of a worm

109
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.810 
on their system and the system got infected.

110
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.590 
Also here the phone address book was misused by this malware

111
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.390 
to organize distribution

112
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.020 
via SMS to other users getting similar information and click

113
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.650 
on it and infected the system.

114
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.000 
If we look to another type of malware,

115
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.540 
trojans. Trojans is a malware that

116
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.780 
disguises itself as a genuine and useful application

117
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:19.450 
and tricks behind the scene the target to install another malware.

118
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:25.860 
It works on smartphones, it works on any kind of host, on computer and laptops,

119
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:33.370 
on target and the idea is that in this malware in the trojan

120
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:40.100 
that looks like a useful application, some malicious functionality is hidden

121
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.410 
which is not known for the user who downloads the software

122
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.680 
and when he downloads the software because he thinks it is helpful to me,

123
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.430 
he downloads the malware which are hidden in that

124
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.560 
trojan. So in that trojan

125
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:03.010 
this come from the Greek history with the trojan horses.

126
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.440 
So malicious functions are executed in parallel to the inspected functionality.

127
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.360 
So true trojans have different objects.

128
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.690 
They are misused to install so called backdoors.

129
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.070 
Backdoors is for the attacker possibility

130
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.490 
to get access to the victim's system without authentication.

131
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.630 
So he gets an entrance to the victim's systems so he can see

132
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.470 
the data, he can manipulate things like the user can do.

133
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.050 
Other trojans, they have the object

134
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.980 
to install spyware. And spyware monitors the user.

135
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:55.620 
Spyware monitors and sends information of the victim's systems

136
00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:01.270 
by capturing keyboard typings, gaining access to microphone or webcam

137
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:06.620 
or others to learn more about the user, for example to prepare

138
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:14.810 
bigger attack. And then and this is most often, trojan provide the possibility

139
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:23.310 
to install malware that turns the system into a botnet

140
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:31.040 
member. And botnet is the situation that the victim's systems is connected

141
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.350 
to a network of other hijacked and remotely controlled systems,

142
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.920 
then to launch cyber attacks. So we will speak in more detail

143
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.910 
later in another lecture.

144
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.670 
Here we only see how dangerous trojans are because they

145
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:56.210 
provide so many different possibilities to infect the system

146
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.650 
by malicious software.

147
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.750 
Another often in connection with trojans used malware attacks

148
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.580 
is to install a downloader,

149
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:14.520 
so that automatically other malware are downloaded from the internet

150
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:22.120 
to infect the system, for example download like the famous ransomware or worms.

151
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:29.540 
To give a concrete example, let's look to the BlackNET trojan RAT.

152
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:38.390 
This is a trojan that utilizes see also COVID-19 pandemic.

153
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:44.150 
It utilizes a phishing website that encourage users to download software

154
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.450 
to protect their computer against COVID-19 viruses.

155
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:55.160 
Of course it's not true, computers cannot be infected by COVID. But

156
00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:00.180 
many people are not careful and think, its good as a protection against

157
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:07.090 
Corona, an anti-virus they download this malware and when they have

158
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.700 
this malware downloaded, it is installed and infects the computer

159
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.710 
so that the

160
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:22.280 
host computer becomes bot, then can be controlled from outside, from the hacker

161
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.650 
for example to misuse them as an attack computer as attack system

162
00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.500 
when they performs attacks to other systems.

163
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.520 
So a BlackNET RAT is capable of launching

164
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.820 
distributed denial of service attacks, this is an attack from

165
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.970 
a botnet when the attacker starts at the same moment many many hijacked

166
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.190 
the spot computer to perform a denial-of-service attack.

167
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.900 
They are able to take screenshots, stealing passwords, cookies

168
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.440 
bitcoin wallets and others.

malware, we see in a mixed form but this was originally too

171
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:15.090 
characteristic of this different type of malware and it's interesting to know it

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.130

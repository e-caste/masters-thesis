1
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.320 
So now we want to talk about
the process from a different angle.

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.960 
So we were looking at it as a process to

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.720 
develop products and services and
solve complex problems.

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.200 
And you might think this is just

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.080 
for external use, just for the things
we're putting outside.

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.160 
But no, we figured out through the last
years you can use the same process

7
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.040 
with all the complex challenges you are
seeing also inside the organization,

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.120 
changing your whole business concept,
your management strategy and so on.

9
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.800 
Exactly.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.480 
So therefore, you can also use design
thinking for Internet questions that are

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.320 
around developing your business designs
and new business opportunities,

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.360 
but also to change organizational
wise your way of working.

13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.160 
So your HR activities, for example,

14
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.120 
or also how to incentivize
people, teams, et cetera.,

15
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.400 
and you can also use it
for that strategic vision.

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.440 
So just consider as an example,
a company that has been manufacturing cars

17
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.520 
till now, how to actually create
that strategic process in order to become

18
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.520 
a company that will offer
mobility in the future.

19
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.800 
Could be also questions, challenges for
design, thinking projects and processes.

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.920 
Where we started 12 years ago, we were
actually focusing very much on product

21
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.200 
and service development
together with the industry.

22
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.840 
You were getting a lot of big partners

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.240 
coming up to us and they were making
use of the student capacities here.

24
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.720 
But through the time and very,
very soon actually, we found out,

25
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.240 
yes, we can address different fields,
not just the business field,

26
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.120 
also the social field, the real
social startups approaching us,

27
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.560 
social good social organizations
approaching us, but also public entities,

28
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.200 
Governments started approaching us,
administrations.

29
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.960 
So therefore, as the business oriented way
of doing design thinking might be about

30
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.520 
creating new market opportunities,
designing with nonprofit organizations

31
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.600 
and also social startups is actually
about designing for impact.

32
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.520 
So the only thing that actually
changes here is the measurement.

33
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.120 
How do you actually measure what
the objectives you want to achieve?

34
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.920 
As I said, market opportunities
and then also designing for impact.

35
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.120 
And this also holds true
for public challenges as well.

36
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.920 
This here is actually about how
to make an impact on the system.

37
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.720 
And finally, we also want to share a piece
of advice with you,

38
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.960 
learnings that we actually have
been gaining by doing design

39
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.640 
thinking here at the School of Design
thinking at the HPI for more than 12

40
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.080 
years.

41
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.880 
That's actually about how to structure

42
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.720 
in a more thoughtful way
your design thinking iterations.

43
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.480 
And if you consider doing a project that's

44
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.120 
actually is meaningful and will,
for example, take three to six month,

45
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.200 
it makes sense to start with a fast
forward that might be just a day or just

46
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.440 
one week where you're about to discover
what's actually in that challenge.

47
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.000 
It's not just about the problem

48
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.240 
and finding solutions,
but it's also about gaining a common

49
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.640 
understanding about what's the scope
of opportunities that you then are about

50
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.760 
to address in the following
three iterations.

51
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.400 
Or you can also call them
design thinking sprints.

52
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.440 
The first really long iteration that we

53
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.680 
are suggesting here is then about "Define".
The objective of this iteration is

54
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.560 
actually to come up with idea concepts
that are refined and already also tested.

55
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.640 
And the general aim is not just have
a broad array of ideas somewhere around,

56
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.320 
but also by clustering and structuring
them to have strategic fields

57
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.200 
of opportunity where you actually
want to head further into.

58
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.560 
To give you one example,
we have been doing one project together.

59
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.600 
with several project partners about
security control at the airport.

60
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.600 
And strategic fields of opportunities
that we have been identifying in order

61
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.920 
to smoothen the process of getting through
the security control as a customer.

62
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.840 
So as somebody who was about to take

63
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.520 
a flight, let us think for example,
from the perspective of the security

64
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.040 
personnel to say, hey, we can
actually optimize the process flow.

65
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.560 
And the idea the team had was like
a bag and a system of bags that makes it

66
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.120 
faster for customers to unpack
and repack their stuff.

67
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.960 
The second field of opportunity

68
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.120 
that the team did identify was about
signaling to the users how to actually

69
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.760 
maneuver through the security control by,
for example, using a traffic light system

70
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.160 
that indicates we have green and red
lights when you actually have the chance

71
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.240 
to take a step further into the line and
also through the security control itself.

72
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.920 
And the third one was about something
different.

73
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.920 
It was actually about the appreciation
of the employees,

74
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.320 
because you can also optimize the process,
but you can also

75
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.800 
motivate people to deliver a good service
quality by giving them appreciation.

76
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.720 
And that starts with uniforms, with shoes,
but also rooms to have breaks.

77
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.320 
And also a system of shift changes

78
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.320 
that actually further accommodates
them into the whole system.

79
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.680 
After having made well informed choices

80
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.560 
about which field of strategic
opportunity you'd like to pick.

81
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.120 
You then continue in the next iteration.

82
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.360 
The next iteration
or design thinking

83
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.440 
sprint is actually about further

84
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.720 
developing the idea build on the notion
of co-innovation and co-design.

85
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.360 
So what we're doing here is we don't
start all over again from the beginning,

86
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.720 
we do start with the concept ideas we
already have,

87
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.280 
and by integrating the future users,
but also the ones we're about to deliver

88
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.680 
the product or the service and other
experts,

89
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.320 
we're creating more refined prototypes
and have then also solutions that are far

90
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.040 
more closer to minimal viable product
than in the initial iteration stage.

91
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.880 
The last design thinking Sprint is

92
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.520 
actually about "Deliver" and that's
designing for implementation.

93
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.560 
So again, for example,
in the field of the airport security

94
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.800 
control, we decided to further
continue with the back idea.

95
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.440 
So that means that actually the team came

96
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.120 
out at the end with the final
product, but also an understanding about

97
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.680 
whom do they need to start producing it
and also how much will it cost at the end.

98
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.320 
So therefore, they already had,

99
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.080 
at the end of this iteration, a product
that was ready to be implemented

100
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.640 
aka meant to be
rolled out in the market.

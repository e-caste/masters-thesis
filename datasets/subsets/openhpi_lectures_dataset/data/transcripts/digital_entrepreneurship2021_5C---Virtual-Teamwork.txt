00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.332 
Not just since the epidemic of covid-19 teams increasingly

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.529 
collaborate, more children in digital entrepreneurship teams frequently

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.859 
rely on virtual means of collaboration and progressive work from home policies.

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.079 
Therefore, we as partnership researchers are interested in

5
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.340 
the impact of virtual communication on the facets of teamwork.

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.769 
In this session, we address the question of how we can assess virtual

7
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.729 
teamwork, and we will highlight a key influencing factor.

8
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.330 
Nina and I welcome you to this video now advancing

9
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
digital means of communication has substantially changed teamwork.

10
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.009 
While virtual collaboration has been catalyzed during recent times, research

11
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.629 
and practice concerning virtual teams has evolved considerably over the course

12
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.710 
of two decades.

13
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.400 
And yet the foundational insights of team research still apply.

14
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.549 
But today's reality of virtual work, the missing invisible fabrics that keep

15
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.079 
us close, requires adapted ways of thinking, meaning how

16
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.030 
team processes emerge in states as well as structural and compositional features

17
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.520 
contribute to team effectiveness.

18
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.109 
Whereas earlier studies used to make a distinction between

19
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.295 
co-located teams and virtual teams, current research is employing

20
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.349 
the concept of virtuality when studying teamwork enabled through digital

21
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.999 
means, according to the team scholars Bradley Corkman and John

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.940 
Traumatism team, which reality refers to the extent to which

23
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.214 
team members use virtual tools to coordinate and execute

24
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.099 
team processes, the amount of informational value provided by such

25
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.839 
tools, and the city of team member virtual interaction.

26
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.389 
In other words, do you all first define what or not based on a question

27
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.959 
what a team's work, virtually or not.

28
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.410 
Instead, virginity is based on three continuous dimensions

29
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:15.479 
to extent of reliance on virtual tools for informational value

30
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.199 
they carry and the synchronicity of these tools.

31
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.586 
Probably you noticed that this definition does not include team members geographical

32
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.460 
distance to each other.

33
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.640 
As an example, let us imagine a team that works together in the same building,

34
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.182 
however, first, instead of meeting face to face, they rely

35
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.919 
heavily on digital communication tools.

36
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.960 
Second, these tools are used in a way that does not carry much information.

37
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.779 
For example, when they have long chats instead of efficiently carrying out video calls.

38
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.479 
And third, it takes team members quite a while to respond, which makes

39
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.819 
interaction less synchronous.

40
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.172 
So despite being de GraphicLy close to each other, they score a high

41
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.569 
level of virtuality.

42
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.131 
Differentiating these three dimensions helps researchers to measure the extent of virtual

43
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.249 
work and to look for more nuanced influences of related factors

44
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.990 
such as the team's climate.

45
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.593 
Since we are talking about team climate factories, let us point out

46
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.669 
one of the most important qualities of teamwork, especially for virtual

47
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.289 
collaboration, that is psychological safety, coined

48
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.119 
by psychologist Abby Edmondson from Harvard Business School team, psychological

49
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.219 
safety is defined as a shared belief that a team is safe

50
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.749 
for interpersonal risk taking.

51
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.729 
It is worth noting that this concept does not refer to a cozy

52
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.848 
environment, but instead indicates a team climate in

53
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.869 
which it feels safe to speak up and to contribute relevant information

54
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.679 
and where members can engage in productive discussions.

55
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.659 
In an often highlighted two year study that Google conducted of two

56
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.519 
of their teams in two thousand fifteen, psychological safety was identified

57
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.559 
as the key factor for successful teamwork, which has brought further attention

58
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.360 
to the question of how psychological safety can be nurtured in teams.

59
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.150 
Following a recent study to this issue by Alexandra listener Anuta Mortlock,

60
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.100 
three practices to cultivate psychological safety come into question.

61
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.189 
First, accepting virtual team challenges.

62
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.636 
This means that teams acknowledge issues such as the more difficult day to

63
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.978 
day processes when working virtually or when subgroups are communicating

64
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.490 
in separate bubbles.

65
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.999 
The authors recommend, for example, to proactively discuss these problems with the team

66
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.850 
and to reframe them as opportunities.

67
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.966 
Second, by connecting as human beings, as the authors elaborate,

68
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.249 
this implies to demonstrate genuine interest, to share appropriate

69
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.079 
non-work related information and to create new experiences together.

70
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.069 
For instance, this can involve virtual team building activities.

71
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.850 
And third, by discussing the rules of the game, to put it differently,

72
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.230 
this means to develop team norms and a code of conduct for virtual work

73
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.509 
to iterate the selection of digital tools according to the team's needs, and

74
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.910 
to agree on shared goals and responsibilities in the virtual environment.

75
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.639 
Certainly a high level of psychological safety is not a panacea

76
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.070 
to remedy for other issues. The team is facing yet empirically and has

77
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.850 
been found to substantially and positively influenced team effectiveness.

78
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.379 
In perspective, the nature of teamwork is changing rapidly in

79
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.130 
the light of retreat or desired virtual collaboration.

80
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.769 
Following a recent commentary by the Reno team scholar Deborah and Cona

81
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.259 
and her colleagues, existing change has been accelerated,

82
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.399 
for example, with regard to increasingly blurry team boundaries and memberships.

83
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.339 
And change has been introduced when we think of decontextualized

84
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.560 
socialization of new team members.

85
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.019 
This also holds true for entrepreneurial teams, potentially even more

86
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.579 
so, as they often cannot rely on the established processes and

87
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.610 
structures that are common in large organizations.

88
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.089 
Still, the rich body of research on teams can point to crucial

89
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.989 
factors at a wolf while addressing such as psychological safety.

90
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.569 
Hopefully this brief introduction into two concepts that are key for virtual

91
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.000 
teamwork, namely spirituality and psychological safety, could give you

92
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.579 
some insight. And we look forward to seeing you in the next video.

93
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.089 
Bye bye.

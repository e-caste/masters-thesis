00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.020 
In our openHPI course about digital
identities, now we want to have a

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.210 
closer look to social
engineering attacks

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.660 
on provider, on service provider with
the goal to steal digital identities.

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.610 
We already discussed such attacks
against the user of services.

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.050 
Such social engineering attacks
with the goal to get sensitive

6
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.080 
data, to get the digital identity of
a user, but this attack can also

7
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.870 
be directed against
the service provider,

8
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
against the employees of the
service provider. And the idea is

9
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.010 
to provoke them, to force
them, to bring them

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.860 
that they do something which helps
them to get access, for example,

11
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.230 
on an identity data of a
user of that service.

12
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.230 
For example, cybercriminals perform
such social engineering attacks

13
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.070 
on service provider employees to provoke
them to provoke certain activities,

14
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.140 
for example to take over a digital
identity of a registered user.

15
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.120 
To this end, the cybercriminal
pretends to be the rightful owner

16
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.640 
of the digital identity.
He wants to steal,

17
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.100 
and the more information the
attacker has about the victim,

18
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.120 
the more credible he appears. The more
the employee of the service provider

19
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.830 
believes him and interacts
with him. So at the end, the

20
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.920 
employee believes the
attacker and the

21
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.580 
attacker gets the digital identity of a
user in its hand although this victim,

22
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.610 
this user does not identify, doesn't notice
that his digital identity has been stolen.

23
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.540 
So what are typical attack vectors
against a service provider employees?

24
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.130 
One is to force them
to reset a password.

25
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.440 
So the attacker convince the service
provider, convince the helpdesk

26
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.350 
of the service provider
to reset a password of

27
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.560 
user he claims to be, and hijacks
the process to choose a new

28
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.830 
password. You know there is an
email sent, and then one has to

29
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.260 
answer that, has to give in the new
password. He gets access and then

30
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.360 
the attacker has the password to that
digital identity which belongs

31
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.360 
to his user digital identity and then
the attacker can misuse this

32
00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.910 
and the rightful user has no
chance. So the service provider

33
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.450 
typically they want to help the user very
quickly, to make the users happy and

34
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.820 
to feel that it's really a
good organized service.

35
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.930 
So sometimes identification,
verification of the identity

36
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.190 
of the party that asked for a
reset of the password is not

37
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.660 
completely checked. So the
attacker manages to

38
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.550 
to start such a procedure
and gets in this way, the

39
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.260 
digital identity of the user gets in this way
in the hand of the attacker. So usability

40
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.850 
for security, this
we have seen often

41
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.640 
because something needs to be
done fast or is very urgent or

42
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.840 
the service is really needed
the attacker claims because of

43
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.170 
some very serious problem so the people
from the help desk want to help

44
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.870 
and do not

45
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.820 
do not completely verify the identity

46
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.310 
of the user. So they
do something

47
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.670 
which is forced by the
attacker and not

48
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.890 
not by the user.

49
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.630 
Another attack vector is to
change to provide change in the

50
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.530 
two factor authentication. You remember
the two factor authentication

51
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.290 
is a more, much
more secure way to

52
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.360 
to authenticate a user, to
authenticate a digital identity.

53
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.410 
So beside of a giving password,
also for example a TAN is asked

54
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.740 
which is sent to the smartphone
or a card needs to be shown or

55
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.660 
other things. So
here in this

56
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.540 
category of attacks, the attacker
convinces the service provider employee

57
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.500 
to reset the second or the third
factor of the authentication.

58
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.570 
For example he claims that he
has lost his phone and got a new

59
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.920 
phone number,
so that the

60
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.510 
TAN which is sent as SMS to the
user is no more sent to the user,

61
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.400 
it sent to the new phone number
and that's the phone number of the

62
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.770 
attacker. Or disable a second factor
because the attacker claims

63
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.790 
I lost the phone
and I have

64
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.200 
very urgently
to do some

65
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.730 
money transfer
or other things.

66
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.420 
So let's have a closer look
on this password reset

67
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.500 
attack. The goal is to
access, to get access

68
00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.420 
to account via new password
and the attack method by

69
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:07.390 
social engineering works as follows. The attacker
convince the service provider employee

70
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:15.300 
to reset a new email address
due to a "lost email account".

71
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.970 
So, hello, can you please set a
new password for my account?

72
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.640 
And then, easily gettable secret
questions are common vulnerabilities.

73
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.780 
You know, if there is a new account
then you need it you have to answer

74
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.990 
some some questions for security, so
that the service can check whether

75
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.310 
the real owner of the
identity is on the other side

76
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.430 
and not only an attacker. And often
the security questions are very

77
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:59.370 
easily designed and it's not difficult
for attackers to guess this and to answer

78
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.570 
in a right way.

79
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.700 
If we look to another attack,
then the following is the

80
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.720 
Man-in-the-Middle attack. Here the
attacker initiates a password reset

81
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:23.100 
request. So the attacker
calls the service, hello,

82
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.980 
can you please set a new password
in my account and sure, but

83
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.310 
please tell me first in which city
you were born. These are typically,

84
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.610 
these are such typical

85
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.870 
security
questions. It is

86
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.610 
simply easy for an attacker which
spied out the user before,

87
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.430 
his victim before, could for
example find on the website some

88
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.040 
personal data about him
and then, hello, due to a

89
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.330 
technicality if the attacker
is not able to find out this

90
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.870 
information on a website, he
calls the victim and explains

91
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.900 
I am the service
provider

92
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.340 
and I need to
do something

93
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.570 
to verify your account. So hello due
to a technical problem, we need your

94
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.870 
phone number and in which city you
were born and then the victim

95
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.790 
answers this and then the attacker can
tell this information to the service

96
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.230 
and succeeds. And if we have a look
to the change, to the attack

97
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.250 
that aims to change something,
the two-factor authentication,

98
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.350 
then by means of social
engineering of this approach,

99
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.680 
this approach is successful, convince
the mobile phone provider

100
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.460 
to send a new sim card
due to a lost phone

101
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.120 
and then convince the
service provider

102
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.310 
employee of the internet service to
send new TAN to the new phone number.

103
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.930 
Also here a Man-in
the-Middle attack

104
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.510 
approach is possible -

105
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.410 
exploit vulnerabilities especially in
the mobile phone, network protocols

106
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.650 
SS7 protocols to
intercept SMS-TANs.

107
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.930 
For example PayPal, your security
code is - then the code is sent

108
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.830 
and your code expires in ten
minutes, please don't reply and

109
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.350 
if this code gets into the hand
of the attacker because it

110
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.350 
is sent to the customer but the attacker
has placed himself in the middle

111
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.700 
of this communication line, then
the attacker can make changes

112
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.630 
in the authentication
system.

113
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:46.650 
So with social engineering attacks,
not only the users of online services

114
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:53.350 
are in danger but also an attacker
for such social engineering attacks

115
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.990 
are the
providers, are the

116
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.410 
employees of the
providers, are the

117
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.810 
help desk or the
telephone provider

118
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.890 
every time with the goal to
theft digital identities.

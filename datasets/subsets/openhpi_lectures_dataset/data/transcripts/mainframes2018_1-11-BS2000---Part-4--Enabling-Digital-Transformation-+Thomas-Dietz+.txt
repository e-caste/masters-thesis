00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.549 
Hello and welcome to this MOOC session.

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.550 
My name is Thomas Dietz.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.033 
In this session, which will be a final session of the SE infrastructure

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.029 
part, I will introduce you to the topic of digital transformation

5
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.279 
and the role of the mainframe in it.

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.319 
The digital transformation journey moves organizations from a process defined village

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.760 
to a data driven world.

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.459 
Digital collapses processes into data, and data enables

9
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.899 
speed. A data driven world enables delivering an end

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.269 
to end customer experience.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.829 
And as you remember, data are located to a large extent on

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.449 
mainframes. Unlocking the door and connecting mainframe data by

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.079 
new methods is key for success in the digital arena.

14
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.750 
Integration and connecting data is nothing new for BS 2000 mainframes.

15
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.309 
As easy to use is built for hybrid computing.

16
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.899 
Running different applications takes in an optimized environment for this

17
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.489 
application secure, available, connected and managed

18
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.049 
centrally. Typical use cases are multi tier

19
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.699 
applications home grown mainframe core applications

20
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.289 
in a BS 2000 runtime environment can collaborate with

21
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.170 
arbitrary SU applications very smart.

22
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.739 
This is enabled by a SOA, service orientated architecture.

23
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.509 
It allows flexible adoption and the integration of well-established mainframe

24
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.650 
applications in modernized, integrated new applications.

25
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.923 
Mainframes do this in a comprehensive way since centuries.

26
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.929 
Legacy integration is a basic task for mainframe environments at

27
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.010 
IT operations site, as well as in the application operation.

28
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.008 
The advantage is the ability to use Rock-Solid Mainframe Applications

29
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.023 
together with most current technologies.

30
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.449 
SOA is a well established way of application integration.

31
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.189 
But the world is still turning and requires more agile, more flexible

32
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.600 
ways to combine mainframe data with new style applications.

33
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.119 
Application integration based on the web-based representation

34
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.829 
is available for BS 2000 transaction forms-based application

35
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.333 
for a long time byproduct called Web DA.

36
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.592 
In the meantime, new types of applications entered the space

37
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.239 
cloud native containerized microservices,

38
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.739 
which may be the future

39
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.179 
of application development.

40
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.359 
This requires a new approach to connect these services to actionable

41
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.860 
data on mainframes.

42
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.129 
The de facto standard for data transfer and data communication on all rest APIs.

43
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.319 
The presentational state transfer.

44
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.099 
So this is based based on http verbs, get,

45
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.199 
put, post, delete.

46
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.289 
To re-create, update and delete data.

47
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.169 
And once again, the mainframe has adapted to the new technology

48
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.550 
and provides rest APIs for its available transaction processing.

49
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.549 
So the new microservices can make use of mainframe data,

50
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.060 
as you know, data is the new currency in the connected world.

51
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.939 
But unlocking the door to mainframe data is only one part

52
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.940 
of the game.

53
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.990 
Adopting mainframe application itself to new requirements in the mortgage holiday

54
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.569 
may result as an requirement out of a digitalization agenda at the

55
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.129 
customer. So this is already possible by using a modernized tool

56
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.719 
environment for mainframe software development and especially when

57
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.299 
you're thinking about DevOps.

58
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.979 
Think also about the culture change related to it when going

59
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.869 
the way of continuous deployment and operation and feedback from your operations

60
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.329 
team. In the area of artificial intelligence,

61
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.410 
there are at least two areas where mainframes can make a difference.

62
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.469 
At the IT operations side integrated machine learning can provide

63
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.659 
better insight into mainframe operation, leading to an operational

64
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.660 
intelligence.

65
00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.080 
At the application site robotic process automation

66
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.919 
can help customers providing their clients with an enhanced user experience

67
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.860 
while reducing company internal effort to do so.

68
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.989 
Mainframes can also make use of technologies like blockchain or

69
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.729 
generally by using a distributed ledger technology

70
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.499 
to add certain functions to existing transaction systems

71
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.782 
BS 2000. For example, by using GLT

72
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.529 
in a government community as consortium blockchains to secure audit

73
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.389 
trails when exchanging data inside a community.

74
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.249 
Or for smart contracts, which means an automated escrow

75
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.839 
for insurance enterprises.

76
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.839 
These are some examples of connected services that support

77
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.759 
digital transformation comprehensively.

78
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.249 
And BS 2000 mainframes, we support customers on their journey to digital,

79
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.869 
addressing the need for an end to end integrated approach here

80
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.869 
to avoid the digital disconnect.

81
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.699 
From increasing efficiency and profitability through improving customer

82
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.559 
experience, to enabling new business models, we help them to realize

83
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.999 
their digital ambitions and respond effectively to increasing

84
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.600 
demands for the business, their customers and the market.

85
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.529 
Fujitsu Continues adoption of the modern interfaces to interconnected microservices

86
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.659 
will ensure that the mainframe will remain as a mission critical part

87
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.429 
in the modern world of artificial intelligence and robotics.

88
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.330 
This also includes adoption of new technology like SE series

89
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.169 
with an integrated approach of running core BS 2000 applications,

90
00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:00.689 
together with new applications in an integrated environment.

91
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.129 
Using data analytics, IT transformation in a secure

92
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.509 
way and using your applications on BS 2000.

93
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.789 
As you have seen, these two thousand mainframes are nothing to be static at all.

94
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.969 
They are constantly changing and adapting.

95
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.099 
How about helping shape the digital future with mainframes?

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.830 
In our OpenHPI course Cyberthreats
by malware we now

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.030 
speak about
Ransomware.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.490 
Ransomware is a malware that denies
victims access to their systems,

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.220 
typically way is that all important
files on the systems are encrypted,

5
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.390 
so the victim or the user cannot understand,
can no more use, can no more access

6
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.790 
his system, his data,
or his programs.

7
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.990 
So the name ransomware is
derived from the word 'ransom' or extortion

8
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.170 
and ware from software.

9
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.210 
And the general approach of
this malware is after infection

10
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.640 
the blackmailers
demand a ransom

11
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.710 
for unlocking the system,
for decrypting the files,

12
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.510 
for giving the users access
to his own systems.

13
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.800 
And of course they user is
forced to offer a pay

14
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.320 
for that typically by a cryptocurrency,
bitcoin, or money pack

15
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.010 
or other online
payment methods.

16
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.600 
But be careful before
you pay as there is no

17
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.510 
guarantee that the
victims will be able

18
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.730 
to fully access their system
again after the payment.

19
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.810 
So the German cyber security
authority BSI recommends

20
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.550 
not to pay. So this is really dangerous
for the people and many people

21
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.500 
lose data for it, but it's not only
a problem for private persons,

22
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.410 
also in hospitals
and other

23
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.980 
institutions that got infected
by such as randomware attacks

24
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.830 
it causes a huge amount of problems.
How ransomware is installed in

25
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.100 
the target systems
of the victims?

26
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.260 
There are different ways by opening
malicious email attachments,

27
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.010 
behind the attachment or
inside of the attachment,

28
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.920 
malicious software is
involved. Such a ransomware

29
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.890 
is hidden and involved
by installing fake software

30
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.360 
with malware, we discussed already
different types of other malwares

31
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.880 
that can be used to bring
such ransomware software

32
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.390 
to your computer or by
accessing malicious websites.

33
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.080 
And the question is, how you can realize
that there is a ransomware

34
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.170 
attack or how it
becomes noticeable?

35
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.170 
If for example the screen is
blocked or there is no way

36
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.520 
to interact with
your system,

37
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.390 
an alert or a pop-up
message or

38
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.210 
blackmail letter is
shown and displayed

39
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.250 
or the system failed
to work at all.

40
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.970 
Some ransomware variants initially
sleep in the system, so they infect

41
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.260 
the system not immediately after
downloading this ransomware, and are later

42
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.210 
switched on by the attacker if they
think that's a good situation to

43
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.340 
start the attack
against the user.

44
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.060 
Let's look to some
examples, Wannacry

45
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.480 
is a famous
ransomware

46
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.250 
worldwide visible.

47
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.550 
It was a ransomware campaign in
the year 2017,

48
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.440 
This maliciousware
attack made use of malicious code,

49
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.780 
the Eternal Blue, which was originally
leaked from the National Security Agency

50
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:33.270 
of the USA and it targeted windows
systems without security updates.

51
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.540 
They were able in the
year 2017 to infect

52
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.720 
more than 200,000 computers.

53
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.310 
For the 200,000 computers,

54
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.720 
the user could no more access
the system, could no more

55
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.660 
access their data.

56
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.630 
So here in that case the
data, the hard disk was

57
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.240 
encrypted on such infected
systems and later

58
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.920 
it was offered that one can pay and
later it was eventually unlocked

59
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.870 
after the victims
paid bitcoins.

60
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.210 
And what was the problem, and why did the
attack became so popular was

61
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.990 
that very sensitive areas of society
were infected by this Wannacry

62
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.360 
attack. Critical infrastructures,
hospitals, energy utilities.

63
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.850 
So here is an example,

64
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.690 
you see the system is
blocked, here is shown

65
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.520 
no more work. Here is shown
if you look to this message,

66
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870 
then there is an explanation what
happened with your computer,

67
00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.700 
how can I recover my files and
then it's clear one has to pay

68
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.960 
and then the question
is how to pay?

69
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.060 
And here you see the details
what needs to be done, is there

70
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.360 
is a time limit, there is
the amount that you have to pay

71
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.530 
to get the key
to unlock

72
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.550 
your system that you can recover
your data, that you can

73
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:31.230 
work with your system. But I mentioned,
and I repeat it again,

74
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.790 
it's not recommended to pay for
it because it's not clear whether

75
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.720 
the attacker would really

76
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.100 
unlock your system.
Here's another example,

77
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.920 
you see also a perfect
one, Covid lock.

78
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:57.460 
So here it's disguised itself as useful
smartphone app that helps to track

79
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.020 
COVID infections so it
was exactly adapted

80
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:10.150 
to the situation we have in the
COVID 19 pandemic. So

81
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:17.030 
the current campaign exploiting
concerns about COVID and SARS,

82
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.010 
and they promise

83
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.630 
to provide statistics and map

84
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.190 
about the spread of the
virus in the victim's area.

85
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.950 
The people downloaded this and
then the system

86
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.490 
was blocked

87
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:47.520 
of the user typically
smartphone and it asked a ransom

88
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.180 
of 250 dollars.

89
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:59.490 
It encrypts the contacts, it
encrypts pictures, it encrypts

90
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:05.650 
videos on the smartphone, so the
user can no more use smartphone

91
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.580 
in the right way.

92
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.850 
The internet is not used by ransomware,
for example data is not

93
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.580 
uploaded to the attacker server, the
logo description is not very easy or

94
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.780 
impossible to crack, so as
this was an attack which

95
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.820 
could be even more dangerous

96
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:35.720 
by taking the data, but here
the unlock code if you are paying

97
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.700 
then you can get back
access to your system.

98
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.300 
Or you have to completely
re-install the system.

99
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.140 
When we speak about such
dangerous ransomware,

100
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.480 
what are the
protective measures?

101
00:08:54.330 --> 00:09:00.810 
First again major consensus, advice is
not to pay the ransom

102
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.290 
since there is no guarantee that the
attacker will unlock the system

103
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.850 
or give you back the
data after the payment.

104
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.030 
The most effective protective
measure against random goods is

105
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:21.570 
create backups. If you take care that
there is an back up of all your data

106
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:27.170 
and this back up is not from last
year, this back up is from yesterday,

107
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:33.810 
then even if your data is no more
accessible because the ransomware attacker

108
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:40.480 
encrypted it so that you cannot read it,
then you can easily

109
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.640 
re-install as the data
from the back up,

110
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:51.500 
then systems and files can easily be
restored in case of a ransomware

111
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.320 
infection. And again a general
security measure is

112
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.240 
the installation of virus
and malware scanners,

113
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.940 
they were able to detect such
ransomware if it's updated systems.

114
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.540 
More protective measures
we will discuss in

115
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:19.690 
the final video of this OpenHPI course week
cyberthreats by malware.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.590 
This is knowledge
graphs lecture two -

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.840 
basic semantic technologies. In
this lecture we are going to

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.720 
talk about logical
inference with rdfs.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.410 
So here we are on the rdf schema layer
of the semantic web technology stack.

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.640 
Now how much knowledge or semantics
is there? So all the semantics are

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.110 
described in terms of entities and
properties in rdfs ontology.

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.120 
So here you can see that the example that we
have been discussing from the beginning

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.430 
everything is defined in the form of
entities and properties and then

9
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.410 
a hierarchical relationship between the
classes such as subclass of relationship.

10
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.330 
So we are going to look a
bit deeper into that. So

11
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.300 
the difference to other data
definitions as compared to

12
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
rdfs is based on because it is
based on a formal semantics. So

13
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.880 
it can be defined by the
model theoretic semantics.

14
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.990 
So this formal semantics helps our dfs in
drawing valid and sound logical inferences

15
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.430 
which you are going to see in the
course of this lecture. So for example

16
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
the model theoretic
semantics of these triples

17
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.490 
Joseph Fourier is a physicist, physicist
is a sub-class of scientist

18
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.340 
and discovered by is the sub-property
of perceived by, can be represented

19
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.550 
in this form. So Joseph Fourier
belongs to the set physicist

20
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.020 
and physicist is a subset of
scientist and discovered by is

21
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.950 
the subset of
perceived by.

22
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.710 
So here we take this example
that green house effect

23
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.430 
was discovered by Joseph Fourier.
Here we see that Joseph Fourier is

24
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.180 
a physicist which
is a sub-class of scientists.

25
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.330 
Now given this information we
can infer that Joseph Fourier is also

26
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.090 
he is also a scientist. So this can be
given with the help of first order logic.

27
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.350 
You can see at the bottom
of the slides that

28
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.560 
entity is an element
of a class C1 and C1

29
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.650 
is a subclass of C2
then by transitivity

30
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.880 
this entity i is has
the rdf type C2.

31
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.190 
Now let us consider more semantics
related to the property.

32
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.580 
So here you see greenhouse effect
is discovered by some blank node.

33
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.210 
Let's consider we don't know
what it is there is no ID.

34
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.960 
And now we are given given the
semantics about this property

35
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.370 
discovered by in rdfs
where the domain is a thing

36
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.840 
and the range is a person and
discovered by is a property.

37
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.850 
So how do we get more information
based on this information?

38
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.220 
So here with the help of deduction
we can say that if the

39
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.350 
one entity is connected to
another entity with the help of

40
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.350 
a predicate, with the help of a
property and the domain of the

41
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.030 
property is some class, here in
this case thing, and the range

42
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.260 
of the property is another class,
here in this case it is a person,

43
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.820 
then the we can easily deduce
that the type of this entity,

44
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.650 
for example greenhouse
effect, is rdf type

45
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.880 
thing. Similarly we can also
deduce the rdf type of the

46
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.230 
blank node that it
would be some person.

47
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.330 
Now we have more semantics given
in our rdfs were discovered

48
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.410 
by is the sub-property
of perceived by.

49
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.220 
The domain of perceived by is a
thing and the range of perceived

50
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.390 
by is a person. Based
on this information

51
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.250 
we can simply deduce
that greenhouse effect

52
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.040 
is perceived
by Joseph Fourier.

53
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.700 
This is given the similar thing
is given in the form of first

54
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.250 
order logic and at the
bottom of the slide.

55
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.750 
So now here we are talking
about rdf schema

56
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.340 
and in the next lecture you are
going to see an excursion

57
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.660 
on RDFa - rdf on the web.

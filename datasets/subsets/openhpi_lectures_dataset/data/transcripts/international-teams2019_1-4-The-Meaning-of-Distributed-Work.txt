1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.460 
So Salim, tell us a little
bit about the significance

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.190 
of remote teamwork
and why we will be

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.230 
watching all this stuff in the
course. Ok, Tom, this is something

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.680 
that definitely is interesting for all of us not just now,
it has been used since all already a couple of years,

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.680 
has been used since all already
shown a couple of years

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.680 
the point is that the concept
of work is now redefined

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.500 
because we have so many
technologies and the internet

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.940 
is there we have now a
chance to get work done

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.120 
remotely. And not necessarily
alone, this is a very important

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.250 
point we are going to discuss
because remote work is just not

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.220 
that someone is working outside it
means that someone is working

12
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.780 
outside but is collaborating
with more people outside.

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.510 
This is really something that
the meaning of remote work is

14
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.950 
really there in collaborating
in working together.

15
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.140 
Work not necessarily happens always
an office, this is something

16
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.710 
that is new cheap that we need
to start understanding.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.930 
Work is not even related
to a specific space in a

18
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.670 
geographic location, work can
happen in different locations.

19
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.510 
We are now aware of this we
can email from when we

20
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.740 
are our way, we have cellphones,
we have laptops, we have all the

21
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.650 
stuff. Now the technology
allows to do this

22
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.400 
work and also in this new
scenario where we are,

23
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.620 
we are defining a new culture a new
culture where more flexibility

24
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.870 
is there, where people are
allowed to be more creative,

25
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.620 
to work in a different setting which
make them even more productive.

26
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.310 
This is a significant set of work
we are going to discuss in

27
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.570 
this in this course and we
will encourage all the all

28
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.210 
of our participants to think
about the different meaning of

29
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.110 
work out of the settings
of a normal office.

30
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.770 
Let's start thinking about why
we want to work remotely.

31
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.880 
You can work alone,

32
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.520 
but we are talking about
working remotely in a team.

33
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.020 
You have all the potential to work
and to perform outside without

34
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.780 
being tied to a single place. Of
course we are not saying that

35
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.180 
a firefighter can work remotely
but there are different

36
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and several professions where
you can definitely work

37
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.790 
remotely, the technology is
available, the technology

38
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.240 
is also offering us security, speed,
quality, so many things that

39
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.400 
are necessary for working
remotely, are there. It is,

40
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.030 
this is not just a trend,
since several years

41
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410 
many companies have
been using this.

42
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.210 
Mainly successfully.
Some of them have been

43
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.220 
having trouble with that ,but this
exactly the point we are going

44
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.630 
to address today. The office
myth is not necessarily the

45
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.410 
same as before. Some
people even call it:

46
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.790 
I'm going to jail
from nine to five.

47
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.390 
We need to remove this
because we have

48
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.010 
all the technology and the ways
how to have to manage this.

49
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.670 
Now the office is
becoming a different

50
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.370 
meaning of course the socialisation
that happened at office

51
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.750 
it is important but in the remote
work it is also possible

52
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.170 
to have this socialization.
And does remote

53
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.840 
work mean, does it
always mean that

54
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.330 
you're working at home?
No, good point.

55
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.040 
Many people confuse that this is
always work at home. No. Remotely

56
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.100 
means that I can be working
in a different office.

57
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.850 
Some people can be working even
at the other side of the world

58
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.270 
in their office, at other
offices. Of course, you can

59
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.980 
relate it to: I go and work from
home and this is not an issue.

60
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.030 
But it is also important to
make this real clear point:

61
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.470 
Remote work is not
necessary work at home.

62
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.310 
This also has it also has a
meaning for the organization.

63
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.710 
Organizations sometimes don't
trust that you're working

64
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.670 
at home, you are doing nothing,
you're probably watching a

65
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.490 
movie or something like that.
It brings huge advantages

66
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.250 
to the organization, if
you can have people

67
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.220 
working at the other end of the
world. Exactly, and you will

68
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.940 
profit out of the expertise, you
will never have all the expertise

69
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.350 
you want to have in one single
place. It is really rare that

70
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.040 
you have this, but with the
remote work we will have people

71
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.310 
and you will have the tools
to interconnect everyone.

72
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.870 
The richness for the
organization is amazing.

73
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.150 
The work, as i said before, is not
a place. It is something you do,

74
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.560 
This is really a cheap, it is a culture,
it is a mentality that organization

75
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.100 
need to work on. You will have
access to more expertise, you

76
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.900 
will have a reduction
of commuting time.

77
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.280 
If you just make a calculation,
a small calculation:

78
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.030 
you take half an hour to go to your
office, let's put it that way.

79
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.960 
But before going to your office,
you need to walk to the bus,

80
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.980 
or to your car, fifteen minutes
more. Let's say, to prepare

81
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.430 
yourself for your taking and to
go to the office forty five

82
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.430 
minutes. Let's put also,
when you're coming back,

83
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.440 
another forty five minutes. It means,
you have one and a half hour

84
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.110 
per day, just commuting. One
and a half hours per day,

85
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.540 
Five days: then you
have seven point five

86
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.490 
hours a week, almost one day
is gone just commuting.

87
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.020 
Go, make the calculation
for the whole year.

88
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.060 
Three hundred, four
hundred hours a year

89
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.090 
that are lost just because
you are commuting.

90
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.130 
This is something. Time
is money. Definitely.

91
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.550 
If you want to invest this time
in something more productive,

92
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.920 
then start thinking
in this direction.

93
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.690 
You will not need to make your employees
work remotely all the time. If you have

94
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.110 
let's say fifty employees, some
of them are working at home

95
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.760 
sometimes, some of them are
working here, and this

96
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.710 
is another thing, you will not need
huge offices in order to perform

97
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.150 
Working at home will be also
an alternative. So it saves

98
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.420 
you money, actually, if
you can reduce your

99
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.640 
office space? It saves you
definitely money and it's

100
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.480 
not only money in salaries because
you will need to pay still

101
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.970 
the salaries, but in the
infrastructure you need

102
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.260 
in order to perform, and also
something that you cannot ignore:

103
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.970 
The response time. If you're working
remotely you have all your

104
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.900 
equipment ready to work,
it will be immediate.

105
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.460 
You need of course a kind of
coordination, and we will

106
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.030 
talk about this, coordination
plays a huge role, but this

107
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.170 
is something that also can increase
the response of organizations.

108
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.140 
There are also some areas where
it is specifically useful.

109
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.880 
But it will also

110
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.150 
cost you some money, I mean the
Infrastructure you need to build

111
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.880 
and... Exactly, it is not free but
there is an infrastructure that

112
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.900 
you can let's rent this
infrastructure and use it on demand

113
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.920 
and it will be also ok.
You can also define

114
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.110 
where you want to work. Let's say
you are going to work at home,

115
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.890 
let's put it as an example,
then you will have at home

116
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.120 
some small place where you
will work exclusively,

117
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.260 
where you are isolated from
any kind of distraction,

118
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.460 
and this place also has another
role because in the office

119
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.250 
you are here, chatting
here, doing this here.

120
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.810 
The performance, this has also
been shown in some studies,

121
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.540 
is not always the best. I'm not
complaining about the socializing,

122
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.370 
because this socializing, and
this face time when we express

123
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.170 
ourselves, mimics and all this stuff,
this is also very important.

124
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.340 
But also in performing your task,
when you're isolated, it's

125
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.040 
also a is a good thing... If
you have the chance to have

126
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.140 
this environment. If you live in
not alone at home, you might

127
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.410 
also be distracted. Exactly,
and then you need to

128
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.530 
to prepare yourself. You're not
going to be in the middle

129
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.780 
of the domestic stuff that you
are normally doing there.

130
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.330 
You need to prepare yourself
and to set up a room

131
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.890 
that is isolated. Also for reasons
of data protection, not everyone

132
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.740 
should see what you are doing and
these are some other concerns

133
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.310 
that are important. When we talk
about the the environmental

134
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.240 
concerns if i'm travelling
seven point five hours

135
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.630 
a week, it's not only time consuming,
it's also carbon printing,

136
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.900 
We don't have a second
planet, in this

137
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.700 
case we don't have a backup. Then
we will better start thinking

138
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.970 
about that a bit. The last
point I want to mention here

139
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.840 
is the work-life balance. It is
definitely an advantage because

140
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.180 
your life is moving, and
if you think the offices

141
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.270 
nine-to-five, nine-to-five, nine-to...
what happens with this rest

142
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.640 
of your life. Then there is a work
balance, there are some situations,

143
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.030 
where there are some conditions
where you need definitely to

144
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.890 
be at home because you need to
take care of your children or

145
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.070 
your parents... I don't know
different conditions,

146
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.170 
but it could also be negative if you
know do not manage yourself properly.

147
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.220 
Because then your working
time will not be

148
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.860 
eight hours, but you abuse yourself
and it will be twelve hours,

149
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.460 
sixteen hours. In this
coordination is necessary,

150
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.600 
discipline is necessary,
because the work-life

151
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.220 
balance needs to be considered,
needs to be managed

152
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.210 
properly. These are mainly the
points that we would like

153
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.160 
to consider right now to make an
introduction of what we are

154
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.930 
talking about in this course.
Definitely, you people out there

155
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.330 
in the community, may have
some experience already

156
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.800 
working remotely...
If you have

157
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.580 
other ideas or other kinds of
experiences that you made so far,

158
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.440 
we really would like to
invite you to come and

159
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.920 
join the discussion, use the
discussion forum, the platform

160
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.990 
provides a lot of tools that

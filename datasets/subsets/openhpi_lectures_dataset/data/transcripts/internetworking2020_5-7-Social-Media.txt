00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.510 
Social media are very important
phenomenon in the internet

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.640 
so let's say a few words about social media in
our openHPI course - A Half Century of Internet

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.690 
Imagine it's
already time

4
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.750 
your friends are traveling and you
want to stay in contact with them

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.880 
you want to hear what
they are doing

6
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.850 
and how it's the most easiest way
to stay in contact with friends

7
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
with family when
they are away

8
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.090 
your friends went to vacation, you
would love to know what's going on

9
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.680 
calling every day would
cost a lot of money

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.330 
a post card or letter would take
a lot of efforts and time

11
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.710 
so social media - this is
the answer of our time

12
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.270 
by means of this internet
application we can have all this

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.460 
in a very easy, very
convenient way

14
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.810 
that's the reason that

15
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.030 
media consumption through
the ages has changed

16
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.510 
classic media are print media,
newspaper, book, posters, leaflets

17
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.370 
a radio, television, record,
photographs, paintings, drawings

18
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.020 
but the new media are CD, DVD,
Blu-Ray or e-mail, World Wide Web

19
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.560 
video streaming, so, all these is
possible by means of the social media

20
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.580 
but what is
social media?

21
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.960 
Social media are internet
platforms based on digital media

22
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.100 
which allow the users to exchange
information in a very very

23
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.690 
simple way via the internet and to create
multimedia content individually or together

24
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.620 
so the traditional roles
are blurred, everyone can

25
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.100 
same time consume and same
time create content

26
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.710 
and communicate
with others

27
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.710 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
communicate with others uh uh uh

28
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.580 
by means of such
social media.

29
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.580 
by means of
social media

30
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.500 
If one looks to social media then
there are different categories

31
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.070 
there are Blogs, Forums, Wikis,
for example, our openHPI forum

32
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.230 
Reddit and others. By the way,
please use the form because it

33
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.910 
helps you to connect
with other learners.

34
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.150 
There are media sharing, for example,
YouTube, Instagram are providing a lot of

35
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.490 
multimedia information, there are social
networks, for example, like Facebook

36
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.210 
Instagram. Telegram
and others

37
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.170 
What makes social
media so special?

38
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.920 
What makes them so that
the people use it

39
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.280 
so much time a day?

40
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.340 
Social media are
globally available

41
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.390 
so, yeah provides a possibility to
exchange multimedia information

42
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.590 
it's so easy to access

43
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.270 
also, our friends and our
family members are using it

44
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.170 
we have a very cheap and simple channel, a
channel for interaction with each other

45
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.740 
and at the end, if they provide
a lot of information about

46
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.960 
all our friends, about all our
family members, they consume

47
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.930 
a very much time. Why

48
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.160 
such media are
called social?

49
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.150 
What makes social
media social?

50
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.960 
This is a possibility to network,
to interconnect, to stay

51
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.360 
in contact with friends, with
family, with colleagues

52
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.250 
to interact in a broad range one
can exchange text messages

53
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.520 
one can exchange images, one
can exchange a video when

54
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
it is able to
let the other

55
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.630 
be part of a day, part of our
work, part of our peace

56
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.730 
it supports collaborations
and interactions

57
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.460 
so, users are same time producers
as well as consumers of content

58
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.460 
Let's have a look at

59
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.660 
the famous social
network - Facebook

60
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.700 
Facebook was founded
in February 2004

61
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.400 
it's about 15 years old; it was
founded by Harvard students

62
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.120 
Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz,
Chris Hughes, and Eduardo Saverin

63
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.510 
and the main components
of Facebook are

64
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.480 
a personal profile - which
tells us what I am doing

65
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.940 
then I can connect the photo album, I can
connect the timeline to that others

66
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.970 
that take part
on my day

67
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.380 
there is a messaging system,
there are pages, there are apps

68
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.470 
and games and search places,
events you can evaluate

69
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.540 
likes are very
important

70
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.540 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh likes a very important

71
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.300 
and helped in a very short way
to say, yes, I like this

72
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.310 
Facebook social media
which was first only

73
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.170 
available via the browser, while
the internet is meanwhile

74
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.420 
also available as a native app
and almost all mobile devices

75
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.010 
provide such kind of
app to use Facebook

76
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.630 
also with a smartphone

77
00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.570 
but there are also a lot of
critics around that social media

78
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.510 
a lot of critics around Facebook and
some central point of all this

79
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.100 
is data protection

80
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.310 
The question what can be done with
all the data I know of a person

81
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.620 
often the people are self-responsible.
They put all these content

82
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.890 
into the social network without
thinking that these content

83
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.170 
is also possible to
come into others hand

84
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.210 
if something as cost-free
like the usage of Facebook

85
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:41.330 
it's a tremendous expensive system to
provide the possibility that everyone

86
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.280 
very close can use Facebook, then
you have to understand that

87
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:55.370 
the evaluation of the data,
analysis of the data

88
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.660 
this is for many parties of great
interest which are willing

89
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.720 
to pay for it. So, it's paid by
providing the possibilities to

90
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.340 
analyze all this data

91
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:17.630 
Another social media is Wikipedia.
Wikipedia is collaboratively edited

92
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.470 
Online-Lexicon. You know that there
was a lot of discussion about

93
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.900 
the preciseness of such
entries in this lexicon

94
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.470 
It was founded in 2001, it's
operated by a foundation

95
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.550 
by a non-profit foundation
by Wikimedia Foundation

96
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.900 
and today approximately
54 million articles

97
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:49.650 
are provided in Wikipedia.
An average of

98
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:57.230 
52 edits are done per article
everyone can contribute

99
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:04.160 
one can consume and contribute at
the same time. As a principle

100
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.280 
of Wikipedia is to collaboratively
write the articles

101
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.320 
to take the knowledge

102
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.830 
of the larger crowd

103
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.830 
the larger of
the crowd uh

104
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:24.120 
to provide information about all
things everyone can write, everyone

105
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.180 


106
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.120 
provide information about all things
everyone can write everyone

107
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.700 
can change, everyone can edit and the
changes go online after being reviewed

108
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.690 
by experienced users

109
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:40.210 
There are elected administrators,
they pay attention to compliance

110
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.120 
with the rules and also have the
right to make changes or to

111
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:50.710 
block articles and users if
there are very bad content

112
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.890 
sexual or physical
power or others

113
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.840 


114
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.890 
physical power
or others

115
00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:01.210 
and of course social media play
an important role in the field

116
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.950 
of learning and sharing information.
A good example is our openHPI forum

117
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.370 
this is a social media which connects
all the learners that take part

118
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:19.170 
in our openHPI courses. You are and I
mentioned it several time, cordially invited

119
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.160 
to an exchange on all
aspects of social media

120
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.170 
with the other learners, with your
classmates so the forum is only

121
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.600 
a click away from you, so you are
invited to share your experience

122
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:41.460 
your ideas, your observations with other
learners who are definitely interested

123
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:48.180 
in this. So, how do you keep in
touch with friends and families?

124
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.990 
What means you are using? Wich
social networks do you use?

125
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.380 
What are you experience?
What you like most?

126
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:04.540 
How should one behave online?
What is an angry behavior

127
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.090 
for you? What do you not like?
What kind of behavior you like?

128
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.080 
Why are there so many hateful posts?
Although, this is a question

129
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.950 
it is such a media, it's a
possibility to change ideas

130
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.850 
Why change ideas and feelings and
observations? Why is so much of

131
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.830 
changed information
is hateful?

132
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.300 
Is bad content, shows that
people are really angry

133
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.030 
please discuss
such things

134
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.900 
in the forum

135
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.410 


136
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.900 
forum

137
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.690 
of openHPI which
information

138
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.820 
should never be passed
on, these are all

139
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.010 
interesting

140
00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:01.140 
information for us, for you,
or for the other learners

141
00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.590 
which follows
the cause how

142
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:11.590 
we can improve at this point
because social media provide such

143
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:18.480 
a good and simple to
use, a nice way to

144
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.160 
exchange information but due to the bad
sides that become more and more obvious

145
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.390 
many people hesitate to use
and to use such social media

146
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:37.810 
young people typically are less critically
becoming older they learn more

147
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.700 
that important to think twice
before certain information is

148
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.550 
shared via
social media.

149
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:51.930 
So, it's a big topic I mentioned that
there are many many different platforms

150
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.680 
which are interesting platforms in
the country spread from specialized

151
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:03.480 
so, for all these systems they need
the corresponding protocols to

152
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:09.170 
be able to use the internet for
interactions on their platform

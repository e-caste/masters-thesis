00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.970 
Welcome to our openHPI course on Mastering
Design Thinking in Organizations

2
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.290 
I'm Danielly and the topic of today is
developing design thinking further

3
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.190 
By specifically, we will be looking
into a research perspective

4
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.510 
on implementation
and measurement

5
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.180 
The learning objectives
of today's model are

6
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.480 
ONE - To learn about the different views on
the topic of measuring design thinking

7
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.140 
TWO - To understand what you need to do
before you start thinking about metrics

8
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.490 
And THREE - To understand what
should be measured and how

9
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.240 
If we take a look at our Design
Thinking Implementation Wheel

10
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.410 
we are on the topic of
Impact and Measurement

11
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.860 
As part of this module, we have already
talked with Prof. Jeanne Liedtka

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.740 
from the Darden University (Darden Business
School) and also Prof. Pietro Micheli

13
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.830 
from the University of Warwick (Warwick Business
School) who provided us with different

14
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.150 
perspectives on the topic. Considering
that Prof. Pietro and Prof. Jeanne have

15
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.430 
already covered many relevant
research aspects about the topic

16
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.740 
The goal of today's module is to
share with you only the recent

17
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.650 
insights of our research team which are of
course based on extensive literature review

18
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.860 
First of all, should we measure
our innovation activities?

19
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.560 
What do you think?

20
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.530 
How do you do at
your company?

21
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.210 
Do you have a clear set of
key performance indicators?

22
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.140 
If you don't have a clear set of
key performance indicators,

23
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.830 
why is that? There is a reason I'm asking
you these questions, it's because

24
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.970 
there is some debate around whether we should
measure our innovation activities or not

25
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.400 
Why are some petitioners looking
for proof that shows the

26
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.030 
value of the investment for the
innovation efforts? And also

27
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.000 
to provide guidance and alignment
others are concerned that

28
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.090 
having metrics can diminish the
flexibility of the innovation endeavor

29
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.880 
While attempts to quantify the
impact of design thinking are

30
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.450 
seen to aid in building up the recognition
of design as a driver for business

31
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.190 
Many academics and practitioners feel reluctant
to focus on quantitative measures only

32
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.630 
they argued that there is a lot
of value in design that cannot

33
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.410 
be grasped by
quantitative metrics

34
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.300 
You can try to measure innovation efforts
but the recognition of the impact

35
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
has to come from individuals
experiencing the concept

36
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.160 
Why are reports about the
value of design can help?

37
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.970 
It's important to understand what
context innovation teams are

38
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.780 
and what would be
relevant to measure?

39
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.690 
For example, many experts argued that
it should be more about whether teams

40
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.910 
have a serious interest in
reflecting on the way they work

41
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.480 
and how this innovation efforts are
changing the organizational culture

42
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.630 
and the mindset of the
involved team, for example,

43
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.710 
designing things focused on empathy
is perceived to be valuable

44
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.900 
in projects involving
multiple stakeholders

45
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.550 
Here, design thinking is found to create
a more participative way of working

46
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.040 
to foster alignment and also to notice a
sense of ownership among the workforce

47
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.950 
In a recent study conducted by
our research team this year

48
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.810 
in 2020, we identified a
more specific challenge

49
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.930 
when measuring innovation
activities that can lead to some

50
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.470 
directions that can
be further explored

51
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.960 
Considering that design thinking is
normally used for exploratory projects,

52
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.850 
these projects normally aim to identify
new opportunities for the organization

53
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.060 
Since these activities are exploratory in
nature they can lead to different outcomes

54
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.880 
then what was planned in the beginning. Even
though these are exploratory projects,

55
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.510 
companies try to measure the
progress of the project based

56
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.280 
on metrics used to compare and
evaluate exploitative activities

57
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.770 
Based on these metrics, early innovation
projects cannot provide evidence of progress

58
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.850 
and under-perform which creates
disappointment on both sides

59
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.470 
This situation indicates that the
team lacks the right metrics

60
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.370 
to prove and monitor their activities
while management applies metrics

61
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.930 
that do not fit the
project's intent

62
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.510 
Based on that the first challenge is
although design thinking is normally used

63
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.690 
for exploratory
activities,

64
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.870 
metrics used commonly for
exploitative activities are applied

65
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.250 
Another challenge would be that even
though design thinking contributes

66
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.750 
to the aim of internal transformation,
metrics of the overall

67
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.990 
revenue or specific innovation
products are used

68
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.710 
For example, innovation activities
especially in the development

69
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.440 
of human centred products and
services contribute to transforming

70
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.430 
the mindset of the team

71
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.800 
For example, design thinking is well
known for promoting mindset change

72
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.930 
in terms of creativity,
collaboration, and user-centredness

73
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.530 
Even though design thinking has
demonstrated to have a clear impact

74
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.930 
on changing the mindset and
respectably working modes of teams

75
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.550 
Management would still use
revenue-related metrics

76
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.120 
on a larger scale, this can mean that
long term transformation endeavors

77
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.110 
normally gets stopped

78
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.090 
due to a decrease
in revenue

79
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.710 
In this way activities related to promoting
internal transformation and cultural change

80
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.680 
are normally not assessed
as a success metric

81
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:23.200 
Finally, a third challenge would be concerning
the company's objectives and scope

82
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.560 
when there is no or unclear
intent of what innovation teams

83
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.740 
are supposed to achieve
for the organization

84
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.690 
In large organizations, there are
multiple priorities and even

85
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.500 
political opinions
at play

86
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:47.420 
making it hard for the innovation teams
to identify their supposed goals

87
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.790 
because many organizations that
implement design thinking remained far

88
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.890 
from their
intended impact

89
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.470 
They often generate a lot of ideas
and employee engagement however

90
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.300 
workshops tended to remain
colorful posted parties

91
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.870 
In many cases, design and implementation
lacks an established connection

92
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.830 
between design thinking and the
business strategic intent

93
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:24.210 
As a consequence, many companies do not
manage to achieve implementable solutions

94
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.920 
that have an impact
for the organization

95
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.300 
We define a strategic intent as
the rationale that guides the

96
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.160 
implementation of design thinking
within an organization. To

97
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.870 
leverage its full potential, we
believe that every organization

98
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:49.200 
needs to define its strategic intent before
starting to implement and later on

99
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.000 
to measure design
thinking

100
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:58.430 
The two dimensional matrix that you see
defines the space for the strategic intent

101
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.880 
underlying the implementation
of design thinking

102
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.340 
This matrix reflects the strategic
intents of organizations

103
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.590 
that implement
design thinking

104
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.720 
Those with no intention of implementing design
thinking are not included in the matrix

105
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.250 
The horizontal access aims to
capture organizations that are

106
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.160 
looking for using design thinking to
focus on internal transformation

107
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.010 
in a sense of changing the
organizational culture

108
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.560 
The vertical access reflect companies
that implement design thinking

109
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.210 
with the goal of having an external
orientation focused on the customer

110
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.490 
Considering the axis of
the matrix as continuous

111
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:51.610 
organizations or their entities can
position themselves on them freely

112
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.180 
Based on that we define and introduce
4 archetypes of strategic intent

113
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:04.740 
that cover the extremes of the matrix - Creative
Co-operation, Collaborative Co-creation,

114
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.490 
Creative problem setting and solving,
and Innovation with meaning

115
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.960 
Organizations with low internal
and low external focus

116
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.170 
aim at a strategic intent
of creative cooperation

117
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.560 
They want to mainly use methods of
design thinking to bring employees

118
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:32.900 
and or customers together and let them work
with creative methods, for instance,

119
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.820 
to express themselves through sketches and
prototypes. Building on creative confidence

120
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:45.650 
they can move the strategic intent
from a low to high internal focus

121
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.080 
leading to the strategic intent
of collaborative co-creation

122
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.100 
Now, teams process both the work task skills
and their digital collaboration skills

123
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.040 
necessary to making knowledge of
their domain available to others

124
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:11.450 
In contrast, a very high external
focus and a lower internal focus

125
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:17.110 
leads to a strategic intent of
creative problem setting and solving

126
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:24.660 
This is reflected in a high customer orientation
to fully understand the customers' problems

127
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.440 
eliciting latent needs and then creating
superior, sometimes surprising solutions

128
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:38.580 
Lastly, companies with a high external
and high internal focus have realized

129
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:44.100 
that they need to both build the
internal mindset cultures and skills

130
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.750 
and have to be open to their
external and first identify and

131
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.880 
then solve a
customer's problem

132
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:59.220 
Also in seeking to balance these two
types of companies mostly follow

133
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.050 
a deeper purpose and achieve
radical innovations with meaning

134
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.610 
The theoretically derived matrix
helps us to categorize the

135
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.130 
strategic intents of companies that
want to implement design thinking

136
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.850 
The first step when measuring
innovation effort is to understand

137
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.730 
the strategy underlying
the activities

138
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.800 
With that in mind, we can then
start thinking about what

139
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.310 
exactly should
be measured?

140
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.590 
Why are many companies proposing to
measure the process of design thinking?

141
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.350 
The practices that are part of
the process, the inputs that

142
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:48.310 
go into the process and the outputs derived
from the process, we propose that

143
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:54.130 
since design thinking is exploratory in
nature, companies should first look

144
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.560 
into the strategy and then what are
the principles of design thinking

145
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.000 
that can support them
to achieve that

146
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:07.830 
In this way instead of focusing on
traditional management metrics,

147
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.540 
companies should look at what is
the impact of design thinking

148
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.980 
from a culture and mindset change
perspective. If you want to

149
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.220 
know more about design thinking
principles, you can watch our module

150
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:27.400 
on processes and practices. One example
of a principle is user-centered

151
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.170 
We will now look into an example of
how exactly companies could measure

152
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.810 
the design thinking principle
of user-centricity

153
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:44.050 
For example, in this figure, we
show an illustrative example

154
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:49.190 
of a fictional company that has a
focus on external transformation

155
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.270 
with a strategic intent of creative
problem setting and solving

156
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.770 
Since this fictional company has
an external orientation, they

157
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.300 
want to become more
customer centered

158
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:08.700 
The principle of user-centered
can be operationalized by the

159
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.480 
practice of running
user research

160
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.430 
One possible way to measure the
progress of the team could be

161
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.510 
to measure the number of hypotheses
that were derived from

162
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:28.520 
the need-finding and later on positively
tested as part of the user research

163
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.900 
This particular metric is an example
of how companies could measure

164
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.500 
the principle of becoming
more user-centered

165
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:43.930 
It's important to say that further investigations
should be conducted to understand

166
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.720 
in what context this
metric would make sense

167
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.060 
To sum up, existing metrics are
often found to be inadequate

168
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.060 
in light of the exploratory
nature of design thinking

169
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.900 
When analysing the challenges
that we found together with the

170
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.020 
possibilities of the
company's strategic intent,

171
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.470 
we identified some guidance on
different approaches towards

172
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.050 
measurement that academics and
practitioners can explore

173
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:21.240 
If you want to measure your innovation
efforts it's recommended to first

174
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.330 
look into what is
the strategy,

175
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:30.240 
then you should position yourself
on the matrix that I showed

176
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.770 
here to you today. Based on that
you will be able to identify

177
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:40.100 
what are the design thinking
principles that can support you

178
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.210 
to achieve your goals

179
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.560 
Finally, you should initiate the
discussion around creating

180
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:53.700 
a performance measurement system that can capture
the operationalization of the principle

181
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:59.470 
I hope today's module opened up
new possibilities for you on

182
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.270 
how you can measure your
innovation efforts

183
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:07.510 
It's important to say that we are
further developing the results

184
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:12.410 
that are shown to you, new findings
will be released in a timely manner

185
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.330 
If you want to learn more about
design thinking principles, I

186
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.680 
recommend towards our module
processes and practices from

187
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.880 
where you can derive what are
the practices and capabilities

188
00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.730 
that you could use to measure
whether these principles are

189
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.010 
becoming more embedded
in your company

190
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.040 
Thank you for
your attention

191
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.200 
and see you again as part
of our next module. Ciao!

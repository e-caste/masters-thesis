00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.169 
Welcome everyone, now to our fifth cleanIT open exchange live talk.

2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.729 
My name is Nils and I am always here with Max and

3
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.829 
Sophie from the cleanIT team.

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.410 
Today's guest is Dr Jens Gröger.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.742 
Dr Gröger is a senior researcher at the German Oeko Institute

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.589 
there. His research focuses on sustainable consumption and products over the last

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.228 
few years. He has been working on improving and enhancing the famous German

8
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.269 
sigil or label Blue Angel.

9
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.270 
In Germany, it's called Blaueringe.

10
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.749 
The Blue Angel is a label to certify sustainable products of all kinds, such

11
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.819 
as paper, which is, I think, the most famous application, but also printers, computers

12
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.679 
and even data centers. The latest addition to the label's portfolio

13
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.789 
is a sustainable software or a sigil for sustainable software.

14
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.229 
And today our guest will give us an insight on how he and his team developed a

15
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.849 
way to measure the environmental impacts of software and on how

16
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.559 
this led to criteria to certify software as sustainable software.

17
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.020 
Please welcome Dr. Jens Gröger.

18
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.169 
So welcome from my side. My name Jens Gröger, actually not a doctor, only

19
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.129 
an engineer, so I'm not a doctor Jens Gröger, but diplom engineer Jens Gröger

20
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.769 
from the Oeko institute.

21
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.609 
And what is the next step?

22
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.469 
Do we have some introduction or anything? Or should I just start with the presentation?

23
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.989 
I think you can just start with your presentation on it.

24
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.609 
I saw that you present the Eco Institute and everything, so I didn't want to take

25
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.889 
that away beforehand. Yep.

26
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.419 
So I'm going to show the title of my presentation will be the

27
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.499 
energy consumption of software, and I know it's quite

28
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.439 
astonishing that software and all consumes anything because it's really

29
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.529 
software. It's soft, nothing behind.

30
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.179 
But that was actually the question of a research project that we have

31
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.949 
done for the German Federal Environmental

32
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.569 
Agency.

33
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.399 
We've done a research project called Development and Application of Criteria

34
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.989 
for Resource Efficient Software Products with consideration of existing

35
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.459 
methods. Now we'll show our results from this research project

36
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.619 
and the next steps that could be done with this kind of assessment

37
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.292 
with this kind of methodology that we have developed.

38
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.079 
First, one little slide, what is the Oeko institute at all?

39
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.179 
Oeko Institute calls itself a leading European research and consultancy

40
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.649 
institute. We were founded in 1977,

41
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.229 
and in fact, it was quite unusual these days, 1977

42
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.299 
to have a independent research, independent from universities,

43
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.669 
but also independent from industry.

44
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.749 
And actually, that institute was founded to have some

45
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.449 
independent research about nuclear energy

46
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.069 
and about the risks of nuclear energy, because then everybody said

47
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.739 
it's no risk at all. No problem.

48
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.499 
And so there were several scientists that gathered to

49
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.300 
do independent research.

50
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.169 
Right now we have offices in Freiburg, Darmstadt, in Berlin, and we're

51
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.209 
170 employees.

52
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.789 
Most of them are researchers.

53
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.609 
We have the turnover last year of

54
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.259 
17 million euro.

55
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.849 
And our clients are mostly European Union, but

56
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.289 
also national and state level ministries, companies as

57
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.259 
well, and non-governmental organizations.

58
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.449 
So we have quite a wide range of clients

59
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.669 
that ask for our expertise.

60
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.359 
To show the significance of hardware,

61
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.633 
software and data processing, I have prepared

62
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.049 
some three slides.

63
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.279 
I try to get rid of this picture here.

64
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.989 
The one is the energy consumption of datacentres

65
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.699 
worldwide, and here we can see three different curves.

66
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.589 
The blue one is the best case the red one, the expected case,

67
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.089 
the green one, the worst case, and

68
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.969 
in fact, in the worst case in the year 2030,

69
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.499 
that 28 percent of the worldwide electricity consumption

70
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.109 
will be consumed by datacenters.

71
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.969 
In the expected case, it's only 11 percent in the best case, four percent.

72
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.799 
But still, the expected case with 11 percent of the total electricity

73
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.529 
consumption is quite a huge number.

74
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.999 
And so we can see well in all the other industries and all

75
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.469 
the other sectors. We're trying to reduce the energy consumption, trying to

76
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.279 
reduce to be more efficient the energy.

77
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.019 
The total energy consumption is rising in the datacentre

78
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.849 
sector. Probably they are getting more efficient because they are

79
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.889 
calculating much more.

80
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.459 
But nevertheless, they consume more and more.

81
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.199 
And so we have to think how we could maybe get to a flat

82
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.689 
curve and not an increasing curve.

83
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.754 
The other figure is the only one example for software

84
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.129 
bitcoin energy consumption.

85
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.209 
And we can see the estimated two tera watt hours per year,

86
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.089 
bitcoins do not only consume energy when calculating

87
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.419 
a new bitcoin or when estimating a new bitcoin.

88
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.299 
They also consume energy when transferring bitcoin.

89
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.099 
So as soon as I do trade with bitcoins, I consume

90
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.159 
energy on lots of different computers.

91
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.929 
We know this technology has its

92
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.969 
whole database on world wide spread computer instances.

93
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.769 
And so if I do one transfer, all these databases

94
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.629 
will have to change. And everywhere energy is being consumed.

95
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.009 
Only this number 180 terawatt hours per year.

96
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.449 
This is the actual number from October this year, which is about

97
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.180 
a third of the German electricity consumption.

98
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.689 
The last slide for the examples or to show

99
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.249 
the importance of that whole topic is that

100
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.989 
the software

101
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.919 
is getting slower, more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.

102
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.479 
This is a sentence of Niklaus Wirth, who says that

103
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.339 
software is actually growing much too quick

104
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.989 
and we can see this for example, at the Microsoft Office

105
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.909 
Operation System, which started in 95 with 25

106
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.540 
megahertz CPU speed and 4

107
00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:38.719 
megabyte 50 megabyte hard disk.

108
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.459 
And we end up at Windows 11 right now with 80

109
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.169 
times as much processor speed, 1000 times as much memory

110
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.729 
needed and 1280 times as much

111
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.889 
hard disk drive needed.

112
00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.049 
So we see this software got really bigger and bigger, and we can

113
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.669 
think about if it really is a thousand times more useful than 25

114
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.670 
years ago.

115
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.871 
So we did this research project Entwicklung and Anwendung von Bewertungsgrundlagen für

116
00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:12.872 
resourceneeffiziente software,

117
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.559 
development and application of criteria of resource efficient software products.

118
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.039 
And we didn't do that ourselves.

119
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.236 
We did this together with the University of Zurich, which has a

120
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:37.519 
special expertise in lifecycle assessment of ICT devices,

121
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.952 
and the University of Applied Sciences in Brirkenfeld,

122
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.909 
who has special lab laboratories

123
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:51.529 
to measure the energy consumption

124
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.299 
of software and to look at from the software

125
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.950 
side to this problem.

126
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:05.029 
And our client was the German Federal

127
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:09.679 
Environmental Agency, and there's

128
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.399 
the study, which I will represent right now is also published

129
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.590 
under this link that you see here.

130
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.069 
So we had four questions, four research questions and the one

131
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.270 
was is there a connection between software and resource consumption?

132
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.539 
Then, is it possible to define criteria for assessing the resource

133
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.369 
use of software? The third question was are such criteria

134
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.079 
suitable for comparing different software products.

135
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.509 
So is it possible to say this software is much more efficient than the

136
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:50.069 
other software? And default question was can minimum requirements

137
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.279 
be defined that describe resource efficient software products?

138
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.039 
So is it possible, for example, in the process of green public

139
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.619 
procurement if I buy new software?

140
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.179 
Can I ask for a special energy and resource efficient software?

141
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.290 
Or can I define minimum criteria for an Oeko label?

142
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.179 
This is already the answer to all these questions.

143
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.639 
All three answers are yes.

144
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.259 
Software is responsible for energy consumption and hardware usage and can contribute

145
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.939 
to hardware obsolescence, meaning that I have to throw away computers,

146
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.049 
for example, because the software is getting too greedy.

147
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.109 
Second, a set of criteria for sustainable software was developed, which is suitable

148
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.029 
for assessment and optimization of software.

149
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.509 
So we have this criteria catalog.

150
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.129 
I will show that later on. Then the application of the criteria to look

151
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.939 
shows clear differences between different software products, and the fourth

152
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.699 
answer is it was possible to identify criteria that are suitable

153
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.710 
for an Oeko label for software programs.

154
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.209 
So how does software influence resource consumption

155
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.099 
and energy consumption?

156
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.629 
Now we can see this on this picture quite simple, in

157
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.189 
a company, in an organization we feed in new hardware and one day

158
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:21.319 
they come out as an obsolete hardware, which I can't use anymore.

159
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.969 
So there is, in fact, a resource flow hardware flow through

160
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.840 
that company, but there is also an energy flow through that company

161
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:36.289 
because I have electric energy as an input

162
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.969 
and output always comes waste heat because every computer does nothing else than

163
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.899 
producing heat. And in fact, it calculates also a little bit.

164
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.639 
But I can't see this in this picture. So there is a flow of hardware and electricity

165
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.409 
through that company. And depending on the software, I can

166
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.969 
accelerate that, that speed

167
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:03.469 
of flow or I can try to reduce the energy consumption and

168
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.449 
the hardware flow through a company.

169
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.419 
In fact, we did a more complicated effect model for software

170
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.039 
where we say, how does software influence these different,

171
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.019 
different parts? And one interesting thing is that we have divided

172
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:26.089 
by local capacities, by transmission capacity.

173
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.679 
So everything that goes through the network and remote capacity is what

174
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.839 
happens in data centers.

175
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.759 
And we know if we, for example, use a smartphone application, then

176
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.099 
the local consumption is quite low.

177
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.719 
But we have to transmit data through networks and we have to calculate,

178
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.779 
let's say we make a translation from the smartphone.

179
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:52.279 
We will have used calculations in data centers and

180
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.620 
the replies will be rather small.

181
00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.739 
And there are different, different parameters that will influence these,

182
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.249 
these hardware capabilities that are used.

183
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:09.529 
And one thing that we've seen before that we need resources

184
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:14.299 
to produce all these hardware, but we have also

185
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.429 
resources to put on some

186
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.820 
electrical waste dumping spaces.

187
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.029 
And we also need resources to operate the hardware, especially

188
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.429 
energy to run all these computers.

189
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.459 
So what we have done, we have installed, in fact, different software types

190
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.629 
on a system under test and we have run.

191
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.129 
We have used that software, but not manually

192
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.989 
by a workload generator, meaning that we had some standard

193
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:55.249 
usage scenarios which are run over this software.

194
00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:00.649 
And we aggregated all these data, especially the energy consumption

195
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.749 
of the computer under test.

196
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:07.309 
And we assembled these data to compare different

197
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.430 
software types. Yeah, we see the laboratory,

198
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:17.329 
which is in the campus Birkenfeld

199
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.839 
from the University of Trier, and we even had a

200
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.709 
little robot who tapped on a smartphone to have different

201
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.299 
usage scenarios automatically on a smartphone device.

202
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:40.099 
I will skip that slide because we don't have

203
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.569 
too much time. As you've seen on the picture, to

204
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:50.539 
really assess the energy consumption of a computer, you have different requirements.

205
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.219 
And what we actually have tested is

206
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.989 
four different software products a word processing software, a internet

207
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.819 
browser, a content management system and a database.

208
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.769 
And for all these, we had different standard usage scenarios,

209
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:14.659 
meaning that we are doing with the different software programs.

210
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.409 
Let's say with a different word processing programs.

211
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:23.089 
We wrote the same text we inserted and updated tables.

212
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.739 
We changed the view. We saved it and created it PDF

213
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.659 
document. And this same standard uses scenario we used

214
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.399 
to test the different software types, the same with the browser and the content

215
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.159 
management system and the database.

216
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.749 
And what we could see, for example, at the word processing software, these

217
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.280 
are two different words processing softwares, which did just the same.

218
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:55.159 
But the one led to an average power consumption

219
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.719 
of the computer of 83 watts, and we see if

220
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.399 
we did some actions, we saved the documents, we've changed the layout or save

221
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.869 
document. Then in fact, we had some peaks

222
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.399 
that the computer needed more CPU power or more hard

223
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.330 
hard drive power, and so it used more energy.

224
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.749 
But in fact, the other program that we compared

225
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.999 
used all the time the energy.

226
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.279 
So as soon as the program was started, we could not even see now what

227
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.749 
actually or the link to the actions that we did

228
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.149 
with our standard usage scenario.

229
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:43.429 
This program consumed all the time lots of energy,

230
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.059 
and the average power consumption was hundreds of this program.

231
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.499 
So we can see the one program needs 16 watts more

232
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.330 
for just doing the same job.

233
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.329 
We compared these different, different softwares and text

234
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.999 
for all by telling us what processing program.

235
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.161 
And we see that the watt hours, the energy consumption

236
00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:11.959 
for executing the standard usage scenario was that this

237
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:17.029 
first program four times as much as at the second program.

238
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:22.098 
For the browser, we see there was a program with three different ones

239
00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:26.659 
who used the double as much energy for

240
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.589 
the content management systems. We saw they were approximately the same.

241
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.359 
Not only can we compare the energy consumption in the when

242
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.219 
having a standard usage scenario, you also can compare just the idle load, just

243
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.009 
turning on or starting the software.

244
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.519 
And here we see that these three different browsers.

245
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.109 
There was one browser who actually used 12

246
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.669 
times more energy or in this case,

247
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.939 
CPU power than the other programs.

248
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.679 
So obviously, it seems to be that you can do a different kind

249
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.719 
of software applications, one that need

250
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.819 
a lot of energy when just started without doing anything and the others

251
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.960 
that are using less than one percent of the CPU power.

252
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:28.249 
Based on this measuring, we

253
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:33.859 
have set up a catalog of criteria for sustainable software design.

254
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.749 
And the three main topics is resource efficiency,

255
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.339 
potential useful life of hardware, and

256
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:48.829 
the third one user autonomy and the resource efficiency, for example,

257
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.689 
ends in the minimum system requirements that you need

258
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.219 
to run the software or the hardware utilization in idle

259
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.659 
mode that we just have seen at this comparison of the browsers or

260
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.549 
the third one hardware utilization during normal use,

261
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.450 
assuming a standard configuration, a standard usage scenario,

262
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:17.269 
and then points about the energy

263
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:21.400 
efficiency. Also, the other things like useful life of the hardware

264
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.689 
quite important. But one is the backward compatibility.

265
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:31.609 
And what we observe is that if you buy a new software, often

266
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.289 
you have to buy also a new computer.

267
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.259 
Because the software needs so much resources.

268
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:43.169 
So we're asking about minimum requirements for backward compatibility

269
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:48.479 
and for other points like platform independence, hardware sufficiency.

270
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.129 
Third point, user autonomy, which are

271
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.903 
all these points about transparency and stability,

272
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.879 
for example of programs, are under

273
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.880 
this topic.

274
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.869 
So what we have done starting from this

275
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:14.429 
when we have seen that it is possible to differentiate between different

276
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.390 
softwares and we have developed a

277
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.769 
guideline for public procurement.

278
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.329 
So if a public authority wants to buy

279
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.799 
new software or they want to have a new software developed,

280
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.389 
they can use this guidelines to ask for

281
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.630 
a specially efficient software.

282
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:46.049 
We have developed, meanwhile, together with the Hochschule Trier, a clear

283
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:51.359 
set of criteria for the Blue Angel for the German Oeko label.

284
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.699 
There these criteria are already existing.

285
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.669 
So if I am developing

286
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.259 
an energy efficient software and a transparent software and

287
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.759 
software that fulfills all this criteria here, then I

288
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.400 
can apply for this blue angel for the software.

289
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.039 
And together with this blue angel, we've developed some kind

290
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.569 
of labeling of

291
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.644 
a sustainable footprint of the software, which is an XML

292
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.409 
file that I can attach to the software to show how much

293
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.369 
resources this software consumes.

294
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:39.329 
And as a last point, we are doing other

295
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:44.279 
projects about software driven obsolescence of hardware to make sure

296
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.049 
that hardware doesn't get obsolete, meaning it's getting older

297
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.239 
and I have to throw it away.

298
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.769 
The idea behind software is usually that I can run it on

299
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:01.109 
any platform, but what we observe is that if you

300
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.759 
have more and more requests to the software

301
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.769 
that these hardware doesn't work anymore, or if the hardware is as

302
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:15.719 
has external responsibilities, for example,

303
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.159 
to a cloud service and you, you just switch off that cloud

304
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.959 
service, then you also make these hardware

305
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.960 
obsolete.

306
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.589 
This was my very brief presentation, 20 minutes, I guess

307
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.980 
took me, and now I would like to discuss with you

308
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.769 
maybe first, if you have questions about it and then to discuss with you

309
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:47.109 
how we could make in future software more

310
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:51.129 
sustainable and not so energy and resource consuming.

311
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.130 
Thank you.

312
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.369 
Thank you very, very much, Mr. Gröger, for your presentation.

313
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:02.289 
I found it very, very interesting and we've already had the few first questions.

314
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.429 
So the first question by Sebastian Heckler, I think

315
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.579 
this was meant to be one of the first three figures

316
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.749 
that you showed at the presentation. And he asked, are there any assumptions about the

317
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.039 
share of green energy consumption of data centers, especially of the major cloud

318
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.869 
providers such as Amazon, Google Cloud, in these

319
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.853 
three scenarios for 2030?

320
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:35.049 
And this is in fact one idea that the data centers

321
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:40.539 
just switch to green energy and so there is no problem left.

322
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:46.419 
And in fact, yeah, Amazon and Google and everybody they have their sustainability

323
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.819 
plans or communications and are

324
00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.399 
buying a lot of green energy.

325
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.499 
But that probably doesn't solve the problem.

326
00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.999 
I mean, if the software gets more and more

327
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.689 
hungry, then it won't solve the problem.

328
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:09.129 
If I just switch the electricity consumption and I don't have

329
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:14.139 
any estimates about that, but at least some providers

330
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.909 
are communicating that they are climate-neutralor whatever

331
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.749 
because they just buy electricity from renewable sources.

332
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.519 
Thank you very much, I hope that answers the question.

333
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.259 
And I think also the figure you showed just showed the

334
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.069 
amount of energy that was needed and not the implications for the environment.

335
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.579 
Right. So there were no carbon emissions.

336
00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.130 
It was only the terawatt-hoursof energy.

337
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.369 
So the second question was from James Schlegel.

338
00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.300 
Why don't you disclose the names of the word processors which have been evaluated?

339
00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:57.159 
Yeah, because I mean this, it's just a one

340
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.209 
time shot. Maybe they have changed already.

341
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:07.359 
And in fact, because it's a governmental project, the

342
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.069 
Environmental Agency doesn't want to fight

343
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.799 
with companies about these studies.

344
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.239 
So we just anonymise them, but you can estimate

345
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.709 
it by your own experience. If you have some programs, but always

346
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:29.049 
the ventilator off of the computer runs, then it's probably

347
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.050 
these.

348
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.750 
OK.

349
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.179 
I think I think that answers the question as well.

350
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.739 
Tom Kessler has also asked to share the link of the document and I sent the link, which

351
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.409 
I think helped him and to all the others.

352
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:50.119 
We can, of course, share any links to any studies or any documents

353
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.469 
in the cleanIT forum when we upload the recording of this.

354
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.059 
So the next question also from Jens Schlegel, was

355
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.349 
what gives you hope that the Blue Angels for software will not completely fail like the

356
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:07.609 
Blue Angel for hardware has failed, except for a few outdated keyboards.

357
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.459 
No hardware at all has been certified with the Blue Angel.

358
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.729 
What do you think about that? I wouldn't say that it had failed because I'm quite aware

359
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.939 
of the green public procurement, for example.

360
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.469 
So if the public buys computers, they usually use the criteria of the Blue Angel

361
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:29.089 
and they don't have necessarily to be labeled with the Blue Angel.

362
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.239 
They just have to show that they fulfilled the criteria.

363
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.859 
And we know it from the manufacturers themselves, that they use the criteria

364
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.700 
of the Blue Angel themselves to develop an efficient

365
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:46.909 
product. But in fact, the angel for software is quite complicated,

366
00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:51.469 
and I'm not sure if it's really a good marketing

367
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.159 
advantage to have the Blue Angel on it.

368
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.889 
But still, the methodology is useful.

369
00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:02.839 
And if there are other possibilities to show that I'm

370
00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.429 
programing results that are and energy efficient, then

371
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.349 
this also could be done. And we still even have another project

372
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.789 
just running where we have ideas, where we can

373
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:21.319 
transform the criteria from the Blue Angel to other kind of

374
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.259 
information that I put to a software, for example, when I upload

375
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.669 
them on GitHub.

376
00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:33.259 
I could tell how much CPU

377
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:38.539 
power and how much energy is being consumed by this certain software.

378
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:43.249 
So also the other folks that assembled different

379
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:48.889 
software modules, they can choose either a very resource

380
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.389 
greedy software or a very slim software by looking at these

381
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.689 
numbers. Thank you very much.

382
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.659 
So I have a little follow-up question on that myself.

383
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:04.279 
You just mentioned that companies or developers might use your criteria

384
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.759 
to estimate their software while developing.

385
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.289 
But this, or I think from what you've showed, you can only measure that when you

386
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:16.669 
when you have got a finished product or a finished software, did you do any research to

387
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:21.439 
link any actions or any parts of the software to the outcome

388
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.629 
or the energy usage? Or is that a whole new field that has to be

389
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:31.099 
opened yet? In fact, there is just has

390
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.082 
started another project where we want to include the

391
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:40.819 
resource consumption of software in the development tool.

392
00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.240 
So there will be a link to

393
00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.999 
which is a tool to make test on the software.

394
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.499 
And that later will not only tell me if there are

395
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.479 
problems in speed or whatever but also tell how much resources

396
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.729 
I'm consuming with this software.

397
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:06.229 
And so I can improve the algorithms, too, to make the software

398
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:10.189 
better while just developing a programing software.

399
00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:16.729 
OK, that sounds very interesting. I think we can, of course, link also to the study

400
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:21.650 
or any information to this new project in the forum afterwards.

401
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.529 
We have a few questions in the chat. I quickly want to mention that if you want, you

402
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.199 
can, of course, also ask a question in person.

403
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.009 
Just raise your hand and maybe someone wants to take the chance.

404
00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:43.329 
Doesn't look like it, so then I'm just going to read the next question from the chat.

405
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:49.479 
There is a huge difference of energy consumption for data-drivenalgorithms for

406
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.429 
training purposes, e.g. ML or deep learning to rule-basedalgorithms

407
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.309 
due to the fact that AI becomes more and more popular.

408
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:00.657 
Should this development be considered for estimation of power consumption?

409
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:07.899 
At least if I'm developing the

410
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:12.099 
artificial intelligence algorithms, I should always think

411
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.009 
on the energy consumption and the resource consumption of what I'm just developing,

412
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:23.259 
and so it should just be a very common step to include

413
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.719 
this in the development process.

414
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.969 
I mean, I already right now do include, for example, if I developed four smartphone

415
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.419 
apps, I'm aware about the battery consumption.

416
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.919 
I don't want to program a software that

417
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.859 
empties the battery in half an hour.

418
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.719 
And the same applies for artificial intelligence that

419
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.919 
I have to be aware that I can make it probably better.

420
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.569 
And the good news is that if I make it energy saving,

421
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.869 
probably the results will come up even quicker.

422
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.579 
So I also save time.

423
00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:07.049 
Yeah, and there's a similar question or a similar topic, a related question of

424
00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:11.519 
that said, how severe is the sustainability topic for

425
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:16.199 
development abuse given that training and furtherance of large AI models like GPT

426
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.337 
three consume a lot of energy compared to word processor databases?

427
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.029 
I think it's just the same.

428
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:28.649 
It should be the same problem as at these

429
00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.959 
little examples that we tried.

430
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.669 
And I mean this, we've just developed this methodology and

431
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:38.009 
didn't apply it in the whole field.

432
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.839 
But especially if you're developing this kindof algorithms, just

433
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.140 
be aware and try to use this methodology.

434
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:52.859 
Yeah, thank you, and for everyone who's interested, we have an entire section

435
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.479 
about cleanAI, in the CleanIT Forum, because there's also some research

436
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.159 
at the HPI where we, there's research about binary

437
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.899 
neural networks, for example, who needs way less energy and training

438
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.639 
and other such samples.

439
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.069 
So you can, of course, look into that when you want.

440
00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:17.129 
The next question is you've shown at the page effect model for

441
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.349 
software different aspects.

442
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:24.419 
Have also reviewed the way of software development,

443
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.369 
so the process must set perspective.

444
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.609 
We actually didn't look at this.

445
00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.849 
We know that this I mean, we could really

446
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:38.639 
look at different topics, what kind of computers are being used and so on.

447
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.619 
But we expected, at least for these software that are sold

448
00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.149 
a lot of times that the most consumption will actually happen in the

449
00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:53.309 
field in the using of the software and not in the development process.

450
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.759 
But that might be different for very specialized software.

451
00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.799 
So these artificial intelligence projects, maybe the development

452
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.329 
part is much more important than the usage part, but at least in

453
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:11.249 
this, this is desktop computer software and so on.

454
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.749 
We expect that there is much more consumption in the use phase

455
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.309 
the consumers afterwards.

456
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.170 
Yeah, but there are, in fact, and this is where the Hochschule Trier really

457
00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:29.469 
campus Birkenfeld started sustainable software development, there

458
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:34.149 
are, in fact, lots of things that I can take

459
00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.220 
into account when developing.

460
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:44.139 
I hope that that's the question, so you're also just a mutant, so

461
00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.159 
I'm just even more interesting in the way of cooking, no.

462
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.219 
It's also may be changed for all the consumption.

463
00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:56.289 
So I think a lot of consumption is very important, but

464
00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:00.969 
I think that was for software developers should get kind of sustainable

465
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:05.529 
touch how they're thinking as not on efficiency, just how they

466
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.459 
can build up this socially responsible part

467
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.010 
during recording and.

468
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.479 
I don't know. So it's very interesting what it's shown.

469
00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.238 
And I would also, you know, maybe contact related to to to know more about it here

470
00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.809 
it activities.

471
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:55.615 
Mm-hmm. Sure. And I think on that note, you can also think that most coding environments or frameworks which developers use are, of course, also programmers, so have the Blue Angel criteria or the set of criteria that you formulated. I think this can be used to assess the coding framework programs just as well to maybe find the coding program or the coding environment that uses the least energy. And that would maybe also change some of the development processes and make it more efficient. So the next question is do you have recommendations or best practices for different types of software? Which ones should we use and how can software improve or become more sustainable? Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. We only developed the methodology. So in fact, we didn't do a real comparison. I mean, we did the comparison in our research project to show

472
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.190 
that it works at all.

473
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:35.189 
But in fact, this is the idea about the Blue Angel, for example,

474
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:39.659 
that I'm a software resources aware

475
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.789 
developer that I can show that my software, especially resource-efficient.

476
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.229 
But we did not do any comparison or we let's say we

477
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.849 
have in Germany, there's this consumer organization shift over atom

478
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.379 
tests, which make tests, which device consumes how much energy and

479
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.150 
so on. We didn't do that, but everybody is invited to do so.

480
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:09.479 
Yeah, I think your work was probably very ground level work

481
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.710 
or the starting which can lead to much more work in this field.

482
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:20.219 
So the next question from Sebastian is for CO2 footprint calculation

483
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.499 
a differentiation to different scopes.

484
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.239 
So the first direct scope, the indirect scope and the use of the product as the

485
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.799 
third become standard should be systematically also

486
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.129 
should this systematic also be applied for software-driven companies.

487
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.130 
Hmm.

488
00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:45.229 
No, why not? I mean, generally, it's just to communicate

489
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:50.299 
the carbon footprint is also always a little bit the problem because

490
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:55.699 
I could make the same actions, let's say in Poland

491
00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.279 
with lots of coal in the electricity grid or in the

492
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.849 
region where they have lots of hydropower, and I do the same action with a different

493
00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:10.069 
carbon footprint. And so in fact, it's

494
00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:14.989 
the information that's getting lots of information lost if I just communicate

495
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.939 
the carbon footprint.

496
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:21.559 
But anyway, if I communicate both the efficiency or the energy

497
00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.999 
consumption, but also the carbon footprint, that's a

498
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.469 
good idea. But what we see and we did another project about data

499
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.470 
cent

500
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.179 
res, and we also looked at the production off of all these service and storage systems and so on. And we saw that if we only look at the carbon emissions,

501
00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.839 
it's, in fact,the usage of the data centre.

502
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.279 
So the when the service, they all consume electricity and

503
00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.529 
the air-conditioning and so on.

504
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:58.969 
But if we also look at the resource consumption, so how much

505
00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:03.649 
resources I need to produce either computers or

506
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:08.209 
the electricity, then I see it's the other way around, need a lot of

507
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:11.929 
resources to produce all these electronic devices.

508
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:16.609 
So I need both points of view as a need this point of view for the

509
00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:20.929 
carbon emissions because it's a very important topic.

510
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:25.579 
But I also need a look at the, in fact, resource

511
00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.769 
consumption because this leads to a lot of

512
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:35.209 
environmental damage for growing for all these

513
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:40.099 
raw materials productions in factories and after all, the electric

514
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.629 
waste that is connected with all

515
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:45.739 
these hardware devices.

516
00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.079 
OK, I also hope that this answers the question.

517
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.719 
You've mentioned the cryptocurrency bitcoin in your person,

518
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.549 
one of your first figures.

519
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:02.569 
And the next question relates to that blockchain consumes a lot of energy because of

520
00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:07.819 
multi-usageof hash programs to secure the distributed blockchain.

521
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:12.319 
If the world moves more and more to crypto's energy, consumption will certainly increase,

522
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.903 
as you've shown in the figure.

523
00:39:14.904 --> 00:39:20.179 
But on the other side, digitalization makes the process based on physical money obsolete.

524
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.649 
Should this replacement, so what we save by making the old processes obsolete

525
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.669 
also be considered for the CO2 you see its CO2 footprint as an

526
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.049 
energy-savingmeasure. Actually, we didn't do any research about bitcoins yet, and I just showed that to show that it's quite huge

527
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:43.549 
numbers. Somebody else calculated that but they in fact

528
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:49.129 
also calculated it for different currencies, like for visa transactions,

529
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:53.509 
or it's also just electronically.

530
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:58.459 
You don't have to have real money, but they also calculated that for

531
00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.989 
gold, and everybody knows that gold is very

532
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:08.089 
environmental hazardous because you take it out of

533
00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:12.289 
the landscape with lots of chemicals and so on.

534
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:17.419 
But actually, they ended up that it's more environmental friendly to use gold

535
00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:22.099 
than bitcoin. So even gold, which

536
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:27.499 
seems to be the worst physical currency,

537
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.479 
seems to be better than bitcoin.

538
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.209 
But for sure, there are other

539
00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.939 
distributed ledger technologies that are

540
00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.579 
probably much more efficient than bitcoin.

541
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.769 
I mean, bitcoin is especially inefficient.

542
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.429 
So I can't really answer that, but yeah, it's

543
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:57.009 
not sure that if I turn everything into cryptocurrencies,

544
00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.099 
then that I will have the savings somewhere else.

545
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.789 
Yeah, I see the best and raises his head.

546
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.769 
You can unmute yourself if you want to.

547
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.269 
Yeah, thank you very much, Mr Gröger, for your great presentation.

548
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.239 
I appreciated them nonetheless.

549
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.919 
I would like to dig a little bit deeper into my last question regarding

550
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.130 
this replacementof physical processes by

551
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:31.776 
the item that is an ongoing process.

552
00:41:31.777 --> 00:41:33.749 
The word is going in that direction. So my status would be on.

553
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:38.589 
My approach would be if the new process, the digital

554
00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:43.919 
process is more efficient than the current one, then it's an improvement

555
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.529 
for the energy consumption of the bud.

556
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:51.029 
That means an isolated view only on the IPA at

557
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:55.889 
the data centre. The data and processes, et cetera, is not sufficient.

558
00:41:55.890 --> 00:42:00.959 
We should always consider what is replaced by that or improved

559
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.489 
by that because each project has a target to

560
00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:09.919 
increase the efficiency and the quality

561
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.369 
of something out. Yeah, but to be able to say how

562
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.919 
much I'm really saving with that.

563
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.369 
First of all, I need information, how much I'm consuming on

564
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:23.010 
the hardware and software side.

565
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:28.559 
So what we can see right now is that there are lots of

566
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.039 
claims that things are virtual.

567
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.199 
Things are much more efficient than

568
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.909 
virtual physical things.

569
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.739 
But there is really no proof about that.

570
00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.099 
And for example, we have made

571
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:58.735 
a research on the energy consumption of video streaming because this is a very, very popular topic to say. It's much better to have video streaming instead of travel

572
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.270 
ling by plane somewhere. And we actually realized that's true. It's much more efficient to have video streaming instead of travelling even by train to somewhere. But what we can

573
00:43:10.271 --> 00:43:14.939 
observe is that video conferencing, sorry, video conferencing, is replacing other

574
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.889 
types of communication.

575
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:21.480 
So it's not only the conference that is been replaced,

576
00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:27.299 
maybe the telephone call or the

577
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:32.159 
message. The text message is been replaced by a video call instead.

578
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.999 
So we don't really compare the business travel.

579
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.129 
We do have to compare, let's say, video or a video call

580
00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:45.629 
compared to a normal phone call, or maybe to an

581
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:49.590 
appointment that has been made verbally with the other person.

582
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.179 
We call it, by the way. Rebound, if there is a possibility

583
00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.419 
to do something, then it will be done.

584
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:04.189 
And so if there is a possibility to stream music from

585
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:08.719 
the network, then everybody will stream music from the network instead of buying

586
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.269 
discs and playing them online.

587
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.149 
Yes, someone just mentioned that in the chat as well.

588
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.309 
They're a possible rebound effect.

589
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:22.130 
Segue comparing city usage with music streaming.

590
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:27.919 
That's very important as well. So yes, it's also raising his

591
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.979 
hand. You can also ask a question right away.

592
00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.889 
I just wanted to make another comment.

593
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.089 
I fully joined Younes.

594
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:40.669 
Given what he said regarding the relation of digital versus

595
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.639 
physical stuff, I would like to add two things.

596
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:48.109 
One is that actually, the climate problem is so urgent

597
00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:52.759 
that we must not exclude any industrial sector from

598
00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.279 
trying to optimize itself so easily avoided.

599
00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.929 
If digital helps to reduce CO2 emissions in the physical world,

600
00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.779 
we still have to look for opportunities to reduce them.

601
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.539 
And the other point is we started the discussion on bitcoin and bitcoin

602
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.009 
is really far, far, far beyond anything that that is a

603
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:17.989 
rational approach of using digital stuff

604
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:22.489 
realistically. So bitcoin violates everything that

605
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:27.019 
you learned in your university courses on data structures and

606
00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.969 
algorithms because it doesn't scale.

607
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.089 
So we have to be careful with assuming that digital

608
00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.999 
is simply because it's digital.

609
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.729 
It's better than physical. It's not always the case.

610
00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:49.409 
Yeah, I think you're right, it's most often more

611
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.079 
and more complicated than just that.

612
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:57.169 
OK, so I'm looking through that shit, but I think I know.

613
00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:00.229 
So there is one last question from John.

614
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:04.609 
If I'm not mistaken, the work that you've just presented relies on the premise that there

615
00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.269 
is a similar software product that allows me to do the same thing.

616
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:10.639 
However, that is not always the case.

617
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.599 
There's only one World of Warcraft one, Tesla OS and so on.

618
00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:19.349 
Are you aware of any work related to evaluating such unique software?

619
00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:24.049 
Hmm. Yeah. This was in fact the reason why we took these, these

620
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.949 
very unusual software that we could really compare them.

621
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:32.599 
But what software could do is to compare it with itself.

622
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:38.119 
And so this is what we called sufficiency in this project.

623
00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:42.679 
If you are able to improve your software to have new releases, but

624
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:47.299 
not to use more resources than before, then you

625
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:52.069 
are sufficient. I mean, then you have succeeded to improve

626
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:56.989 
that software, upgradingthat software or whatever without using more.

627
00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:01.699 
And as we've seen at this operation system,

628
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.319 
there has been or sometimes there is a situation when

629
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.759 
a software really does what it should, and so there

630
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.409 
should not be any reason anymore to blow it up

631
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:19.189 
and to make it more hungry for resources and energy.

632
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:24.229 
And so, yeah, in fact, it's not possible to to

633
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:28.759 
to compare Minecraft or whatever with another software doesn't make any sense, but

634
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.249 
you can actually compare it to yourself.

635
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:36.739 
And maybe, yeah, you can. Also, if you have it in the data centre,

636
00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:42.289 
you also can improve the data centre to have this software

637
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.059 
running more efficient than before.

638
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.929 
OK. I think so, yeah, is raising its head here.

639
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.599 
You can let me just help if you want to thank me very much.

640
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.929 
Thank you very much for your presentation for the answer.

641
00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.549 
Very much appreciated. However, would you just describe relies on another

642
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.329 
premise, which is that I'm not adding other features for that.

643
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:09.549 
I'm not changing the features that my software is presenting to the user in any

644
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.289 
way because.

645
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:15.759 
That would be really hard because then I

646
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.999 
don't know what I can attribute that

647
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:24.550 
change in energy consumption too. Is it because of the new features or is it because of

648
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:30.699 
improved processing, improved hardware, improved

649
00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.801 
data structures, whatever?

650
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:38.919 
We actually didn't look so deep into the code of the program

651
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.069 
what they are actually doing.

652
00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:46.659 
But one point in this catalogue, what sustainable software

653
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.229 
is, is, for example, the point of modularity.

654
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.510 
That means that software doesn't really ha

655
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.779 
veto supply or be able to do lots of things.

656
00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:03.670 
Let's say if you take Excel, it's not really necessary that there is a

657
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:40.931 
nimage manipulating program in there, but it is so you can manipulate, you can insert images there, you can change its colours and everything. It's very beautiful. But I think

658
00:49:40.932 --> 00:49:40.962 
only very few users will really use Excel, especially for manipulating images. So you can make it modular, really. And if you don't need that certain part of the software, you

659
00:49:40.963 --> 00:49:43.029 
just switch it off and then it doesn't consume hard drive space or CPU power. And for example, my word processing program always asks

660
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.539 
me if I wanted to dictate something into the microphone.

661
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.089 
So it's recognizingwhat I'm saying.

662
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:53.619 
I don't really like that. I would really prefer to really just write

663
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:57.669 
with my writing program and not to dictate any text there.

664
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:02.979 
And so, yeah, this is modularity or it makes sense to cut off these parts

665
00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.929 
that the users don't really want to use.

666
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.369 
Thank you very much. That's an excellent answer.

667
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:15.699 
OK, so I think the last comment from defence and

668
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.539 
then we will finish this again.

669
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:24.009 
Again, I tried to answer what has happened and have an additional

670
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:24.429 
comment.

671
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:28.839 
I mean, of course, one can relate the additional energy consumption of software to

672
00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:33.219 
additional features. But I mean, I would suggest a very simple rule.

673
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:37.659 
We should not grow the energy consumption or consumption of software at

674
00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.179 
all. Full stop. We should shrink it.

675
00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:44.829 
Yeah, because if you look at the energy consumption of the world

676
00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:48.999 
you have, we all have to shrink and not to grow anymore.

677
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.239 
With regard to this, this is a very simple rule.

678
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.359 
And if we try to follow it, we get much better software.

679
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:05.479 
Yes, I think in Syria, you also mentioned that in your presentation,

680
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:09.919 
that bloated software is a big problem and

681
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.100 
probably the main problem about software at the moment.

682
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.599 
OK. One last quick comment from Robert.

683
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.719 
Yes. It's not a question, is it? Maybe.

684
00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.219 
Yes. So what are you asking are looking from us, for example, because we

685
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.220 
are also very interest

686
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:51.953 
edin this topic. Maybe you have some hints where we should focus our research on that point and just bring new, new, new, new topics. Just asking you what you're looking for.

687
00:51:51.954 --> 00:51:54.079 
Maybe also could be interesting for us to give something back. Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm I like the idea of spreading this idea or this

688
00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:58.729 
methodology of assessing the resource and energy consumption of software.

689
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:03.799 
And we, as I said before, we just started a new project where we want to include

690
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:08.389 
these methodologies in software development

691
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:12.949 
tools. And so if you are actually developing software, you're very

692
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:17.300 
welcome to be one of the beta testers of this later software

693
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:23.059 
that we were trying to develop to use that in your

694
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.700 
daily life of developing software.

695
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.179 
OK, I see a heads up, so thank you very much.

696
00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:38.739 
Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Google, for your presentation and you're very kind

697
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:39.969 
and interesting answers.

698
00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:44.739 
And thank you, participants, everyone, for your questions and your comments

699
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:47.259 
on the talk to the end.

700
00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.320 
I hope I can do that. I will just quickly share my screen again.

701
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:56.319 
I hope we can see that now. So the next presentation will

702
00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:00.789 
be from Rudolph Maya, who you already know from

703
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:05.167 
the keynote to it forum. And she will be talking about carbon calculation

704
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:10.869 
basics, as always on Monday, the 20 second

705
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.359 
of November at 12:00.

706
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.699 
And I think that's it for today.

707
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.229 
You can, of course, want to mention that you joined the forum.

708
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:24.879 
If you haven't already, we will, as always, upload the recording and any

709
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.379 
additional material to the forum so you can watch the video or

710
00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.880 
see the additional material.

711
00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.869 
And with that being said, thank you everyone for joining today.

712
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:38.350 
Thank you again, Mr. Gröger. And see you next time.

713
00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.449 
By my side, bye bye.

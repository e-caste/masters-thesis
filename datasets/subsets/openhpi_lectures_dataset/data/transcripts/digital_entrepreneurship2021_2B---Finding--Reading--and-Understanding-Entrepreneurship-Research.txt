00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.866 
What is entrepreneurship research all about and where can I find

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.599 
scientific evidence on entrepreneurship?

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.609 
Welcome to the second video on Scientific Principles in Entrepreneurship Research.

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.769 
In the previous video, you learned about the scientific approach and how evidence can

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
play a vital role in entrepreneurship.

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.790 
So far, so good.

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.859 
Probably you are now asking yourself where you could find this evidence

8
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.380 
on entrepreneurship. This is what we will cover in the first part of this video.

9
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.159 
And as a bonus, we also want to give you insights on how to

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.109 
read and more easily understand entrepreneurship research.

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.080 
Let's dive in, what is entrepreneurship research all about?

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.040 
Companies' competitiveness significantly changed by technological innovation,

13
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.460 
these interrelated aspects constitute the so-called TIME

14
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.949 
landscape or time landscape. Behind this acronym, we subsume

15
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.576 
those three research areas that focus on Technology management, Innovation

16
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.390 
Management, as well as Entrepreneurship.

17
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.095 
Scientists conducting research and teach insights on the question

18
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.824 
how the 'new' enters the world - be it new technologies, products,

19
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.701 
services, business models, organizational forms or companies.

20
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.926 
Thereby entrepreneurship is a multidisciplinary field, including

21
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.089 
management, psychology, engineering, economics and public

22
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.709 
policy. When it comes to communicating and discussing

23
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.669 
research findings, the primary mode of communication of entrepreneurship

24
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.640 
researchers are typically peer reviewed periodical journals.

25
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:55.729 
Other modes involve conferences and published

26
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.780 
proceedings, edited volumes and so on.

27
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.400 
Some of the most renowned and thus influential journals are,

28
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.547 
for example, the "Academy of Management" Outlets for Management

29
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.680 
and Organization Topics, "Research policy"

30
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.689 
or "creativity and innovation management" for innovation

31
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.319 
related topics, and the "Entrepreneurship theory

32
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.897 
in practice" or the "Journal of business venturing", for Entrepreneurship

33
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.029 
topics. So if you are looking to find some excellent

34
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.970 
and trustworthy sources for entrepreneurship knowledge, look

35
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.089 
out for those journal names.

36
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.160 
In case you want to know more about the quality of publications,

37
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.931 
we recommend you to take a look at the official journal rankings, for

38
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.979 
example, the VHB, this is the German Academic Association for

39
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.010 
business research, they have published the Jorqual.

40
00:02:56.011 --> 00:03:00.509 
In this jorqual, they ranked a multitude of academic journals

41
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.550 
between A+ and E.

42
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.949 
Of course, these rankings also exist from other national and

43
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.322 
international institutions, including, for example, the Google H-index,

44
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.199 
which is a discrete score based on citations.

45
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.210 
We will put some links in a supporting material in case you want to look it up.

46
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.905 
You might now stand at the point that you found some article from

47
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.031 
the multidisciplinary field of entrepreneurship that has been published and one

48
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.119 
of those renowned journals and therefore is probably rigorous and relevant.

49
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.199 
What now? Should you just read it from beginning to end,

50
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.710 
just like you do with a novel?

51
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.189 
The answer's no. Basically, your reading strategy depends

52
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.069 
on what you are looking for.

53
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.204 
Let us first take a quick look at which parts a scientific article

54
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.300 
typically is composed of.

55
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.315 
They generally follow a standardized format, understanding this

56
00:04:02.453 --> 00:04:06.226 
format will make it much easier for you to understand the content and to know

57
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.860 
where to look for which piece of information.

58
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.499 
First, title and abstarct: the first part of every scientific

59
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.540 
article is the abstract, which is a concise summary of the entire article.

60
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.799 
You will find what the authors are studying, how they approach this topic and

61
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.930 
their primary findings. The first real chapter, the introduction,

62
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.059 
will introduce you to the topic.

63
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.300 
There by it also describes the motivation to conduct this study,

64
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.929 
the relevance of the topic, what the authors want to show in this article,

65
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.430 
and the intended contribution to its field of research.

66
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.314 
The next section after the introduction will provide you with a theoretical background

67
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.429 
on the topic. It covers what is already known and what is not

68
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.069 
yet known about this topic and how past findings led

69
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.970 
the authors to conduct this research.

70
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.189 
After the theoretical background, the authors usually describe how they

71
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.889 
conducted the study in the methods section.

72
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.019 
This includes, for example, the procedures, participants,

73
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.544 
instruments, variables, the sampling strategy,

74
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.110 
data and so forth.

75
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.750 
After that, you will find the results section, the

76
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.359 
section includes a rather technical explanation of what the authors found

77
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.860 
during the analysis. If applicable, the authors will also provide you with

78
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.349 
statistical details in the section.

79
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.258 
The result section is then followed by a discussion section in

80
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.659 
which you will find a less technical discussion on the meaning of the results and

81
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.960 
answer to the research questions and an exploration of the significance.

82
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.059 
Further, you will find a discussion of the original theoretical contribution

83
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.529 
of the paper, the policy or management implications, a critical assessment

84
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.399 
of the studies and limitations and possible outlines for further research.

85
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.699 
In other words, this section discusses the meaning of the findings and

86
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.980 
the reason why they are important.

87
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.690 
Finally, all articles conclude with the references section.

88
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.579 
You will find the detailed references to all sources cited within the article.

89
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.789 
Now let us come back to the question we raised before.

90
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.860 
What should your reading strategy look like?

91
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.910 
Well, the answer is: it depends.

92
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.659 
It depends on what you want to get out of the article.

93
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.979 
What are you interested in? We would recommend to think about the question before

94
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.879 
you start reading and accordingly devise your reading strategy.

95
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.589 
Suppose you are interested in the big picture, for example, to find out

96
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.450 
whether this article will provide you with the insights you are looking for.

97
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.760 
In that case, it is probably enough to read the title and abstract only.

98
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.569 
However, I suppose you deeply want to understand the whole

99
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.369 
paper and that case, we would advise you to skip

100
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.680 
the abstract and begin by reading the introduction.

101
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.199 
The reason is that the abstract already contains some interpretation

102
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.797 
of the authors, of the results and may therefore bias

103
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.440 
your own reading. While reading the introduction then, first identify

104
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.209 
what research question, what problem this article is trying to address

105
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.889 
or to solve. The next step, read the theoretical background

106
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.779 
section and try to summarize it briefly.

107
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.839 
This will help you to better understand why the specific study has

108
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.709 
been conducted in light of other work done before in this field.

109
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.257 
After that, read the method section and make sure to understand

110
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.319 
it in enough detail to be able to explain it to someone else.

111
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.329 
Then you are ready to move on to a results section, there, pay

112
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.839 
special attention to statistical details such as the sample size.

113
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.899 
Also, look out for any graphs and tables, in many papers that will

114
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.960 
comprehensively summarize the findings.

115
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.290 
Before moving on to the next section, we recommend you think

116
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.250 
about your own interpretation of the results you just saw,

117
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:35.190 
only then move on to read the discussion section to find the authors interpretation,

118
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.880 
be critical and ask yourself whether you agree with their interpretation.

119
00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:46.190 
And finally, you can go back to the first page and read the abstract.

120
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:51.116 
Again, reflect critically whether the abstract actually matches what the author

121
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.669 
did and what they found out in the paper.

122
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.419 
And yeah, just between us, as researchers we often use

123
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.017 
the abstract as a means of marketing, which sometimes

124
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.179 
leads to promises the article later on will not hold up to.

125
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.069 
Are you now curious to put all these things into practice?

126
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.320 
Try it out. Just go to Google Scholar, for example, search for any

127
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.029 
entrepreneurial topic that you find interesting and then, first check whether

128
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.529 
the publication is a high quality outlet, device your reading strategy,

129
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.610 
and find out about some high quality entrepreneurship evidence.

130
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:37.399 
If you need additional support on how to read a scientific article, we recommend

131
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.010 
you check out the LSE social sciences blog.

132
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.809 
For example, you can find there a blog post from Jennifer Raff, who prepared

133
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.500 
a helpful guide to approach scientific papers for nonscientists.

134
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.769 
We will also put a link in the supporting material.

135
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.779 
Until then, enjoy your reading and see you in the next video.

136
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:57.460 
See you!

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.590 
research is a journey.

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.250 
a journey through vast landscapes of data

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.930 
guided by inquiry and imagination.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.750 
across the globe researchers and scientists are working with oracle for research

5
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.340 
to find transformative solutions to complex problems

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.610 
accelerated by the power and security of oracle cloud.

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.910 
these collaborative teams are redefining what is possible

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.700 
from higher crop yields with less fertilizer

9
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.980 
to temperature stable vaccines for mosquito-borne illnesses.

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.740 
high-performance computing

11
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.770 
autonomous technologies AI and an ever expanding universe of data

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.620 
are transforming innovation pathways.

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.390 
oracle for research puts oracle cloud directly into the hands of researchers.

14
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.360 
free technical mentoring and nurturing communities of practice further accelerate results.

15
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.860 
at oracle we believe cloud computing is the key to an unprecedented

16
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.630 
aera of new discovery.

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.850 
join oracle for research and explore the endless possibilities that await.

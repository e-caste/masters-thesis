1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.440 
Let's have a look to the beginning
of the communication technologies

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.800 
in our OpenHPI course, a
half-century of Internet.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.600 
The ability to communicate, the
ability to exchange information

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.200 
was very, very important for the
development of the human society.

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.160 
It has made the
beings to humans.

6
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.120 
And to understand
this and see this,

7
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.160 
it is very interesting to look on
the history of communication.

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.480 
And there were three very
important developments.

9
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.320 
The first technological
development was

10
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.240 
that communication content
could be stored permanently.

11
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.280 
I remind you, to caves
and cave paintings.

12
00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:02.480 
So even if the painter died, the story
he told the event he described

13
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.480 
in his painting could be
seen by other humans.

14
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.400 
The next important
development was

15
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.320 
that communication content could be
stored independent from a location,

16
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.000 
for example, to write it in
stone the stone could be moved

17
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.800 
and the next
step was that

18
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.880 
communication content could be
transported over long distance.

19
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.520 
This was

20
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.800 
connected to the discovery of paper
and the usage of paper as media

21
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.160 
for writing a communication
content on it.

22
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.520 
So the Internet in this development
has come to the temporary

23
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.640 
end of a development from,
say, cave paintings,

24
00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.840 
writing books, telephony, radio, cinema,
television to what we have now.

25
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.280 
So a historical review provides
some interesting information.

26
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.280 
Let's start with look to the
evolution of writing systems.

27
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.360 
About 40000 years ago,
first cave paintings

28
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.720 
unknown and cave paintings
and symbols so

29
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.360 
human used a symbolic alphabet
to describe a situation.

30
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.880 
And about three thousand
five hundred before Christ

31
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.600 
transitions from a symbolic alphabet
to a phonetic alphabet. So this

32
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.880 
with the cuneiform script
in Mesopotamian.

33
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.440 
About 3000 before Christ
see hieroglyphic

34
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.160 
to pictographic alphabet became
interplays the ancient Egypt

35
00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.800 
in the hieroglyphic alphabet
consisting of bird and

36
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.720 
about 600 before Christ, preventing
the development of writing,

37
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.680 
some barriers were

38
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.000 
prevented by developing a
grammar, first grammar.

39
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.440 
Then

40
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.120 
of course the
writing material

41
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.360 
play the role, an important role for
the evolution of writing systems.

42
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.280 
So in addition to clay
and stone slabs,

43
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.680 
papyrus and parchment, they were used
for writing as a precursor to paper.

44
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.240 
The invention of paper in China,
about one hundred five after Christ

45
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.960 
offers the possibility
to transmit even

46
00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.880 
more extensive messages over
long distances. In Europe

47
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.520 
paper arrived around in
around the 12th century.

48
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.800 
When we look for a message transmission
systems, then we see the first beginnings

49
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.640 
with acoustic message transmission,
why are call stations

50
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.200 
we know is this from ancient Greece,
Persia or drum telegraphy.

51
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.360 
First, optical message transmission via
smoke and fire signals across relay

52
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.280 
stations are also known
from the ancient Greece.

53
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.000 
Then 4000 years ago,

54
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.200 
Also, carrier pigeons
are used in Egypt.

55
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.760 
undefined

56
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.600 
They have a speed about of
60 kilometers per hour.

57
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.480 
And we are trained to
transport messages.

58
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.120 
Since 5:00 B.C.,
messenger

59
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.560 
relays and messenger
services came into place.

60
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.360 
So first modern
postal service

61
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.400 
in Europe was established in 1490
by King Maximilien, the first,

62
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.280 
It was operated
by the family

63
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:38.400 
of Thurn and Taxis. In 1597 the German
postal service became Imperial

64
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.400 
Sovereign right
based on Vassals.

65
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.280 
In 1615, the German Postal
Service solely operated

66
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:58.160 
by the Taxis family. And it was
a huge development in the 1700

67
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:07.120 
Thurn and Taxis Postal Service already
employed more than 20,000 couriers.

68
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.560 
So First Maritime Postal
Service in Europe

69
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:20.960 
was was invented at 1633 between
Dover, UK and Calais in France.

70
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.880 
Telegraph

71
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.120 
was the next step in Communication
Technology. Telegraphy

72
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.120 
is divided into two branches, the
optical and the electric telegraphy.

73
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.760 
undefined

74
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.840 
It starts with the optical
telegraphy. So 1609,

75
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.560 
the development of the first telescope
is development as first dated to 1609,

76
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.520 
it has only a few practical
ideas and suggestions.

77
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.520 
For example, in
the 17th century

78
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.800 
worked with semaphore,

79
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.120 
characters were

80
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:07.760 
transmitted via a certain
position of the signal arms.

81
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.400 
This system was

82
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.640 
at least over 270 kilometres, was
established between Paris and Lille

83
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.760 
with a way to transport to telegraph
information by means of semaphores.

84
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.880 
In 1845 the national telegraph
system in France was invented,

85
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:44.640 
established not only one connection, but
over all France, and it ends in 1853.

86
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:52.600 
Then the last optical telegraph
connection in France is abandoned.

87
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.440 
Abandoned because
Electric Telegraphy

88
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:04.800 
came into place. 1730, there was a proof
that electricity propagates along a wire.

89
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:14.360 
And this idea was used in 1804, the
electrolyte telegraph was developed.

90
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:21.400 
So a single line for each of the
26 characters was in place

91
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:28.760 
with glass tubes at the end so
that an electrical surge can be

92
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.120 
transmitted that produces
gas bubbles in the liquid,

93
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.360 
so that on the other side the single
letters could be observed and then

94
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.400 
the text could be composed
as a single letters. 1820,

95
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:52.400 
an electromagnetic needle telegraph
was developed by Ampere.

96
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.760 
13 years later to
point the Telegraph,

97
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:06.320 
which was able to transmit binary
coded information over two lines.

98
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.160 
Then development was driven
for Morse who invented,

99
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:19.720 
writing telegraph as a world widespread
after the introduction of some

100
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:27.720 
of the alphabet in 1840 and as a result,
the first agency was established,

101
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:35.840 
such as Associated Press and Reuters,
which used this electric telegraphy

102
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.520 
for distributing their
messages around the world.

103
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.480 
So the system was
improved continuously

104
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.720 
and was quickly replaced by the
directly readable teleprinter.

105
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.960 
This was the
so-called Ticker.

106
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:59.400 
So first cable connections
between U.K.,the continent

107
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:10.000 
came in place in 1851 and Newfound
land and Ireland in 1956.

108
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.600 
A global communication
system is emerging,

109
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.280 
so this compared to what is
possible today with the Internet,

110
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.400 
there is a huge and fast
technological development.

111
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:40.400 
video around the world, you see how
many steps necessary to come to this

112
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.800 
gives us possibility, which never
was possible in the history.

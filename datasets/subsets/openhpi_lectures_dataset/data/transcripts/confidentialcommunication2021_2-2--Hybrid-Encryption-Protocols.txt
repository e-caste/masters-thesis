00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.940 
In our OpenHPI course about Confidential
Communication in the Internet,

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.570 
now we will have a closer look at
hybrid encryption protocols.

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.700 
Remember from our first week,
that hybrid encryption consists

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.110 
of the idea that
we combine

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.580 
symmetric encryption methods that
can be perfectly used for long

6
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.920 
messages, with the

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.120 
asymmetric encryption methods
that fit very well for short

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.670 
information. So, the asymmetric method we
will use for communicating the session

9
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:46.250 
key and then for communicating the
message we will use a symmetric method.

10
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.450 
And this is how
the basic

11
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.570 
hybrid encryption
protocol looks like.

12
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.640 
We have Alice and Bob, and first they
agree on a symmetric cryptosystem

13
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.700 
which is a later
one to use

14
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.550 
to encrypt the messages
they are sending.

15
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.360 
And then, Alice generates
a secret session key

16
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.370 
exactly for that symmetric cryptosystem,
which she will later use

17
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.880 
for encrypting
the messages.

18
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.317 
But how to bring this secret key
to Bob? How to transmit it?

19
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.480 
It cannot be done in clear text
because everyone in the internet

20
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.460 
can access the key
and can later on

21
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.270 
decrypt the messages Alice
is sending to Bob.

22
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.220 
So, here exactly the asymmetric
cryptosystem is used, and Alice

23
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.500 
and Bob have to agree on an
asymmetric cryptosystem

24
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.260 
with the idea to use this asymmetric
cryptosystem to exchange the session key.

25
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.580 
And now Alice takes the public
key of Bob and encrypts

26
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.510 
the session key with the
public key of Bob,

27
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.130 
and the asymmetric
cryptosystem they agreed.

28
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
And now Alice encrypts the actual
message she wants to send to Bob

29
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.490 
with the symmetric cryptosystem
and the session key.

30
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.730 
And then both messages
she sent to Bob, first

31
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.240 
she sends the encrypted
session key

32
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.290 
which was encrypted with the
asymmetric system to Bob and second

33
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.980 
she sends the encrypted message
itself which was encrypted

34
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.450 
with the symmetric system
and the session key.

35
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.583 
Bob can now decrypt first the session
key by using his private key.

36
00:02:57.683 --> 00:03:01.217 
He knows that they agreed on
an asymmetric cryptosystem,

37
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.367 
he knows Alice
has encrypted

38
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.950 
the session key with
his public key

39
00:03:11.017 --> 00:03:19.600 
and now his private key is exactly the
one with which this can be decrypted.

40
00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:23.300 
And now Bob has in hand
the session key,

41
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.880 
it was securely transmitted over the
internet and he can decrypt the ciphertext

42
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.510 
with his decryption function of
the symmetric cryptosystem and

43
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.200 
the session key and now they can
communicate with each other.

44
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.600 
Of course, what is the
advantage of this

45
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.120 
hybrid encryption
method?

46
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.190 
The biggest advantage
is that it

47
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.820 
provides a secure way to
exchange the secret key.

48
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.490 
This was a big manko (problem)
for all the symmetric

49
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.920 
procedures. So, with this
using the asymmetric

50
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.420 
encryption to

51
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.910 
encrypt the session key, solves the key
exchange problem for symmetric encryptions.

52
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.410 
And then another
advantage is

53
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.670 
the high efficiency of
symmetric encryption.

54
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:40.410 
Long message can be decrypted with a symmetric
system with a session key, so it is

55
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:48.730 
very resource demanding. Asymmetric
encryption methods are only applied

56
00:04:49.254 --> 00:04:53.360 
to the short session key and
then the message itself

57
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.240 
is efficiently encrypted with a symmetric
encryption method and the key.

58
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.560 
There is another advantage of such
hybrid encryption protocols

59
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.960 
and this advantage consists of the
possibility from time to time to change

60
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.780 
the secret session key that
you use to encrypt messages.

61
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.580 
So, the validity period of the
session key can be limited

62
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.540 
and such limitation make it difficult
for the attacker which use

63
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.190 
cryptanalytic
methods to break

64
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.710 
the encryption. So, these are the
advantages of such a hybrid approach.

65
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.860 
Of course, there are
other problems

66
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.700 
too and problems we have to
discuss in more detail is

67
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.870 
that we need arrangements.
Arrangements to ensure

68
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
that Alice is using the
correct public key of Bob.

69
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.570 
These arrangements are called Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) we will later on

70
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:17.500 
discuss this topic in more detail and
the problem here is that when Malory

71
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.770 
succeeds to hand
over his/her

72
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.890 
public key to Alice as
the public key of Bob

73
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.300 
and Alice is using this key, then
Malory is the only one who can

74
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.580 
get access to the secret key and later
on can decrypt all the messages

75
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:48.380 
Alice is sending. So, these arrangements
are needed to use this asymmetric

76
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.930 
cryptographic
algorithms

77
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.480 
in a secure way.

78
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.300 
And when we look at how
we use the internet,

79
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.240 
indeed these hybrid encryption
protocols are a typical way

80
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.170 
for confidential communication
in the internet,

81
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:14.950 
then there the asymmetric
RSA method is combined

82
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.800 
for the key exchange is combined
with symmetric methods

83
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.270 
TripleDES or IDEA or AES to
encrypt the message itself.

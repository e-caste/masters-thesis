00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.740 
Hi Ralf. Hi Tom. Nice to meet you
again. Nice to meet you again.

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.480 
And nice to meet
you again.

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.090 
So we will start right
where we stopped at

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.710 
the last course, the java1
course. So, we assume you know

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.050 
all the things we learned there. And, if
you forgot everything there's nothing

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.970 
that hinders you to go back
and go to the other course

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.550 
and see what we did there
an redo the exercises.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.830 
But what we want to really do here is
to dig deeper into java development.

9
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.570 
And getting practice in coding,
creating programs, writing programs.

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
We had a look at
the survey and

11
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.620 
what you wished for. You wish
for graphical user interfaces,

12
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.710 
some design patterns, so this is
some pretty hard stuff, or not

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.650 
hard, some more intense stuff and,
therefore, we need additional

14
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.220 
tool support. So, we need
to full-fledged IDE.

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.320 
So, what is that Tom? Well, an IDE is an
integrated development environment.

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.280 
Like CodeOcean?

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.060 
Hm, it can do a little bit
more than CodeOcean,

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.180 
on the other hand CodeOcean can
do things that most IDEs can't.

19
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.630 
Basically, an IDE is a
package of small programs

20
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.320 
that support you in
developing software.

21
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.780 
You do not really need an
IDE to do that, you can

22
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.230 
use a text editor, you can use a command
line compiler, you can use all these tools

23
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.670 
distributed over your
system and wherever,

24
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.750 
the IDE kind of
bundles them,

25
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.910 
and helps you... it's your workplace,
your personal workplace that brings

26
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.930 
together all the tool you need.
We can implement source code,

27
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.313 
we get code highlighting, we can also get code completion
that was not there in CodeOcean by intention.

28
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.280 
It helps you when you want
to test your software

29
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.170 
with unit tests, it helps you
to fix your software, so,

30
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.460 
you debug your software when you
made a mistake. We will cover

31
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.920 
this in pretty much detail
in a separate video.

32
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.260 
At least some more detail. It
helps you to optimise your

33
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.240 
software, so to improve the
performance. It helps to maintain

34
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.770 
your software, so if you need to do
a refactoring or restructuring.

35
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.540 
We will have a look at
that as well when we

36
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.610 
we will cover design
patterns for example.

37
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.060 
Yep, you wished for those. It also helps
you to manage and version your code.

38
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.990 
and you will have to do
that at least if you work

39
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.170 
in a team. And also if you
not work in a team because

40
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.060 
what we want
you to do is

41
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.560 
hand in your code, the
solution for the task,

42
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.170 
your results, via an online
version control system:

43
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.960 
GitHub, and we will
cover that as well.

44
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.560 
So, what does an actual IDE
or desktop IDE look like?

45
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.530 
Here we got one, Netbeans,
one of those that

46
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.440 
we will not use. But, as
you can already see

47
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.280 
we have a code editor on the right
side, and the code editor allows us

48
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.610 
to write code. Surprise
:) and it comes

49
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.040 
with lots of support, you
can see that there's these

50
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.710 
yellow markers that show
that there's something

51
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.680 
not optimal, you can maybe
optimise that, a couple of other

52
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.330 
things. You have a project list
on the on the left side, which

53
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.960 
is the manager
for your code

54
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.170 
for your files. You
see the file tree,

55
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.920 
the little icons are packages. We
covered packages in the java1 course.

56
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.220 
You get a navigator in
order to improve, yeah,

57
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.120 
to find your methods that you
need and if you have a look

58
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.420 
at another IDE,
IntelliJ.

59
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.120 
Same in black, actually you
can switch the user faces

60
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.210 
of all of these IDEs
into any color sets

61
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.830 
that you want. Any themes
that you want. But that's

62
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.500 
not the important part, the important
part is that they offer you, yeah,

63
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.360 
tooling to do your thing, and
once again you see here

64
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.960 
a file tree on the left hand side, an
editor on the right inside, some code

65
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.880 
coloring, yeah. The missing
windows, the missing

66
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.640 
views that you just saw in
Netbeans and that you now don't

67
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.610 
see here in IntelliJ, it's not
they are not there, it's just

68
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.920 
that in this case
we've hidden them.

69
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.540 
You can configure
these environments,

70
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.240 
can figure the view. We
will shortly cover that.

71
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.350 
Last but not least, Eclipse.
So that's finally the IDE

72
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.470 
that we will use.
Again. Actually,

73
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.320 
there is no reason why
we do that. It's

74
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.590 
just because we use it, we
decided to do it, we could

75
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.990 
have chosen any of them. Actually,
if you are already familiar

76
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.920 
with one of the other IDEs,
and you want to work alone,

77
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.340 
then you can choose
whichever IDE you like.

78
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.280 
If you work in
a team, we

79
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.700 
recommend that you
use the same IDE.

80
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.280 
As we're using Eclipse
here we recommend you to

81
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.930 
use Eclipse as
well, just to

82
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.510 
reduce incompatibilities and reduce
se-up of work environment.

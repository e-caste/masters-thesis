00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.190 
Our next keynote speaker

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.060 
well, actually, has been on the forefront

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.640 
of fighting this pandemic on a global level,

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.420 
as the head of Learning and Capacity Development at the

5
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.050 
World Health Organization's Health Emergency Programme ,

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.860 
Dr. Gaya Gamhewage was responsible for making information

7
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.470 
on COVID-19 rapidly available on to health workers around the globe.

8
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.350 
OpenWHO, WHO's online learning platform developed together with HPI,

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.370 
saw exploding numbers and had to scale quickly

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.130 
to serve the need for information.

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.250 
This also meant translating the courses offered

12
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.980 
in more than fifty languages.

13
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.920 
Dr. Gamhewage will share her insights on how to tackle

14
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.370 
the pandemic with online learning. So, please welcome Dr. Gaya Gamhewage.

15
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.220 
Thank you so much, Christine and what a pleasure it is to be here.

16
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.180 
And any event

17
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.640 
in collaboration with HPI is always

18
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.340 
a very sweet moment for us, because when we started our collaboration ,

19
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.030 
we didn't know how impactful this would be. So I really look

20
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.860 
forward to you know answering questions and going into the

21
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.660 
discussion. But to frame that ,

22
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.420 
I wanted to look a little take a step back and look at this topic of whole

23
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.950 
not just us, but how anybody can fight a pandemic with online learning.

24
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.720 
This idea would have seemed quite ludicrous,

25
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.290 
you know in the past, because you fight pandemics with

26
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.970 
you know, with contact tracing and outbreak investigation

27
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.640 
and clinical management and community engagement, but really

28
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.540 
the concept that learning is central to fighting any pandemic,

29
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.960 
but also epidemic or health emergency, hasn't always been obvious to everybody.

30
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.010 
And I'd like to take you through some thoughts that I have related to this.

31
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.190 
So if we take a step back we have to really understand why

32
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.700 
we're having an increased risk for implication of epidemics and pandemics

33
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.930 
that require us to learn in a very different way.

34
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.310 
This is a picture taken, if you like a visualisation in

35
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.990 
2012, this is nearly a decade ago and imagine this even more

36
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.280 
of a global travel in one day global air travel in one day.

37
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.020 
You can see that people and also pathogens whom people are

38
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.650 
carrying can move from one part of the world very quickly to another

39
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.960 
because of the way we live our lives. Global economy, global trade, global travel.

40
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.410 
Now this means we are actually at increased risk because of

41
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.710 
the way we live. We also have urbanization, more

42
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.520 
than half of humanity live in crowded

43
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.720 
urban settings that are really hotbeds for epidemics and and pandemics

44
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.590 
and by mid-century we're going to have sixty eight percent of

45
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.550 
human beings living in cities and towns.

46
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.900 
There's poor infrastructure about, I think one third of people

47
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.420 
who will live in cities will be living in substandard conditions

48
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.740 
in slums and so on. And you can see most of COVID has spread

49
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.360 
really easily in cities because we are crowded, because we're in

50
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.470 
close proximity and because we depend on each other for daily needs.

51
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.720 
There's poverty, lack of access to education, health services,

52
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.440 
and employment increase your risk of getting pandemic diseases

53
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.250 
and increase your risk from dying or suffering or losing your

54
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.620 
livelihood because of that.

55
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.070 
There are many risks at the human-animal barrier

56
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
as we do massive deforestation, as we do

57
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.900 
the way we do massive livestock development agriculture, the

58
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.740 
way we misuse antibiotics, about seventy percent of antibiotics,

59
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.260 
are used for animals, not for us, and we we are increasing the risk of

60
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.120 
diseases in animals jumping species and coming to us.

61
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.370 
Of course lack of surveillance, early warning, poor response capacity,

62
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.660 
but also technological advances people can manufacture pathogens

63
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.140 
quite easily now. And these can be weaponised or they can accidentally be released.

64
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.210 
And of course people's beliefs traditions and practices, you

65
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.280 
can see a lot there are there is a significant amount of people

66
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.240 
who don't believe in vaccines. So even if the global health

67
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.140 
response to the COVID is to vaccinate people it's one of the responses,

68
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.700 
you may still have people who say no, I don't want to be vaccinated.

69
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.820 
So all of this is increasing the potential of pandemics and in fact some

70
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.190 
experts say we are in a pandemic era. And really what a pandemic

71
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.530 
is is a new disease usually from animals

72
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.160 
which jump species to us. So we don't have prior immunity and

73
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.430 
they spread all across our planet. Pan means everywhere and

74
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.390 
demi means the earth. So that's all this is. Now,

75
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.970 
what has this got to do with learning, I hear you ask.

76
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.440 
Well, in an outbreak, a disease outbreak that can start from

77
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.300 
a localised outbreak and grow to an epidemic and can become a pandemic,

78
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.870 
there are many moments which are very critical and we have to learn

79
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.950 
and teach others things in order to act in each of these stages.

80
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.570 
The first is really the anticipation and preparedness stage.

81
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.130 
Before there is an emergence of a new disease,

82
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.620 
soon as something comes up, we need the people

83
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.250 
in the system, in the community, need new knowledge and skills

84
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.040 
for early detection and reporting. Once there is a localized outbreak,

85
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.700 
our job is to contain it. That requires different knowledge different skills.

86
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.010 
Then of course we have epidemic amplification and with that

87
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.870 
map I showed you, this can happen very quickly. We need to do mitigation

88
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.640 
to reduce avoidable death, avoidable disease and avoidable loss

89
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.980 
to livelihoods, economies, cultures and societies. So all of these.

90
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
So we're not learning the same thing across this process. We need very specific

91
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.210 
knowledge and skills at different stages and you can see you

92
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.360 
have to be very quick. So we can't follow the traditional process,

93
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.280 
trajectory, timeline of how knowledge gets codified, gets transformed

94
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.030 
into learning and then it's made available to people and people

95
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.190 
acquire it and use it. There is an incredibly different

96
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.880 
thinking process and timeline that is required to learn in

97
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.640 
emergencies if we are to use learning as a tool to fight health emergencies.

98
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.680 
So, you know this is what happens - the orange curve if we don't really intervene.

99
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.710 
More and more people will get sick, more and more people will

100
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.500 
die and then eventually if everybody dies the pandemic will

101
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.480 
the epidemic or the outbreak will die off. And this dotted line

102
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.810 
is the health care system capacity. So one of the things you

103
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.550 
would have seen in the COVID nineteen was how to flatten this curve.

104
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.590 
How to really not have this quick peak but to control the transmission,

105
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.010 
so that the health care system didn't get overwhelmed and that

106
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.490 
the system could save lives. A lot of learning had to happen

107
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.510 
for individuals, for communities, for health care workers, for

108
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:58.620 
decision makers for people who manage hospital waste, people who drive ambulances.

109
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.980 
in order to go from this to this. So this is again about the

110
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.190 
different things we have to learn and the speed at which we learn.

111
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.320 
For those of you who may not know the World Health oOrganization so well,

112
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.720 
we are the World Health Organization we are made up of one hundred

113
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.720 
all the countries in the world, the governments make us up and in terms of

114
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.810 
infectious outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics WHO has the global lead to respond

115
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.070 
and in countries we work with the Ministries of Health and

116
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:36.840 
others to manage the response. If it is a humanitarian conflict

117
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.690 
or a natural disaster, the whole UN system

118
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.320 
there is a mechanism to lead it called the Inter Agency Standing Committee,

119
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.730 
and WHO will lead the health response in that. And for chemical

120
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.860 
disasters, nuclear disasters, specialized mechanisms. So you see,

121
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.250 
in my job as Head of Learning and Capacity Development and

122
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:02.740 
for openWHO, we can't just focus on infectious disease outbreaks

123
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.390 
but we have to offer learnings for any of this, because today

124
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.940 
we are at risk of all hazards - natural hazards, armed conflict,

125
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.980 
infectious outbreaks, chemical disasters, radio nuclear disasters and also

126
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.010 
food emergencies. So this speaks to the scope of areas which

127
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:25.810 
we have to cover.

128
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.390 
But we have to remember, this doesn't happen in

129
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.750 
a sterile environment where I have knowledge, we have the platform

130
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.780 
and we give it to people and people accept it. We live in a really

131
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:47.330 
world full of inequity. Life expectancy has increased three years.

132
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.720 
Actually eleven years in high-income countries, but only

133
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.610 
three years in low- and middle-income countries.

134
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.820 
Seventy one percent of deaths are due to what we call non-communicable diseases.

135
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.220 
These are diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive

136
00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:11.780 
respiratory diseases, diabetes and cancer. So while we have this COVID and pandemic,

137
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:16.790 
we still have to make sure people are learning about how to manage

138
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.590 
the diseases that really kill most people.

139
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.230 
There is eighteen million health worker shortage. What does

140
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.080 
that mean? It means people who are not trained and qualified

141
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.170 
are having to deliver health. So we have to provide educational opportunities for them.

142
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.740 
You can see in the next to less than ten doctors per ten thousand population

143
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.760 
less than forty nurses - these are the minimum standard. But half

144
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.640 
the countries in the world don't have enough doctors and nurses.

145
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.310 
And so people who are not qualified to do that are having to provide those services.

146
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.920 
Essential health care in twenty seventeen only one third

147
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.480 
was provided for only one third of

148
00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.170 
the populations. At least thirteen percent of the global population,

149
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.590 
that is a billion people will spend at least ten percent of

150
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.750 
their household income on health care. There's a lot of learning around that

151
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.870 
and let me just jump to this one. Forty percent of households

152
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.390 
lack access to basic hand-washing facilities. So when we provide

153
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.430 
training and say wash your hands,

154
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.530 
people can't implement it. So there is the know do gap that we

155
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.970 
have to address when we think of learning.

156
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.720 
And even before the pandemic, ninety five percent of countries

157
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.370 
were not on target to meet the sustainable development goal three on health.

158
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.930 
So we are in a really challenging situation and we are not

159
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:47.470 
like universities or education institutes, we are the world's public health institute.

160
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.640 
So what we need to do is to promote learning, support learning,

161
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:57.510 
keeping in mind the reality of the world, that the world is very unequal.

162
00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.910 
Even when we do online learning that

163
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:08.500 
many and in fact, in some countries, most people don't have access to broadband internet.

164
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.530 
Now COVID has made things worse, as as you all know.

165
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.230 
Much of the gains that we made over the last ten-twenty years has been reversed,

166
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.740 
the pandemic has interrupted childhood immunization in about seventy countries.

167
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.920 
So we are going to have to go back and do learning and programs on

168
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:35.780 
restoring these immunization practices. We expect illnesses such as malaria

169
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.030 
will rise, we think there'll be a hundred percent increase in malaria deaths.

170
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:45.170 
So we may be having to redo learning on all, in fact malaria

171
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.350 
it's been on for thousands of years. These diseases on how to

172
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.550 
control them but in today's context.

173
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.250 
So really this is going to be a very challenging time as we go ahead.

174
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:02.410 
So the key ideas are these learning for protecting health is an important component

175
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.880 
for protecting people from health emergencies and that

176
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.210 
they live in good health. So you cannot have help for all,

177
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.320 
if we don't have learning for help for all.

178
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.230 
Everyone needs to learn and to learn across their lifetimes.

179
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.840 
Lifelong learning for help is here to stay and one of our key

180
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.710 
principles is to make sure that everybody who needs it, health

181
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:31.550 
professionals, volunteers, individuals, families can access appropriate,

182
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.310 
timely learning opportunities across their lifetime.

183
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:41.090 
And it is very important because of the kind of organization we are

184
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:45.690 
and the iniquity in the world that barriers to accessing learning

185
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:51.370 
must be not ignored but they must be proactively dismantled.

186
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.140 
We cannot wait for someone else to remove these barriers.

187
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.690 
So why did WHO, a Health Organization, and I am a medical doctor,

188
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.960 
why on earth are we embarking on online learning? So my story

189
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.020 
is simple. It's a personal story and the story of my team and my organization.

190
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.570 
In West Africa 2014 - 2016 there was an Ebola attack

191
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.710 
that really challenged the world. Not just the people in that region

192
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:23.660 
the best experts the best teams were sent from the United States

193
00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:28.150 
of America, from the United Kingdom, from France, from many countries

194
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.980 
and other countries in Africa from Uganda

195
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.640 
Congo and others and

196
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.440 
it was all, it took everybody's effort and it took a long time

197
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.010 
to bring under control and I was appointed as the International

198
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.920 
Training Coordinator for this and a large amount of training

199
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.210 
happened and this is what training looked like. We had experts

200
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:55.710 
go in and train people on infection prevention control, caring of Ebola patients,

201
00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.120 
and we had to do a lot of work at community level. I was actually

202
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.530 
deployed to Nigeria and this picture is from Nigeria. This is

203
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:08.770 
this is a group of women celebrating the end of Ebola in that

204
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:13.680 
area. So this is what training look like. And I was told that

205
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.790 
I had six weeks to train a hundred eight thousand people for this response.

206
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.610 
And I began to understand the scale and the scope of this of

207
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.020 
course we worked with many agencies and we managed to do this

208
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.470 
but really what were we doing? We were taking a memory stick

209
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.500 
putting all our resources on it and sending it to the field

210
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.660 
and nobody had time to open this and it really was very very hard.

211
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.220 
But we did start an online training program at that time called eProtect

212
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.660 
and this was a compulsory course on how to protect yourself

213
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.350 
work safely in the response and the strategic response pillars

214
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.990 
for ebola. So anybody who was deployed under a flag had

215
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.600 
to complete this course and this was really the beginning of

216
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.590 
in this area the work.

217
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.880 
And immediately afterwards, I realized this is not going to

218
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.590 
work. So we looked for a suitable partner to collaborate with. And HPI

219
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.530 
and the great colleagues there, I see professor Meinel is there as well, and

220
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.500 
you know stood up and and we formed a partnership a collaboration.

221
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.460 
They're a service provider, but they've been more than a service

222
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.100 
provider, they've been a true partner. And we launched this platform called openWHO

223
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:30.380 
and the name was very poignant for me. We wanted it to be truly open.

224
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.040 
And we started and my I know there are many colleagues online and

225
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.990 
one I have to mention Heini Utunen

226
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.220 
who really started working with me and a colleague called Oliver

227
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.310 
and together this small team started

228
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:51.800 
working on this platform and we took little epidemic and pandemic prone diseases.

229
00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.960 
We always thought we need a massive open platform that could

230
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.880 
scale up into millions if there was a pandemic, right.

231
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.340 
And Heini has taken that work and she leads it completely now.

232
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.670 
So any success that is attributed to WHO really it goes to her.

233
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:17.050 
I was very lucky to be leading this team and to grow this concept and

234
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.420 
what we really want to do is address the situation we saw in Ebola

235
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:26.210 
but also we remembered that we had been through a previous pandemic,

236
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:32.570 
and we wanted to be pandemic ready. So in january early january twenty nineteen,

237
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.090 
when WHO was notified that there was a novel virus, a corona

238
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.440 
virus in China, we

239
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.890 
sort of jumped in, no regrets and started preparing for this.

240
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.530 
And we we were in good grounds because there was another corona virus MERS

241
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.950 
that we had done some courses on, we worked with the expert,

242
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.510 
and in fact even before a public health event of international concern

243
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:03.650 
was announced, we were able to produce a basic course on the knowledge

244
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.840 
depending on what we knew. Now I said before, new viruses mean new knowledge.

245
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.880 
How they're caused, how they're transmitted, how they can be managed.

246
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.260 
So knowledge will evolve over time and we need to update

247
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.250 
anything we put up all the time. So this was our journey and we

248
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.940 
thanks to the preparatory work and done with HPI on openWHO

249
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.660 
we were pandemic ready. We were off the

250
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:35.180 
starting blocks very quickly. It is now our flagship interactive

251
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.240 
web-based knowledge transfer platform. We offer mainly online

252
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:43.300 
courses which are asynchronous but we have started doing

253
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.750 
synchronous courses as well for smaller groups, virtual interactive classes, virtual labs

254
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.240 
and we recently introduced online drills through a simulation

255
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.240 
exercise software as well. Now,

256
00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.950 
from twenty seventeen we really had a great growth but it was

257
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.210 
very important that it is free of charge to the user.

258
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.560 
It's like free health. Somebody has to pay for it but we

259
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:13.110 
don't want the user to be blocked by having to pay to access it.

260
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.790 
Mostly self-paced because we know adults need flexibility and people in emergencies

261
00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.860 
really need to find their own time to get get the knowledge they need.

262
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.840 
We made sure right from the beginning from design, it's accessible in low bandwith

263
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:33.070 
settings and is accessible offline with the app and available

264
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.460 
in local and national languages. When we started this journey

265
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.760 
we could not have imagined how far we would come.

266
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.390 
You can see when we started in twenty seventeen, we were so

267
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.160 
excited with the first thousand enrollments. Then

268
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.430 
ten thousand, nineteen thousand seem like oh that was a great year.

269
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.910 
But then in twenty eighteen it really went up.

270
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:59.920 
Four hundred forty three percent to nearly a hundred thousand.

271
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:06.470 
By twenty nineteen you can see and by twenty twenty more than

272
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.730 
to nearly two thousand five hundred

273
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:14.470 
percent and today, I think we have more than five point three

274
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:20.030 
million course enrollments. This was done by Heini Utunen with only one

275
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:26.550 
full time staff with us helping but working with service providers.

276
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:32.030 
It's an incredible incredible enterprise to show if you get the philosophy,

277
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.990 
the value, the system, and the orientation right, great things can be done.

278
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.370 
We were obviously catering to the demand. We obviously understood

279
00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.670 
what people wanted to learn about. So here is our, if you like, a

280
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:52.060 
hall of pride and I think HPI should actually feel very

281
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.470 
proud when they look at this - 5.3 million total course enrollments,

282
00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.430 
34 COVID topics,

283
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.790 
65 other help topics and that's why I talk to

284
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:08.770 
you about the big issue about public help, 2.8 million

285
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.920 
certificates that means people have finished the courses and

286
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.870 
proven that they have gained some knowledge,

287
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.940 
54 languages.

288
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.080 
This is really a source of pride because what does this say? It

289
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.210 
it says that people at the frontline communities, people who

290
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.570 
are putting their lives at risk can get life saving knowledge.

291
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.180 
Nine point six million words translated

292
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:40.740 
fast, I must say. Crowd-sourced, not all paid for, volunteers, people

293
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.390 
just coming to us because they believe the philosophy and the

294
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:47.820 
value system of this was right.

295
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.590 
1781 videos. Heini tells me we are

296
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.670 
up there where the top users of vimeo and 30 thousand

297
00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.360 
plus hours of videos watched.

298
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.090 
You can see top countries,

299
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.070 
India, United States is at the top.

300
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.190 
You can see it's wide ranging it's from around the world. We have

301
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.180 
every country coming on the platform, but these are the top users.

302
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:20.390 
The top courses right, top languages. So it's really really an interesting thing.

303
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.030 
We have many channels and most recently we launched the channel

304
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.550 
to service countries. So countries can quickly go up there, find

305
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:32.150 
all the courses that are relevant for languages their own languages

306
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:36.060 
and you can see there are many. I won't go through it and they're not

307
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.310 
all COVID, you know, our Ready for

308
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.990 
Response is a very good course that will very soon we are piloting it,

309
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.790 
very soon it will be made

310
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:52.270 
compulsory for anyone being deployed in health emergency, neglected

311
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.660 
tropical diseases, get social was one of the earlier channels

312
00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.940 
about risk communication, community engagement, Go Data is very

313
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:07.750 
specific about how to do epidemiological investigation, outbreak investigation, how to

314
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.010 
turn that into a response so very specific very broad. So

315
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.760 
we've worked with more than seventy technical teams across

316
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.310 
WHO. Now this is another asset that we have. The technical

317
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.900 
expertise within our organization but it's dispersed. But we

318
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.750 
actually can convene them and bring them together. So we're

319
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.110 
not waiting for technical, you know, content experts to come and

320
00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.830 
work on courses with us.

321
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.620 
Also, as I said, it's targeted to what people need. This is the

322
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.610 
COVID response the pillars at the bottom are the pillars of

323
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.880 
global response that we are advocating every country takes

324
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:48.850 
and Heini has been very clever. She works very closely she actually develops courses that

325
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.430 
actually support every pillar of response. So if we're to asking people to

326
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:59.280 
you know, do something for points of entry, she's already got the course there.

327
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.240 
If we're doing maintaining essential health services she's

328
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.770 
got all of these courses there right. So this is really about

329
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.960 
aligning the strategy for response with learning. Learning cannot

330
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.030 
be separate from response. Learning has to be for achieving health objectives.

331
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.020 
So what are the key ingredients for impact?

332
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:25.150 
It has to be free. This is non-negotiable. This has to be free.

333
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.030 
If rich learners come to us and they want to donate money they

334
00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.970 
can donate money to the foundation and we can channel that.

335
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.590 
That's not a problem, but we have to remove cost barriers.

336
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.810 
This is very very important is very fundamental and that's

337
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.090 
why I'm really happy that this session is being broadcast on

338
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.150 
youtube and people can watch it for free.

339
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.730 
You have to have, I know about AI, I know about gaming, I know

340
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.580 
about all of these learning tools using

341
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.760 
you know we are in the fourth industrial revolution.

342
00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.330 
But we cannot exclude people, we have to have low bandwidth solutions

343
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:07.550 
for this. We have to have offline solutions. Just one statistic -

344
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.790 
only twenty two percent of women in Africa have access to internet.

345
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.850 
That compares with about thirty two percent of men.

346
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.190 
These women are at the frontline, they're in the community,

347
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:25.610 
they give care, they identify disease, they're community health workers,

348
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.530 
and they are seventy percent of the health workforce usually

349
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:36.610 
in the lowest paid and low-status professions like nursing or midwifery.

350
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.610 
So we cannot, just because there are great solutions out there, we cannot

351
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.540 
use that what we need to do is try to find a way to get those

352
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:50.390 
solutions to people who are challenged with digital access. Languages -

353
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.670 
languages is very important. Particularly under pressure if

354
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.160 
you look at psychology, neuroscience, risk perception,

355
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.710 
people are under stress and they learn best, comprehend best

356
00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.260 
when they are working in their own, not just official language,

357
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.330 
but their dialect and local language, their mother tongue. So

358
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.010 
this has become a crusade for us. We really really want to do this.

359
00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.170 
Choice of formats - so we may have great videos but in certain

360
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.380 
cultures and because of low bandwith people can't access videos.

361
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.170 
We have to offer small short audio files, we have to find flip,

362
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.090 
we have to find other ways of of getting this across.

363
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.870 
We have to respect adult learning science and integrate that in all learning

364
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:40.630 
and of course real time, really fast production. If we are slow,

365
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:45.610 
the pandemic and the needs all change and we have to do it at massive scale.

366
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:50.850 
So this is what I've learned so that we allow people to work in the response

367
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:55.840 
for a coordinated response, also including individuals health

368
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.990 
literacy and agency ability to act to protect themselves and others,

369
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.130 
providing tools and resources for applying the knowledge, not

370
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.660 
just getting the knowledge and creating this appetite

371
00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.530 
for a learning ecosystem where today I'm the teacher, tomorrow

372
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.010 
I'm learning, the day after I'm helping someone else learn. This

373
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:20.330 
tradition of I am the professor and you are the student I believe this is dead.

374
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.110 
And I am very happy because we have a lot to

375
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:28.750 
learn the pandemic has shown us knowledge is generated not just in universities

376
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:33.650 
but in the field, in homes through practitioners. So we have to

377
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:39.130 
remove the hierarchy and the unidirectional flow of knowledge

378
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.230 
and we should find ways and technology should help us find ways to

379
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.710 
harness that, to codify that, to share that.

380
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.720 
So these are of course while we are doing this Heini has led, really, she

381
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.470 
is incredible she has led, I think more than ten peer reviewed

382
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:59.010 
articles, many of them related to openWHO, some of them

383
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:05.000 
together with HPI. I'll leave this for you. I clicked the wrong thing, excuse me.

384
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.100 
Let me just finish off, sorry about that.

385
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:24.980 
And I'll also leave this slide as part of the pack. And this slide,

386
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.240 
if you get this presentation if you click directly you

387
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.130 
will go to the courses in WHO languages and different things. So

388
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:38.250 
this is really what I wanted to share as a conversation starter

389
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.820 
and happy to answer any questions and join the discussion. Thank

390
00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:47.010 
you again so much for inviting me to this. This is such a pleasure

391
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.970 
because it's not often that we start on a journey where we

392
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.840 
don't know where we are going but there's just so much that

393
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.070 
we've been able to contribute together. So thank you all colleagues at HPI.

394
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.280 
Thank you very much Gaya for those insights. Incredible

395
00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.510 
what you have managed

396
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.010 
in a very short time.

397
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:16.560 
Well, yes, we have still time to take some questions.

398
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.640 
So I'd like to invite the audience again to

399
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.320 
pose their questions in the QnA

400
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.310 
area or in the chat, whatever you like.

401
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.860 
For a starter, I would be interested

402
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:40.790 
how, you said to crowd-sourcing with the translation, but maybe you can

403
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.140 
share some more information how did you go about the translation

404
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.890 
of the courses in more than fifty languages, and you said you

405
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.830 
have to be really quick. So, yeah.

406
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.190 
Sorry. I think, you know as I said, if your vision is right,

407
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.180 
people understand you're doing something for a global good,

408
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.330 
so this is not profit making right. People have really attuned

409
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.810 
to what you're doing so we're a big bureaucracy for a big organization

410
00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.530 
and to do formal translations it takes a long time.

411
00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.590 
So we realized very quickly this is not going to work for us.

412
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.300 
So we have very innovative colleagues in our team who already identified partners

413
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.870 
who do this kind of work in emergencies. So for example we started

414
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.360 
our journey with translators without borders.

415
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.110 
Then there was a private company called Iwa language who said okay,

416
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:41.370 
we want to do social good. We donate translations to you. So lots of people,

417
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.610 
either they were on contract, but really very low contract because

418
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:49.440 
of the nature of the work or private companies who usually

419
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.180 
would charge a lot, would come and donate translations free

420
00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.900 
because they believed in the mission that we were pursuing.

421
00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.760 
And then as the material became available to countries, countries

422
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.110 
would say, our country officers or people in the ministry or NGOs would say,

423
00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.390 
oh we'd like to have this in our language, can we help you?

424
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:13.130 
And we would say, yes please and we translated and we asked

425
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.620 
our country officers to validate the translation.

426
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.330 
And we always put disclaimers you know it's the english version

427
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:24.030 
that is the standard, but you know this worked because our country officers helped us

428
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.320 
and one of the most remarkable ones we did was somebody from the

429
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.040 
impaired hearing, the deaf community in India which is an enormous

430
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.930 
country, came to us and said while we're translating, how about in sign language?

431
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.960 
And this amazing person volunteered. Right, we didn't have to

432
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.980 
pay him I think we gave him a gift later, but really he volunteered and

433
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.550 
they did the COVID introduction in Indian sign language and

434
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.690 
later our director general got a letter saying eighteen million

435
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:57.560 
community workers are using this with people with impaired hearing

436
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.730 
in India and this wasn't when you know we had this

437
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:04.810 
peak in India. This was way before so we didn't we didn't have

438
00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.430 
to get excited when you know the numbers started going up in India

439
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:09.910 
this was well before.

440
00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.810 
So I think if people understand that your mission is right,

441
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.650 
it's for a social good and of course we have to be flexible

442
00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.510 
and accept that and we have to have quality control. I think

443
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.980 
if we have that that's primarily how we how we went about the

444
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.880 
translations.

445
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.550 
Thank you.

446
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.530 
Any more questions from the audience?

447
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.040 
There's one that here, maybe this is not for

448
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.350 
me but it's still a good question. I think it was for the previous

449
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:45.790 
speaker. We need tools for the community that includes content discovery

450
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.550 
and curation.

451
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.330 
Open source. So, if I may say something on that. Yes, sure yeah.

452
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.500 
And it's really speaking to that point that knowledge isn't

453
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.960 
is no longer in institutions. Yes, institutions have a very important role

454
00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.860 
but the knowledge production, codification, transfer in institutions

455
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:12.890 
take a long time and what we see is bringing practitioners together, particularly

456
00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:17.320 
you know across the world. So our clinical guidelines for COVID management,

457
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.650 
how were they developed. They weren't developed by somebody

458
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.240 
you know in WHO, in university. What we did is we convened

459
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.750 
I think was three hundred or four hundred clinical practitioners

460
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:31.420 
we're in a network around the world got them to help,

461
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.860 
bring crowdsource knowledge, use scientific methodology that

462
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:40.420 
was appropriate for an emergency and then codified that, got

463
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.560 
a guideline and then turned that into a training.

464
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.410 
So these are some of the things that we have to do. The same

465
00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.630 
with Ebola, much of knowledge on how to handle Ebola in the

466
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.290 
community in West Africa did not exist.

467
00:33:54.310 --> 00:34:01.300 
It was created in the field in West Africa in communities in Liberia Sierra Leone

468
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.510 
and Guinea. So you know we are asking people to wash hands but

469
00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.550 
forty percent of the world's population doesn't have access to water.

470
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.300 
We're going to have to be innovative.

471
00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:14.760 
So there's nothing that i'm going to be able to tell them. So

472
00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.710 
this shift, this mind shift that knowledge is created in many different places

473
00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.830 
and we have to find ways to find it, to validate it, to codify

474
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:28.210 
it and to share it with others, of course mentioning the limitations

475
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.070 
and the contextual nature of this.

476
00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.370 
And what I also be interested is like from

477
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:43.470 
you had to learn really quickly during the pandemic now, yeah.

478
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:49.640 
What would you say are the more mid term learnings, or you know

479
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:54.370 
what you take further in the longer term work?

480
00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:00.330 
I think I have a renewed passion for this equity that things must be

481
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.810 
free accessible in people's languages. I mean, we started off with this idea

482
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:09.490 
but the pandemic really you know, drew a red line under it and said no

483
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:15.480 
you must pursue this. You must proactively remove barriers to learning.

484
00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.660 
So, I think in terms of an operation we're doing very well. I

485
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:22.690 
think this is good. You know everybody's happy with us. So I think that

486
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.550 
that commitment to equity and access is important as a you know

487
00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:32.040 
as a guiding light for everything we do. And practically

488
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.630 
I think we have to really move out and

489
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.970 
offer on top of the self-paced learning, we have to go with the

490
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.740 
synchronous interactive learning. Not for such large groups

491
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.230 
or once people have done that, how can we do that at scale and

492
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.840 
that's very difficult to do it at scale. I mean, we did this

493
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.450 
with a couple of hundred people but it was impossible and really

494
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.850 
the third area that I really am finding it challenging and

495
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.350 
everybody's finding it challenging but we should put it out there,

496
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:07.530 
is competency based learning. So people can design learning based on competencies

497
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:11.210 
but we still haven't found out how to assess those competences

498
00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:18.450 
remotely at scale and quickly right. So you know, particularly the softer

499
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.010 
what we call soft skills, how can you work in new teams, how

500
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:26.140 
can you work under pressure. It takes a lot of resources to

501
00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.930 
observe people to say they have the competency but how do we do that

502
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.820 
at scale during an emergency, because we are having to identify

503
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.210 
people to take on new roles in emergencies. So those are the three

504
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.730 
things you know the values

505
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:45.240 
really doing more interactive learning and third is assessing competencies

506
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.990 
at scale during emergency. So those are my three big nuts to crack. I hope

507
00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.610 
people here are clever enough to join me in answering that.

508
00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:02.030 
Thank you and maybe one last question I have - which kind of

509
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:06.610 
cultural differences have you observed in online learning?

510
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.280 
Well I mean, even I hated online learning before the

511
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.610 
pandemic. Oh I'll produce it and give it to somebody but even I

512
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.700 
had to do it so I think you know it has become normal. So this

513
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.760 
is a great cultural shift across humanity, right. Whether you

514
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.470 
know we're doing this over zoom, I would physically go to a

515
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.650 
conference, I wouldn't do anything like this. So we as a race

516
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:34.790 
as humanity know how to use digital tools for communication and learning.

517
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:40.310 
Everybody including very high highly qualified people have understood

518
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.270 
they have to keep learning right, so this concept of lifelong

519
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:48.090 
learning is coming. So I think these are two big changes in culture.

520
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:51.620 
But if you're talking about people's culture, yes that's very

521
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.480 
important. We have to contextualize learning into people's cultures.

522
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.150 
But that can't be done at global level. So what we are doing

523
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.390 
is we're working with intermediaries, societies,

524
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.900 
faith-based organizations in giving them the skills to access

525
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.660 
global or national learning and to help them contextualize

526
00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.630 
it in the culture and the context. So I think those three aspects

527
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.440 
could be really important to going forward.

528
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.780 
So thank you very much again Gaya. This was very very interesting.

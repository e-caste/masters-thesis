1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.600 
start with a quick introduction.
so welcome everyone to the third

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.870 
session of the day the international track and that the last

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.560 
session of the international track.

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.990 
and this one we're going to be exploring a social change

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.010 
and a MOOC adoption around the world.

6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.730 
and our agenda for the session is

7
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.330 
three presentations, three full papers.

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.150 
the first of which will be presented by Julien Jacqumin

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.330 
from NEOMA Business School.

10
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.590 
and the name of the paper is what drives enrollment
in massive open online courses ?

11
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.080 
Evidences from a French MOOC platform.

12
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.090 
this presentation is going to last for about ten minutes, although

13
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.150 
given the comfortable time frame that we've been given

14
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.140 
julia feel free to go a little bit overboard.
that's completely fine.

15
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.900 
it will be followed by a

16
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.100 
perfect  Q and A and we will have two other papers following

17
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.860 
the same format after that. and at the end we'll invite our

18
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.730 
three speakers of the session

19
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.570 
to come back on camera again for a discussion
and for some extra questions

20
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.360 
from the audience. and on that note over to you, Julien.

21
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.300 
thanks thanks a lot for manual
and thanks a lot jose for the  Jose organizing this sessions.

22
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.090 
so the starting point of my paper is  this one.

23
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.530 
it's the difference in the allocation mechanism that I used

24
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.890 
in the earlier education sector on the top we've got the common

25
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.960 
framework, the common allocation mechanism that we see. and it's

26
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.580 
what we call a two sided allocation mechanism. let's face

27
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.080 
it the extreme example is harvard. i would have loved to study

28
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.720 
in harvard, i have to admit i've never applied to go to harvard.

29
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.290 
probably, maybe because i wasn't dissipating they would not

30
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.160 
accept me, but it said, it's not just my decision to go to harvard.

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.130 
so also the decision of harvard to accept me or not to go there.

32
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.760 
in the context of most massive open online courses.

33
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.780 
the open means that we do not have a two sided allocation mechanism
anymore.

34
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.160 
but we have a one sided allocation mechanism.

35
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.500 
it's just the students that decide to enroll at the class.

36
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.030 
and the platform is by default accepting the students,
because of its openness.

37
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.790 
and so the idea is that in this case the enrollment data

38
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.760 
can be in some way meaningful in order to make some claims

39
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.050 
about the students preferences for the courses that are provided

40
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.040 
on the platform which would also be possible with data from

41
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.210 
harvard. but would be a bit more complicated, because it's you

42
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.640 
need to consider take into consideration this two sided aspect

43
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.870 
which is mostly due to the fact that the capacity of harvard

44
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.180 
university is quite limited and the number of place in the

45
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.920 
ola is quite limited, why in an open online setting you can

46
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.280 
depending on certain context. But most of it at least in what

47
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.420 
we're gonna study here that do not have capacity limitations.

48
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.710 
and so the idea here is to use data

49
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.030 
from france university numérique which is a french platform that was

50
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.350 
established by the a joint venture from the french government

51
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.270 
and some french universities to try to infer some information

52
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.020 
about MOOC users. and there are three

53
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.580 
kind of research questions that i try to tackle here.

54
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.520 
the first is try to understand
what are the determinants of enrolment.

55
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.180 
and others some striking differences with real life courses.

56
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.960 
the second is to see whether the differences
between the french students enrolling

57
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.450 
the courses provided on france  university numeric compared

58
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.580 
to international students.
and finally the goal will be to answer

59
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.920 
questions relating to the timing of the launch of the course.

60
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.330 
and this timing relates to two aspects the first one is related

61
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.580 
with the months of the launch.
and the second one is related with

62
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.410 
whether or not there are many other courses that are being

63
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.780 
launched at the same time.

64
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.060 
a word of caution and we've discussed that a bit this morning.

65
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.390 
it's not a learning outcome, as we've discussed a bit
this morning in other settings.

66
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.430 
and  you can see enrollment as a

67
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.320 
necessary condition for learning experience.

68
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.700 
but it's not a sufficient condition,

69
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.720 
but it's a first step.

70
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.530 
so it's important to have this limitation in mind.

71
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.770 
so in term of the data and the methodology. I use course enrollment

72
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.290 
course level enrollment data from from the platform.

73
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.370 
I've close to three hundred courses.
and it's all the courses that they've

74
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.580 
been provided on the platform between two thousand and fourteen.

75
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.830 
and i've data i stop the data at the end of the

76
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.700 
last courses that they've been provided in 2017.

77
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.290 
the methodology that

78
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.490 
i use in order to try to infer information regarding student

79
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.700 
preferences is a multiple regression on isis.
so the idea with this kind of approach.

80
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.350 
i'm not making just brute correlation kind of

81
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.420 
i don't only measure brute correlation. but i'm able to measure

82
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.270 
a control correlations which i think is an improvement compared

83
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.860 
to what has been done in the literature, however be aware that

84
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.880 
it does not mean that the relationship that i am measuring here

85
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.590 
are causal relationships.
so it's still an improvement.

86
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.150 
i think from what has been mostly done in the literature,

87
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.710 
but still it has to be taken with some caution. just to give you

88
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.660 
a rough idea about the course enrollment distribution,

89
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.710 
while you see here that
it's far from looking like a normal distribution.

90
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.250 
and it's quite skewed to the right. and we have some sort of

91
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.070 
courses that we could if you want to qualify as a super star

92
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.860 
courses, courses and rolling quite a large amount of students

93
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.490 
compared to the other courses.

94
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.010 
so let me go straight to the results.

95
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.230 
I mean to the sake of time and let's go straight there.

96
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.050 
and let's only focus on what appeared to be
recurrent observations which

97
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.520 
are not just brute luck and that seemed to show a control robber's

98
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.770 
correlations with the enrollment of students.

99
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.180 
on this first column what we sees
that work the amount of work required

100
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.440 
as assessed on the website as a positive
and significant impact on the enrollment.

101
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.200 
this is something rather curious for an online courses compared
to a real life course.

102
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.020 
and i imagine some of you are active

103
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.090 
in the higher education sector and we were all students in

104
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.790 
what point in time. usually the tough courses the one requiring

105
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.970 
the most work are not always the ones enrolling most students

106
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.180 
in real life. well this seemed not to be the case at the opposite.

107
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.590 
it seems to be that the more work required for the students

108
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.640 
in order to pass the class. the more you will see students enrolling.

109
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.820 
what we also observe is that the the courses are providing

110
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.060 
the ability of to the possibility to students to pay to receive

111
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.270 
a certificate of completion tend to fare better in terms of enrollment.

112
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.450 
or so french courses tend to enroll more students than courses

113
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.080 
provided in other language.

114
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.470 
here there is something quite curious in order to measure.

115
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.190 
let's say the superstars i mention of the

116
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.170 
professor, i use the h-index which is criticize ubl a measure of the

117
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.210 
degree of fit how famous the professor is teaching the course

118
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.310 
with respect to his research activities.

119
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.240 
and some as claimed in the media and also in some articles that

120
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.760 
with the emergence of massive open online courses.

121
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.450 
we will have some sort the superstar teachers
will be teaching for the food world,

122
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.040 
well here what we observe is that those superstar teacher

123
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.180 
are probably not defined as those with a high h-index.

124
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.610 
and on the opposite if you have a high h-index,
you tend to have lower enrollment

125
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.230 
than if you do not have a high h-index.

126
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.210 
that was a bit a surprisein terms of results.

127
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.750 
we also and that's some key take-home here,

128
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.520 
the media coverage in your presence on twitter
where i use data from media coverage from

129
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.920 
google and data from twitter tend to fare much better
in terms of enrollment than the other courses.

130
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.290 
in term of differences, so that's the first part

131
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.790 
the first question i  was aiming to answer.
the second is are the differences between

132
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.070 
national french students and international students.

133
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.700 
we see here first of all that

134
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:56.190 
the national students tend to prefer
for french students tend to prefer courses

135
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.260 
which are taught in french why international students
seem to be indifferent.

136
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.050 
and also we see that international students are indifferent

137
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.130 
about the nationality of the institution providing the courses,

138
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.720 
while french students seem to be attracted by courses provided
by foreign institutions,

139
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.430 
which i think is something which is important mentioning.

140
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.660 
about the timing of the launch of the course here there are

141
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.010 
two kinds of results the first one
which is presented here on the graph

142
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.260 
is about the timing of the course. and we see that what comes

143
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.930 
up here is that overall french and international students then

144
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.450 
tend to have the same preferences regarding the timing of the course.

145
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.900 
and it seems to be not a great strategy to launch your
course during the summer

146
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.150 
and including september as part of the summer have the part

147
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.300 
of the time to get back to school.
or so the second part of

148
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.440 
the years does not seem to be a great timing,
but overall they have similar preferences

149
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.080 
to french and international students,
except for the month of december where

150
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.510 
we have that french students tend to like to attend courses that are

151
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.650 
being aired online in december,
while this is not true for international students.

152
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.190 
they tend not to be very active on the platform at that time of year.

153
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.470 
the other aspects regarding timing relates to what we call

154
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.380 
in economics same side network externalities.

155
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.170 
so the idea is that we have a platform
which is french university numérique which

156
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.370 
is composed of students on one side of the platform.

157
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.760 
and on the other side of the platform of institutions
nd teachers providing courses.

158
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.040 
and what we are interested here is trying to measure whether

159
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.560 
you are launching a course, whether it is better for you in

160
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.230 
case you want to enroll a lot of students to launch your course

161
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.160 
at a time where many other schools are launching courses at

162
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.190 
the same time as you.

163
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.930 
we look at different dimensions, so the number of courses that

164
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.390 
are provided by other institutions doing the same amounts and also

165
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.500 
the number of courses on the topic that you are teaching at the

166
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.650 
this specific months.

167
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.060 
and what we observed is that in the data, but did not show the

168
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.230 
full result, because it's easier, just to say that there's not

169
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:22.820 
seem to be neither positive neither negative
same side network externalities.

170
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.770 
so whether there are a lot of courses available at the platform and

171
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.560 
there are being set on line at the platform at the same time

172
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.830 
as you, does not increase the enrollment
that you will have neither decreases it.

173
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.670 
and this is important, because we know in economics in the case

174
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.980 
where there are positive same side externalities.

175
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.520 
there will be some sort of concentration forces
in this kind of market

176
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.810 
that will lead to a platform concentration platform mergers,

177
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.660 
and the emergence of one platform dominating the whole market.

178
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.310 
and this does not seem based on the data. we have here this

179
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.060 
does not seem to be the case with france university.

180
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.650 
so let me conclude an discussion and maybe

181
00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.470 
show some things that could be
interesting to to discuss further on.

182
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.930 
at first thing first they come is that media coverage,

183
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.790 
seems to be very important.
and here's just i think it's something

184
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.570 
that is very curious i don't know,
if you've seen the data about the coursara.

185
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.430 
the accounting data from coursera in 2020.

186
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.870 
they spend on average thirty seven percent

187
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:38.530 
off the budget on marketing expenses.
so i'm not saying all the schools

188
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.390 
are although the massive open online platforms should do that.

189
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.260 
but it seems that marketing expenses are a good way in order to

190
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.370 
attract and enroll more students.

191
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.770 
but i think it remains an open question
whether platforms especially one which

192
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.560 
like france university numeric should do that,

193
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.550 
but i think it's still something that is worth discussing further.
so media coverage bringing out there

194
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.920 
to the masses the knowledge and information about the existence

195
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.430 
of your courses seemed to be very important, also as something

196
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.250 
that was recurrent is the fact that students value the fact

197
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.980 
that there is a paid certification option,
not all the courses have this option,

198
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.520 
not remember from other the data. but it's a minority of courses

199
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.680 
that if that based on the sample that i have which is a courses

200
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.650 
from before 2017. while one suggestion

201
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.210 
here could have is just to make it a default option,

202
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.710 
because i guess it's just one line of code extra
that you need to add

203
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.170 
to your pitch course in its she should not a priori as too much

204
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:52.710 
administrative work for the platform,
nor for the teacher putting up the course.

205
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.920 
and the third one is related to a same side the network externalities

206
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.990 
that do not seem to be presented, so based on that  one of

207
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.360 
the implication is that the there are limited concentration

208
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.070 
forces in the MOOC market. so we should not compare to other

209
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.370 
internet markets. we should not observe a

210
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.560 
big waves of concentrations going on and having one player

211
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.230 
dominating the whole market like we've seen with gotham,

212
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:26.460 
for example,
where we tend to see one or at max two players active on the market.

213
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.690 
and so this this result seems to promote the idea that

214
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:38.460 
we should observe in the future quite
an important diversities of platforms

215
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.460 
of massive open online platforms active on the market.

216
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.120 
so i hope i was sharp with the timing.

217
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.080 
thanks a lot for your attention.
and i'm looking forward to hear your questions

218
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.190 
and your comments. thank you very much Julien.

219
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.170 
so at this point as you said we're going to be taking questions,

220
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.050 
feel free to raise your hand or your virtual hand

221
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.330 
or to unmute yourself and ask a question directly,

222
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.640 
or if you prefer you can share the questions in the chat.

223
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.600 
and we'll relate them for you.

224
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.780 
when we have a question for Anna.

225
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:25.420 
yes i was curious why did you stop at 2017?

226
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.090 
the year you would be this analysis?

227
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.880 
yeah that my answer is very simple. It is because i had an agreement

228
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.560 
with the platform to have data up to that time.

229
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:46.680 
so ok no i was guessing that maybe the behavior of
the enrollments changed

230
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.660 
after that or meanwhile and i think of

231
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.840 
this pandemic also affected.

232
00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.110 
what i consider a time trend which all the trends like the

233
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.700 
increasing number of a time of students coming is taken into

234
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.970 
consideration with the methodology I used. but I'm limited in

235
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.620 
term of timing of the data, because I data up to that time and so

236
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:17.980 
as always. I'm always using data and when it's proprietary data

237
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.410 
it's always very complicated to get updates and so on.

238
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.940 
so i was like oh let's say i have the data and and you know

239
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.720 
it's an administrative extra work and i had the data and i did not

240
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.430 
you know the time you need to analyze it and so on it's not

241
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.190 
always easy to have up to the data, but it would be interesting

242
00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.530 
to of course to look at whether a kovac has been a game changer

243
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.390 
on that. but that's uh that's remains i think an open question.

244
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.180 
okay, thank you.

245
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.250 
thank you should i also answer the questions on the chat manual ?

246
00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.410 
or i was going to relay the questions with.

247
00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.080 
by no means, go ahead, perhaps maybe read them
for the audience that maybe

248
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.840 
training just through sound only so dorry as asked did you

249
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.050 
get a chance to compare with any other moocs.

250
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.510 
so i imagine dorry relates to any other movie platforms,

251
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.340 
well it's a bit complicated there have been other works

252
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:21.340 
horses been doing some within roman data,

253
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.450 
but it's a challenge to get access to
this kind of data and to compare it

254
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.980 
Josė has done great work on that,

255
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.890 
but there is no like one database where you get data about all

256
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.390 
massive open online courses and that is representative

257
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:42.380 
often the data is from a sample of courses
which is not necessarily representative.

258
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.180 
and what's nice is that I have the whole population of courses

259
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.910 
from the beginning of the platform up to 2017,

260
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.710 
which i think is makes it.

261
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.790 
i mean it's an added value compared to other

262
00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:01.010 
settings. but it depends on the or  chance she added.

263
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.750 
i mean it's really you need to negotiate to get the data.

264
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.370 
it's not always easy but fun is very accommodating was with respect

265
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.840 
to that compared to other platforms that did not want to provide

266
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.700 
us data about the environment.

267
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.970 
there was a second question by John, is the timing graph showing

268
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.570 
time of launch? yes, it's the time of launch.

269
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.170 
so it's the time of the beginning of the course.

270
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:29.270 
and the idea is that the the course of course can be available

271
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.750 
for a longer period of time and most of the time it is.

272
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.990 
but it's the the first launch of the course that is
what i've been considering.

273
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.990 
when may as warner's questions called the high january enrollments

274
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.790 
be due to new year's resolution that's probably one of the reason

275
00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.860 
another one can be holidays is they are holiday,

276
00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.780 
so you get more free time usually and

277
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.760 
generally a resolutions are probably another one.

278
00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.740 
i tend not to make any resolutions,

279
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.880 
because then i don't have to face them a few weeks afterwards.

280
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.190 
but yes that's probably a possibility.

281
00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.990 
but i could other points by may.

282
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.270 
do  you have any idea how long is the optimal marketing period well.

283
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.290 
that would be that that's something i'm my data is not precise enough,

284
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.760 
in order to answer that question.

285
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.250 
and even here i mean everything here is to be taken cautiously

286
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.180 
i mean in terms of external validity.

287
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.430 
it's unclear whether we can can make conclusions for anything

288
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.740 
else than the platform we have here.
I believe some opposite possible,

289
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.390 
but regarding optimal marketing period the more in-depth analysis

290
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.180 
of that specific question would be required.

291
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.680 
maybe a quick follow- up to that question marketing.

292
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.180 
have we established maybe this something you mention that i

293
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.140 
just missed is, how we establish what we mean exactly by marketing?

294
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.390 
what forms does it take and which ones may be the more effective.

295
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.190 
so yeah, I hear I do not have data about marketing in the paper,

296
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:11.020 
it is just an implication,
because i see that if i use data about google coverage.

297
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.770 
and I use data about the presence of twitter i see that causes that are

298
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.210 
that if a lot of coverage centering almost students.

299
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.650 
the link with marketing is where what's one way in order to

300
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:28.780 
get coverage well one way is through marketing expenses
by adding people

301
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.650 
trying to convince other people to enroll or by investing in ads

302
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.350 
on youtube, on facebook, and so on so forth.

303
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.110 
so i do not have data about that. but one of my implication

304
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.540 
is to say well coverage is important one way to do it is to

305
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.260 
do advertising and it happens to be the major player

306
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.040 
on the massive open online course

307
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.050 
ecosystem which is coursera which invest
a whole lot into advertisements.

308
00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.440 
just to give you an idea. thirty seven percent of your spending

309
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:08.410 
is going to marketing expenses an average university
is zero point five percent.

310
00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.740 
so you see the the gap is very big. and usually if you look

311
00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.750 
at sector level analyzes the sector investing
the most from all the sectors

312
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.010 
in marketing expenses is the pharmaceutical sector.

313
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:27.130 
and it's rarely above ten percent. so 37 percent is very very high.

314
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.550 
some of it can be due to the fact that it is online and online is

315
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.740 
activities that are taking place online are not a specific sector.

316
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.320 
and those institution might be much more practive
with respect to marketing expenses.

317
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:45.670 
but thirty seven percent is  really a lot of work

318
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:50.040 
especially knowing the size of coursera.
it's really a lot of of money.

319
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:56.340 
thank you Julien. I think we may have time for one last question,

320
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.210 
and if no one wants.

321
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.700 
i'll be happy to do it.

322
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.130 
by your responses julian is clear that you are a professor

323
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.020 
in a business school.

324
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.210 
I want to ask you about, because one of the

325
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.550 
one of the clear applications of
this research can be to drive in german.

326
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.580 
But I was wondering, if for example we could also use this kind

327
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.290 
of analysis to decrease certain gaps by tweaking landing pages

328
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.120 
or the kind of content that we use

329
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.450 
or the profiles of the professors and so on.

330
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.690 
so yeah for that, i  think that in order to be able to

331
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:43.520 
go a bit more in-depth,
you would need to to have much more precise information here.

332
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:48.650 
so, for example i did not do
for example a texture analysis of the courses.

333
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.390 
especially about the trailer because one we've been talking

334
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.680 
about marketing one of it is the trailer of
the course which is a very

335
00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.360 
important and potentially influential marketing practices in

336
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.250 
order to attract students.

337
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.690 
but it's yeah i think to make further conclusions about
how to set up

338
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.510 
the profiles and so on. i think there are other methods that

339
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.040 
would be more suited to using experimental methods and maybe if

340
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.470 
a course with two parallel profiles and one with a small tricking

341
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.440 
to change and see whether this is an impact on enrollment,

342
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.820 
i think there are other methods

343
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.960 
in order to try to answer questions like that.

344
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.640 
my method is taking into consideration a lot of data.
but I do not have an

345
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.570 
experimental setting in order to be able to make a claims about

346
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.620 
how to treat your  profile in order to attract some kind

347
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.960 
of student profile of students,

348
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.380 
for example students with from
a specific socio-economic background or

349
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.260 
students with specific problems.

350
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.990 
that's  the super interesting questions,
but unfortunately based on

351
00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:58.210 
on my research that i've done here,
i would not be able to answer that.

352
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.980 
thank you julia.
and at this time we're going to move to the next paper

353
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:10.780 
which is titled fostering women to STEM MOOCS, a fost woman told kids

354
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.490 
and that is going to be presented by Carlos Turro.

355
00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.000 
okay so do you see my scream? yes.

356
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.070 
so yeah and maybe, so thanks a lot for

357
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.020 
your time. so i'm going to present

358
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.520 
our creator's call for woman to stem moocs.

359
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:36.320 
I am here and also around is animal santos from my studio city

360
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.010 
so where is here.

361
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.240 
so my idea is to present what start we are doing about fostering

362
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.200 
woman in studying moocs. an our main target is

363
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:57.370 
that we started wondering if  MOOCs can lower
the gender imbalance in stem.

364
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.500 
so there's a lot of studies that shows that

365
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.690 
a gender both genders are represented in stem courses and we

366
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.570 
wonder whole moocs could happen in this.

367
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:14.320 
so and then, it would tell you about the actions and the results

368
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.520 
that we're using for that.

369
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.440 
one moment just to say that this work has been
supported by another class.

370
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.140 
it's a sixty six month project and we are in day

371
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.570 
plenteous months,

372
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.750 
a bit more than half of the year.

373
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:39.010 
so for doing this were working five higher
institutions from portugal, italy,

374
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.630 
france, spain and sweden.

375
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:48.250 
and both all institutions are committed to making MOOCS
and all institutions

376
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.380 
share the interest in making that more

377
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.570 
woman accessible among gender equality.

378
00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:02.640 
so entering into the work. so how moocs had

379
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.880 
to lower this destroying how to take this problem.

380
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.510 
okay i spent our salvage.

381
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:14.070 
and reading to find three conditions
that we could use for doing that.

382
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.840 
one is try to propose some suggest fresh free of stereotyping

383
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.540 
assumptions and i believe this.

384
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.690 
so when you think on how you should make your next mooc,

385
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.770 
you should think that the beard mooc should be a myth both

386
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:31.970 
for men and for women,

387
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:39.830 
then you have to create a context in which girls and your woman

388
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:44.440 
feel represented, basically that means that you should have

389
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:45.580 
a woman on your moocs.

390
00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.940 
moocs should find broad models that
make them feel part of the system content

391
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:57.560 
you are preparing and find rail war situations in which

392
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.470 
both men and women are represented.

393
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.530 
and first applying good practices in our courses,

394
00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:10.750 
for giving sense of belonging. so and the point here is that

395
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.380 
usually all of us make our moocs thinking heavily on the content,

396
00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.510 
then thinking  on the way we present that.

397
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.460 
but maybe not thinking enough gender balance in whole families

398
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.050 
students will see our content.

399
00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:35.530 
and this is the where we want to had
our MOOC producers and creators fall for.

400
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.360 
so being fast our work is doing on five actions.

401
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.570 
so i diagnosis which is needed with before,
and then we have produced a toolkit

402
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.310 
which is basically a set of rules a set of recommendations

403
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.480 
on how you should produce your content.

404
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.390 
then with that we will create one look out the toolkit

405
00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.340 
to us then moocs using the tool kit as a validation of that,

406
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.540 
and some training sessions with teaching staffs.

407
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.680 
so how what about the toolkit. so i took it is

408
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.150 
a set of recommendations, you should use

409
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.250 
for making your mooc,

410
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.140 
and it could be used for any person or institutions who want

411
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.550 
to make a moocs. so it's open for everybody,

412
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.470 
and the first thing we realize is that the set of recommendations

413
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.620 
should be the same for the people that are making the mooc.

414
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:38.990 
let's say teachers want to test first
or for the picture the people that are

415
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.660 
doing work on that.
let's say the sun is that the selected day matches sunday

416
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.940 
and the things that appear on the mooc or how you

417
00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.900 
prepare the course of the social designers.

418
00:28:52.760 --> 00:29:00.170 
so the mooc in itself will have a different set just  for each profile.

419
00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:10.390 
another thing that we realize when with for our work is that

420
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.890 
it's not the same before or after. so let's say

421
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:22.070 
we don't care about evaluating moocs. so the point is that the

422
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.770 
important part is to make that good from scratch.

423
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.770 
it's not a good practice to find a mooc ,
and let's say you are doing it bad,

424
00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.050 
do it again. because that's not practical.
that's not a practical reason.

425
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.110 
so the point is that our work is aimed to

426
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.930 
to give a set of rules and raise awareness.

427
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.140 
so please move producers clicks contact especially strong designers

428
00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.860 
think on gender balance before you're doing the mooc, not after.

429
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.580 
after you have your work done,

430
00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:58.250 
and basically is not there's nothing you can do at the end.

431
00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:05.540 
the toolkit is in the form of a rubric. so you can find our

432
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.920 
website is the fossil doctor you want to use.
it's really big there.

433
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:15.290 
and basically is a set of recommendations you are using,
you should think

434
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.130 
before or you should have in mind when you are preparing your mooc.

435
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.970 
all recommendations are may simply be basic,

436
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.780 
but on the other hand
when we have reviews on moocs

437
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.410 
look at these recommendations.

438
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.170 
we also realized that people usually

439
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:40.620 
fail on using these pretty basic recommendations.

440
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.140 
basically because you haven't addressed their whitenessm,

441
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.650 
which is one very important part of this.

442
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:51.560 
let's say just for  telling some comments.

443
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.410 
for instance,

444
00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:01.140 
if you are thinking on giving for a guess on your woman a

445
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.350 
sense of belonging in the moocs,
you should have female content extra personal

446
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:10.570 
stuff of the mooc. maybe you know half,
if you have there's no reason for that,

447
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.990 
but when you are selecting who will appear in your mooc.

448
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:18.110 
maybe you can think about that.
and make it equally men and woman in your mooc.

449
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:23.330 
and that is what at the end would provide woman and girls,

450
00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.700 
references and role models that say, this mooc is for you.

451
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.010 
it's not for other kinds of people.

452
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:35.150 
so this is a small part of the content of toolkit

453
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.830 
or for instance for visual designers.

454
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:43.040 
we want for them to think about the matches they are using that,

455
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.000 
if they are gender balance maybe in your mooc all the images

456
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.620 
that you are putting are male.

457
00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.550 
that don't make sense, that just for man,

458
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.940 
for woman, just think on that before hand.

459
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.850 
so about the rest of the action's, basically we're preparing a MOOC.

460
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.140 
explaining the first one tool kit for people that want to learn

461
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:11.730 
more how to apply and everything that will be available for 2021

462
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:17.220 
is in english. and we will provide a transcript and a supply

463
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.590 
of those in spanish and french

464
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.850 
which is depending on there on the interest.

465
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:30.780 
and on the other hand we are preparing a MOOC
for machine learning

466
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.420 
with a point of view in mathematics.
so there's quite a number of moocs on machine learning.

467
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.970 
but we want  as our research.

468
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.570 
we have a phone that girls are quite interested more on social

469
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:54.670 
and the social part. so we also realise
that most of machine learning courses

470
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.850 
are not related to those social topics.

471
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.940 
so we want to make a focus on ethics.

472
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.990 
so we are the mass unethically

473
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.750 
where we that would be hands-on.
I will female role model something

474
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.870 
on gender balance data sets for that.

475
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.620 
just for providing a couple of examples that work with me.

476
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:21.170 
so this is an actual slide from our

477
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.960 
imagine living mooc. our content expert first thought on

478
00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:33.510 
air while we were talking on a suffered by and supervised learning.

479
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:35.350 
for and supervised learning

480
00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.790 
with playing that machine learning to think about,

481
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.790 
how to learn the rules of a game.

482
00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.670 
so you put two male football players

483
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:53.030 
in a baby or at least in our social context male sport.

484
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:58.690 
so that is something that is not really needed,

485
00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.060 
because you could use another i know there are image that woman see

486
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.990 
that they are not thinking on. that's not for me. also if you are

487
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.310 
when we talk about supervised learning. this is a baby,

488
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:15.690 
but is quite clearly a male baby boy. so that's not

489
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:20.680 
that shouldn't be like that. in fact there's not a problem

490
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.770 
in just one image or so on. but if you're thinking on the whole MOOC,

491
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:28.540 
this is something you have to think about. so for instance in this case

492
00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.710 
that shouldn't be a problem to use basketball
that in our social context

493
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.530 
is more a men and woman a sport. and you could put a woman on that

494
00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:39.610 
or you could use babies that are not clearly gender.

495
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:44.700 
so for instance, we feel that by these simple changes that you

496
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.970 
should do in advance. as I told you

497
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:52.690 
girls with more with more sense of belonging
or and more participating in their moocs.

498
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:59.310 
so at the end as conclusions, so we think that most moocs

499
00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:03.120 
may have been afraid achieving a friendly
environment for women in STEM.

500
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:07.490 
so it's not tough to do it properly, but it's better to before

501
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.050 
and the content that we are developing on that website are

502
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.960 
how they are to help.

503
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.920 
so that's all thanks.

504
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.090 
thank you very much Carlos.

505
00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.890 
so now time for questions, if you have a question,

506
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.240 
raise your hand,

507
00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:31.240 
or mute yourself or post in the chats.

508
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.120 
all right, Jose go ahead all.

509
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.370 
I can start. you have a two part questions.

510
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:45.080 
the first part is that if the project contains any evaluation

511
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.380 
phase of the toolkit,

512
00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.960 
how would you validate that it improves gender balance?

513
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.360 
yes, so

514
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.510 
we are going to yeah the reason that we produce the MOOCs is

515
00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.830 
to try to evaluate the content.

516
00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.540 
so we plan to validate

517
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:12.580 
in the product on face with robotics so we are going to

518
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.820 
to direct ourself to the people that are preparing the course

519
00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.800 
and see if they have the mooc.
it has helped us to make a gender balance.

520
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.130 
on the other hand as the long term result of the project we

521
00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.270 
are not so sure about

522
00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.370 
how to measure that. because

523
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.160 
the effect,  if it's there

524
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:42.380 
should appear more on other moocs,
yet let's say for the future.

525
00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:46.510 
so you have it in for the future so of course for the

526
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.470 
two moocs that we are doing.
let's have fun that most of machine learning

527
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:59.040 
we can wait we can could not enrollment and achievement in different
genders.

528
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:05.320 
and so on. but for me it's a bit of a small sample

529
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:11.860 
to make that let's say less for validation.

530
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.320 
maybe I could say something about this.

531
00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:22.560 
well i can maybe i can add that i'm using the two kids of course.

532
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.040 
i'm not with a checklist and then i think i'm going to be the

533
00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:32.080 
one of the authors of the machine learning,
so myself i'm a mathematician,

534
00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:38.470 
and so i do the math spark and we i have a colleague of mine

535
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.890 
a male expert on machine learning.
so we are designing the MOOC together

536
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:52.870 
and we across the so it goes like a discussion

537
00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:58.350 
between us, ok? so he proposes some of the storyboards for the

538
00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.040 
machine learning parts and I discuss with him.

539
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.680 
I was the one that proposed that to change
to basketball instead to give

540
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:11.790 
the example of football and we both agree
that i played basketball, he played

541
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.530 
basketball, why give the same example that you we always see

542
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:22.040 
the same examples. we watched several videos on the MOOCs about

543
00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.580 
machine learning that the examples are always the same.

544
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:31.770 
for supervised it's football,
for unsupervised it's cats and dogs,

545
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:36.890 
and then you jump very quickly to some assumptions that are not

546
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.250 
sometimes connected.

547
00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:47.690 
so it's a matter of the working with the thing,
then we  maybe afterwards we can validate,

548
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:52.740 
if this works or not, because there are lots

549
00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.520 
of machine learning moocs. so maybe we can then see for someone

550
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.220 
posit also in the street that sometimes.

551
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.010 
it's not only the the content, it's also the discussion or the

552
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.380 
the people that enroll, who enroll that's are more austar or are

553
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:17.050 
so of course this is going to be. it's a work in progress.

554
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:22.580 
and we are going to see what happens afterwards, okay.

555
00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:27.270 
and as to the requirements, so we are designing a very hands on

556
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.110 
mooc, not assuming that

557
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.240 
the participants already know some coding or

558
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:42.530 
so we just give all the instruments to begin,

559
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.680 
to start with the

560
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:52.910 
analyzing data and things like that okay. so we are going to use the

561
00:39:54.400 --> 00:40:00.600 
google color and the help with the python, a language.

562
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.050 
and so let's see, maybe it will be going a friendly.

563
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.620 
or carlos regarding another question in the chat.

564
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:19.140 
the framework is explained in terms of stem education,

565
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.430 
do you think it can transfer be adapted extrapolated to other fields?

566
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.980 
i think  the framework can be used for sharing other

567
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:31.080 
fields. so it's not that brought him
with directed that to STEM.

568
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.210 
because i don't have the benefit break is that

569
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:39.410 
where we like a lot of girls some woman is in the system.

570
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:45.560 
so but the framework would be for sure available,
i think about two fields.

571
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:53.570 
thank you.
we have another question in the chart, I gonna read this one.

572
00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:59.070 
where do you see the main difference between men
and women perceiving such machine learning

573
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.120 
besides different types of samples and how do you judge the

574
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.540 
influence of gender ideology on learning

575
00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.480 
motivation and professional outcomes for men and women?

576
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.850 
here maybe Anna,but yeah i can yeah.

577
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:20.090 
but let me just say one thing. so one

578
00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:24.280 
thing that is all around our work is that we try not to judge.

579
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:30.930 
so judging his s is very controversial. it's very difficult

580
00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:33.980 
depends on a lot of the social context and so on.

581
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:41.360 
so yeah basically, they they might know
there is we ask people to reflect, to think.

582
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:45.850 
so how you can do your work better and how you could

583
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.760 
make it that good. so i and you can think for yourself

584
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.310 
with person guidelines so, and maybe i'm not clear on this.

585
00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:02.290 
yes, i  can say that it's important  to

586
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:07.390 
choose well your datasets, because a data set.

587
00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.200 
so the data set i would say that the

588
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:14.690 
i was not aware of such a difference like

589
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:23.410 
what can be the importance of a data set.
so data sets are neutral and

590
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:30.920 
are things that apply everywhere and every time ok.

591
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:39.330 
but i'm not,
now i'm more aware that there are datasets that can be

592
00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.660 
maybe not the data sets, but the why are the these data sets

593
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:48.600 
we are choosing enough than other ones ok, maybe some of them are

594
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:54.820 
not so social involved or things like that. and as a rule,

595
00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:01.320 
i would say that the girls and the young women

596
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:07.850 
cares more about why is these and reasoning.

597
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:13.930 
so I was watching this, i can give an example,
even if it's not well to judge,

598
00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:20.410 
but i  watched lots of videos in these MOOCs and the example with

599
00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:27.270 
cats and dogs was the one to jump in the next
flight to facial recognition, ok.

600
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.710 
so the computer learns that as a baby to recognize cats

601
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.380 
and dogs. and now the computer recognizes

602
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.860 
faces from people in the same, let's say order of

603
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:44.850 
plans like the baby ok.

604
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:52.980 
and this was in several videos,
then I went and I began to research.

605
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:58.280 
because i'm not a machine, i'm not from computer science,
i'm from maths,

606
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.940 
my background it's physics and maths.

607
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:08.460 
and I just started to read papers on facial recognition.

608
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:14.210 
and there is a problem, there is they're a big huge problem.
so facial recognition databases are biased.

609
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.440 
they are one hundreds or almost one hundred

610
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.110 
percent correct when they

611
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:30.240 
need to recognise a white male face,
but then for female white faces,

612
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:38.720 
the normal IBM,  amazon you name it,
lots of softwares file for female faces.

613
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.600 
and then if you go to the black world,

614
00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.790 
the asian they fail a lot.

615
00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.790 
so why not to bring to a video,
these kind of problems that the datasets

616
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:59.920 
are not always ok. so the even sometimes the algorithms are not ok.

617
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.190 
so this was the more or less the our reasoning and

618
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:07.000 
the way we are designing now the MOOC,

619
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.230 
also bring this kind of questions.

620
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.180 
thank you anna. i think we have time for one more question and

621
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.640 
this is one i was also wondering about so from the chat martina.

622
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:24.180 
do you also draw on examples of best practices that already exist?

623
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.010 
is there a collection of best practices somewhere

624
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:31.760 
or put in my own words where does this checklist come from?

625
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.150 
it seems to make sense right at the first glance,

626
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.800 
but are these practices based on some recommendations
that existed prior

627
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:44.710 
as within just such a way that we have to show a person that

628
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.370 
we're side basically,

629
00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.350 
and that's a broad view of the literature on

630
00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.710 
what has been done on what could be

631
00:45:55.060 --> 00:46:00.850 
thought we are eager to get more input from whatever is coming.

632
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.970 
so we have a place for people to

633
00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:11.240 
put that. and also we did a survey of current MOOCs,
trying to find good

634
00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:17.510 
practices. unfortunately a wouldn't then ask for permission

635
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.070 
to the authors of those moocs. so we can publish that.

636
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:25.860 
because maybe especially for the above examples,

637
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:30.570 
i think it would be not polite to publish those examples
without talking with the authors.

638
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:35.050 
but i think it's understood.

639
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:41.230 
well thank you both karlos and thank you for your questions.

640
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:46.920 
or we're going to move to the third and final paper of the session.

641
00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:54.240 
the paper is titled the mooc syria observatory study
the current situation of moocs.

642
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.760 
and strategies to improve their adoption in ecuadorian universities.

643
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:04.860 
and the paper if i am not mistaken is going to be presented

644
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:06.500 
by Jorge Maldonado Mahauad.

645
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.440 
so first all have a good day

646
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.880 
for everybody, greetings from the other side of the continent.

647
00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:25.720 
i am in right now in ecuador. here is 7 a.m in the morning.

648
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:30.990 
so we have a great day a beginning with this amazing conference.

649
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:36.820 
so today i'm going to present the MOOC ecedia observatory that

650
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:41.550 
is on a strategy that we built in ecuador in order to know

651
00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.640 
how we can start producing moocs.
so you will see some difference between

652
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.580 
moocs in latin america and mooc

653
00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:57.090 
for example in order regions such as europe australia etc.

654
00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.410 
so first at all let me introduce who i am. I am a father of a

655
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:07.560 
beautiful girl, i should romi very perfectly here, she got the picture.

656
00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:12.940 
and also i am a lover of sports i practice racquetball squash.

657
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:19.430 
i also sometimes write with a group of bicycle people.
and when i was in

658
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.180 
studying in argentina and the first thing that i

659
00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:28.730 
obviously i have to learn is how to make some barbecue.

660
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.640 
so this is mandatory when you go to argentina and make some stage there.

661
00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:39.840 
so in the academic side, i own to the university

662
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:44.290 
of cuenca. in ecuador a cuenca is a city

663
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:49.410 
that has four rivers crossing the city.

664
00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:55.160 
a here is located the university of inca is a university of

665
00:48:55.590 --> 00:49:01.540 
one hundred fifty three years of history. we have so faculties

666
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.910 
from arts, medicine, engineering etc and we are located in the

667
00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.150 
half of the world exactly.

668
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.970 
and we are over 2,300  square meters over the sea.

669
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:19.620 
so we don't have for example as other countries.

670
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:29.110 
the winter, the summer the different stations  in one day we have

671
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:34.330 
the four a stations.
for example there is sunny, then rain there is winter and cold.

672
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:43.250 
so it's interesting but  today
also i am representing cedia, cedia

673
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:48.740 
stands for the ecuadorian research development consortium
and the academy.

674
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:54.480 
it was established in 2002 by the group of ecuadorian universities

675
00:49:54.740 --> 00:50:00.990 
with the proposal of creating the national node of
the global academic network,

676
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:05.030 
and improving the conditions of memory for provision of the

677
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:10.360 
internet to members institutions. cedia is a private non-profit

678
00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.790 
corporation and currently brings together 44 universities.

679
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:18.650 
more or less seventy eighty percent

680
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:22.280 
of the total of the higher education institutions in ecuador.

681
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:28.090 
also a 12 technology institutes and more or less theory

682
00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:33.860 
other kind of institutions such as schools and college.

683
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:38.430 
so the organization provides its to its members with a broad

684
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:43.920 
portfolio of services.
the organization has also ball with to become a

685
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:48.750 
fundamental pillar of support to ecuadorian institution system.

686
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.120 
over time cedia has been internationally

687
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.220 
sight to the point that researchers from
more than twenty countries collaborate right now

688
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:03.630 
with ecuadorian researchers on different projects
funded by the institutions.

689
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:08.770 
in addition to offering its members more than ninety continuing

690
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:13.450 
education courses per year. cedia also operates and maintains

691
00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:18.610 
its infrastructure of learning management systems for about

692
00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:24.370 
24 institutions an opic access learning object a repository.

693
00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:32.540 
and now we have the mooc platform open to all of these members.

694
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.160 
so today as you mention,
i'm going to present this the mooc cedia observatory.

695
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.490 
this is a study of the current situation of moocs

696
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:48.650 
and recommendations to improve
their adoption in ecuadorian universities.

697
00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:56.080 
so as you know this work also was made in collaboration with cedia.

698
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:01.870 
in the person of javier Valdiviezo is the chief in long life learning

699
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:08.760 
education in cedia. and also javier is joining
to us here in this conference.

700
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:12.480 
also juan pablo Carvalle who is the achieve of a

701
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:18.780 
executive chief of syria and Nicolay Samaniege who was the

702
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:23.050 
main director of cedia at that moment.

703
00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.700 
so as you know massive open online courses are

704
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:33.850 
a global phenomenon that is transforming teaching
and making researchers,

705
00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:38.010 
reason about new ways to support the teaching and learning processes

706
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.000 
and higher education institutions. so the adoption of MOOCs

707
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.950 
in different regions of the world has been quite a genius.

708
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:50.230 
most MOOCs are produced in europe and the united states where

709
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.240 
only a small proportion are produced in latin america.

710
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:59.180 
for instance, it can be seen in a report that we prepared in

711
00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:03.470 
early two thousand and sixteen by the MOOC maker project the

712
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:08.410 
erasmus project and on we saw that the incorporation of moocs.

713
00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:12.540 
in latin america has been very slow the rate of production of moocs

714
00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:18.060 
has been between four and five  times smaller than they

715
00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.070 
appears in europe for example.

716
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:26.220 
so according to the data published by this mooc,

717
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.940 
you see observatory for latin america until 2018

718
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.580 
more than nine hundred moocs were produced in latin america

719
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:38.410 
being obviously mexico and brasil the countries that lead the

720
00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:43.990 
production of such courses. so in the specific case of ecuador.

721
00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.640 
this is 2014 the year

722
00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:52.420 
in which the film mach's course initiative was

723
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:58.530 
were registered in the country.
according to the mooc observatory a total of

724
00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:04.190 
26 moocs were register in the 2016.

725
00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:10.230 
and then we have 37 MOOCs until 2018.

726
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:16.070 
so this make evidence about the slow growth of MOOCs in the country

727
00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:21.210 
in two years.
just for example, between these years only eleven moocs,

728
00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:25.210 
if we compare to other countries in the regions.

729
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:33.660 
so the first step that we thought in that moment is
ok, let's do an observatory

730
00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:38.580 
to see what is the current situation.

731
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:42.220 
because we heard that some universities have moocs.

732
00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:50.220 
but where are those moocs.
so that reason a mooc it was to go forward and

733
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.170 
try to build for example this observatory.

734
00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.780 
in order to  build this observatory, we have to

735
00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.850 
review the information and we divide in three steps.

736
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:09.440 
the first steps that we use such as a methodology
was to select the sources

737
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.990 
of information and define of the searches  strategies

738
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:17.690 
to be carried out. so in this point for example,

739
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:23.280 
with are defining what is a MOOC and what is not a MOOC in

740
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.010 
a quarter, because we have a problem here defining

741
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:31.490 
this kind of forces. then a second phase in which we have to

742
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:36.450 
data collection ready registration
and review of the data collected on the fears.

743
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:40.850 
and the last a step was the evaluation of
the results our main conclusions.

744
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:45.110 
so this is the observatory, let me please

745
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:50.910 
change my screen and this is what we have other result.

746
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:56.900 
so in this digital MOOC observatory,
we have some a key indicators related

747
00:55:57.290 --> 00:56:03.420 
to what is a mooc, what if i spoke and what is also
a new term that we saw a MOOC.

748
00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:08.340 
for us a mooc is a kind of mooc probably a last one week.

749
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:16.170 
so for us if it's more like a learning

750
00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.370 
object than a course.

751
00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:25.490 
so in this observatory we can see for example that you can choose

752
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:30.460 
the different type of course a spoke or mooc and we have for

753
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:35.480 
example a demographic distribution in which we can see in different

754
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:40.770 
cities where is concentrated the more amount of moocs produced.

755
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:45.640 
also we try to rank for example different universities,

756
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:50.210 
a public universities pre-paid universities and others that

757
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:52.370 
we call for example is

758
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.990 
networks or financial institutions on all other ones.

759
00:56:57.350 --> 00:57:01.520 
so we can software example the different kinds or the amount

760
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:06.870 
of moocs that they have produced.
also we have characteristic sizes the

761
00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:12.150 
different characteristics of the moocs for example.

762
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.630 
the topics they say how many weeks they have ?

763
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:24.100 
also for example,how long is on average each course?
for example there is very interesting.

764
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:28.540 
because we saw that there that we have moocs that last three hours

765
00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:33.530 
as an average in from different from one institution and other

766
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:38.180 
moocs that in a  week. for example they demand thirteen hours.

767
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:41.110 
so this is very interesting, because we don't have

768
00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:44.670 
more or less a calibrated

769
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:49.610 
number of hours that a  student

770
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:57.130 
has to win in a week of the course. so also this gives rise

771
00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:01.780 
up as to  know that, there is a misconception about what is

772
00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:05.150 
really a mooc in ecuador. also for example

773
00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:11.050 
in this case we surveyed the platforms that the institutions

774
00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:16.050 
have. and we were very surprised that for example,

775
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:19.770 
for build moocs they use moodle. and moodle is not a

776
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:24.630 
platform to build moocs, moodle is a learning management system.

777
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:30.880 
but we have for example other kinds of platforms such as blackboard.

778
00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:36.560 
but mostly open edx is the platform used for most of the universities.

779
00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:41.330 
and also we found and that was a very incredible one university

780
00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:44.240 
that have one course in media x.

781
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:50.860 
so this is the first approach that we have built a regarding

782
00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:55.040 
the moocs, in order to for example understand

783
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.690 
what is a mooc for the universities, what is i spoke for universities.

784
00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:05.160 
and also what is a this kind of mooc that they have a invented.

785
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.390 
so after we have built these observatory,

786
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:15.970 
then we want to know a little bit more about the real situation

787
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:20.870 
of the different universities. and here we have to

788
00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.990 
try to answer some research questions, more research questions.

789
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:32.630 
questions about to that drives us to identify

790
00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:37.510 
the different gaps and factors that we can relate

791
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:43.440 
to the adoption of moocs.
so what we have learned about this initiative.

792
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:49.360 
so we found different barriers and factors
that are affected the adoption.

793
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:54.490 
factors or barriers, such as the technological one relate related

794
00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:58.780 
to the for example the implementation, operation, visibility

795
00:59:58.810 --> 01:00:00.480 
and the use of the moocs.

796
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:06.150 
a barriers regarding to or related to for example the economic.

797
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:11.110 
some universities are lack of resources
to embed the hardware and software

798
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:16.730 
required to develop the moocs, also social and cultural ones.

799
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:20.700 
for example in cultural world we discovered that there is a

800
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:26.940 
resistance to sharing and using moocs produced
by other teachers and other institutions.

801
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.860 
and this is related to the other fact that

802
01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:35.820 
there is a friend at all.

803
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:42.560 
ok, so we have a legal one that is related to the cultural,

804
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:47.140 
because there is some and more than ignorant.
there is misunderstanding about

805
01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:53.160 
how to license intellectually property.
so for example some kind of people

806
01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:58.500 
were worried about that if they build a MOOC
and if they don't have licenses

807
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.880 
such as creative commons. or something somebody will

808
01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:08.140 
steal or take their contents and put their names
for example something like that.

809
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:11.590 
the other one is the conceptual and pedagogical.

810
01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:15.820 
sometimes moocs are not understood or

811
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:20.840 
sorry as courses more like a digital educational material

812
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.540 
and no more than that.

813
01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.690 
so right now we are trying to raise signification the concept of a mooc.

814
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:34.260 
and also what if i spoke most of the courses that we found were

815
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:38.550 
moocs and the people called also moocs. so we start trying to

816
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:42.410 
differentiate these kind of terms and we have the last word

817
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:45.990 
last one that if political and organisational.

818
01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:48.690 
and this is very important,

819
01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.650 
because it is related to the position of the institution
and the services

820
01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:57.540 
involved if the institutions are not interested in big moocs,

821
01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.700 
and they don't understand how they can for example use moocs,

822
01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:07.690 
not only as a digital mooc, but also as a part of the flipping

823
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.850 
learning classroom for example or use

824
01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:16.700 
a mooc as for extended learning for example.

825
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.480 
so we are trying to build some politics from cedia.

826
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:26.590 
an cedia groups all of the universities.
so this will be a great a initiative.

827
01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:32.090 
so after we have learned this about our mooc.

828
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.120 
we start, i know a moocs

829
01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:45.220 
idea or project in which we are trying to frizzle gifts of

830
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:50.760 
training to all of the teachers and some of institution

831
01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:57.810 
in order that they understand what is a mooc fears,

832
01:02:57.970 --> 01:03:01.390 
how to be loved, how to design?
how to immolate these moocs and how to

833
01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.510 
have an idea of a mooc? design the mooc on a deploy or put those

834
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:11.970 
contents in a platform. and after that we are going to provide

835
01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:16.160 
some for example a learning analytics services, in order that

836
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:21.820 
we can start understanding what is
the characteristics of the students that

837
01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:26.440 
take moocs for example.
so more or less this initiative is

838
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:31.330 
quite similar to other initiative that we have developed in
other universities,

839
01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:35.000 
such as pontificia universidad católica in chile,

840
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:40.750 
where we work together by the hand of coursera.
and we learn

841
01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.570 
also some important lessons that we have to

842
01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:49.270 
transferred to other countries, such as ecuador  by the hand of cedia.

843
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:55.470 
thanks for your time, and thanks for listening this presentation.

844
01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.830 
and it's great to participate in this conference.

845
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:09.110 
probably all of you are missing to be there in germany probably,
and have this contact

846
01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.610 
and give it a pandemic with we can do that,

847
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:17.630 
but hopefully the next year we can see together
in this conference again.

848
01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:21.520 
thank you very much. thank you very much.

849
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:26.980 
let's take some questions,
if you have any question, please raise your hand

850
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:30.390 
and mute yourself. sebastian, go ahead.

851
01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:36.840 
yeah, thanks a lot for your presentation. and on the state

852
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:42.300 
of moocs in your country. I was interested in kind of the other

853
01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:46.860 
side and you talked a lot about kind of the move provide us and how

854
01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:51.310 
they are distributed across the different kind of regions you have.

855
01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:56.260 
but what about the mooc participants do you see various kind of

856
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.160 
differences, as well.

857
01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:02.670 
yeah, thank you sebastian for your question.

858
01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:07.500 
yet right now we don't have specifically the characteristics

859
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.120 
of the learners,

860
01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:14.020 
because we have more or less eleven moocs. but the analytics services

861
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.120 
is was not working in that moment, so this is one of the reasons

862
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:23.300 
why we start building this project in different phases.

863
01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.810 
because we want to understand better older learners
in order to provide the specific contents

864
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.740 
that they probably need in one pilot that will run doing some analytics.

865
01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:38.310 
we show that mostly ecuadorean students are taking

866
01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.760 
the moocs that were publication or published

867
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:46.190 
in the serious platform. but also we saw a little part of people

868
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:50.910 
from argentina on also from venezuela.
but we don't have a gender

869
01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:55.830 
characteristics for example age or characteristics,

870
01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:01.540 
but right now we are trying to produce first
the content for a learners in order

871
01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:05.590 
that they can take the courses and after that trying to analyze

872
01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.940 
what kind of a learners or people we have taken this course.

873
01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.960 
what can i mention is that for example in chile,

874
01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.210 
we have people taking or moocs in
the pontificia universal catholic of chile.

875
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:26.900 
coursera people from spain, from mexico, mostly also from peru.

876
01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:33.210 
so probably given that the rankings of the university in latin america.

877
01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:37.370 
this is one factor that for example at the beginning.

878
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:42.670 
somebody come in, i mean it's julian who said that
they also the marketing is an important

879
01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:47.680 
factor that affect a how people perceived or

880
01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:52.230 
see the courses in different platforms.
so the main idea after

881
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:57.610 
we study the population in moocs in syria,
we are going to run for example

882
01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.460 
an interesting marketing campaign given that cedia is well

883
01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:09.240 
connected with other kind of net's in latin america,
such a meta read,

884
01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.880 
and also internet to that is an interesting project.

885
01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:19.210 
thank you,  there's a couple of questions in the chat

886
01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.290 
gonna relay them to you.

887
01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:26.640 
may ask what is the eventual definition of mooc that is being used,

888
01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.910 
or cd envisions to be used in ecuador.

889
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:38.040 
ok thank you. may  ok as you know the definition of mooc that

890
01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.890 
is massive open online courses

891
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:45.840 
from the first time that a mooc was published.

892
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:51.940 
these definition of mooc has been a ball bit along the time.

893
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:57.650 
because when you call full or where you say about massive.
what is massive in moocs really

894
01:07:57.890 --> 01:08:02.830 
because you have a lot of students registering in a mooc.

895
01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:08.430 
but how many learners finished the mooc?
only ten percent of rate. so are really the mooc mass

896
01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:12.380 
are really the mass of the moocs. so this is the first thing,

897
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.520 
so the other thing is the the openness of the mooc.

898
01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.060 
for example right now, some platforms

899
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:25.990 
they you can only outbid for example a week of

900
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:30.160 
content and you cannot access
for example the evaluations or the assessments.

901
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:33.630 
that is mainly sometimes they are a main part of the

902
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.060 
activities of the mooc in which you want to for example try

903
01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:41.600 
to test your knowledge.

904
01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.490 
so also we have a reflection about what is openness.

905
01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:51.690 
and from this point of sight the concept of mooc that we have took

906
01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:55.990 
is that the original one. because we want to open your courses

907
01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:00.790 
to the entire population in latin america without restrictions

908
01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:05.190 
of you have to pay for something or you have to pay probably,

909
01:09:06.150 --> 01:09:09.870 
in the next years we are trying to make a business model

910
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.870 
that  can be attractive mostly for the teachers or lecturers

911
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:16.750 
in which they are

912
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:25.750 
more or less partners of slavia and trying for example  to have some

913
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:31.740 
incomes from give the certificates.
but also we are planning for example

914
01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.380 
to interchange credits from the different universities.

915
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.690 
so from our point of view, a mooc is

916
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.960 
the original one concept that we

917
01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.280 
that what we know. so we want to open the

918
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.990 
moocs to all people.

919
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.770 
and that the restriction like coursera water a platform for

920
01:09:54.770 --> 01:10:00.320 
example to pay for have access to the evaluation or assessment

921
01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:03.850 
is not or right yes. so i will give a course a

922
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:11.420 
that is built on a moocs platform
not a learning management system platform,

923
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.710 
and also if you a close the course for us this is an spoke.

924
01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:23.690 
thank you jorge, and we have another question in the chat.

925
01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:27.290 
this one is about learning fields,
such as the social sciences and culture,

926
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:31.380 
probably different types of tools quizzes and ways to teach

927
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:35.090 
and learn have to be considered for these fields which difference

928
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:37.590 
do you see and what would you recommend to use

929
01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:40.970 
as far as moocs in those fields?

930
01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.220 
ok, thank you matthaeus for these questions.

931
01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.180 
yeah probably,

932
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:54.340 
there is one thing that we have to think about moocs.

933
01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:58.740 
moocs right now are more or less such as

934
01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:03.450 
a box, a box in which you have contents there is fixed contents also.

935
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:07.720 
for example the instructional design of the moocs is quite

936
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:14.430 
straightforward. so in social science or culture for

937
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:18.500 
example, or different kinds of topics of moocs not related,

938
01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:21.540 
such as a computer science for example.

939
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:27.090 
we are trying to implement different kinds of moocs depending

940
01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:30.900 
on the learning theories.
for example we are trying to experiment with connected

941
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:37.400 
moocs such as the george siemens did in past years.

942
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:46.300 
and also we built in past years a framework
that we call the mooc framework in which

943
01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:51.460 
for example we recommend some uses of the moocs depending of

944
01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:55.700 
the effort of the institution
that both put in the development of the moocs.

945
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:59.980 
and also the alignment with the curriculum for example.

946
01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.630 
so the pain depending on those x axis,

947
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:07.360 
you can have your own moocs built with your own effort and

948
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.780 
use such as a part of a traditional classroom. for example for

949
01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:15.100 
online later online learning or for example a for extended

950
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.190 
learning or hybrid initiatives and also you can start using

951
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.190 
moocs weeks of the other moocs produced by different universities.

952
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:25.610 
and for example use this material

953
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:33.920 
in a kind of extended learning in which
for example you transfer information

954
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:38.760 
using content from a third party university or something.

955
01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:45.060 
for example in your class you use more active learning practices.

956
01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:48.310 
so there is a great or a huge wave of abuses

957
01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:58.530 
that you can make this kind of social
or cultural or arts mooc for example.

958
01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.230 
thank you very much.

959
01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:07.150 
and given that we have just a little over ten minutes left, i think

960
01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:10.480 
that was a good time to transition to the final discussion

961
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:14.230 
which boils down to just bringing back into the conversation.

962
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:18.220 
all our speakers so julia carlos, Anna

963
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.030 
and jorge, if anyone has any question for our

964
01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:29.670 
panelists, by any means go ahead and mute yourself,

965
01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.480 
raise your hand or share them in the chat.

966
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:45.330 
I can start with the first one.

967
01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.450 
we've seen talks from

968
01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.470 
moocs in different countries,

969
01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:59.370 
in france, in ecuador, in portugal, in spain i was wondering what

970
01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:03.610 
are some of the design decisions that you think are particular

971
01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:05.750 
to the specific context that you are making

972
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:09.260 
in terms of generally speaking producing moocs.

973
01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:14.260 
I can maybe start, if you want,

974
01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:19.310 
i think one of the peculiarity of ethics is have a fan,

975
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:23.640 
so fan is using the ethics architecture and one of its

976
01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.070 
peculiarity is that is

977
01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.990 
a fan does not play the role of an editor.

978
01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:34.690 
so they do not control the quality, they do not set rules on

979
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:37.710 
what is a mooc what is not a mooc. it really gives a lot of

980
01:14:37.710 --> 01:14:40.840 
power to the teacher. and i think it's quite peculiar to the

981
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:45.010 
to the platform compared to us. let's say most famous platforms

982
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:49.610 
like ethics or coursera where you cannot do any course,
you want you cannot

983
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:53.280 
organize it the way you want. you cannot launch it the way you

984
01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.960 
want and i think fun has been a great example of what happens

985
01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.140 
when there is no when the platform provides you tools. but does

986
01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.360 
not guide you on what to do, even though  they provide training

987
01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.330 
and so on so forth. and i think it's a

988
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:12.770 
very french way, i think to do it to give a lot of power to the

989
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:15.750 
people to  give them a lot of freedom in what they

990
01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.510 
can do. and when they can do it and i think,

991
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:23.190 
it's quite a nice future of the platform.
because it opens the room to

992
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:25.680 
much more innovation to

993
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:29.990 
moocs from different kind of institutions from museums,

994
01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:33.770 
from different not for profit organization,
from the administration and so on and so

995
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:37.210 
forth. and i think it's a  very

996
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:41.420 
peculiarity of the design of france invest in music,

997
01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.850 
which i think it's a quite nice added value.

998
01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:47.980 
so in our case,

999
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.800 
i think it's maybe scudo saro

1000
01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.840 
our interesting to know that all the members of the consortiums

1001
01:15:57.870 --> 01:16:00.450 
we all run an open index platform inside.

1002
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:09.620 
so a portugal and france and milano
and us we always have opening x.

1003
01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:15.010 
and i think that is that's nice to have because in some

1004
01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:18.780 
sense we speak the same language when we're planning moocs.
so we're preparing

1005
01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.080 
somewhere things with some peculiarities.

1006
01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:25.810 
but almost all of us speak the same

1007
01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:27.230 
language and it's quite easy

1008
01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.010 
to understand the children and what we are talking about.

1009
01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:33.280 
and maybe as julian say said,

1010
01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:37.380 
maybe that could be different in other platforms.

1011
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:39.090 
but in our case we are learning that.

1012
01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:46.760 
and for me it's a the ability to have a platform that is open

1013
01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.640 
to use and you can start in your

1014
01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:55.880 
institution. i think it's right, so we are very very grateful

1015
01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.910 
for  the people of opening x to open that up.

1016
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:06.410 
thank you got love from our side, for example such as julian and carlos

1017
01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.790 
we have also an open edx instant running on the web.

1018
01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.070 
so if i compare for example there is great opportunities that

1019
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:18.320 
we have for example, for developing some

1020
01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:24.270 
new x blogs in order to gather more information or for example improve

1021
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:28.280 
a youth in a flip learning initiative or something like that.

1022
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.420 
we can for example develop something to put into the platform.

1023
01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:35.950 
that is great that you have this power to create an modify

1024
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:41.370 
the platform. but on the other side,
also when you have for example initiatives

1025
01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:43.780 
or a scenario such as in ecuador.

1026
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:47.450 
it probably the people need at the beginning

1027
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:53.530 
that you show the  way or the path
in order they can build their own mooc.

1028
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:57.460 
so for example we compare this platform with the other one

1029
01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.830 
that we have that is coursera also has for example

1030
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:03.830 
some interesting tools inside the platform. and obviously there

1031
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:08.730 
is a big team behind this platform providing some insights

1032
01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:13.740 
about analytics insights.
also about the characteristics of the learners on

1033
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.100 
also database a lot of the time trying to

1034
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:21.620 
to make some training for the teachers in order to understand

1035
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.900 
that it.  there is something that is more important than the plateau

1036
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:29.990 
that is the design of the course.
and how to push from different learning theories

1037
01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:34.820 
inside the course, for example,
for people that take a mooc at the

1038
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:40.340 
first time. and for example how how to build a

1039
01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:44.260 
successful mooc and trying to balance the

1040
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:49.150 
academy church in ours. because we saw for example that

1041
01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:54.780 
typically the teachers when they design the first mooc.

1042
01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:00.880 
the first week is a kind soft week, in which
they say welcome make the survey

1043
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:04.520 
present yourself in a full room and nothing more else.

1044
01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:09.130 
so one hour of work,
but in the second week of the mooc, they put all

1045
01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:13.610 
of the meat in the barbecue, we say that in a way.

1046
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:18.120 
so a learners probably have to work three or four hours.

1047
01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:21.650 
there is all of the academic church in terms of hours and people

1048
01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:26.780 
drop out the course in the second week. so for example when we start

1049
01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:32.360 
trying to train teachers to do the moocs, we talk about that

1050
01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.900 
is more important the concept of the

1051
01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:38.050 
what they want to

1052
01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.420 
do what are the main objectives of the course.

1053
01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:45.380 
and what abilities they want to develop in learners

1054
01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:47.400 
regarding the mooc more than

1055
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:55.290 
we are going to  teach for example machine learning
or algorithms for kind of.

1056
01:19:55.510 --> 01:20:01.080 
i think there is a misconception that this pandemic
also in ecuadorian universities

1057
01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.750 
a half arrived and is the fact that we are

1058
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:13.380 
teaching based on contents and there is a big mistake.
we have to teach a

1059
01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:18.990 
related to the learning object is.
and the ability that we want the learners

1060
01:20:19.090 --> 01:20:24.810 
half when they finish for example the course.
so for us is very important

1061
01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.610 
the instructional design the learning theories and the way

1062
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:31.030 
you design the mooc more than the platform.

1063
01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.830 
thank you, all three for giving this very

1064
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:38.770 
comprehensive perspective.

1065
01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:41.770 
does anyone else want to ask a question?

1066
01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:47.390 
I see we have one in the comments.

1067
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.990 
I'm going to read it, i guess all venues showing this session

1068
01:20:51.010 --> 01:20:54.430 
aim to be inclusive, however there are some inclusivity efforts

1069
01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:58.830 
that backfired. for example, i heard women
who received computer science scholarships

1070
01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.970 
had their achievements diminished.
because they only succeeded,

1071
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.210 
because they are women.

1072
01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.300 
heard it in other cases, how are you dealing with this back fire?

1073
01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:13.950 
and i don't know if the question is pointed to someone specifically.

1074
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:18.100 
i think not to carlos.

1075
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:23.410 
no i am not aware of such a situation.

1076
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:27.450 
so i have nothing to answered

1077
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:32.450 
i should i could say the opposite.

1078
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:34.900 
usually as a social

1079
01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:42.580 
service what happens is that usually the woman that then says them

1080
01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:46.330 
are because they are more committed to because if you are not

1081
01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:49.640 
committed you don't go. because students sense that you are welcome.

1082
01:21:50.290 --> 01:21:54.950 
so usually a woman in a STEM a form at first better,

1083
01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:59.530 
but there's something like a bias in selection.

1084
01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:03.420 
so my experience is totally the opposite.

1085
01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:11.330 
i can only add that i teach computer scientists students.

1086
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:13.560 
and there are very few girls and

1087
01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:19.790 
the title they receive is they are very hard working girls.

1088
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:23.570 
and well the boy says there are a group which are

1089
01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:29.310 
has the designation of genius. or but sometimes they are not

1090
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:32.580 
genius, they are as well hard working boys.

1091
01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.290 
thank you both, i don't know Jorge if you want to touch on this.

1092
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:46.630 
ok so regarding this both topics

1093
01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:53.160 
are very tavon in a quarter, because also in computer science we

1094
01:22:53.400 --> 01:23:00.010 
have a little presence of women with misery but right now.

1095
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:07.830 
in chile i have heard that for example
when you run for a county seat a scholarship.

1096
01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:14.700 
and they don't give this points only because

1097
01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:19.100 
they are women. so i think probably the panel the region how

1098
01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:24.040 
they balance this kind of things.
so for example in latin america

1099
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:30.760 
probably women are not receiving a scholarships or more points

1100
01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:36.620 
for being a woman. they try to have this equality between

1101
01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:41.010 
the most six man, probably when you have a

1102
01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:46.120 
physical disability you give some extra point for a scholarship.

1103
01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.510 
but no more than that.

1104
01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:55.050 
thank you very much and i guess we might have a question for

1105
01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.370 
a time for a last question.

1106
01:23:58.230 --> 01:24:03.790 
and let me squeeze a one in and this one would be for julien.

1107
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:09.110 
julien, you started your presentation mentioning
harvard mentioning these

1108
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:15.500 
big name universities that the us has
and that are known throughout the world,

1109
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:22.610 
but at our small scale of belgium,
france we do have our own household names,

1110
01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:25.650 
they're more known nationally rather than internationally.

1111
01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:28.780 
but nonetheless,

1112
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:31.950 
they are well established here.
i'm thinking about polytechnique.

1113
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:33.600 
i'm thinking about normal in my soup.

1114
01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:39.180 
are these the outliers that you see in the data are these the

1115
01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.060 
creators for instance of some of
the super star courses that you mentioned?

1116
01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:46.680 
i'm curious about that. that's an interesting point,

1117
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.470 
because they are not so.
they are not the outliers so, if i remember

1118
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:53.080 
the course that is the most followed is.

1119
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:57.170 
i'm not supposed to say it's, because i'm not supposed to because

1120
01:24:57.170 --> 01:25:00.500 
of the data. but it's not a course from one of those institutions.

1121
01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:03.720 
but what is interesting with respect to those institutions.

1122
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:09.350 
they do provide courses on the front platform,
but they also do provide courses.

1123
01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.760 
but that's the case for polytechnic,
i'm not sure whether the a part of

1124
01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.410 
their providing course on ethics are on coursare.

1125
01:25:16.410 --> 01:25:21.450 
but they do provide courses on those american platforms,
while most of its

1126
01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:25.090 
say the cep bar schools the cep bar universities.

1127
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:30.050 
the cep bar french grande école de they would have probably

1128
01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:34.630 
like to provide course on ethics on coursera. but there is coursera

1129
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.590 
and ethics are super selective.

1130
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:41.990 
they only aim for the top and don't ask me about what is top.

1131
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:47.080 
but that's the definition of the people at ethics and coursera.

1132
01:25:47.610 --> 01:25:50.580 
but they do also provide those institution courses
on those big platforms.

1133
01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:53.990 
and there i imagine the enroll much more students

1134
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:55.880 
when they provide a course on there,

1135
01:25:56.310 --> 01:26:00.060 
because in term of scale the number of people
who are part of the ethics

1136
01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:03.470 
on the course or a platform is much bigger than phone.

1137
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:06.790 
so i imagine there then were a whole lot of students for some

1138
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:08.560 
of the courses and much more than on the

1139
01:26:09.150 --> 01:26:14.320 
university new-music platform which is much confidential.

1140
01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.100 
let's say because it's at the french scale rather than at the world

1141
01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:18.830 
scale compared to those two players.

1142
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:23.350 
thank you julien, and thank you to all our speakers, and thank

1145
01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:34.790 
industry actors that is just starting i believe.

1146
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:39.300

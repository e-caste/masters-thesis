00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:13.590 
Welcome all of you to our online learning
course, Beyond Brockhaus Thinking,

2
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.020 
with Design Thinking to a Networked
Culture. It is actually

3
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.170 
an experiment which we are trying
out first time now, after

4
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.320 
12 years of being physically involved
in training Design Thinking,

5
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.760 
helping people to think, learn,
and work in a different

6
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.130 
way. Now we have you sitting in
front of the screen there, there

7
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.170 
is no physical reach out to you.
However, we consider this as

8
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.340 
being a good way of sharing our
experiences with a bigger

9
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.990 
audience and also creating
a new way of interacting.

10
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.220 
With our students, more than
thousands we already had throughout

11
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.620 
the last 12 years, we have been
building these learning journeys,

12
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.610 
also with the companies and organizations
with whom we did projects.

13
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.410 
But now for us, it's really time
to start sharing with a bigger

14
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.450 
audience and also start sharing
beyond just 'How to apply

15
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.940 
Design Thinking to a real life
project?' And that indicates also

16
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.630 
what our learning
courses are not about;

17
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.460 
it's not one of those traditional
Design-Thinking learning

18
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.490 
exercises which you can find now
in the market quite a bit. It's

19
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.390 
not too much on the 'How'
it's more on the what

20
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.370 
are the three core elements.
Because we figured out it's not

21
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.840 
just a process, it's not just a new method
for the method suitcase, it's actually

22
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
yes there's a process, but
it's also very much about

23
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.710 
the team, 'the team of teams' as we
call it and also it's also about

24
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.230 
the physical space and
the virtual space.

25
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.000 
It's the triangle we want
to focus in on and we

26
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.900 
also want to focus on the
'Why', Why is it so important

27
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.500 
in times we are living in right now,
to use this kind of approach?

28
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.780 
And that's why it is also about the change
Design-Thinking actually underwent

29
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.090 
by us shaping it and also by
others helping us to shape it.

30
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.590 
Because it's no longer just an
approach to come up with new

31
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.490 
ideas for products and/or services.
But it also became a principle

32
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.890 
of guiding change within the
organization in order to develop

33
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.550 
new business designs, new business
models, but more importantly,

34
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.010 
also to design the strategic
future. Who do you want to become

35
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.750 
as an organization in the area
of digital transformation, Who

36
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.810 
do you want to attract towards this
organization in the future? And

37
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.630 
this is the 'Why' part that we
also want to dive into with you.

38
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.680 
This focus on the cultural
aspects is also what is

39
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.260 
driving us to communicate with you. We
want to learn from you as well because,

40
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.550 
I think there is a very
interesting community setting in

41
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.320 
front of the screens right now;
you have your experiences

42
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.860 
in your organizations, in your
companies. And what we want to

43
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.530 
do is, we want to use all the
available tools of Open HPI platform

44
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.230 
to get in touch with you, to
learn from you, and get

45
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.920 
you in touch with other
participants as well.

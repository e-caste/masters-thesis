00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.810 
Hi everyone! In this video we
talk about how to facilitate a

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.650 
brainstorming session. Meaning
what is your role and what are

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.450 
your tasks when you want to guide
and motivate a team through

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.450 
idea generation?

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.110 
So, to have a brainstorming session,
you need a team. So keep your

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.710 
eyes open for some colleagues,
family members, or some friends

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.010 
that you can assemble for
a brainstorming session.

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.600 
This will be part of your second
task in the assignment.

9
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.810 
But before your team comes in, you
will need to set up the space.

10
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.020 
Fancy and atmospheric workspaces
like here are great for

11
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.020 
brainstorming sessions. But you can
easily set up your own office,

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.260 
your living room, or even a green
spot in the park into a creative

13
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.900 
workspace as well. Make sure that
it's a space where the team can

14
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.790 
stand up, move around freely, and
has a surface where they can

15
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.610 
collect their ideas. We also recommend
that it's a space where your team

16
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.200 
can be loud and a bit noisy.
Because if they feel like they

17
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.700 
would disturb some colleagues,
they might feel uncomfortable

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.190 
to have these crazy and wild
ideas. We also recommend

19
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.860 
that you take sticky notes with you
and big pens to write on them.

20
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.200 
You might also want to
take a watch with you

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.520 
or a phone so you can track the time. Put your
&amp;quot;How Might We&amp;quot; questions down.

22
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.160 
You can either also write
them on a post-it

23
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.860 
or on a big sheet
of paper,

24
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.020 
or if you have a surface in the
back that you can directly

25
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.890 
write on, just use a big
pen and write on it.

26
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.850 
As a brainstorming facilitator
you should be aware of what we

27
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.940 
call the brainstorming
mindsets or principles.

28
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.020 
We use them to set the tone
of a brainstorming session.

29
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.660 
Team members who are constantly
blocking each other, or

30
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.380 
are negative about everything, or
are talking of over each other

31
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.750 
can destroy any brainstorming
session. This is why it's important

32
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.440 
that you communicate these mindsets
at the beginning of each session

33
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.800 
and also step in if you see
that the team members are

34
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.170 
violating any of these rules. Let us
shortly go through these mindsets:

35
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.890 
Defer judgment: A good idea
may grow from something

36
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.930 
that seems silly or impossible
in the beginning.

37
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.070 
Don't judge ideas immediately!
You want to make everybody feel

38
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.810 
comfortable to speak their
mind and share their ideas.

39
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.840 
Encourage wild ideas: Allow those
crazy and weird ideas to flow.

40
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.370 
This is your chance to think about
solutions without the constraints

41
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.960 
of technology or financial resources. This
may lead to very new creative ideas.

42
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.810 
Stay focused on the
topic: Yes, your ideas

43
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.830 
should be wild, but keep the overall
topic and problem you're designing for

44
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.780 
in mind and gently guide your
team back to it if needed.

45
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.840 
Otherwise you might just
drift off too far.

46
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.100 
Build on the ideas of others:
Listen carefully to the ideas

47
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.200 
of your team. Do they inspire
you? Maybe you can expand one?

48
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.830 
Building on the ideas of others
is not only a lot of fun but it

49
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.080 
really helps to keep those
creative thoughts going.

50
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.780 
One conversation at a time:
Be mindful of one another.

51
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.640 
Listen to the ideas of your team
members and give them time

52
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.790 
to finish their explanations. You
cannot build on each others' ideas

53
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.020 
if everyone is talking
at the same time.

54
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.820 
Be visual: Doing a quick sketch,
scribble or doodle of your idea

55
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.150 
helps the team to understand
the idea better.

56
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.910 
Refute the thought that visualization
is reserved for those who can draw!

57
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.980 
Everyone can be visual.

58
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.270 
Go for quantity: I know, we usually
value quality over quantity in life.

59
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.430 
But in the case of brainstorming we
are turning this principle around.

60
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.220 
Aim to push for as many ideas
as possible, quickly!

61
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.550 
Coming up with many ideas in a
short amount of time helps to

62
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.950 
not overthink or judge. We want to get
into a flow mode in brainstorming.

63
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.900 
The first fifty ideas might be great,
then you have ten boring ones

64
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.800 
then twenty which are kind of weird,
and then twenty amazing ones again.

65
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.080 
Just don't give
up immediately.

66
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.330 
You really want to have a big pool
of ideas so that you can select

67
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.290 
the best ones from this
pool at the end.

68
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.590 
We put these seven mindsets or principles
on seven big posters for you.

69
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.350 
And you can print them out
if you want and put them

70
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.930 
up in the space where you
do your brainstorming.

71
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.110 
When your team comes in for
brainstorming, try to put them into

72
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.890 
a collaborative mindset. Remind them
of the brainstorming principles

73
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.870 
and the &amp;quot;How Might We&amp;quot;
question. Now it's on you to propose

74
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.930 
some techniques for brainstorming.
We introduced some of them

75
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.670 
in our brainstorming
techniques video

76
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.530 
and we usually recommend to start with
a round of silent brainstorming

77
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.280 
so your team members can get all
these ideas out that they already

78
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.270 
have in their heads. Set a
timeframe for each technique.

79
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.730 
This helps to keep the
tension and the energy high

80
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.670 
instead of dwelling on the formulation
of one idea for too long.

81
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.810 
Remind the team to write their
ideas down on the sticky notes.

82
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.340 
One idea per sticky note. And you
should use clear and capital letters

83
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.400 
on the sticky notes. Any idea
that's not on a sticky note

84
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.670 
will get lost during the
brainstorming session.

85
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.710 
After you used a couple of
brainstorming techniques

86
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.290 
it's time to cluster, so ask a
team to look at the ideas again.

87
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.820 
Which ones belong together?
Which have the same topic?

88
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.390 
Making these connections will
further help your team to

89
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.480 
build on the ideas of others.- Try to sense
the atmosphere and the mood in your team.

90
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.830 
Does your team have a flow or
do they feel a bit stuck?

91
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.220 
Maybe they need a mental
perspective change.

92
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.860 
Do they need to calm down
or psych up a bit?

93
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.770 
Try to choose the brainstorming
techniques accordingly.

94
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.680 
After you generated a lot of ideas,
it's time for idea selection

95
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.140 
and we will explain some idea selection
techniques in our next video.

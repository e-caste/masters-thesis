1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.759 
I invite you to the cybersecurity basics exam which starts on 31st August 2022.

2
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.050 
What is the idea? We want to offer to give you the chance to make an exam in cybersecurity basics.

3
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:29.230 
And to this end, you can take three of our two-week OpenHPI workshops focusing on different aspects of cybersecurity, combine

4
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.060 
them and take an exam covering all three of them.

5
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:42.719 
Procedure is easy - enroll in all three courses, receive a confirmation of participation for each of the courses, register

6
00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:54.659 
for the exam course which only consists of the final examination and receive a record of achievement or a certificate.

7
00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:06.840 
If you are able to successfully complete at least 50% of the total points of so get ready and start study now.

8
00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:08.950 
We wish you great success.

9
00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.359 
Speaking about the three courses you can combine.

10
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.370 
There is a self paced study of the first course which is about confidential communication in the internet. Confidential communication

11
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:33.090 
in the internet is important and it's difficult because the internet is an open network, data are transferred and open channels where

12
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:43.250 
everyone has access. And so it's easy to eavesdrop or to manipulate data transported through the internet in order to secure

13
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.560 
messages and data.

14
00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:54.180 
There are technology and methods needed for encryption and digital signature and exactly this is the content and the goal

15
00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:05.030 
of the course to introduce you to these topics, to sensitize you about the risk of data transfer on the open internet and

16
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.349 
to introduce protection measures by cryptographic technologies and their application in the real world.

17
00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.479 
Then there's a second openHPI course.

18
00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.599 


19
00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.550 
The course Digital Identities - who I am on the

20
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:26.009 
Internet, that helps you to understand when you use a digital service, online banking, social

21
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:31.159 
media, online shopping, you need and use a digital identity.

22
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.889 
And what is about digital identities, what is it, how to establish it, how to verify it, how we can bend it to the

23
00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:47.270 
physical persons and are there extremely high interest for cybercriminals?

24
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:55.129 
And if they are able to take over such a digital identity, to take over your digital identity, then they can

25
00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.860 
act in the internet, they can buy in online shop, they can do online banking in your name.

26
00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:11.659 
So what is the content of this course? It is to introduce digital identities, to explain the topics of identity management,

27
00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:22.810 
present different methods for authentication and verification and give hints on how to secure such digital identities against

28
00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:23.349 
attacks.

29
00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:35.960 
And in the third course we propose to combine the two week course about Cyberthreats by mafia, cyberattack, by malware, we want

30
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.360 
to explain the different types, what is malware and want to explain the different types of malware.

31
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:56.620 
This is one of the biggest threat in the internet to the type of security succeed in loading malware on your computer

32
00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:05.849 
which gives them access to your computer which allows them to manipulate data, which allows them to stop the real work of

33
00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.370 
data.

34
00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:16.750 
So the target of malware can be multi million dollar companies as well as your private computer, laptop or even your smartphone

35
00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:23.259 
So in the course we introduce different types of malware together with the cyber attacks which they enable.

36
00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:31.560 
We want to discuss how one can get infected by such malware and learn how to protect our own systems.

37
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:44.720 
So in the security basics exam you can prove that you understand and are involved and have enough knowledge in all these

38
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.750 
three areas.

39
00:04:46.439 --> 00:05:01.300 
So this is the possibility without participation requirements. Everyone is welcome to study the courses which are

40
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:10.860 
providing short learning videos, interactive quizzes, tasks to be solved and related reading materials.

41
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:19.259 
And then if you successfully finish the courses, there are various certificates available.

42
00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:28.459 
Simple confirmation of participation for each course and record of achievement or even a certificate with two ECTS points -

43
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:39.350 
if you get at least 50% of all the reachable points, if you receive all the reachable 50% of all the regional points.

44
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.600 
The exam will be opened in 31st August it is open up to 28th

45
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:53.740 
September. Requirement is confirmation of participation for each of the three causes, for all learners that worked on at least

46
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.879 
80% of the material.

47
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:05.750 
This is possible in the exam, you will have two hours to answer our questions available, certification is a record of achievement

48
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:13.610 
which is available for overall combined causes. So the questions you have to answer is about the content of all the three

49
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:22.269 
courses and this record of achievement is available for learners that receive confirmation of participation of each of the

50
00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:27.250 
three courses and successfully completed the combined exam.

51
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:39.389 
And you can even reach a certificate with two ECTS points if you behave in the same way like for the record of achievement

52
00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:50.350 
but if you start in online proctoring during the final exam, so that we really know that answers were given by you.

53
00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:57.639 
So I invite you to take the cybersecurity basics exam.

54
00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:09.009 
You can use some time to recap to see the material from the three courses and we hope that you'll be able to receive

55
00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:16.060 
a certificate in the cyber basics exam, which starts on 31st August 2022.

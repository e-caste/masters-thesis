00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.399 
Hello out there, my name is

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.229 
Wolfgang Maier. I'm the head of the

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.969 
hardware development organization in

4
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.188 
the IBM Research and Development

5
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.569 
Lab in Böblingen.

6
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.069 
And today I want to give you a little

7
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.169 
introduction into IBM

8
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.729 
POWER systems.

9
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.009 
I want to give you a little bit

10
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.079 
history, background, little bit

11
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.119 
orientation where we are heading to

12
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.369 
in the future and also talk about

13
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.319 
some trends, actually, which we see

14
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.910 
in the marketplace these days.

15
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.499 
So first of all,

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.389 
the IBM Research and

17
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.369 
Development Organization is

18
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.289 
a huge development cluster spread all

19
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.539 
over the world, but for the

20
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.819 
POWER platform, the most relevant

21
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.519 
locations are Austin,

22
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.469 
Texas. Actually, this is pretty

23
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.419 
much the headquarter of the POWER

24
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.339 
brand. And then, of course, also

25
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.139 
looking at the history a little bit,

26
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.049 
Rochester with their former

27
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.389 
AS/400 brand is a major player

28
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.829 
in this game.

29
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.109 
Meanwhile, there are other parties

30
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.269 
involved. The Böblingen lab,

31
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.518 
which I am pretty much located,

32
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.829 
is one of the major

33
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.079 
contributors to the process

34
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.129 
of development.

35
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.689 
And then there is, of course, the

36
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.649 
Bangalore team in India and

37
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.529 
the smaller location with

38
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.019 
a smaller team also sitting in Haifa.

39
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.839 
So these are the major locations

40
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.909 
which are developing

41
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.919 
all the content which is used

42
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.199 
within the POWER systems platform

43
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200 
these days.

44
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.509 
Let's look a little bit into

45
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.189 
POWER history.

46
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.249 
Actually, the first POWER system

47
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.839 
was shipped to the marketplace in

48
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.840 
1990.

49
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.279 
There was a long debate

50
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.199 
pretty much before this really

51
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.089 
happened since there have been a

52
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.435 
lot of discussion between RISC

53
00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:52.319 
architectures and CISC architectures.

54
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.089 
And while CISC architectures actually

55
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.269 
had the major focus before the 90s

56
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.279 
in the middle of the 80s, there was

57
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.289 
a kind of rethinking within

58
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.159 
IBM.

59
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.529 
And the question really was,

60
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.479 
as the boundary conditions

61
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.239 
has changed in that regard, that

62
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.799 
storage was not that expensive

63
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.089 
anymore.

64
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.979 
If RISC could be

65
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.109 
an architecture, which also would

66
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.029 
fit well into the requirements

67
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.379 
of the marketplace.

68
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.089 
There was a young engineer, actually,

69
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.579 
John Cocke, in the

70
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.469 
Yorktown Heights research lab

71
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.389 
who had done some pre-studies

72
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.349 
on that.

73
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.359 
And John Cocke's work

74
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.279 
pretty much was translated then into

75
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.499 
the first Power-One processor,

76
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.359 
which was called the America's

77
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.609 
Project, at which are

78
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.629 
pretty much made it to the

79
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.129 
marketplace in 1990.

80
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.569 
After that, there had been a

81
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.579 
follow-up chip

82
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.469 
every two to three years,

83
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.419 
and there also had been several

84
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.709 
sidelines actually, which

85
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.009 
are pretty much

86
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.409 
designed processors

87
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.839 
for similar purposes

88
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.209 
as the power brand is doing.

89
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.414 
So there had been the 6

90
00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:06.559 
Ox PowerPC

91
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.139 
line, which was a cooperation

92
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.809 
with Motorola and Apple

93
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.129 
on one side.

94
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.569 
And then there on the other side

95
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.570 
there was the

96
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.159 
RS64 actually, which was developed

97
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.179 
in Rochester.

98
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.549 
And for the first six years

99
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.529 
actually up to 1996

100
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.449 
things went well and

101
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.579 
there was a huge market

102
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.949 
success actually with POWER.

103
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.169 
So things were running pretty well.

104
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.239 
But then middle of the 90s,

105
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.129 
out of the sudden there was quite

106
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.349 
a problematic situation since

107
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.329 
the projects pretty much could not

108
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.279 
make their goals commonly.

109
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.319 
And it was close to

110
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.419 
the decision actually to

111
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.889 
pretty much cancel the further

112
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.869 
projects and continue

113
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.029 
with our competitors' hardware.

114
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.949 
In this case, it was a DEC Alpha

115
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.739 
processor which had already

116
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.989 
run at a much higher frequency

117
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.989 
in this case at around

118
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.629 
650 MHz, while the IBM

119
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.549 
chip actually was a little bit behind

120
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.899 
in their days.

121
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.209 
Nevertheless, this was a

122
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.949 
difficult time for the POWER brand.

123
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.309 
This decision was made actually

124
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.259 
not to go with DEC Alpha,

125
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.179 
but instead go

126
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.099 
with a very ambitious project which

127
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.434 
was called the so-called Giga

128
00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:26.376 
processor. And with this Giga

129
00:04:26.377 --> 00:04:28.309 
processor, which today

130
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.352 
is named POWER4.

131
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.919 
IBM really had a huge market success

132
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.019 
in 2001.

133
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.399 
Actually, this was the first

134
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.649 
processor which was breaking

135
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.179 
the gigahertz boundary.

136
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.519 
Actually, it ran at 1.3 GHz.

137
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.769 
And this was

138
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.899 
without any competition at that time.

139
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.859 
After that and with this

140
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.480 
kind of near-death experience,

141
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.629 
the team really understood the

142
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.159 
rules of the market.

143
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.739 
And as you can see from the chart,

144
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.929 
pretty much every two to three years

145
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.879 
a new processor generation

146
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.709 
was shipped to the field.

147
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.419 
And as you can also see on the chart,

148
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.909 
of course, the density

149
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.859 
of transistors actually,

150
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.049 
which was possible given

151
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.059 
new lithography processes,

152
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.009 
was climbing up

153
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.659 
the ladder very, very fast.

154
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.639 
And so today, actually, we talk about

155
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640 
the POWER9

156
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.019 
processor, which

157
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.813 
pretty much was shipped in 2018.

158
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.951 
In this POWER9

159
00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:33.529 
process,we really talk about eight

160
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.839 
billion transistors

161
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.939 
which are located on that.

162
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.219 
So that's a short overview

163
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.079 
of the POWER history.

164
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.569 
Now let's look a little bit into

165
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.490 
what the challenges are these days.

166
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.299 
The story which we just heard pretty

167
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.009 
much is all circled around Moore's

168
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.389 
Law.

169
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.459 
Since I think the real

170
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.739 
thing behind all this is, is to

171
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.289 
lower price actually for computation,

172
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.299 
for bandwidth, for storage capacity,

173
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.769 
for memory capacity and all these

174
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.639 
things.

175
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.649 
This is the really the background

176
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.049 
why IBM invested

177
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.699 
all these dollars actually into this

178
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.069 
business. And this, of course, also

179
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.019 
is the background actually

180
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.419 
why IBM could be such

181
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.819 
successful with the POWER brand.

182
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.739 
Now Moore's Law

183
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.629 
and also

184
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.729 
so-called affiliated laws actually

185
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.679 
to Moore's Law, like

186
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.059 
Dennard's Law and Amdahl's Law, of

187
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.069 
course, had been

188
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.139 
kind of empiric laws,

189
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.359 
actually, which had been defined

190
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.949 
and formulated way back.

191
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.349 
And the question, of course, is how

192
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.269 
long will they pretty much

193
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.979 
reach out into the future?

194
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.829 
And this certainly is something

195
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.529 
which will not go into sleep.

196
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.479 
Specifically, Moore's Law

197
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.399 
is at a critical point these days.

198
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.419 
We are at the point to

199
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.099 
pretty much change our lithography

200
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.199 
methods from ultraviolet

201
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.389 
to extreme ultraviolet,

202
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.340 
an extremely critical

203
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.059 
challenge for the complete

204
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.440 
semiconductor industry.

205
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.759 
eUV lithography really is needed to

206
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.979 
make it beyond the 40-nanometer,

207
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.959 
actually, which are

208
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.179 
state of the art or maybe leading

209
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.649 
edge, of course, but state of the art

210
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.199 
today in the semiconductor industry.

211
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.269 
And there are only a few companies

212
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.619 
in the world, actually, which can

213
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.889 
take that step into this eUV

214
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.869 
world within the next three

215
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.829 
to five years.

216
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.169 
And IBM has

217
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.779 
a very close technology

218
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.669 
relationship with a technology

219
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.809 
partner in order to take that step.

220
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.819 
So this is a challenge, but

221
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.589 
I think we are on a good path here

222
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.379 
and we will see the first

223
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.299 
7-nanometer projects

224
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.399 
actually and also 7-nanometer

225
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.319 
products coming within

226
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.999 
the next some years into the

227
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000 
marketplace.

228
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.789 
The other law actually is the

229
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.719 
Dennard's Law, which makes

230
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.369 
pretty much a clear definition about

231
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.049 
how the power consumption will

232
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.939 
continue, I think at

233
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.619 
that point is pretty clear.

234
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.569 
We cannot go beyond the point

235
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.159 
we are today.

236
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.229 
The outcome of that is that

237
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.179 
the process of frequency, which was

238
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.609 
one of the main contributors actually

239
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.499 
to the price performance in

240
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.479 
the past, more or less

241
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.919 
stagnated in the years 2010,

242
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.709 
2012.

243
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.139 
We are running at extremely high

244
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.959 
frequencies these days.

245
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.189 
The POWER systems range somewhere

246
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.629 
around 4 GHz.

247
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.788 
Our mainframe even runs at

248
00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.288 
5 GHz.

249
00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.149 
But it's not to expect that with the

250
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.009 
common CMOS technology, which we use

251
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.109 
today, that there will be

252
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.659 
any improvements

253
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.839 
in that regard, that we will go

254
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.849 
into other regions than the five

255
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.379 
gigahertz respectively, the four

256
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.599 
gigahertz we see these days.

257
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.279 
The reason for that is is also

258
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.719 
physical on the gate oxide.

259
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.721 
Meanwhile, it's just some atomic

260
00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:06.189 
layers. And I think we have reached

261
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.199 
a break-even here, here,

262
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.279 
where we really have to do the

263
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.619 
balance between leakage

264
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.629 
and performance

265
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.949 
of the system.

266
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.650 
And then the third one is Amdahl's

267
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.550 
thoughts about parallelisation.

268
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.329 
I think the architectural features,

269
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.119 
meanwhile, are at a very high level,

270
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.099 
but it's not to expect that we will

271
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.959 
see new architectural features there

272
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.599 
in that regard with the

273
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.519 
implementation we have in place right

274
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.499 
at the moment, we are at

275
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.569 
extremely flexible point specifically

276
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.459 
for the POWER platform.

277
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.799 
We can pretty much create

278
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.319 
a flexible environment to use

279
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.939 
simultaneous multithreading in

280
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.009 
different ways, be it as

281
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.929 
a two-way or as an eight-way or

282
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.359 
as a four-way multithreads

283
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.309 
or so. From that perspective, I

284
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.229 
think we have invested a lot

285
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.059 
in order to make that flexible.

286
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.489 
But there is no further

287
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.469 
architectural adaptations which

288
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.470 
will be done there.

289
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.839 
So now with that, we have

290
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.999 
had a closer look into the

291
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.099 
environment in regard to

292
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.629 
base technology.

293
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.579 
Besides that, of course,

294
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.799 
the IT landscape

295
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.039 
has changed dramatically.

296
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.289 
This technology

297
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.569 
history we just looked at, this is a

298
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.819 
range of 30 to 40 years.

299
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.589 
But what we, of course, see in the

300
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.109 
last five to 10 years

301
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.269 
is a massive change,

302
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.129 
which is more or less characterized

303
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.320 
by the digital transformation.

304
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.649 
Some people also call it a second

305
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.469 
wave of digitalization.

306
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.479 
The things which are behind that is

307
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.849 
that we see significant changes

308
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.049 
in many, many areas.

309
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.919 
We see on one hand that

310
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.869 
companies are changing internally,

311
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.759 
so they adapt

312
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.009 
their development processes as

313
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.799 
they move forward with a more agile

314
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.259 
towards DevOps processes.

315
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.719 
We see a clearer change in the

316
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.879 
application architecture

317
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.679 
moving away from monolithic

318
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.899 
approaches into

319
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.819 
implementing microservices.

320
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.409 
But then I think the most significant

321
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.809 
part all is about the

322
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.129 
things which are happening in

323
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.162 
virtualization respectively in cloud.

324
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.759 
We see new deployment architecture,

325
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.559 
we see new data infrastructure, data

326
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.329 
center infrastructure.

327
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.029 
And pretty much the

328
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.030 
interesting

329
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.259 
insight in that is that we see more

330
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.179 
and more customized open

331
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.219 
source projects, actually, which

332
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.739 
reach into this area and

333
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.239 
specifically in the deployment

334
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.489 
architecture containers,

335
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.909 
which mostly are used

336
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.839 
in stocker containers,

337
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.389 
are kind of industry-standard today.

338
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.549 
And in the hybrid cloud, the standard

339
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.279 
management, which is

340
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.230 
these days given by

341
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.319 
Kubernetes actually also seems to be

342
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.449 
a kind of open standard,

343
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.459 
which has been accepted by

344
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.319 
the complete industry.

345
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.419 
And all these changes

346
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.579 
massively influence

347
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.069 
the development roadmap of

348
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.019 
POWER these days, since I think

349
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.969 
the transition from

350
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.249 
the on-premise business

351
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.949 
into the cloud business is

352
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.079 
a little bit more complicated maybe

353
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.119 
in the enterprise space than

354
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.159 
it would be in the private space.

355
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.139 
Of course, the expectation is

356
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.269 
that in the enterprise space we

357
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.270 
will see

358
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.219 
unchanged requirements

359
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.779 
in regard to reliability,

360
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.939 
availability, security.

361
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.609 
And pretty much this means

362
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.349 
in order to be successful with the

363
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.419 
enterprise cloud, the

364
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.339 
POWER platform has to

365
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.649 
accept all these rules of the market.

366
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.719 
And these rules actually have

367
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.859 
to be put into the right products

368
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.559 
then, so that we can make a

369
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.359 
successful way into this hybrid cloud

370
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.360 
environment.

371
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.809 
Now, besides the

372
00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.389 
changes in the IT landscape,

373
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.219 
there are also other consequences

374
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.439 
from the digital transformation.

375
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.419 
One of these is that we

376
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.519 
see an exponential growth

377
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.099 
of data now

378
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.629 
that this data are growing

379
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.099 
exponentially. This is not really

380
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.259 
new. We also saw that in the past.

381
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.329 
But when we look at the

382
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.369 
different type of data which

383
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.319 
contribute to this growth,

384
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.549 
there are quite some changes

385
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.949 
actually, which we can

386
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.839 
perceive here

387
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.399 
over the last four or five years.

388
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.739 
And this means

389
00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.760 
we see more and more

390
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.939 
unstructured data, as they are given

391
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.189 
by sensors and devices, medical

392
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.429 
images, multimedia natural languages,

393
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.339 
which really make the big deal here.

394
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.340 
We still see

395
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.719 
growth in enterprise data and

396
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.699 
more structured enterprise data,

397
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.769 
actually. But the big heap here

398
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.029 
is unstructured data.

399
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.159 
And the big question, of course,

400
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.469 
for IBM as a systems

401
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.395 
company and for POWER

402
00:14:11.396 --> 00:14:12.980 
specifically as the right infrastructure

403
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.919 
is do this unstructured

404
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.899 
data require the same

405
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.939 
systems actually as we have seen it

406
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.859 
with the structured data?

407
00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.119 
For the structured data, we have a

408
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.429 
long history of optimization.

409
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.430 
We have seen that

410
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.689 
on the first charts.

411
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:30.690 
I think we started in the

412
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.219 
90s and really

413
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.589 
used all these architectural and

414
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.599 
technological features in order

415
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.729 
to come up with the right systems.

416
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.769 
But it turns out that these

417
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.049 
unstructured data really

418
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.149 
behave a little bit different than

419
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.859 
structured data.

420
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.869 
One of the differences is

421
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.999 
unstructured data are not that dense.

422
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.619 
Structured data are.

423
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.019 
And at the same time, the

424
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.909 
algorithms which are used in order to

425
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.279 
deal with them also have different

426
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.199 
compute capabilities or different

427
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.239 
compute characteristics than

428
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.399 
we see them with structured data.

429
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.469 
Specifically,

430
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.419 
precision for unstructured data is

431
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.319 
not a big deal. Why?

432
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.599 
For unstructured data, of course,

433
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.579 
this was completely different.

434
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.469 
So for that reason, we

435
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.419 
really have to adapt

436
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.039 
our two systems to these new

437
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.689 
requirements.

438
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.609 
I think we are at the beginning

439
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.679 
of a new era here

440
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.569 
in a certain sense, and we

441
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.549 
see step by step that some

442
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.259 
of these optimizations are meanwhile

443
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.999 
integrated into the systems.

444
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.799 
The state of the art part, of

445
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.439 
course, right at the moment are

446
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.969 
neural networks, deep learning

447
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.889 
actually, which are mostly

448
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.639 
realized by use of GPUs

449
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.039 
as hardware accelerators.

450
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.409 
The POWER9 chip already

451
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.449 
has implemented

452
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.819 
in NVLinks in order to optimize

453
00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.959 
this path.

454
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.819 
But besides that, there is also a lot

455
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.769 
of research done in

456
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.649 
the era of neuromorphic computing.

457
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.709 
Actually, this is a new way of

458
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.839 
pretty much processing

459
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.089 
these unstructured data by

460
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.170 
kind of brain-inspired

461
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.519 
techniques, which are very closely

462
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.529 
intertwined with the functionality

463
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.539 
of the human brain and

464
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.429 
which are usually also using

465
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.349 
so-called spikes instead

466
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.149 
of bytes in order to do this

467
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.169 
processing.

468
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.329 
So it will be seen in the future

469
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.219 
how these new technologies can be

470
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.199 
integrated into the platform and

471
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.399 
how we can make use of that

472
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.049 
specifically, also from a power

473
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.119 
consumption perspective.

474
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.699 
And the next few years

475
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.979 
certainly will

476
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.719 
give us evidence actually how this

477
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.549 
market is evolving.

478
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.029 
Now coming to the end,

479
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.619 
looking at the POWER technology

480
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.269 
roadmap, I think

481
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.569 
POWER has a clear strategy,

482
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.609 
which are the target markets

483
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.039 
for the platform.

484
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.509 
As I pointed out at the beginning,

485
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.399 
the traditional Unix market,

486
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.318 
which is circled around AIX and

487
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.479 
IBM i, will remain

488
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.879 
one of the most important

489
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.409 
revenue contributors to POWER.

490
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.509 
So there will be no compromises

491
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.848 
actually in that space.

492
00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.319 
Our new designs will

493
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000 
take a lot of

494
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.899 
advantage from the long

495
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.848 
experience we have in this market

496
00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.739 
and do the right

497
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.629 
adaptations in order to stay

498
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.199 
so successful there.

499
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.080 
Then the next

500
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.169 
segment actually is

501
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.409 
Enterprise Linux, mostly

502
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.849 
SAP HANA workloads.

503
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.769 
POWER is certified for

504
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.469 
SAP HANA for several years now.

505
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.539 
This is a huge market success.

506
00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.519 
It's obvious that there is

507
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.559 
an extremely good fit between

508
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.049 
the workload and the architecture.

509
00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.999 
This is based on things

510
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.829 
like memory capacity, memory

511
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.749 
bandwidth, which really

512
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.909 
gives a big advantage to

513
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.949 
SAP HANA users, which use the POWER

514
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:06.789 
platform.

515
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.679 
Then, as pointed out in

516
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.629 
the former charts, we also

517
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.509 
had the artificial intelligence,

518
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.039 
partially also high performance

519
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.329 
computing space in the

520
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.459 
AI space.

521
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.439 
We have to distinguish

522
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.809 
between inferencing instructions

523
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.069 
actually and also trading

524
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.599 
instructions.

525
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.759 
As I mentioned before,

526
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.069 
the POWER platform has implemented

527
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.959 
in buildings the right interface

528
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.639 
in order to attach GPUs.

529
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.619 
But I think there will be other

530
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.719 
open accelerators actually,

531
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.939 
which will be used in this field.

532
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.709 
And I think we are just at the

533
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.659 
beginning of this new

534
00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.399 
era and there will be a lot of

535
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.900 
technology adaptations

536
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.379 
required in order to make

537
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.579 
AI workloads

538
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.939 
pretty much as capable as we

539
00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.979 
see it with the Rules-based

540
00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.819 
algorithms right at the moment.

541
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.459 
And then last but not least, of

542
00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.589 
course, the hyperscale data centers,

543
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.749 
which are the base

544
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.939 
infrastructure for the cloud

545
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.039 
implementations today,

546
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.929 
of course, cloud comes

547
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.029 
with economical equations,

548
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.699 
so the silicon efficiency,

549
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.829 
energy consumption, area yield

550
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.899 
and so on. These are all things which

551
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.339 
are important in order to be

552
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.349 
successful with the

553
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.119 
hyperscale data center in that field.

554
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.539 
So that's

555
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.769 
pretty much it.

556
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.219 
Thank you for your attention and

557
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.089 
I hope you will have some fun with

558
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.169 
this material.

559
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.170 
Thanks.

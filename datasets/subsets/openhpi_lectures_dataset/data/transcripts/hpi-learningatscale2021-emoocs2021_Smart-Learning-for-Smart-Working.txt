WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.550 
and it is my duty and pleasure to

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.340 
open the session and welcome to the third session of the future

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.900 
track of the e-moocs conference 2021. i'm valentina

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.950 
and i'm the moderator of this session just a few words to introduce myself.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.190 
i have a phd in political science, and i am responsible for

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.280 
the r and d sector and strategic partnership at federico web learning.

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.580 
the center for digital learning of the university of naples federico secondo

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.900 
in italy or in the ault south of italy today. let me briefly

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.110 
present the panel and the great speakers saw today.

10
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.270 
starting from the title smart learning for smart working. this title was designed

11
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.830 
together with well the chairs of the future track.

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.980 
to stimulate reflection on the radical changes we have seen

13
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.060 
in the relationship between education and work. and at the end

14
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.430 
of a year marked by the pandemic and the forced digitalisation

15
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.450 
of all human activities. two aspects in particular seem to stand out.

16
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
on the one end people had to and have to manage their work

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.690 
and working lives in a new way which has given rise to new training needs

18
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.010 
dictated by the demands of working remotely. so not only

19
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.050 
on working and this has been and this is not an easy transition

20
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.100 
which requires new approaches to organising activities and tasks

21
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.900 
as well as time management and communication.

22
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.510 
but at the same time which determines a greater awareness of people

23
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.470 
regarding the role of training in improving their own career prospects

24
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.290 
and in general the way in which people look at their working lives.

25
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.340 
on the other hand as it has been clearly and it is clearly eye lighted by

26
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.460 
the well known reports and us being recalled during this conference

27
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.950 
and also by the keynotes from

28
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
john kaldor reports by mckinsey a world economic forum cisco

29
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.630 
sophie to learn and others the rapid rate of change within

30
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.610 
the world of work and the changing nature of jobs has forced

31
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.770 
us to think about education differently as a process that a company that companies

32
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.500 
people through their working lives so without a separation

33
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.180 
between the years of study and training and the years off

34
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.210 
of work and this as made necessary more and more to focus attention

35
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.960 
on not only learning tools and technologies as we did all

36
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.200 
above all at the beginning of the pandemic emergency.

37
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.350 
but also on the format and the formats and teaching methodologies

38
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.120 
as well as and perhaps above all at least from

39
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.510 
an education institutional point of view on new ways on new

40
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.860 
ways of delivering and organizing learning pathways during the conference.

41
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.880 
we have already heard about the issues of micro credentials

42
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.980 
and the new way of imaging the future of the degrees of non degrees

43
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.890 
and this topic is well no more challenging than before.

44
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.160 
but it is absolutely not new and i just recall a quote by jennifer

45
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.220 
carpenter vice president of talent acquisition at ibm who was already in two

46
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.370 
thousand and nineteen paraphrasing a classical quote by alvin toffler

47
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.160 
and she pointed out in an interview for linkedin

48
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.580 
that recruiters will soon start hiring for something called lq.

49
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.050 
the candidate's learning quotient i'm quoting.

50
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.570 
that means the ability to learn i'll learn re-learn. i remind

51
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.340 
this because it has a bit became a refrain of this discussion

52
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.420 
of the relationship between

53
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.800 
the learning and the traditional learning and the new

54
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.060 
word the work. and in other words this means that the ability

55
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.010 
to adapt together with the ability to improve through training

56
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.550 
become essential characteristics in the world of work of the future

57
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.170 
and this feature has already started. so we have today three

58
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.550 
authoritative speakers this afternoon will explore this relationship

59
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.690 
between the changing workplace and the changing education scenario

60
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.300 
and draw the role that universities and these groups and open

61
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.940 
education play for lifelong learners.

62
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.810 
the first one will be professor will open the floor

63
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.110 
is professor in learning technologies at harvard spirited school

64
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.670 
of education member of the oecd twenty thirty scientific committee

65
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.250 
and advisor to the alliance for the future of digital learning.

66
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.700 
among his latest works

67
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.110 
the sixty year curriculum new models for lifelong learning

68
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.420 
in the digital economy and the previous one learning engineering for

69
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.980 
online education. our second speaker is professor mark mark brown.

70
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.390 
well well well known in the nginx community

71
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.830 
director of the national institute for digital learning at

72
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.780 
dublin city university and a leading member of the eden network.

73
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.820 
professor brown's main research interests are in the area of

74
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.110 
digital learning and blended education which focuses on online

75
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.260 
delivery models including and perhaps today above all moocs.

76
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.180 
effective pedagogy learning design and student experience and

77
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.220 
micro provincial and micro provincials and we will see more

78
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.690 
in his presentation. last but not least professor phil long

79
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.310 
will close the round up professor long is a senior scholar

80
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.780 
at the georgetown university center for new designs in learning and scholarship

81
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.680 
his current work focuses on documenting competencies and higher

82
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.470 
education credentialing. and is also consultant for the us chamber

83
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.400 
of commerce foundation for learning and employment trade course.

84
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.270 
so i'll leave the floor to professor didio is going to talk

85
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.370 
to us about the three main enablers for scaling up education to meet.

86
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.760 
the growing needs of lifelong learners please professor lee.

87
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.300 
thank you so much for inviting me to share ideas.

88
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.500 
i will begin by sharing my screen

89
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.040 
and in about fifteen minutes i will cover three different

90
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.340 
interesting developments that are coming in terms of lifelong learning.

91
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.490 
so

92
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.430 
as was mentioned i co-edited a book that was published last year

93
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.660 
on new models for lifelong learning and the fundamental concept

94
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.970 
is that we are entering.

95
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.670 
a very disruptive half century

96
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.810 
in which we are seeing climate change a failure
to meet the un sustainability goals.

97
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.280 
the pandemic at the front end but probably other pandemics as well

98
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.730 
and what i'll talk about in a minute the advance of artificial

99
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.070 
intelligence in the workplace. and so

100
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.090 
the book describes the fact that lifelong learning instead

101
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.830 
of being episodic and intermittent than something that you

102
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.570 
do only when you're planning some kind of change in your occupation.

103
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:10.230 
a new role a new job a new career lifelong learning will have to be continuous.

104
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.050 
and it will need to build people's capacity

105
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.850 
to prepare for careers that don't yet exist to be flexible and resilient

106
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.980 
self confident and with initiative.

107
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.240 
so the first enabler that i want to talk about is artificial

108
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.200 
intelligence and how it's changing

109
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.260 
my role and the role of university professors.

110
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.220 
and then i'll talk about engineering learning prior book and

111
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.860 
then i'll close with massive communities of practice which

112
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.620 
are a way of taking some of this to scale.

113
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.590 
so i work with a show gohl who is a professor of artificial

114
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.900 
intelligence and computer science at georgia tech university

115
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:57.190 
in the united states. and he has been developing what he calls AI based assistance

116
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:03.250 
for university instructors. so there are tutors that help students

117
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.360 
with types of content that many students don't understand even

118
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.370 
after the course has covered them there are tutors that specialize in answering questions

119
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.180 
teaching assistants to help with laboratories teaching assistants

120
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.560 
to help with library searches. there's even a social assistant

121
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.930 
that helps students who may have similar backgrounds connect with each other.

122
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.590 
and so you can imagine me

123
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.510 
starting really today but certainly in a few years being surrounded

124
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.470 
by all of these assistants who do part of what i do now.

125
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.480 
and of course that creates a very interesting situation in which

126
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.930 
i can be de- skilled if i don't do anything more and sort of

127
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.820 
end up working for these assistants

128
00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.080 
that call on me when they had something that's beyond their capabilities,

129
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.720 
or i can upskill to take advantage of the fact that there are

130
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.040 
many routine things that i no longer have to do and instead

131
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.610 
i can focus on the deeper parts of doing my work.

132
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.880 
and while i'm describing this in terms of university teaching.

133
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.210 
the estimates are that about sixty percent of all occupations

134
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:26.680 
are going to be partnerships between an artificial intelligence,

135
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.290 
and a human being within the next ten years. so this is a major

136
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.160 
shift in the workplace one of the reasons why

137
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.540 
the book talks about the necessity for continuous lifelong learning.

138
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.100 
so what is the machine part of the role and what is the human part?

139
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:51.850 
this is known as intelligence augmentation. so i a instead of a i.

140
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:58.610 
a person and an ai working together to do more than either can in isolation.

141
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:04.650 
and an example of this from science fiction is star trek the next generation

142
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.630 
or captain picard is the human and data who looks like a human

143
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.690 
but is actually an android a machine is the ai and the two

144
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.760 
of them work together very effectively. this is a long standing

145
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.470 
theme in science fiction

146
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:26.420 
some of you who are younger may think about tony stark in the avengers' and jarvis

147
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.090 
his computer side kick some of you who are older might think about pryor

148
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.690 
a star trek captain kirk and spock who is not a machine. but

149
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.330 
he's a machine alike.

150
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.960 
and if you look at the analysis of who does what?

151
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.930 
the machine or the ai does what's called reckoning

152
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.680 
which is calculative prediction.

153
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:59.790 
taking very large amounts of data finding patterns in it making forecasts making predictions

154
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:06.010 
of different kinds and humans do what is known as judgment

155
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.220 
which is like practical wisdom.

156
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.530 
and the distinction between the two is really quite profound

157
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.430 
that machines are becoming much better than humans at doing reckoning

158
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:25.060 
and humans retain the fact that ai cannot do judgment.

159
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.090 
so i i've given an example that shows how this might play out

160
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.650 
in health care workers. but i think the important issue here.

161
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.170 
in terms of this panel is that people in many jobs who never thought of

162
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.670 
the fact that part of their job could be done by a machine

163
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.180 
are now facing a situation where they either upskill.

164
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.880 
or they end up being d skill and the kind of upskilling that

165
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.540 
they do is going to involve reckoning.

166
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.220 
the only other thing that i would say about this before transitioning

167
00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.190 
to the second theme is that unfortunately we're going in the

168
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.960 
opposite direction from this in education.

169
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.860 
so places like harvard how do we admit students we look at high states test

170
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.130 
the sh t the g r e the l sat.

171
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:22.470 
this is reckoning this is the side that ai is taking over.

172
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:27.540 
so we're preparing students to lose to the machine instead

173
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:33.360 
of preparing students with the many human dimensions culture embodied

174
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.170 
experience ethics that the machine cannot do.

175
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.750 
let me shift to the second dimension and we can return to this

176
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.540 
other in the q and a session if you're interested.

177
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.360 
the second dimension is that personalization is a goal that

178
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:57.610 
we've had for a long time in higher education and in workplace training.

179
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.630 
and i'm using a strong definition of personalization. this isn't

180
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.610 
simply saying that learning is adaptive and that based on what the learner does

181
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.950 
that determines the next thing that they get instruction only.

182
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.910 
this is saying that personalization is really about the person

183
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.900 
that students have a choice about the time the place the path and the pace

184
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.030 
of what they're learning and how they're learning it.

185
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.940 
that they have an active voice and shaping the design of the learning experience

186
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:34.770 
and that that the learning experiences involve not just cognitive learning

187
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.950 
but different kinds of social emotional learning which of course

188
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.310 
will be very important if we move to teaching judgment.

189
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.750 
there's a long history of work on this unesco published a report recently

190
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.310 
that talked about different universities that are doing what

191
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.920 
are known as flexible learning pathways which are steps towards

192
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.510 
this kind of personalization.

193
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.680 
now the original vision for this was over half a century ago

194
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.860 
with herbert simon who talked about learning engineers. and

195
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.790 
it's a measure of the pace of change in universities that only

196
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:14.510 
half a century later are we actually starting to do this, but the concept is

197
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:20.560 
that we can take advantage of big data in order to engineer

198
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.410 
different kinds of online learning experiences.

199
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.940 
so you're training a large number of workers or students for an occupation.

200
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.930 
you've got say ten thousand people

201
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.680 
that across different learning experiences are getting education.

202
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.350 
and you do a series of what are known as ab tests where randomly

203
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.940 
chosen half of the learners get one way of teaching it and

204
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.250 
half the learners get a different way of teaching this that

205
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.220 
can be very rapidly evaluated online in terms of network when for whom

206
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.290 
and then you do another cycle of

207
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.640 
a different innovation or a similar innovation to check whether

208
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.750 
or not your conclusion was justified. and over time

209
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:15.900 
in a very agile and rapid and iterative way it's quite possible to tailor

210
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.700 
instruction so that it meets the goal of personalisation that i was describing

211
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.520 
earlier. so what we can't do

212
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.430 
and won't be able to do in at least the next generation is

213
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.440 
to have some sort of a machine

214
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.230 
look at you as an individual,

215
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.900 
and in the way that a skilled human tutor might draw conclusions about

216
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.690 
how you like to learn and what you like to learn. but what we can do

217
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:53.390 
is to use big data in a different way to do a whole series of experiments

218
00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:00.020 
that sort you into smaller and smaller categories that come closer and closer

219
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:05.040 
to your personalized learning style. so that's the concept behind

220
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.060 
this method of personalisation.

221
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.290 
and it's an exciting frontier.

222
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.210 
an analogy in terms of learning would be to the microscope or the telescope.

223
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.990 
the microscope took data that had always been there, but had

224
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:28.810 
never been really even recognized let alone collected or analyzed.

225
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:34.380 
it provided a way to collect it and then ways to analyze the data were developed

226
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.470 
and when we finally understood what that data was saying it changed everything

227
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:45.810 
changed everything. telescope same story the data had always been there.

228
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.100 
we had to figure out how to collect them and then how to analyze them,

229
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.050 
and now the insights that we're getting

230
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:58.750 
from astrophysics are changing many things about our understanding of the world.

231
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:05.480 
we now have the equivalent of the microscope and the telescope for learning

232
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.740 
using our ability to engineer learning and one of the major

233
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:17.360 
missteps of the pandemic has been that at a time when

234
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.070 
people were forced to do remote learning,

235
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:27.590 
pre-college, college graduate school workforce training across the board

236
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.740 
very few places were implementing learning engineering.

237
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.330 
but as many aspects of online learning are here to stay

238
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.690 
that possibility can still be realized.

239
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.820 
so that's something again that we can talk about more in the

240
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.260 
question and answer period if you're interested.

241
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.680 
and if you want more background on this just as there was background about

242
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.520 
artificial intelligence and other kinds of disruption in the

243
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.060 
sixty year curriculum book. there's background on

244
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:03.290 
engineering learning in this book that was co-edited in twenty nineteen.

245
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:11.190 
the third theme is really doing massive learning. that's different than moocs.

246
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.070 
so diana lorillard from the university college of london

247
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.700 
has these diagrams that present a contrast between conventional online learning

248
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.090 
which is in relatively small numbers

249
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.330 
perhaps at the upper end a couple hundred people

250
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.790 
and mooc based online learning which classically deals with very large numbers.

251
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.620 
but which isn't accomplishing the many things that were promised

252
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.760 
by the developers of loops less than ten years ago.

253
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.510 
and so in her paper on the potential of books for learning

254
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.370 
a scale in the global south. she basically says there's a sweet

255
00:19:54.370 --> 00:20:00.030 
spot in between these two where the numbers might be in say

256
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:06.320 
the five or six thousand range. so quite a bit more impact than conventional online learning.

257
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:12.210 
the costs would be relatively low compared to conventional online learning.

258
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:17.200 
but the outcomes would be much better than they are for mooc based

259
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:23.360 
online learning. and the key to this is communities of practice.

260
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:29.030 
now communities of practice where people who have the same

261
00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:35.380 
kind of behaviors talk with one another about what they're doing

262
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.370 
and try to provide advice to one another and better understand those behaviors

263
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.160 
have been around for a while.

264
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.270 
but they haven't really been systematically applied

265
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:53.340 
large scale in university instruction and diana has developed

266
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.960 
courses in the five to six thousand person range that depend on

267
00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.970 
a framework that everyone has in common. this is a framework

268
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.600 
that she uses in her courses such as her course on blended

269
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.310 
and online learning design

270
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:13.550 
and that also depend on the fact that everybody is experienced.

271
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.920 
so this is not a model that works with novices or mixtures

272
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.650 
of novices and experts it's a model that's designed to be successful.

273
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.440 
because most of the learning is pure learning and the pure

274
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.150 
learning is driven by the fact that everybody is experience.

275
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.590 
and there's a lot of sort of reciprocal learning that takes

276
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.320 
place so that no one is cast as being the expert that is being

277
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.480 
nice, but isn't getting much out of it.

278
00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.680 
if you'd like to know more about this one of the things that

279
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:51.010 
i did when the pandemic began about a year and a third ago is to

280
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.870 
co-found with four other faculty members an initiative called

281
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.360 
silver lining for learning.

282
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.290 
we have an episode once a week we're now up to sixty three

283
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.170 
episodes and going strong we're trying to celebrate many of

284
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.990 
the insights that have come out of

285
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.870 
the pandemic as an opportunity for productive disruption

286
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.300 
of our educational models and episode fifty three

287
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.670 
feature. diana and i talked about this model, so that could be

288
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.380 
something that you could look at. you could also look at the

289
00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.140 
site for silver lining for learning, because there's a wide

290
00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.720 
variety of episodes one on the sixty year curriculum and so on.

291
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:38.050 
so i want to close by coming back to the sixty year curriculum concept

292
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:44.060 
of new models of lifelong learning. and to talk about what business are we in

293
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.940 
if we do workforce capacity building or if we do higher education.

294
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.560 
and its many forms or continuing education what business are we in.

295
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.560 
i only have about

296
00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:02.300 
a hundred kilometers north of a town in rhode island called newport.

297
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:07.760 
and there are wonderful mansions incredible historical mansions in newport

298
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.030 
that were built about a century ago or a little longer.

299
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.990 
and they came largely out of fortunes in the railroad industry and

300
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:21.650 
the banking industry and they were very very opulent. they were

301
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.710 
something called the gilded age in america.

302
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:30.690 
within twenty years of those mansions being built they were deserted

303
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.380 
and fortunately many became historic sites and the fortunes

304
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.660 
on which those mansions were built had collapsed

305
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:46.230 
what led to them. the people who had made their money in railroads

306
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:50.500 
thought that they were in the railroad business. but in fact

307
00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.850 
they were in the transportation business.

308
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:58.560 
and so the automobile and the airlines destroyed their business,

309
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.300 
because they didn't understand what business they were in.

310
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.610 
we in workforce capacity building and higher and continuing

311
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.700 
education are no longer in the course business. we're no longer

312
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:16.730 
in the degree business or the campus business or the certificate business.

313
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.440 
we're in the lifelong learning business.

314
00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.540 
and that's a profoundly different business.

315
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.570 
and if we don't want to go the way of the railroad fortunes.

316
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:32.090 
we really need to think about what's happening. so overall in

317
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:36.880 
conclusion i'm trying to sketch a time of enormous opportunity.

318
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:43.560 
but also enormous disruption where things like artificial intelligence and

319
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.750 
communities of practice and other disruptions

320
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:57.450 
associated with engineering learning create opportunities.

321
00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.940 
but also create challenges. thank you very much for giving me

322
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.110 
the chance to share. thank you professor.

323
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.470 
well for these interesting presentation and for pointing out the

324
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:15.550 
relevance of quality and scaling in the lifelong learning environment and

325
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:21.710 
the challenges related to the artificial intelligence. and i think that

326
00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.290 
we will come back to that in the question and answers.

327
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:32.830 
i take the occasion to say to all the audience that well you can start

328
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:39.810 
posing questions in the chart. but you will have also the possibility to speak.

329
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.660 
if you want and to pose directly your question at the

330
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.130 
end of the presentations.

331
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:52.760 
now i pass the mike to our second speaker professor brown we

332
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.130 
will focus on the implications of the changing lifelong learning needs

333
00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.640 
on the core aspects of online course provision including instructional

334
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.690 
design and learning engagement please professor brown.

335
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.600 
thank you very much for the introduction, and thanks chris for some

336
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:16.590 
thought provoking ideas there which i will look forward to

337
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:21.580 
teasing out a little more by way of a little segway. i'm juggling

338
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.210 
several events right now. one being the eton conference and yesterday

339
00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.650 
diana gave the opening keynote tomorrow i have to do the summary keynote.

340
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.340 
so i'm needing to pull together some of the ideas already from diana.

341
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:43.150 
and you might be pleased to see that i also hear your sixty-year curriculum

342
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.510 
found. its way as a good reading during the pandemic. so thanks for that.

343
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:54.560 
i'm using a metaphor here that only a white me might remember perhaps.

344
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.160 
and i say that quite intentionally

345
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:03.530 
get smart television series out of the united states maybe.

346
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.670 
it was translated here in europe.

347
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:12.090 
are you thinking what i'm thinking which is one of the catch lines from

348
00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.330 
get smart series. whoops

349
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.140 
wrong button. it's made a forward number wise, because it has

350
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.950 
another scene that is ranked and one of the rankings is number

351
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.750 
two on the list for the very best introductions to tv series where max

352
00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:34.460 
smart goes through a series of doors. and these doors for me

353
00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.360 
are made a fall for the opportunities that we have.

354
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.180 
but actually in the series when for some time

355
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:46.060 
did we ever get to really pursue those opportunities, because the doors shut

356
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:51.110 
behind us as quickly as we went through them if i want to stretch

357
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.550 
the metaphor a little bit. i'm going to be quite

358
00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.410 
dangerous here. if you like any metaphor

359
00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:03.100 
can be stretched too far get smart like the best of television shows was

360
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.250 
made into a movie back in two thousand and eight. so it's a

361
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.960 
bit like mick's, because there are some who say that we're in

362
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.770 
the second wave of luke. and i mindful throughout this talk

363
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.400 
of the need to kind of just anchor it back into the mooc. because

364
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.270 
the look has not gone away at all and it most definitely has evolved.

365
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.110 
there is another dimension to it, as well if you like is the

366
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.430 
fascination with technology and education in the nineteen sixties.

367
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.500 
here we had technology and your phone and a whole lot of other

368
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:41.320 
technologies that might have worked high touch. but typically it was low

369
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:46.890 
touch in implementation.
we were never that successful in implementing the high take

370
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.140 
into the classroom if you like of the day.

371
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.690 
and then lastly still today, we have this tension.

372
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.910 
it's more than a black and white tension presented here. in

373
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:05.190 
the show get smart there was a battle between control and chaos.

374
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.990 
the forces of good and the forces of evil bad

375
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:15.250 
and new technology is entangled into a complex ecosystem. it's

376
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.390 
not as straightforward as the good and the bad. but we do have

377
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:22.300 
to understand that entanglement. and too often i think it's

378
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.320 
too simplistic and the mooc is very much part of it. my own

379
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.020 
writing, i've talked about the leucas part of social practice.

380
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.410 
so that's a little bit of a framing i've got three things like

381
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.570 
christie cover. hopefully i can do this relatively quickly

382
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.610 
really plenty of time for discussion. i'm going to just start

383
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:46.130 
very descriptively talking about some look making partly. because

384
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:50.210 
it is a look i want to then talk about a mooc. that's used in

385
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.620 
the context talk about smart thinking for smart working in

386
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.870 
the twenty first century. and then the rise and the rise of

387
00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.680 
micro credentials which in some respects of the two thousand

388
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.480 
and twelve was the year of the moocs possibly two thousand

389
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.990 
and twenty one. maybe two thousand and twenty two will be the

390
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.990 
year of the micro credential.

391
00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.350 
so that's the road man get us started. if you haven't seen this

392
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.780 
report it may be of interest it might not have found its way

393
00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.190 
across to north america from one of the platforms featured in

394
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:29.230 
the reason i used again the opening point is for many people,

395
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.960 
is also a dichotomy if i took the chaos this control between

396
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.220 
the private and the public sectors in education and thou shall not meet

397
00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:44.520 
actually in health private-public partnerships are seen as

398
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:49.450 
something that can lead to something better. and so i take a

399
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.070 
view that not all of my colleagues share that. if you're not

400
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:56.040 
around the table, then you're more likely to be on the menu

401
00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:02.770 
and i think it holds us as educators to be shaping
these conversations with other stakeholders

402
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.420 
who rightly have an interest in education.

403
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:11.020 
and the move again is part of that particularly with coursera. now fully listed.

404
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.980 
so speaking of moocs let me just share a little bit of what's

405
00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.820 
been going on in my world over the last twelve to eighteen months

406
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:23.250 
in april last year. remembering that we went into lockdown here.

407
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:27.510 
in europe in early march we launched the look on making blended

408
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:31.100 
education work that had already been in the cake box or

409
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:37.340 
the oven for some time. this is an erasmus funded project based on the european

410
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.880 
maturity model for blended education.

411
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:46.690 
so it was very kind even though institutions had moved on to fully online education

412
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:51.870 
perhaps one take away from this framework is the need to conceptualised.

413
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.990 
the culture in which we work within at different layers not just the institute

414
00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.740 
layer or the institutional layer. so this is part of the kind

415
00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.210 
of ecological perspective that i bring that you need to think of this

416
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.570 
at a much deeper level at each layer. and sometimes it's the

417
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.430 
tension between these layers that are important.

418
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.910 
we're all talking now hybrid and i just put a slide in next.

419
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.020 
because if i mentioned sort of an ecological approach at risk

420
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.050 
of using ecology in a very loose way

421
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:28.680 
for me. a hybrid approach is fundamentally different than blended

422
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.210 
learning. they're blended learning has never really had a satisfactory

423
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.900 
definition many people see it as just putting lots of things into the blender

424
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:40.090 
in the hope that it's going to be better by its nature when

425
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.740 
you're cultivating something as a hybrid your intention is

426
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.680 
to get something better. maybe it's more than just two things

427
00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.580 
and if you haven't seen this really well theorised piece in

428
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.350 
the latest issue of the british journal of educational technology.

429
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:59.720 
i would certainly direct your attention to it. it's a very nice analysis of what

430
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:05.080 
hybrid learning and hybridity is post pain limit

431
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.670 
in addition to when on hyper blended learning.

432
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.680 
we were part of the partnership for future.

433
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:20.380 
in a project where we began in a space of about three weeks

434
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:26.990 
from nothing to produce a mooc on how to teach online. we began in the

435
00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.610 
towards the end of march. and we launched this course at the beginning of i

436
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.090 
think the six beginning of the second week of april. i've never

437
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.110 
been in a university that could launch a course so quickly.

438
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.930 
ninety thousand participants yes ok completion right

439
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:49.360 
over twenty percent. so there's a fair few thousand educators around the world

440
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.420 
that benefited from the social nature of the learning that

441
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.290 
went on in the future in platform.

442
00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.480 
you'll note that diana was one of the cost means as i was as well

443
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.910 
helped to produce this course. and i think there's a lesson

444
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:07.510 
and dyna talked yesterday about learning design as a collaborative process

445
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:12.030 
and building if you like almost. she didn't use collectivism here.

446
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.630 
but i will in the sense of knowledge being in the network. and

447
00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:20.220 
that is still a lesson around moocs that look went on to win

448
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:24.590 
a very significant prize or award in the uk. i did have some

449
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.480 
slides to show you bits of the movie. but i don't think you

450
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.950 
need to see that. so i'll move on to

451
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.460 
my own case. we launched a week and developed

452
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.920 
this project with special covered nineteen research funding

453
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.020 
to develop a course on

454
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.650 
the essentials for the online learner. and this was first offered

455
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.330 
in september last year. the reason i wanted to show you this

456
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:54.000 
is because the basic assumption of this course is that learning

457
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.680 
how to learn online is now a fundamental life skill.

458
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.480 
and so this is one of the skills people talk about digital literacy.

459
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.810 
i think that's broader than just learning how to learn online.

460
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.030 
but in september when we had a new cohort beginning class and

461
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.790 
beginning a new academic year. there was an urgent need for

462
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:18.690 
something in the space another part of this course again in the spirit of

463
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.020 
partnerships and understanding new ways of doing things the

464
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:28.790 
course was co- facilitated by students and so had a real authenticity

465
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.700 
to it. now again i am going to show you some of the

466
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.320 
grounding of the course. i will show you this slide nonetheless

467
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.360 
before i just talk about some of the experience. the course

468
00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:45.320 
was designed around these four pillars tools for working to

469
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:49.000 
ways of working ways of thinking and tools for thriving. and

470
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.670 
in the centre of that was the european commission's new life skills framework.

471
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:58.690 
so lifelong learning is at the core of it. yes employability

472
00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.990 
as well but obviously employability is a subset of lifelong

473
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:06.270 
learning so that framework was launched in about march of last year in europe.

474
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.180 
so we should have had a strong theory of a framework for the course.

475
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.510 
and in this course i think there's a message and i'll borrow from diana again

476
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:19.240 
that learning design matters over fifty percent completion right.

477
00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.360 
in the sMOOC maybe that there was a need also we found that

478
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.930 
sweet spot that crisp referred to

479
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.560 
at d c u my own university over sixteen hundred first year.

480
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.740 
students completed the course through to certificate of completion level,

481
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:40.700 
because unlike looks and most places we embedded. the sMOOC

482
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:45.170 
fully into the student experience so the mousse did not sit outside.

483
00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.790 
the normal mainstream education that's a challenge to take

484
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:51.850 
it to that level in other areas.

485
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:57.200 
we have funding now from the european commission for two more iterations of this

486
00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:03.390 
MOOC. so moving on i now want to talk about what is a little

487
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:07.660 
bit popularized in terms of barring on the industry.

488
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.360 
for dot zero and i did yesterday a keynote about higher education five point zero.

489
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:18.950 
similarly i'm drawing on movies again.
but luca's less important than the ideas

490
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:23.520 
beckon a pro sorry early match and then running in tight pro.

491
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.000 
i lead the development team we have on this particular movie.

492
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:30.120 
it sounds very future centric

493
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.070 
talk. it's not intended to be it's just that these you have

494
00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:38.740 
a very strategic partnership with feature in as you'll see around micro-prudential.

495
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:45.270 
so this course began by asking questions about the future of education.

496
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.050 
and we embedded as you're seeing one of the opening slides

497
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:54.390 
here a video from just which is a body in the united kingdom designed to support

498
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.850 
universities colleges to promote new technology in education.

499
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:03.480 
the video if you haven't seen, i'll post in the check box afterwards.

500
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.820 
because we use this as an example to ask the question who is

501
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:12.250 
shaping the future, and for what purpose the video fiercely

502
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:18.300 
suggests that the future is white males from developed countries.

503
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:23.350 
and somewhat of an elitist view of university education because

504
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.410 
those are the voices that you hear in the video.

505
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.100 
a very disturbing video in some respects around who really

506
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.550 
is shaping the future of higher education.

507
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.990 
and i'll leave that hang, there for a follow up conversation

508
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:45.190 
in terms of fact design we had four weeks, sorry three weeks.

509
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.550 
the first one focusing on future skills, then micro credentials,

510
00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.790 
and then sort of new authentic forms of pedagogy. i'm not going

511
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:57.020 
to go into great detail. but i do want to just throw a few bones out there.

512
00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.970 
our so called new skills agenda transversal skills twenty first

513
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.900 
century skills future skills

514
00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:09.130 
that was the focus. but it wasn't like we just described what

515
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:10.380 
others are telling us.

516
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.760 
we hear from the world economic forum that fifty percent of

517
00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.570 
employees are going to need to be re skilled by twenty twenty five

518
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.660 
have actually been saying that for some years and they're not

519
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.230 
the only bodies doing so.

520
00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:29.010 
we shared in the piper report that actually went so far as

521
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:33.020 
to say eighty five percent of jobs today that learners won't

522
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:38.010 
be doing by twenty thirty. there is very little solid empirical

523
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:42.610 
evidence to support these claims. there's quite a nice three to around

524
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:47.410 
sixty five percent claim taking it back to where they could not find

525
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:52.370 
a primary source.
so i do think we have to be very careful and have our teenage

526
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.700 
when we hear this sort of talk. that's not to argue that jobs

527
00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:00.410 
are not changing and chris's example from the railways hued

528
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:06.110 
me to be thinking about the ice traded at the end door of the nineteenth century

529
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.790 
where ice was a major business and went out of business over

530
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.840 
a thirteen to twenty year period in the final thinking part of the

531
00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.990 
week with micro credentials. and some detail which i'm going

532
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.580 
to pick up on in a second

533
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:27.420 
here's a soda while trying to map the new weekend a new credential

534
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.350 
equality ecology. a little bit sorry late in the day stumbling over my words

535
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:36.630 
i would say there's a fair degree of leakage over the representation.

536
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.380 
but sometimes you have to just make it as simple as possible for

537
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.610 
your line managers. and university leaders to understand what's

538
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.420 
happening in terms of the unbundling movement.

539
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:51.700 
and then this is not just from the movie colin i q is doing

540
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:56.100 
a lot of work in the space i question the methodology. but most

541
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.940 
people are predicting that micro credentials are not just the

542
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.540 
latest fed to hear to sky. so

543
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.980 
we wrap up this particular mooc by then looking to the future of different pedagogies.

544
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.950 
we asked the question really because this came up in covert,

545
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:20.440 
as to whether university students would still after the experience

546
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:24.230 
go back to sitting formal examinations whether this was truly

547
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.040 
a measure of learning or not.

548
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.110 
and then we explored in particular what we would call a cluster of heck

549
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:36.040 
pedagogies and hackathons sprints and a particular initiative

550
00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.300 
that we're heavily involved in through what's called the sci.

551
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.230 
you university this is one of the european commission's university

552
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.370 
alliances. it's the largest twelve partner universities and

553
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:51.030 
take the monterrey mexico is the associate partner. we've already

554
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:56.010 
produced seventy micro modules as a fore-runner to the micro

555
00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:00.250 
credentials that will become available which i won't go into detail of

556
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.520 
right now. rip the course up in asking again let's shape the

557
00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.920 
future who's shaping the future i think that quote from michelle

558
00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.030 
obama still stands out for me that if my future were determined just by

559
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.760 
my performance on a standardized test. i wouldn't be here with

560
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.150 
you. i guarantee you that

561
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.170 
so the last part and i need to take a few minutes here

562
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.920 
is the really drew down and hopefully there's a nice sequence

563
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:30.160 
here for chris philip around micro-prudential since i've touched

564
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.160 
on them more than once micro-prudential is a big

565
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:38.250 
big in the context of covert because the australian government.

566
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.870 
for example but also the irish government are seeing the need

567
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.180 
to get people back to work and the demand for shorter forms

568
00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.500 
of learning. this is a worldwide trend in developed countries

569
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.390 
actually micro credentials were big already in the mooc movement.

570
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:56.460 
well before with class central predicting or only basis saying

571
00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.690 
around twelve hundred micronations already offered through

572
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:03.920 
the mooc platforms back in december of last year the ema.

573
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:08.750 
sorry the european mooc consortium developed the common

574
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.220 
micro credential framework some two years ago. now which is

575
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.120 
perhaps ahead of its time my own university had its very first

576
00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:22.530 
micro credential credit bearing stackable the first in europe on future lead

577
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.980 
in the area of fintech. we launched that last year in february.

578
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.750 
and i had the privilege to serve on the european commission's

579
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:34.240 
expert consultation group on micro credentials producing a report in december.

580
00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:38.760 
what we are doing right now is a european wide public consultation

581
00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.790 
process on micro credentials to feed into our commissioned

582
00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.780 
council statement. and

583
00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.010 
we've been employed on contract to the commission to undertake

584
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.490 
quite an extensive literature review in this area. so i'll take

585
00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.500 
just two minutes if i have the luxury of that to kind of give

586
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.470 
you a taste of what we're doing in that space right now.

587
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:05.450 
we already maintain in the unit that i lead the micro-prudential observatory

588
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:11.050 
which is a very comprehensive compendium of all of the reports.

589
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.920 
and research on micro credentials

590
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.420 
as part of our literature review we're going through the other

591
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.220 
literature through various databases that are available

592
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.750 
scopus scopus scholar and so forth.

593
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.180 
depending on what word you use depends on what you find. i'm

594
00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:34.490 
leaving out the term digital befor reasons that just manage this review process

595
00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.760 
and what we've got is a daughter extraction template that we're

596
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.610 
using to go through each publication which i'm just gonna give

597
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.740 
you a couple of slides to give you a sense of

598
00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:48.330 
to try to better read what the literature is telling us. currently

599
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:52.500 
recognizing there's a lead time here probably of more interest

600
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.540 
in this descriptive stuff here is what kind of way in which

601
00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.610 
micro credentials are being positioned are they truly being

602
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:05.180 
embedded in the mainstream or are they being promoted as alternative

603
00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:11.120 
by universities actually promoting them as alternative to protect the traditional business

604
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:15.220 
to what extent by re-imagining through more of a partnership

605
00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.310 
model or disruption model. i can already tell you that there

606
00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.830 
is very little evidence of that in the literature.

607
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.980 
so there are some inherent tensions and we typically seeing

608
00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.360 
micro credentials more as alternatives and supplementaries.

609
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.980 
and there's very limited evidence of fundamental disruption

610
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.720 
through the micro credentials now. that's not to suggest that's not possible

611
00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.460 
and there are examples that we will profile other things. we're

612
00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.980 
looking at are the drivers whilst i fully agree with chris

613
00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.700 
that lifelong learning is probably the driver that i put my

614
00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:50.460 
most of my efforts around. you can see the range of drivers

615
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.600 
that we've already identified in the literature

616
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.700 
covered crisis employability. but there are many other drivers.

617
00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.250 
one is to reduce cost as cost is probably the single biggest problem facing education.

618
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.860 
so this just gives you an indication that the drivers are not

619
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.970 
all in alliance or alignment

620
00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:13.120 
that there are tensions remember the tensions between control

621
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:17.390 
and chaos i'm going to use here the business models that we're looking at.

622
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.920 
i'm again i made a flippant statement that solo institutions

623
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.060 
are going out there with micro credentials that actually be

624
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.930 
arguably to protect their existing business not entering into

625
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:34.830 
much more transformative disruptive approaches and co constructing with industry

626
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:40.870 
with rare exceptions so last slide i think before just a wrap-up is

627
00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:44.340 
if we're interested in micro credentials and if there is something in

628
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.870 
the fact that they are the next big thing

629
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:53.470 
tongue-in-cheek what we don't have unlike traditional degrees in formal education

630
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.820 
is conclusive evidence about the private and public benefits

631
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:04.040 
of the state's investment in education. it's not causal but we have overwhelming

632
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:08.100 
evidence of the benefits of a state investing in education

633
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:12.780 
what we will need in time is similar evidence if we're going to unbundle

634
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:16.430 
short courses not that short courses are new but we will need

635
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.240 
that evidence to support the investment and that evidence is

636
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.830 
not there right now so to write i guess.

637
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.790 
my last coming to come back full circle to maximum smart is

638
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.680 
are you thinking what i'm thinking is there anything i've saved

639
00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.880 
that reason i expect you or perhaps hopefully you're willing

640
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.060 
to disagree with some of things i've said. and we can have a

641
00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.660 
good debate about it. so i'll stop on that note and apologies

642
00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:43.370 
if that was a little bit more than fifteen to twenty minutes thanks

643
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.220 
thank you professor brown well

644
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.150 
very white presentation of experiences.

645
00:47:53.890 --> 00:48:00.980 
and well very very useful to focus on well micro credentials but pointing out

646
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.130 
the importance to consider.

647
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:10.430 
how they can work how how they work how they can work and perhaps

648
00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:18.710 
underline also in an indirect way. the importance also to think about

649
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.960 
what will be the recognition of this kind

650
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:30.670 
of new credential. but well i hope that the floor will follow your invitation to

651
00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:36.140 
well ask and discuss while not criticising necessarily what

652
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:42.840 
husk four four four or more elements are so our last

653
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:50.790 
speaker today professor longer will be sharing some of his groundwork

654
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.480 
with us looking at how learners can create sharable and trusted records

655
00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:59.910 
of their lifelong learning achievements. i'll please professor long

656
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:04.260 
thank you and thanks both to mark and to chris

657
00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.520 
in a terrific job in setting

658
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:09.000 
through this.

659
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:11.640 
get to questions

660
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.740 
one of the goals here

661
00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.780 
is really to think about i'm working in a more pragmatic domain

662
00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:28.390 
public private partnership a work that mark was just describing

663
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.790 
and so i'm focusing here on

664
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.920 
realigning the work and learning

665
00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:36.830 
trust, trust architectures.

666
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.030 
the goal for this is to re-establish a little bit more

667
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.320 
meaning to the notion of learner agency and make them a co-equal party

668
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.820 
in the educational ecosystem.

669
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.760 
we talk about it in higher ed and tertiary

670
00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:59.240 
a lot we rarely actually implement that in meaningful ways.

671
00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.050 
so let me just get on

672
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:03.210 
with

673
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.040 
going back to what chris said at the beginning of this.

674
00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:11.790 
there is a book that he

675
00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.960 
didn't refer to directly but which we both share

676
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.030 
closely and that is called the hundred year life

677
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:23.700 
from wind gretton and andrew scott and they described life as

678
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.220 
probably from the late eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds forward

679
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.570 
really broken into three distinct stages

680
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:34.100 
the stage where there is education the stage where there is so long

681
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:40.390 
a professor. there's a problem with the audio i was thinking that was my

682
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:46.580 
problem but someone so perhaps the microphone i think it's

683
00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:48.930 
probably related with the bluetooth

684
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.320 
was working. so this is what

685
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.750 
i yeah ok hang on one second let me make sure

686
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.710 
seems to be working.

687
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.630 
can you hear me yeah yes it is quite disturbed

688
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:10.080 
okay let me do a better job.

689
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:14.190 
see if i can bring up the wire pardon me

690
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:19.460 
time delay there how's that is a little better.

691
00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:21.990 
no

692
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:34.190 
i'll just switch how about this is this better yes absolutely thank you

693
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.650 
okay sorry about that.

694
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:42.510 
this is from the hundred year life it breaks up the learning

695
00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:48.800 
lifespan into education work and retirement which is the pattern most of us

696
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:54.420 
have grown up with until the last ten years, or so i would argue

697
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:58.670 
i'm going to

698
00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.800 
say i thought about that life and decided i would put this

699
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:09.460 
together in terms of my life itself and represented in terms of logos and

700
00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:13.030 
i get over to my screen

701
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.390 
and this actually

702
00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.440 
looks kind of like this.

703
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:24.410 
it starts out with my educational space and that is my career as a

704
00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:29.490 
as i don't have high school in there but i have college and postgraduate

705
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.170 
study which was a a chunk of time,

706
00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:38.670 
then my work career which you see progressing through a series of logos.

707
00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.780 
and then ultimately to my retirement career which is supposed to be

708
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.330 
a retirement of enjoyment and relaxation and i have utterly

709
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:49.200 
failed at that.

710
00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:56.150 
that's a pattern that if you count up there are twelve jobs twenty one positions

711
00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:59.320 
and seven different careers in that and i thought that meant

712
00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.160 
that i probably had professional h d

713
00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:08.570 
and then i realized on reflection that in fact i'm a post boomer in fact

714
00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:10.870 
the likelihood is that

715
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.980 
i represent the gen x jonsey or pronto of those

716
00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:20.040 
in this transition phase. and that's transition phase is to this

717
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:21.770 
excuse me to this

718
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:29.630 
can framework of a continuous learning pattern that kristen and

719
00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:33.870 
mark already discussed where learning is

720
00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:40.190 
and for some cyclical and episodic in earn learn cycle. but an entire

721
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.060 
pattern altogether there is learning going on continuously.

722
00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:50.190 
so what's forcing this on us as much as anything else well one is from

723
00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.310 
the hundred year life. it makes very clear we're living longer.

724
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:58.080 
these are your uk estimates of life expectancy of males and

725
00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.420 
you can see that as you start in data sets from the nineteen sixties forward.

726
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:07.100 
the life expectancy keeps increasing in fact it has been doing that since

727
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.170 
the late late eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds at

728
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.800 
the rate of about three months a year.

729
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.120 
we are also healthier during this span and that leads to

730
00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.660 
an interesting conundrum.

731
00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:26.210 
so we are seeing that the median age of life expectancy increased simply because

732
00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:32.360 
infant mortality young and young deaths and morbidity have have diminished

733
00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:36.100 
pushing the the hump of the age bracket up

734
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:41.040 
and in the context of one of the economists measures something called the

735
00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.150 
old age dependency ratio which looks at how many people in

736
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:49.150 
the working space are necessary to contribute to and support pensioners

737
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:54.430 
worldwide. that's at about zero point two five minutes for people working

738
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.690 
for every person on a pension but that is changing and the

739
00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.890 
expectation is that we'll get to about a point five in

740
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:07.560 
most countries in the next twenty five years or so and in japan

741
00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:10.930 
it will be one dot zero in that same time period.

742
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:16.990 
and i hate to say it, but the truth is that published last week in nature communications

743
00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.720 
a study of what's referred to as the invariant raging rate hypothesis

744
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:26.530 
has shown that the actual termination of life has not changed

745
00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:30.440 
in its insignificant ways. and so the idea that we're living

746
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:34.390 
longer is simply because we're living well longer and more

747
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:37.670 
of us are getting to that longer age. but the finite lifestyle

748
00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.450 
lifespan in humans as in other primates is real

749
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.570 
what's causing this business churn well it's caused by a number of things.

750
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:50.370 
we've talked about a lot of these things employee turnover

751
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.330 
as people seek new opportunities.

752
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.810 
we've already heard of the employment re-skilling requirements

753
00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:02.580 
multiple things the world economic forum was quoted already fifty percent

754
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:07.180 
needing new skills by twenty twenty-five and core skills being replaced

755
00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:10.490 
in the next five years for forty percent of the workers.

756
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:14.610 
but also the number of skills necessary for a given job is going up.

757
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.760 
there's demand as chris pointed out for more cognitive skills

758
00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.990 
in collaboration with automation and ai and ml as in has he said

759
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.360 
our intelligence augmentation

760
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:30.100 
and the i a of ai.

761
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.990 
it's also the case that in the business world this transition. and this turnover

762
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:40.130 
is expensive last year in the us a trillion dollars was spent

763
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:44.060 
on workforce development and training in the us itself

764
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:49.170 
of that thirty percent of workers were needing to change jobs, or

765
00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.190 
their skills significantly we mentioned that and then there is a

766
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.360 
large pile in the us in the state of california alone eight

767
00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:00.530 
million adults without credentials who are

768
00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:07.450 
in the work force and finally the overall pipeline of people going into

769
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:11.830 
higher and tertiary education is expanding largely in fact.

770
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:17.190 
it's to be a billion students in the next twenty years it may be somewhat declining

771
00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:21.770 
in the most developed countries. but it will be more than made up for

772
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:25.310 
from other countries in the world so the pipeline for education is

773
00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:26.620 
expanding dramatically

774
00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:33.210 
on top of all of this in the and pandemic really really accentuated. this

775
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:36.560 
is a staggering growth in financial inequity

776
00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:40.740 
which is causing lots of concern and problems

777
00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:45.750 
pay ratios between executives and median employee wages are

778
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:50.260 
ridiculous worse than the robber baron days of the nineteen twenties and thirties.

779
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.270 
so you see a graph on the right side which shows

780
00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:58.080 
in logarithmic scale. and you have in this middle section here where the us

781
00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:00.880 
companies conglomerate

782
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.990 
glom together.
that's about a two hundred and fifty to one ratio

783
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:09.030 
of what of what executives earn relative to

784
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.100 
what the and median age of

785
00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.300 
mean wages for workers which is just ridiculous. but it's not

786
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.700 
just a us issue across the world this is many measures

787
00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.460 
measures from india united kingdom south africa etcetera

788
00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:30.760 
and half of the graph is above one hundred and seventy times

789
00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:35.170 
and even in the lowest end down at the bottom china and germany.

790
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:38.360 
it's still one hundred and twenty seven to one hundred and thirty six times.

791
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:41.470 
it is unconscionably obscene,

792
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:46.950 
and that leads to is accentuated by another problem which i

793
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:50.670 
refer to as the signal-to-noise ratio between

794
00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:56.760 
what we use as a degree and what we up and present to employers

795
00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:01.130 
versus what it tells them to be able to discern and match us to a job

796
00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:06.720 
and that means basically that the value of the degree in terms of its

797
00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:12.540 
actual utility is diminished we still in many cases require

798
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:15.500 
it for certain positions. but even that's being questioned tim

799
00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:20.120 
cook couple years ago said that a half of all of the us employees

800
00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.660 
at apple do not have four year degrees. and he doesn't think.

801
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:26.750 
they need them and you've heard from many places google ibm

802
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:30.820 
bank of america and on and on have simply stopped requiring

803
00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:33.220 
them and instead test people on their own.

804
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:36.990 
this is not surprising.

805
00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:43.220 
this is leading to this turn in the learning earnings cycle,

806
00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:47.820 
and a demand for as mark was describing in the context of micro credentials

807
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:51.680 
the other part of this is a demand for short programs that deliver them

808
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:56.770 
instead of people being disrupted by jobs by the pandemic going

809
00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:59.010 
right back to work. they're rethinking whether they want to

810
00:59:59.010 --> 01:00:02.120 
be in work where they were before. but they can't afford the

811
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.270 
time or the expense to complete a typical traditional terminal degree

812
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.290 
as a result they are finding themselves

813
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.790 
looking at options that include these kinds of short term programs.

814
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.370 
and the center for community college research at columbia has

815
01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:27.710 
found that they indeed provide some degree of economic value.

816
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.720 
but they also note and this is critical that the short term credentials

817
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.130 
from programs like this are themselves of short term value

818
01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:40.040 
that is to say they're useful for three four five years perhaps.

819
01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.450 
but they need to be continually updated.

820
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:50.150 
well all of this has led to a massive loss of trust and the pandemic

821
01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.930 
accentuated this as well

822
01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.780 
we live in a post-truth world and in many cases where government

823
01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:01.230 
science and core institutions of the modern world are no longer

824
01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:06.360 
highly regarded. they're viewed skeptically with suspicion in some cases distain

825
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:11.690 
and yet business and people to thrive need predictability and confidence

826
01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:14.940 
now the global fabric of this new world

827
01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.930 
is the network itself the internet

828
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.490 
back in two thousand and five kim cameron then the chief identity

829
01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:25.560 
officer for microsoft now at convergence

830
01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:32.280 
made wrote something called the laws of identity in which he stated the internet

831
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:36.570 
was built without an identity layer in fact

832
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:41.950 
he noted that if we do nothing we will face rapidly proliferating

833
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:46.060 
episodes of theft and deception that will ultimately and cumulatively

834
01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:50.790 
erode public trust in the internet and as at this point in time in

835
01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.970 
our advantage today we would simply marvel at his pressions

836
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.170 
for saying that back in two thousand and five.

837
01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.990 
now the reason for this is that machines for which the internet was designed

838
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:07.850 
were were were designed not to connect people. but to

839
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.430 
connect these devices and assign them unique addresses

840
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:16.240 
which then allowed them to share resources and information across multiple networks

841
01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:20.410 
and then they did this with the packet switch exchange of tcp ip

842
01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.340 
and related protocols

843
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:26.410 
the murmured machine addresses themselves say nothing about

844
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:31.180 
the person the organization or the entity responsible or

845
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.560 
who is at the end of the machine.

846
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.130 
so we need to think about the notion of how we convey what

847
01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.290 
a person has been able to learn and earn.

848
01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:47.470 
and i say it in both context of work and an education

849
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:51.300 
micro credentials being one of the new ways of thinking about

850
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.140 
that and re-balance the agency around privacy with respect

851
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.080 
to the challenges that the internet and that age presents us

852
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.870 
to restore that agency the learner has to have equal footing in this process

853
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:07.690 
learners have never been given the opportunity of that because

854
01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:09.940 
credentials if in their possession

855
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:14.790 
cannot be proven to have not been altered that has been why

856
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:18.530 
the learner has been the untrusted party in this relationship

857
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.410 
and yet a sixty year working life where repeated efforts of

858
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:25.400 
learning both formal and informal through business and work

859
01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.270 
activities as well as training bodies requires

860
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:33.790 
the individual to have the ability to manage and control the

861
01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:37.860 
statements about their abilities. and that hasn't been possible until now.

862
01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:43.710 
the global network trust model t o have with something called

863
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:52.100 
the trust over ip a framework is essential. it starts with this trust triangle.

864
01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:54.320 
it's kind of a trust triangle in the sense that

865
01:03:55.670 --> 01:04:00.280 
the individual a holder hears in the middle

866
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.430 
and then one leg of it is the issue on the left side and the

867
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:04.910 
verifier on the right side.

868
01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.300 
now how does this work,

869
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.520 
essentially it starts with the issuer an institution who makes

870
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.560 
an assertion about a person's abilities through the form of

871
01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.710 
a degree or certificate or micro credential and then

872
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.090 
makes it available to the holder who then requests it from

873
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:28.920 
them to send it to them, when they do that they digitally sign it

874
01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:36.650 
cryptographically and hand it to the holder. and using the public key encryption infrastructure

875
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:41.920 
sop with the key for that in that public space, so that it is

876
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.140 
now possible to verify it without going back to the issuer.

877
01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:50.250 
the holder stores these things in a wallet in this case a digital

878
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:52.640 
wallet which can be a mobile device of some sort.

879
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:58.430 
and through that wallet they're able to curate select and manage the

880
01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.920 
credentials that they have they cannot change them, because

881
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.860 
they've been digitally signed and therefore sealed. but they

882
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.090 
can select them and arrange them into stacks

883
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.340 
they can then notify a what's referred to as a verifier in

884
01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:16.160 
this case think of them as an employer that they have credentials to send

885
01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.210 
the employer request that they be sent

886
01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:23.300 
the holder packages them up and sends them signed by them

887
01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.670 
to know that these credentials about you from this institution,

888
01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:31.670 
or set of institutions are actually you the person that's giving

889
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.280 
the information to the employer. and the employer then verifies

890
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.880 
both of those things that the institution signed the original

891
01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.260 
credential that says you know

892
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:45.950 
information about x y and z. and that you chris didi or mark

893
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:51.180 
brown are the person sending that stack to the in fact to the employer themselves.

894
01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.560 
both of those can be digitally proved.

895
01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.290 
these things need a decentralised identity

896
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:02.970 
which is a permanent persistent identifier that is resolvable

897
01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:05.160 
that is can be read in the metadata and

898
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:10.330 
humanly consumed that it is cryptographically

899
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:13.620 
verifiable that you can prove ownership.

900
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:17.150 
and is decentralised that is does not require

901
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:19.160 
a registration authority.

902
01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:25.490 
why is that so important. just think about it up until now everything

903
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:30.620 
that we've had to identify ourselves on the net has been owned by someone else.

904
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:34.740 
urls are leased to you by a dns provider that gets it from

905
01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:38.080 
the top-level domain service who in turn leases it from the

906
01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:39.750 
standards body i can.

907
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:44.990 
phone numbers are loaned to you government issued idees are

908
01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.970 
often misused and so those things are questionable in terms of their

909
01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.660 
controllability and the management of this is hard there are

910
01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:57.610 
third parties out there and organizations to help you outsource the

911
01:06:57.810 --> 01:07:01.320 
management of that so individuals cannt do it themselves.

912
01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:07.080 
just as this credentials need to be digitally representable

913
01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.270 
sat consumed and managed by the learner the jobs themselves

914
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:16.090 
need to be described with similar machine consumable digital representations.

915
01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.760 
and the US chamber of commerce foundation through the t three

916
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.550 
innovation network for whom i'm a consultant and hr open standards

917
01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:28.180 
organization has been building job descriptions called jdx standards.

918
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.950 
for the purposes of posting jobs in a machine-readable way

919
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:37.220 
that way the machine ai can both consume that information as well as the

920
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.070 
similarly machine-readable information about a

921
01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:45.330 
person's credentials and do a better job at making that kind of match.

922
01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.580 
today these are described these two types more and more

923
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:52.510 
are being described with skills.

924
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:57.260 
the higher level more abstract sort of competencies that often

925
01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.970 
go associated with universities

926
01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:03.490 
employers find very difficult to translate and they've been pushing hard

927
01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.910 
to see actual skill descriptions of what a person can do and

928
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.660 
so the community has responded the open skills network has formed

929
01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:17.700 
and has been defining machine-readable rich skill descriptors that are

930
01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.740 
essentially

931
01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:24.810 
semantic ontologies that add a contextualization to a statement about a skill

932
01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:28.810 
or competency in a machine-readable form with a permanent uri.

933
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.530 
these are being built.

934
01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:35.740 
now by pilot projects across the country and even though the

935
01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:41.480 
o sn is less than a year old there are over six hundred businesses organization government entities

936
01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:45.680 
and universities and others that are involved deeply in the building out

937
01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:51.920 
of this rsd, a set of repositories which are federated in the

938
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.850 
environment and one of the projects that the t three

939
01:08:56.250 --> 01:09:00.280 
innovation network has built as a prototype is a mehta search

940
01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.700 
engine that can sit on top and search across the set of these

941
01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:04.960 
repositories for someone.

942
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:11.090 
everyone in this place in this environment is going to be a lifelong learner.

943
01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.480 
there are rich opportunities to take short term programs to

944
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:20.500 
accrue skills and competencies through work documented by similar digital credentials

945
01:09:20.610 --> 01:09:24.810 
and combine these together as a foundation to pursue a higher degree

946
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.850 
which is only possible with the advent of computational trust.

947
01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:34.910 
people will engage with dozens of learning experiences over a

948
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:39.240 
over a sixty year plus working cycle.

949
01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.540 
these achievements and skills and competencies from many sources

950
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:48.410 
may include things like your community work or your avocation all interests

951
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.810 
that can be certified.

952
01:09:50.730 --> 01:09:54.730 
but all of these need to be available to you to curate and

953
01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:58.240 
manage yourself because the only party that is consistent over

954
01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.650 
the sixty year life of work is the individual the person.

955
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:07.150 
she has to be able to manage her credentials to select and

956
01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:11.170 
present herself to tell her own narrative about she wants in a way

957
01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.850 
that is both verifiable and allows her to select what aspects of the credentials

958
01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:20.160 
she wants to include and expose so that she is not simply showing

959
01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:24.390 
everything but showing the story that she thinks is best representing

960
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:27.450 
herself and allow the person who receives it if they think

961
01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:29.260 
they want to know more to ask.

962
01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:31.340 
so that's the

963
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.480 
future approach that i'm suggesting we need to be using as

964
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.300 
a foundation for the different types of ways to recognize

965
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:44.640 
learning that we crew in the future and i just want to make

966
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.870 
one last note because i know this is orthogonal, but if we all

967
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:50.690 
are not involved in helping

968
01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:57.660 
proactively to address the coming climate crisis and the sixth

969
01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:01.440 
extinction event that it is already starting then most of what

970
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.040 
we're talking about today would be mooc.

971
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:08.010 
but if we can do that and do that with these kinds of methods

972
01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:11.070 
for allowing digital credentials to stay with the person, then

973
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:15.140 
movements of people dislocations as we've seen from climate

974
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.000 
events that will happen nonetheless,

975
01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.570 
can be of mitigated to a large extent and the history and the

976
01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:24.530 
licenses and all the things people have acquired can still

977
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:25.910 
be preserved and come with them.

978
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:28.500 
thank you, thank you professor long.

979
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:37.280 
well. so many informations answer well. thank you are really to

980
01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.570 
have focused all are right least.

981
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:48.160 
i pointed out well the elements i just used a words related

982
01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.180 
to the awareness and this is well your conclusion the

983
01:11:54.100 --> 01:12:02.740 
best way to explain really what does it mean so that the appropriation

984
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:08.170 
of all this process by everyone. but at the same time not

985
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:13.220 
only not only people but in institutions involved in these

986
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:20.640 
well in this wool will process. so thank you thank you very much. i

987
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:25.780 
as we have a really a short time to the question and dancers

988
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:31.460 
i would like to to say to the participants

989
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:36.010 
to write their question.

990
01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.030 
then please

991
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:44.470 
the result from the organization if i don't see something please

992
01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:51.590 
poke me and well you can also if you want just

993
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:57.010 
raise your ants and we will i'll have to just pose your question.

994
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.200 
well

995
01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:10.820 
so just to open open open the floor. i was yes

996
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:15.690 
ok well it was not sir

997
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:18.640 
arise then

998
01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:25.590 
well perhaps i would like just to start not opening the floor, but ask

999
01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.650 
to the other two speakers mark mark brown and professor d a reaction

1000
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:39.260 
to these conclusion of the presentation or professor long, if you want.

1001
01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:46.690 
to jump in on on one small matter at risk of over theorizing.

1002
01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.870 
i've always taken the view and this is the academic in me that words matter

1003
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:56.700 
and we've had quite a big debate here in europe or at least

1004
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.450 
the circles that i'm in around micro credentialing

1005
01:13:59.890 --> 01:14:04.620 
and the right metaphors. so the term wallet that's used as a

1006
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:09.190 
kind of id term we argue is the wrong metaphor.

1007
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:14.500 
we've adopted passport passport has other problems in europe, because

1008
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.580 
part of the big picture is about demographic changes and mobility

1009
01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:23.290 
of people. we're not putting borders on people. but the term

1010
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:28.520 
wallet has two problems firstly it lacks from not being inclusive

1011
01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.470 
language because the opposite for women would be piss.

1012
01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.880 
and secondly it conjures up if you like my battle that i tried to

1013
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:41.440 
paint between the forces of control and chaos

1014
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:46.610 
where a wallet is something that someone puts the knowledge that they have

1015
01:14:46.730 --> 01:14:52.190 
into a container that has a personal gain to the personal benefits

1016
01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:55.760 
here in europe in particular. i guess it's the big distinction

1017
01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.610 
between north america and europe with the exception of the united kingdom

1018
01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:04.240 
where the public good of education is also a very important

1019
01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:09.010 
dimension of the state's contribution and so a wallet for me

1020
01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:14.130 
conjures up the idea that education for one's own personal benefit like money

1021
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:19.850 
building up this currency whereas it doesn't address the role

1022
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:24.580 
and benefits that education and investment in all forms of lifelong learning

1023
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:28.650 
for the state in terms of health and and dare i say it

1024
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:34.020 
speculatively perhaps even the climate when we have a better educated society

1025
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:39.370 
so it's a small point i did qualify and say it's the risk of over theorizing.

1026
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:44.730 
but there are powerful market driven forces associated with the unbundling movement

1027
01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:48.480 
and we do need to understand those who are as you heard from me i like

1028
01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.510 
to get around the table to influence those conversations.

1029
01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:59.810 
and i would like to thank phil for his remarks in fact both marc and phil.

1030
01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:04.070 
i've been great to listen to this you've given me a lot to think about.

1031
01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:09.920 
i think that one of the big shifts that's taking place is unbundling

1032
01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:15.350 
i think another big shift that's taking place is the grain size of credentials

1033
01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:21.520 
and when they are awarded and i think a third big shift is moving from

1034
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:28.840 
credentials that are based on psychometrics if you will are on seat time

1035
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.950 
even worse to credentials that are based on performance.

1036
01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:38.450 
and i think there are exciting opportunities at the confluence

1037
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:42.940 
of those three things that we have new technologies like what's

1038
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.790 
known as digital puppeteering

1039
01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:51.140 
in which companies like version are able to have people practice

1040
01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:55.250 
skills in the same way that pilots practice flying an airplane

1041
01:16:55.450 --> 01:17:01.930 
that can be a performance assessment that can be standardized in interesting ways.

1042
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:06.910 
but on bundling that makes a lot of sense

1043
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:11.640 
having the grain size be relatively small so that students develop

1044
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:18.190 
portfolios as they go along whatever their call is makes sense.

1045
01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.530 
and so it's a very exciting time, but it's a time

1046
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:25.340 
that there are powerful forces that oppose this.

1047
01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:32.050 
you know the the mythology of harvard just to pick a random example

1048
01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:38.830 
is such that you know people say if i just want to have a harvard degree

1049
01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:44.190 
as if the brand were some kind of fairy dust that then makes you

1050
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:50.820 
successful in life alas. there is no fairy dust not even from harvard

1051
01:17:51.010 --> 01:17:56.260 
and so i helping places that should be leading this.

1052
01:17:56.770 --> 01:18:01.960 
but who may find it contrary to their own best interests narrowly defined

1053
01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:07.580 
to unbundle to change the grain size and to move to performance-based assessments.

1054
01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.310 
that's going to be a significant battle over the years.

1055
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:13.990 
it is and it's one of the reasons why

1056
01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:19.030 
a lot of this started because of the frustration over the opacity of the transcript

1057
01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.820 
in terms of what it conveyed.
and so the data models that people

1058
01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:26.210 
started working with how do we add richness to say things like

1059
01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:30.580 
give me an evidence array that showed what the person did in

1060
01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.480 
order to merit this performance score.

1061
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:36.950 
or what are the assessment methods that were used by which

1062
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:39.260 
that particular performance score was derived

1063
01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:42.930 
etcetera. and i think that's where it started i do think you're

1064
01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:45.940 
right. there is a mark mentioned the notion of the institutions

1065
01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:47.570 
sort of preserving their core.

1066
01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:54.040 
i came from u t austin most recently and they are award certificates

1067
01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.300 
in their business school for certain six course sequences.

1068
01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:01.280 
but they will not give them to you they will not award them if

1069
01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.750 
you don't complete the d

1070
01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:10.470 
and so if you don't do their aspect of finish then the certificate is disappears.

1071
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.970 
it is gone and that is just holding hostage in my view

1072
01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:19.460 
the individual as opposed to helping them.

1073
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:23.920 
so the knot of all of this is increasing the perasa

1074
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:27.410 
between the institution and the work and learning

1075
01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:32.780 
environment, so that moving back and forth is smoother it's less

1076
01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:39.060 
disruptive and engaging i mean in the end game harvard and texas and

1077
01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:42.130 
and university college in dublin i said cause

1078
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:44.600 
they want those students for life.

1079
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:50.210 
but we still categorize them you are an undergraduate you are

1080
01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:53.510 
a graduate you're an alum you're a graduate student each of

1081
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:56.870 
these things is so discrete that the boundaries between them

1082
01:19:57.150 --> 01:19:59.090 
impede as opposed to enable.

1083
01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:05.060 
thank you. oh well i just

1084
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:10.510 
had a curiosity about european

1085
01:20:11.230 --> 01:20:16.760 
starting from well what professor long was saying about well also the

1086
01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:24.370 
scene's approach from the companies that

1087
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:28.650 
does not ask for a four for the full degree

1088
01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:31.030 
and also thinking in

1089
01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:36.630 
trends in big international platforms that are going to

1090
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.500 
change or at least this seems to be the coursera model change

1091
01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:47.050 
the model or cooperation between companies and universities.

1092
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:53.440 
so in this new model lifelong learning so the

1093
01:20:53.940 --> 01:21:00.740 
well short learning paths and so on becomes a driver for the degrees.

1094
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:04.270 
so it is not to go beyond the degrees,

1095
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:10.180 
but it seems to be well to differentiate and perhaps create

1096
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:14.880 
different business models for universities and old school learning

1097
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.910 
and teaching and teaching models saw and not only rely to the

1098
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:25.550 
to say the co-production and co

1099
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.240 
operation model that is

1100
01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:35.120 
well dominant in the microcode and so idea,

1101
01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:41.340 
so what's your opinion related to

1102
01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:49.840 
what is the the trend related to the consolidation of this connection between

1103
01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:54.560 
academia and employability and so the relationship with academia

1104
01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:00.720 
and the pole in the n companies in developing the dis well the programs the

1105
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:03.930 
traditional one or the new ones.

1106
01:22:07.450 --> 01:22:09.960 
well i'll start and say simply that

1107
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:15.830 
the professional schools in our institutions have a much stronger

1108
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.240 
track record in this regard

1109
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:21.480 
and that includes business engineering

1110
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:26.270 
many of the health professions etcetera in part because they

1111
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:29.050 
are living in the graduates of those programs are living in

1112
01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:30.040 
a world of licensure

1113
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:34.910 
and licensure has very specific requirements that need to be

1114
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:37.340 
met in order for the career to be performed.

1115
01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:42.440 
and so there is a collaborative interest to work together in

1116
01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.990 
designing the both the experiences and their methods of method of assessment etcetera.

1117
01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:52.990 
for that to enable the students to succeed and in turn, therefore

1118
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:57.550 
become lems and contributors in the end back to the schools.

1119
01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:02.650 
but it has been much more difficult in the liberal arts and

1120
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:05.670 
in some of the sciences where the

1121
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:10.370 
with the exception of the top and research schools.

1122
01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:18.480 
the thought about what it is that the employability requirements are for graduate

1123
01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:22.980 
with a ba and or bs in biology for example

1124
01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:29.650 
are just not really well articulated at uti austin in the psych department.

1125
01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:34.330 
they were shocked to learn that more than sixty percent of their graduates

1126
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:38.040 
went into the legal profession they had no idea.

1127
01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.240 
they were psychologists they thought that that's what they

1128
01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.860 
were producing as people they're going to do things in psychology

1129
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:45.640 
and they just never looked.

1130
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:50.290 
and i think that's part of the myopia that we have to overcome

1131
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:58.170 
i think there's some interesting disconnects between three category systems.

1132
01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:02.440 
there's the way the universities categorize students which

1133
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:06.130 
is in disciplines and fields you're going to be an engineer

1134
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:09.790 
you're going to be a physicist etcetera and phil has described

1135
01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:12.160 
many dysfunctionality of that.

1136
01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:17.730 
there's the way that businesses categorize jobs often stemming

1137
01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:23.320 
out of the hr department more than than the ceo's office where

1138
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.620 
you know you're going to be a technical support specialist

1139
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:30.970 
or you're going to be a marketing person or whatever.

1140
01:24:31.410 --> 01:24:35.470 
and then there's the way that that students and people are

1141
01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:40.190 
as they think lifelong in the way that all three of us have described

1142
01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:45.760 
categorized their life paths which tend to be oriented around passions.

1143
01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:51.100 
i want to help with public works and the global south so that people

1144
01:24:51.330 --> 01:24:57.090 
have a better life i wanted to reduce the disparities in pay

1145
01:24:57.410 --> 01:25:01.500 
that fell described so dramatically and

1146
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:07.970 
that the challenge is really for universities and businesses

1147
01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:13.560 
to start thinking about people's passions and people's life trajectories

1148
01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:18.320 
and then say ok if you come to work for us here's the progression

1149
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.410 
of roles that you can play that that will help you achieve

1150
01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:26.500 
your passion or if you come to study with us here is

1151
01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:32.360 
the series of learning experiences that we can provide across fields and departments

1152
01:25:32.610 --> 01:25:36.030 
that will prepare you for this passion.

1153
01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:41.140 
so there's an awful lot of sort of unlearning that has to go on in business and

1154
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:47.020 
and universities in order to really map onto the kind of a

1155
01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:50.400 
vision of lifelong learning that the figure bus have been describing

1156
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:58.540 
something that i resonated with me in part because i'm doing

1157
01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:02.250 
this literature review at the moment the report that i posted

1158
01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:03.650 
linked to from

1159
01:26:05.710 --> 01:26:10.050 
the oecd skills outlook report is a particular table. sorry

1160
01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:13.840 
figure in that report figure four point six it talks about

1161
01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.040 
where the disengagement is for opportunities for life-long cpd

1162
01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:25.330 
not true draw the two is one and the same. but i referred to

1163
01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:30.770 
opportunities for lifelong learning i think it might be more accurately cpd

1164
01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:35.280 
what that particular table looks at are a size of employers.

1165
01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:41.020 
and so based on what is a pretty macro-level set of data what

1166
01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:45.070 
it suggests is that there isn't a problem in investing in lifelong

1167
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:51.320 
learning and cpd for employees in large industries or larger employers

1168
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:56.180 
where the big problem is is micro and small employers. those

1169
01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:58.760 
are the ones who are not providing opportunities for people

1170
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.210 
to re-skill and upskill.

1171
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:04.100 
so it's just an interesting. i guess aspect that we have to

1172
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.220 
drill down a little deeper into where the real problems are

1173
01:27:07.450 --> 01:27:12.330 
and if i look at learners aside from the employer side similarly

1174
01:27:12.330 --> 01:27:17.780 
the report presents data about what could be seen as generalised distinctions

1175
01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:22.240 
asked about the barriers to pursuing opportunities and one

1176
01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.830 
of the biggest areas even though the expression is they are

1177
01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.550 
interested in pursuing the barrier is family commitments

1178
01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:34.830 
now i could again be over reading the data. but i can draw on

1179
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:37.620 
some personal experience in the sense of even my own

1180
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:42.920 
relationship of who got to do things first and who was left to

1181
01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.720 
be the main child and

1182
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:50.880 
raiser of the family so there is lots i think we have to dig deeper into this,

1183
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:55.420 
and then ultimately maybe there is going to be weight for everyone.

1184
01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:58.730 
and this is really an issue around redistribution of wealth

1185
01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.010 
and our conception of what we mean by wic in the first place.

1186
01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.060 
thank you so much. oh well we have,

1187
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:15.370 
i know it was just a message but we have only two minutes last

1188
01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:17.980 
send i will take the occasion just to well.

1189
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.000 
this will be just a tweet. but

1190
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:29.330 
well we saw in recent years starting from few years ago the

1191
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:35.740 
trump program pledged to america to reskill the american workers. but now

1192
01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:42.760 
in uk for example the white paper and so many initiatives to direct intervene

1193
01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:49.370 
in these so well programs towards the skills gap and so

1194
01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:53.240 
i want just to ask you

1195
01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.210 
what kind of what do you think is the

1196
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.480 
proper and the best way for government and

1197
01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:07.440 
in which the government should intervene in a in a direct way in this sense

1198
01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.850 
one interesting concept

1199
01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.640 
is moving away from unemployment

1200
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.660 
benefits and insurance which assume that you can go out and

1201
01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:25.830 
get the same job somewhere which is increasingly not the case to

1202
01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:34.730 
employability insurance where you basically have a fund that

1203
01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:41.330 
you control that can be used to upskill as you perceive necessary

1204
01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:45.390 
for your life path that's a much better way for governments

1205
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:48.370 
to think about investment in this area in my opinion.

1206
01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:53.410 
we should talk chris because there is a project on the moocs

1207
01:29:53.670 --> 01:29:58.430 
to look at rethinking unemployment insurance with a

1208
01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:04.560 
if an individual can present a digital work record of their private prior work,

1209
01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:08.270 
and income then they don't have to wait

1210
01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:12.790 
the weeks sometimes months it takes to process the

1211
01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:17.270 
the funding that is derived from that to help support them during that time.

1212
01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:23.590 
and we can turn around as a consequence the use of that not just to be

1213
01:30:23.770 --> 01:30:27.460 
to tide them over while they look for a replacement job, but

1214
01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.710 
to get them to look at a new job.

1215
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:37.460 
that's a something that will be kicking off in later part of july.

1216
01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.390 
thank you and i think it underscores quite

1217
01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:46.280 
interesting cultural variations here living in ireland where

1218
01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:50.260 
one of the ultimate is to get a public job a job with government

1219
01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:52.720 
because that's perceived to be a job for life

1220
01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.820 
is something i still struggle with so there are

1221
01:30:57.390 --> 01:31:02.070 
across the atlantic yes and and and right and we often are

1222
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:03.370 
solving different problems

1223
01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:11.510 
well thank you so much we are obliged to close i would stay

1224
01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:17.670 
here all day all the evening but thank you it has been a great occasion and

1225
01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:23.170 
really thank you for your contributions and for all the participants

1226
01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:25.160 
to be there with us.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:15.730 
Hello and Welcome to the Second Module of our Online
Learning course 'Beyond Brockhaus Thinking'.

2
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.510 
As you learnt in the first
module, Space is one of the

3
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.800 
three core things to really look
at and this is what we figured

4
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.430 
out 12 years ago when we started
the School of Design Thinking,

5
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.050 
here in Potsdam. We didn't
find the right furniture

6
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.690 
to help students to collaborate
as teams. And this is why

7
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.150 
we created these kinds of tables, the
environment here, the whiteboards

8
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.770 
together with the
manufacturer in Berlin.

9
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.080 
And it helped us quite a bit, it was a
very interesting learning experience.

10
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.390 
This is what we wanted to lead
you through for the next

11
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.670 
days. We want to start with 'Why
space matters?' in order to enable

12
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.850 
you to understand your space
better. And then to take you

13
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.950 
into being able to design your
own space, specifically

14
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.790 
when it comes to Design Thinking
spaces for collaborative teamwork.

15
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530 
In order to get there, we also
wanted to share with you small

16
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.230 
interventions, small hacks, you can
start with to change your space.

17
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
And also address the question 'How
to integrate the analog space

18
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.620 
with the virtual one?' And for
those of you who think now "Oh,

19
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.460 
we skipped that week because space
is not so important for adults,

20
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.280 
I don't need that." I can tell you
please stay with us, because

21
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.370 
a lot of people completely
underestimate how important

22
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.470 
space is for defining habits of people.
We want to share our experiences

23
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.740 
and we, of course, want to learn from
you as well what your experiences

24
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.660 
are. Please stay with us for
the whole week. Thank you.

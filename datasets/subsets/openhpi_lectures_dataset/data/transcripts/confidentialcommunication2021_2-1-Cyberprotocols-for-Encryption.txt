1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.560 
We start the second week of our
openHPI course - Confidential

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.240 
Communication in the Internet, with a closer
look at Cryptoprotocols for Encryption.

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.570 
You remember, encryption has the
goal to secure the message

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.680 
which is sent over an open channel.
And the cryptoprotocol describes

5
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.810 
the way how this is done. So the
cryptoprotocols for encryption are used

6
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.250 
to transmit confidential messages over an insecure
communication channel like the open internet.

7
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.410 
This is a basic protocol, Alice and Bob are
our two partners of the communication,

8
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.600 
they arrange first, a cryptosystem
and second, they agree on the keys

9
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790 
with which they want to
use the cryptosystem.

10
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.250 
And then Alice takes the message
she wants to send to Bob and

11
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.160 
encrypt this message with an
encryption function and they

12
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.640 
agreed cryptosystem
and agreed key.

13
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:12.500 
And then Alice sends the ciphertext over the insecure communication
channel to Bob and Bob is able to decrypt the ciphertext

14
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.540 
with the decryption function from the
agreed cryptosystem and the agreed

15
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.990 
key. Here is an illustration, we
have our sender, we have Alice

16
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.830 
we have the receiver, Bob. And Alice wants
to send the message for the course

17
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.330 
Confidential Communication, it
is particularly important.

18
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.130 
She wants to send this message to Bob
over the internet, the internet

19
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.990 
is an open network, everyone who has
access to the internet also can see

20
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.190 
what's transported over the
internet and if there are no

21
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.990 
security measures taken, others
can also read the message.

22
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.110 
And of course, Alice does not want
this, so when she sends her message

23
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.400 
in an unencrypted way over
the internet to Bob,

24
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.590 
then the problem is that here
any attacker or anyone who has

25
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.510 
access to the internet can manipulate,
the unencrypted message, can read

26
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.320 
the message, can understand
them, and even manipulate it.

27
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.760 
So, to secure this and to
prevents this, Alice is

28
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.270 
encrypting the message. Encrypted
message looks like that

29
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.210 
and the attacker has no
more chance to see what

30
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.440 
the content of the message
Alice is sending to the

31
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.820 
receiver. So, the attacker can see the
ciphertext but he cannot understand and cannot

32
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.510 
get the details and then
the receiver is able

33
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.810 
to decrypt the message and then to see
also the content of this message.

34
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.390 
We introduced different
encryption methods,

35
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.490 
and you remember,
there was a family

36
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.260 
of symmetric encryption methods and
the family of asymmetric encryption

37
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.430 
methods. So, let's first look at the
cryptoprotocols for symmetric encryption.

38
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.480 
So, here, Alice and Bob arrange
a symmetric cryptosystem and

39
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.520 
they agree on a common key because this
was a characteristic of a symmetric

40
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.300 
cryptosystems that

41
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.370 
the encryption, as well as decryption,
are done with the same key.

42
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:54.157 
And then Alice encrypts her message with the agreed symmetric encryption
functions and the common key. And then the ciphertext is sent over the insecure

43
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.600 
communication channel, is sent
over the internet and Bob is

44
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.660 
able to decrypt the ciphertext with the
agreed decryption function and the

45
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.380 
common key. What is the advantage
of symmetric cryptoprotocols?

46
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.590 
The advantage is that the
symmetric encryption

47
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.720 
and decryption algorithms can be
calculated very efficiently.

48
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.460 
You remember, it was a very simple
function, it was an interchanging

49
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.750 
of bits, it was an XOR
operation or something very

50
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.370 
tiny operations which could very
well be implemented in hardware.

51
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.270 
It is also a clear situation
for the cryptanalysis

52
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:50.290 
which this symmetric encryption provides,
but there is a really serious problem

53
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.240 
with a symmetric
encryption protocols.

54
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.620 
And this is the arrangement or the
exchange of the common secret key.

55
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.430 
Before Alice and Bob have
agreed on a security method

56
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.740 
for exchanging messages,
they have to exchange this

57
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.820 
common secret key. So, this is really
a big problem and that was a reason

58
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.360 
to develop another family, another
approach to the encryption

59
00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:27.430 
task.

60
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.250 
And the outcome was the family of the
asymmetric encryption protocols.

61
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.390 
And the asymmetric
methods

62
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.300 
have a big difference that they do not have
one key for encryption or decryption,

63
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.380 
they work with
two keys.

64
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.390 
So, if we look at an asymmetric
encryption protocol, then

65
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.700 
Alice and Bob
arrange an

66
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.510 
asymmetric cryptosystem and Alice
takes the public key of Bob.

67
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.100 
This was a key that is published
in the internet and everyone

68
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:11.100 
can access this key. Alice takes the
public key of Bob and then she encrypts

69
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:18.100 
the message with an asymmetric
cryptosystem and the public key of Bob.

70
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.510 
And then Alice sends the ciphertext
again over the insecure

71
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.570 
communication channel over the
internet and Bob is able to

72
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:32.200 
decrypt the ciphertext with the
agreed decryption function and his

73
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.480 
private key.

74
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.640 
Of course, there is a big advantage
of asymmetric encryption protocols

75
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.640 
as there is no need for
exchange of the secret key.

76
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.500 
This was a big problem with
symmetric encryption protocols,

77
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.880 
incase of asymmetric encryption
protocols, we work with

78
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.310 
two keys and the one key, the public key
is freely distributed in the internet,

79
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:09.220 
so, everyone can send Bob an encrypted
mail without having the need to exchange

80
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.970 
the secret key before. But we have other
problems with asymmetric encryption protocols,

81
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.670 
and that is the algorithms - the
encryption and decryption algorithms

82
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.770 
in the asymmetric ones that
they are very expensive, they

83
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.590 
need a lot of computational
resources to be computed,

84
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.110 
and the other is that
it needs precautions

85
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.620 
to ensure that the key is
a public key from Bob

86
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.890 
which Alice is using to encrypt a mail
or message she wants to send to Bob

87
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.630 
is really the correct
public key of Bob.

88
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.500 
About this problem, we have to
discuss it in detail, but here

89
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.500 
the expensiveness of asymmetric
encryption and decryption methods is

90
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.620 
that is not simple bit operations.
Here, in the case of asymmetric

91
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:17.420 
encryption protocols we have
very complicated mathematical

92
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.720 
computations
to perform.

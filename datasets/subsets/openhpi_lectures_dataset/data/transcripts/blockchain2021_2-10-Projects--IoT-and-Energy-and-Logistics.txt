1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.603 
Now we want to continue to consider application areas for

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.899 
blockchain, application in our openHPI course: Blockchain - Revealing

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.384 
the Myth, and here we will concentrate on the Internet of Things (IoT),

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.679 
on energy and logistics.

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.221 
What is common in these different applications?

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.360 
The common thing is tracking possession of value,

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.254 
that is what's possible with blockchain technology

8
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.828 
and in fact, this is one of the most widespread use cases of the blockchain

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.389 
technology, together with automated contracts

10
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.640 
and identity systems.

11
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.100 
Perhaps, let's start with an example of tracking

12
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.310 
ownership history, for example, of paintings at an auction.

13
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.490 
The question arises here, so it is clear all the documents about

14
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.459 
changing, selling and reviews

15
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.769 
and other documents that are helpful to prove the originality

16
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.469 
of a physical art object, all these are

17
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.904 
documents and can be stored on a blockchain,

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.659 
but the physical object itself is independent from the

19
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.610 
blockchain, and so the question is how one can combine the

20
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.000 
physical object and with this digital history.

21
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.189 
Indeed making such a connection tamperproof, it's a

22
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.999 
big issue. There are various possibilities.

23
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.788 
For example, QR codes can be printed on the physical

24
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.788 
object, RFID chips or miniaturised computers

25
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.948 
can be used typically Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

26
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.300 
But all of this does not meet the demands for high-level security,

27
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.326 
especially for invaluable

28
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.189 
artwork but at this point, we will not continue

29
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.409 
here in our course, we look at how we can

30
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.539 
find a good way of tracking by means of blockchain.

31
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.029 
So, we focus on solutions that are used in the digital tracking

32
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.410 
of physical objects by means of Internet of Things (IoT) technology,

33
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.909 
which is able to provide more data about the object than just

34
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.810 
an identification number.

35
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.726 
Internet of Things (IoT) is this new world where

36
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.956 
all the objects are able

37
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.360 
to communicate via the Internet.

38
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.599 
So, in the IoT, the devices, the

39
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.658 
objects with the ability to be able to communicate with each other are

40
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.270 
called the smart devices.

41
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.209 
Of course, these smart devices need a digital identity, otherwise,

42
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.789 
they cannot communicate with each other.

43
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.900 
One cannot send a certain task to

44
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.414 
a specific smart device or one needs

45
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.803 
to know when one receives information from another device.

46
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.830 
So, for this unique identification in the network,

47
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.319 
this is the prerequisite to enable interactions with other

48
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.799 
IoT of devices or with people.

49
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.157 
If one looked to such devices in the Internet of Things (IoT),

50
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.320 
then these are miniaturized computers

51
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.899 
that have diverse sensors, that have storage,

52
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.819 
low storage but there are storage resources, they have computing resources,

53
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.529 
also these are low computing resources, but they have it and

54
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.300 
they have a limited energy supply.

55
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.279 
And typically, these smart devices

56
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.049 
are connected to the Internet by means of

57
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.109 
the so-called powerful Internet of Things

58
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.949 
IoT hubs or gateways.

59
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.739 
And here over the gateway, the devices

60
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.209 
are able to connect to other smart devices over

61
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.299 
the Internet. Via the gateway, the

62
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.995 
IoT devices are connected to the cloud and

63
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.021 
from the cloud, they are controlled and they can connect to other IoT

64
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.250 
devices in other areas or in other fields of application.

65
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.089 
Now, when we want to use blockchain technology, then

66
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.739 
blockchain technology provides not only autonomy

67
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.940 
and interoperability for the peer to peer communication,

68
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.330 
they provide this possibility without intermediaries

69
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.390 
or a central authority, and for many applications,

70
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.610 
this is very valuable.

71
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.489 
So, for example, IoT devices can have their own

72
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.990 
Etherium accounts on a blockchain, which

73
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.261 
is controlled by a smart contract or the IoT device,

74
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.750 
they can even generate smart contracts by themselves.

75
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.810 
And this combination that smart advisers

76
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.090 
can interact via a blockchain

77
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.550 
guarantees that the data they exchange over are protocoled

78
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.179 
in the right way in an unfalsified way so

79
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.800 
that everyone can trust this.

80
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.937 
Challenging in the case of Internet of Things (IoT)

81
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.920 
devices is that they only have limited resources,

82
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.759 
limited resources and with respect to computational power, to storage, to energy

83
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.569 
and of course, blockchain needs,

84
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.459 
computational resources and needs abilities

85
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.440 
that often exceed

86
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.609 
the resources of IoT devices.

87
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.039 
But fortunately, there are solutions on the market

88
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.050 
which enable also IoT devices

89
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.084 
to connect with low performance to a blockchain

90
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.059 
that allow us to do this without the necessity of extra

91
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
hardware or significant Internet bandwidth.

92
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.780 
So, there are frameworks that enable that,

93
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.038 
there are also Internet of Things devices,

94
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.610 
smart devices can use these advantages of a

95
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880 
blockchain.

96
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.749 
This is provided, of course, by private companies which developed

97
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.290 
such approaches and

98
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.920 
have introduced it successfully.

99
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.620 
Meanwhile, also, various consortia have emerged

100
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.092 
to support the collaborative development of such

101
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.680 
open source standards for blockchain technology

102
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.209 
in the field of Internet of Things and other areas.

103
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.139 
And now let's have a look at different application areas,

104
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.119 
how such an approach of Internet of Things devices, smart devices

105
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.028 
in combination with the blockchain can be applied in

106
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.040 
the energy sector or in the logistics sector.

107
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.639 
The combination is very attractive and provides new

108
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.491 
opportunities in the mentioned fields: energy and logistics

109
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:37.049 
sector. The interest is documented by a

110
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.225 
huge number of projects that have emerged and then make

111
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.099 
use of this advantageous combination.

112
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.500 
So, the information from the IoT devices

113
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.760 
is transferred to a blockchain network,

114
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:59.190 
often by a blockchain network that's

115
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.349 
controlled by smart contracts.

116
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.970 
And then this can be

117
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.252 
applied, I will show some examples in the energy

118
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.019 
sector and in the logistic sector in a very

119
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.590 
natural way. Let's start with considering the

120
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.889 
examples from the energy sector. In the energy

121
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.363 
sector, such Micro Grids play an important role

122
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.429 
and so there are some projects, which the micro

123
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.158 
grids in conjunction with blockchain and Internet of

124
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.915 
Things devices, make it possible to

125
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.259 
trade locally produced renewable energy in a

126
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.739 
local marketplace.

127
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.642 
And what is the field for such Micro Grids?

128
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:01.799 
These are energy networks that unite energy producers

129
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.259 
and energy consumers.

130
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.938 
And with renewable energy here many people are

131
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.492 
consumers in their houses, for example, considering family

132
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.230 
houses, they are consumers and at the same time, they are producers,

133
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.184 
for example, by means of photovoltaic

134
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.460 
equipment. So, there is surplus energy

135
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.886 
generated by roof solar panels that can be sold to the neighbours,

136
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.740 
in case the energy is not needed.

137
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.639 
And the idea is to allow

138
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.399 
to do this without relying on any kind

139
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.115 
of middleman, going directly in the

140
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.760 
neighborhood to sell energy and to buy energy

141
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.312 
in correspondence where the energy is needed.

142
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.639 
So, the data collected by the centers of the IoT devices

143
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.529 
and the surplus energy becomes a blockchain token, which can

144
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.999 
be controlled by a smart contract and then wired up.

145
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.130 
The participants, the users in this neighborhood,

146
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.050 
they have access to their own electricity consumption

147
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.120 
and the production data and they also can specify

148
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.090 
what kind of price ideas they have for the locally generated

149
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.780 
energy to sell it to the neighbors.

150
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:43.440 
So the combination of IoT devices, which are the

151
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.299 
measure that provides sensors to measure the need

152
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.919 
and the production of energy, and then by means of supply

153
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.049 
chain, it can be documented

154
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.988 
when energy is made, when energy is sold, so that in

155
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.620 
the neighborhood, everyone can be

156
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:12.149 
same time a seller and a user and buyer of energy

157
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.500 
and that the exchange of the payments for this

158
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.710 
can be done without any kind of middlemen.

159
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.869 
Very similar is the application of IoT devices in combination

160
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.200 
with blockchain in the field of logistics.

161
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.679 
There are very interesting use cases and the reasons

162
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.479 
these logistics chain are in the modern world very

163
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.830 
long, there are many different players and

164
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.349 
to give an example, when we consider such highly sensitive goods

165
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.159 
like medical drugs, for example, Corona Vaccine and

166
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.290 
then these drugs, the package of drugs

167
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.433 
can be equipped with IoT devices, which

168
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.003 
collect information and send information, for example, temperature,

169
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.820 
humidity and time to the blockchain.

170
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.100 
So it's exactly documented in which situation a

171
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.679 
good was at that point of time in the

172
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.479 
supply, in the process of supply from the producer to

173
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.799 
the to the user.

174
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:36.056 
The information can be secured in such a decentralized method,

175
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.939 
there's no authority needed and they can control it

176
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.370 
along the supply chain by smart contracts.

177
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.142 
So, for example, that if the time that

178
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.429 
is applied is longer, that's allowed, for example,

179
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.600 
with a certain temperature requirement, then it can be classified

180
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.570 
as a wrong, as a destroyed medium

181
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.200 
that is no longer allowed to bring to the patients.

182
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.139 
Today such supply chains are very complex, very complex in the global world,

183
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.498 
with numerous participants coming from all

184
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.290 
over the world. So, blockchain based supply chain management

185
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.922 
is a very good idea and a

186
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.559 
big field of applications of blockchain technology because

187
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.793 
this management can be automated, can be optimized,

188
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.559 
the whole blockchain process can be optimized without any

189
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.179 
authority, all the participants of this process

190
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.470 
have to trust.

191
00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:57.460 
To summarize tracking possession is a very

192
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.769 
important and one of the most widespread use cases for blockchain technology

193
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:09.015 
to connect a physical object to digital identity in a

194
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.560 
tamper-proof way, it's a big issue in many fields, is

195
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.360 
solvable by QR codes and RFID Chips and others.

196
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.481 
And in any case, focusing on such an IoT solution

197
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:29.679 
helps to activate this

198
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.326 
combination from an IoT device collecting data, sensor

199
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.788 
data and blockchain technology for the documentation

200
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.149 
and the exchange of such data, they offer a lot of new opportunities,

201
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:48.160 
particularly in the energy and in the logistic

202
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.620 
sectors, because it helps to optimize and automate

203
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.494 
the processes between the individual objects and the users without

204
00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.648 
relying on middlemen.

1
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.840 
Now let's introuce Hypertext, HTML and XML.

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.700 
Hypertext or hypermedia- these

3
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.860 
are the documents which can be accessed in the internet and which are characterized by

4
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.170 
having this hyperlink mechanism.

5
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.840 
So one can speak from World Wide Web as a hypermedia system

6
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.510 
or in hypertext system.

7
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.470 
So the document that are provided in the World Wide Web-

8
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.320 
they are inter-connected to each other by means of hyperlinks.

9
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.740 
For additionally inside documents, we have a linear structure.

10
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.250 
You start to read a book in the beginning and then to continue,

11
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.490 
and get it at the end once

12
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.790 
the story told by the author. So for text book writer,

13
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.330 
every time it's difficult to

14
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.220 
organize such a linear order, when they, for example want to explain some content.

15
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.530 
In the internet by means of this hypertext hyperlink structure one can

16
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.990 
interconnect documents in a

17
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.220 
really free way. So it's not necessary to follow such a linear order.

18
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.500 
You can directly

19
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.790 
combine and connect documents that belong together.

20
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.990 
Ssers can follow this linking structure and they can directly access

21
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.280 
one document, one web document from another one when they both

22
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.040 
are connected by a link.

23
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
For that reason, it's not even necessary that the documents

24
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.050 
are placed on the same server.

25
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.910 
Not the server, say the documents can be stored on different servers

26
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.270 
around the world by means of the linking mechanisms. If one

27
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.690 
has access to one document, by means of the hyperlinks one can directly

28
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.660 
access another document on another server in another part of

29
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.590 
the world. In this way the world is a really worldwide distributed hypermedia system.

30
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.210 
The web documents reside on servers which are distributed around the world.

31
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.880 
And this, in one sense provides a lot of comfort.

32
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.490 
On the other way it's difficult to guarantee

33
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
that hyperlinks are consistent, because the owner of the servers, the

34
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.790 
people that are responsible are completely free to replace

35
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.580 
the document by another one without

36
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.180 
also getting a message that the document

37
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.440 
with the hyperlink, he pointed to, now was deleted or was replaced by another one.

38
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.240 
This is a disadvantage. The advantage, of course is that

39
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.220 
on each place people are free to contribute new content to

40
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.100 
the worldwide web.

41
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.050 
Now to describe and compose such web documents

42
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.470 
a special language is needed. And this language is the HTML-the Hypertext

43
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.470 
Markup Language.

44
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.700 
It would be more careful would be for you

45
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.720 
to speak about hypermedia markup language but this is for historical reasons.

46
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.630 
In the beginning most of the documents were text documents.

47
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.840 
By means of a special language, by means of this HTML language,

48
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.310 
the authors of web documents described the structure

49
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.410 
of web documents.

50
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
What is the structure? The structure is to explain this is the headline,

51
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.890 
the first division, seventh division is a paragraphs, it's a table

52
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.900 
it's a description of the structure of the web document, and important

53
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.380 
part of the structure of course are the hyperlinks.

54
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.300 
It is also possible by means of HTML to embed multimedia components into such

55
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.170 
web documents, videos, photos,

56
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.070 
graphics and other things.

57
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:53.120 
The way how this is organized by HTML influences a little

58
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.970 
bit also the graphical presentation.

59
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.740 
This comes from the very beginning. early days of the world wide web

60
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.890 
where HTML was not only used to describe the structure of a document,

61
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.470 
but also its presentation.

62
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.980 
Such an HTML document is called a "page". So the resources in the World

63
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.650 
Wide Web are such pages.

64
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.300 
And if there are several pages belonging to one content provider, to

65
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.060 
one author, or to one company, then one speaks of starting page of this content

66
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.310 
from the home page of the things.

67
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.980 
Browsers- these are the web clients. They request a web page,

68
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.660 
and now they have, when they receive the page to interpret this page

69
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.470 
though and to display it to the user.

70
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.610 
So the browser needs to understand which part of this page

71
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.300 
is an image, which part is text, which part is text of this size.

72
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.180 
So all this needs to be explained for the browser and for such purpose

73
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:17.330 
we have the so-called "markups" or shortly tags in our HTML language.

74
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.240 
By means of such markups identifiers, the

75
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.680 
language helps to express that this part of

76
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.310 
the document is a headline, this is a connecting paragraph and others.

77
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.510 
And the browser needs to understand this markups needs to be able

78
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.080 
to interpret the HTML to be able to display the web page in the right way.

79
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.450 
Markup language should therefore only be used only if we used for

80
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.900 
the description of the document structure,

81
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.890 
and should not be used for the description of the document presentation.

82
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.260 
Unfortunately with HTML, we have a few elements that also

83
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.650 
help to influence the presentation of the document, but this

84
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.390 
come from very early days of the web. Today we

85
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.190 
more and more insist on separation of structure, and

86
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.420 
layout and formatting of a document.

87
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.960 
If we look to an HTML document, then every HTML document consists of two parts.

88
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.700 
One part is a header.

89
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.490 
The document start with the header and the header contains

90
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:43.360 
information about the document, so called meta-information. And then

91
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:51.420 
there is the "body" of the document and the body that contains the actual content

92
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.700 
of the document.

93
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.870 
Now I already mentioned that the basic idea

94
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:03.580 
of markup languages was the separation of structure and design.

95
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.260 
HTML is responsible for describing the document structure and

96
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.500 
for describing the design and layout of a document, we have

97
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.680 
another language these are so called Cascading

98
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.930 
Stylesheets. The Cascading Stylesheets language that's

99
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.690 
responsible for the description of the presentation of the layout

100
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.960 
of the structure, for example that headline is

101
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:43.420 
designed, is described or is displayed in a bold fashion of larger size

102
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.990 
than the rest of the document.

103
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.960 
The main area of application for such cascading stylesheets is

104
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.670 
the exact definition of the layout of an HTML document, is adoption

105
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.010 
of various output media,

106
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.090 
because typically web documents are multimedia documents, and

107
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:10.270 
it provides a central layout management. So that's possible if

108
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.510 
a provider offers several pages, that

109
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.430 
several pages follow the same layout, a guideline.

110
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.840 
With the help of special text.

111
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.270 
one can also realise the links, the hyperlinks.

112
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.090 
The hyperlinks are stored inside of an HTML document

113
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:41.200 
and they are stored and connected to, for example a special notion or a

114
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.120 
special image and the

115
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.580 
storage of a link in this place helps that the browser see

116
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:58.750 
if the user click on this link. Then the user wants to get

117
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:04.010 
delivered the document where the link is pointing to.

118
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.930 
So in this way, links are passive pointers to other documents.

119
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.890 
So it's important to know

120
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.390 
that the pointer points to which document.

121
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.550 
For that reason each document needs a unique

122
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:29.210 
identifier and such unique identifiers and such unique identifier

123
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.750 
in the World Wide Web is provided by means of the so called URIs-

124
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.620 
Uniform Resource Identifier.

125
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.760 
They serve in the unique global amplification of documents.

126
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.920 
URIs can be encoded in strings and can be

127
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:58.410 
made organized for the USI we have  two different type of implementation.

128
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:06.270 
Those one you know and use also called URL- Uniform Resource Locator.

129
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.360 
And in case of such URLs,

130
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.840 
the URI consists of the name of the access protocol,

131
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.860 
the computer name, browser is stored and the document name.

132
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:26.040 
It means pass to find this concrete document on the server. So

133
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.610 
this three parts- the access protocol, the name of the computer

134
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.710 
where the document is placed and the document name at this

135
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.090 
gives an uniform resource locator to

136
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.710 
identify sources in the web.

137
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.250 
Now over the development

138
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:52.070 
of the World Wide Web and the wish to have more and more individualized offers,

139
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:58.280 
there was a main criticism to the HTML markup language.

140
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.560 
And this main criticism was the lack of flexibility.

141
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.010 
Users want to design their own

142
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:14.970 
structural entities, users want to design languages with some special

143
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:21.810 
comments to certain very specific types of presentation. And

144
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.640 
for that reason, there was a

145
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.560 
markup language developed.

146
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.680 
In fact it's not a markup language. It's a meta markup language.

147
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.500 
It was an XML- Extensible Markup Language which makes is possible

148
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.670 
to design new markup languages.

149
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:52.760 
Which make it possible to describe each type of document with its own syntax.

150
00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:01.080 
So it's not a single markup language. It is a way to design a markup languages

151
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.940 
and this is called a meta markup language. So by means of this XML,

152
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.040 
it is possible to design markup languages for

153
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.120 
special purposes. So for example XML is a starting point for

154
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.500 
a variety of application-specific markup languages

155
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:26.190 
that are tailored exactly to the characteristics of the specialized output device

156
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.570 
or the specialized application area, for example there

157
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.590 
is the language MathML- Mathematical Markup Language.

158
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.590 
Language that's designed with XML,

159
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:46.870 
which for the special purpose to display to describe mathematical formulas,

160
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:53.350 
mathematical content in a right way. Or SVG- the Scalable Vector Graphics.

161
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.100 
ODF- the Open Document Format for Office Applications. This are

162
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:04.710 
specialized versions these are by means of XML, a description of

163
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:12.440 
markup languages for special field of applications or for special output devices.

164
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:20.510 
This was the first overview. During our course we have

165
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.300 
to go of course in more detail.

166
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.570 
But here in the first week we want to get an overview about

167
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.070 
the different pieces and different components of the World Wide Web.

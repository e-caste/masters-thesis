00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:10.280 


2
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.330 
The climate change is the defining
crisis of our times.

3
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.830 
It is an urgent planetary problem
and climate action is on

4
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.160 
top of everyone's minds. The pressure
to reduce carbon emissions

5
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.360 
is coming from all directions. Investors,
customers, regulators and governments

6
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.250 
and so also it is one of the top topics
on many companies' minds in the c-suite.

7
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.300 
They need to reduce carbon emissions
significantly in order to

8
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.790 
address the
climate change.

9
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.010 
Addressing climate change is also
being referred by us at SAP

10
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.570 
as the green line where this
topic becomes an integral and

11
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.110 
core part of our business, not only
to define profitability top-line

12
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.390 
but also operational efficiency
which is the bottom line.

13
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.170 
Also, to take
climate action

14
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.310 
we should become
sustainable enterprises.

15
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.070 
The shareholders will expect it,
the consumers will expect it,

16
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.260 
the customers will expect it. It won't just
happen because it's ordered top-down

17
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.620 
or because there is a compelling event
like a regulation passed in the EU,

18
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.180 
America or Asia. It must come
from within an organisation

19
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.950 
to live a sustainable
enterprise philosophy.

20
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.010 
SAP launched the Climate
21 initiative to tackle

21
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.390 
the challenge and support businesses
to minimize their product footprint

22
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.590 
in their operations and supply
chains. With climate twenty one

23
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.450 
we are embedding sustainability as a new
dimension of success into our analytical

24
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.680 
and transactional applications, to enable
our ERP and intelligent enterprise

25
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.420 
to optimize the resources not
only of individual enterprise

26
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.690 
but across the entire value chain. With the
entire product life-cycle starting from cradle

27
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.290 
to grave. This will allow business
leaders to act on the insights

28
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.880 
and ultimately create transparency and
the ability to initiate, for example,

29
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.100 
climate friendly
buying decisions.

30
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.570

21 initiative in our

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.839 
Welcome to this video clip in which we discuss process, discovery and enhancement

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.509 
from a practical perspective.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.739 
So in the previous video clip, we looked at ways to simulate

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.553 
event locks and we used process Model

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.030 
T to to do so.

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.719 
We already said that we created events for three thousand

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.533 
complete cases. And we also need to look at the branching

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.079 
probabilities. So basically we have two decisions in that process.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.565 
Up to the first one is the decision whether a claim is incomplete

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.500 
or not. So that's the decision whether I move here to the incomplete

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.649 
claims or whether I move on.

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.733 
If the claim is complete and we have 70 percent

13
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.462 
of the cases, the claim is complete, 30 percent.

14
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.070 
It's incomplete.

15
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.920 
We are also a bit reluctant in granting claims.

16
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.559 
So in our example that the claim acceptance rate is just 30 percent.

17
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.409 
So 30 percent of the claims are accepted and 70 percent of the claims

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.449 
are rejected. That's basically the input to the process discovery

19
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.219 
that we want to do here.

20
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.769 
So the first process discovery algorithm that we now take a look at is called inductive

21
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.819 
minor. Deductive minor is available as a prompt plug in

22
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.769 
and the inductive miner creates a pattern that and you see here also on

23
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.329 
this slide pattern that inductive miner has been designed and

24
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.430 
developed by Sonder Lemann's.

25
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.069 
So basically, we see here the pattern that that is made

26
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.749 
by the inductive miner and again, the input to this is just

27
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.580 
the event, OK, so we do not do not do any process modelling at all.

28
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.810 
We just have the event like I showed it here again.

29
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.909 
And here's another snippet of the event, like the inductive miner can read

30
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.710 
the events, the traces and the ordering and can distil or discover

31
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.659 
out of the sequence of traces a Petrie

32
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.168 
net that has the same behaviour that we can observe

33
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.960 
in these events. OK, so let me just

34
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.939 
show you some details of that Petrine that.

35
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.509 
So I'm not going to the detail of the pattern yet, but I think it's it's clear that we'll

36
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.949 
mine exactly what we have simulated before already.

37
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.800 
So the first thing that happens is the receive claim.

38
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.240 
Then we check claim completeness.

39
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.360 
Then basically we have two options.

40
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.230 
Either we directly decide on claim coverage

41
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.050 
or we send an update request and we receive

42
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.118 
the update and we can iterate and check again for completeness

43
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.949 
of that claim after deciding on claim coverage

44
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.599 
on the tokenised here so that we can either prepare the approval letter and prepare

45
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.129 
the rejection letter. And we sent the respective letter

46
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.050 
and then we then come to an end.

47
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.240 
So I think it's it's very nice to see that this process, mining

48
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.347 
algorithms just use as input just the data that we that we find

49
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.269 
in the event that we have basically distilled out of all the documents

50
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.499 
that we found in this scenario.

51
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.219 
And do you have a model?

52
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.319 
You have a pattern that that describes exactly the behaviour that has been observed

53
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320 
in our lock.

54
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.409 
The next tool that we want to take a look at is called Disco Disco as a

55
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.000 
commercial process mining tour by a company called Lexicon.

56
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.669 
Disco is a very powerful tool. Is it?

57
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.949 
Allow us to create directly follows graphs with frequencies

58
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.520 
and also also many functionality is here or lots of functionalities

59
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.240 
available in disco as well.

60
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.196 
If we remember directly follows graphs that we discussed earlier

61
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.985 
in this course, we just had these very simple hent drawn directly

62
00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.730 
follows graph in which we have the notes for the events and the numbers

63
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.449 
that we have here. Receive claim and receive claim is 12

64
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.369 
times followed by a check claim completeness and

65
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.929 
C.C.C. is followed ten times by the site on claim coverage

66
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.879 
and so forth. So that was our initial, let's say, toy example to introduce

67
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.350 
what it directly follows. Graph is in

68
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.990 
this call, it looks a little bit different, but the chorus

69
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.889 
is the same, actually. So we have here we have here the graph that has been created

70
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.750 
by by the disco tool.

71
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.478 
And I can also try to increase the size a little bit

72
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.120 
so that we can see a bit better.

73
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.184 
So first you see here that you have a starting point and that three thousand

74
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.120 
cases have been simulate.

75
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.460 
So receive claims are the first activity receive claim has been executed exactly

76
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.479 
three thousand times.

77
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.363 
And then we have a directly follows relationship to check claim completeness.

78
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.279 
And that's also done three thousand times that this arc

79
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.089 
is travelled along. We then have an activity check claim completeness

80
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.959 
also. We discussed it several times already and here

81
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.119 
we see that we have a directly direct successor to decide on claim coverage

82
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.589 
three thousand times. But we also have iterations of the loop and altogether

83
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.609 
we have two thousand and seventy seven iterations of the ascent up there to request and

84
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.139 
receive updates. So we find that in our simulated data.

85
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.139 
So on this, obviously the numbers are based on our assumption regarding the branching

86
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.389 
probabilities, but it's important to see that we have so every case ultimately

87
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.279 
travels along this edge. So all 3000 cases are finally decided

88
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.800 
upon and we do not have incomplete cases.

89
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.709 
Right after deciding on the claim coverage, we have direct successor relationships to the

90
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.029 
preparation of rejection letters and almost 2000 cases,

91
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.619 
and in more than thousand case, a bit more than a thousand cases, we

92
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.389 
prepare an approval letter directly after deciding on claim

93
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.799 
coverage. And then we have the respective sent letter

94
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.619 
events that are represented here.

95
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.239 
And then we have an end. And he has this, again, end of the of the overall

96
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.240 
process.

97
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.910 
So.

98
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.831 
Now we take a look at a different event like simulation, so we have a

99
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.448 
third event like simulation that we like to discuss here, and this event

100
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.420 
like simulation is based on process model three that we discussed earlier.

101
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.569 
And in this event, look, on this process, Model P three,

102
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.617 
we had these concurrent execution of the revealing activities to remember

103
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.777 
that we have an internal that we have an internal reviewing and

104
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.209 
that we send and receive an external review.

105
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.300 
And we do this concurrently. Right.

106
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.079 
So that was that this process, model P three that we created during

107
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.971 
a process enhancement step in our conceptual the conceptual

108
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.750 
part of this lecture.

109
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.415 
All right, so P three is based on this event like that,

110
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.899 
we have fears based on PS3, but we introduce noise here, so

111
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.399 
we introduce, well, behaviour that is

112
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.769 
not cannot be found in that process.

113
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.480 
Model that and thereby we want to assimilate well.

114
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.489 
We want to simulate process executions that do not obey that model, that are

115
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.209 
that are deviations from the blueprint process model.

116
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.790 
We again have 3000 cases and we have the same branching probabilities that we have

117
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.529 
that we looked at earlier.

118
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.660 
All right. So on the right hand side, we see a snippet of an excess document.

119
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.059 
And in that that document, we have noise.

120
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.110 
So it's not exactly as planned.

121
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.379 
And the noise is as follows.

122
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:27.309 
We have a missing receive claim review, so we invite an external review,

123
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.475 
but we never receive it. And this is obviously things that happen that happen all the

124
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.059 
time. So we invite an external review and we just don't receive it.

125
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.159 
We just don't get it.

126
00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:42.519 
And the second thing that we can observe here, we have a missing review claim

127
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.909 
internally activity. So there is no internal review at all.

128
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.470 
We can also take a look at that excess here,

129
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.779 
the upper right part, and we can validate what we have just seen.

130
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.319 
So we ever receive claim event.

131
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.729 
We have a check claim, complete the event, then we have an invite

132
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.509 
claim review. So we have no internal review.

133
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.169 
We invite claim review.

134
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.210 
But then we have already the decide on claim coverage event

135
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.039 
and we do not receive the external claim review and we

136
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.619 
also do not have an internal review.

137
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.649 
All right. Now we have we have well, we have a problem or at least we have some

138
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:31.089 
noise. We have a deviation. And we can you can use this code to to

139
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.799 
show us the situation.

140
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.879 
So we use this code to create again, directly follows graphs, follows

141
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.759 
graph. And we see also here the numbers.

142
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.240 
So we have missing receive claim review in twenty cases

143
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.905 
and we have a missing review claim internally in one hundred and forty five

144
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.252 
cases. So looking at this at

145
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.759 
the details again, so the first part is exactly the same that we

146
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760 
had before.

147
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.477 
But here we have a review claim internally.

148
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.119 
So the internal review claiming two thousand nine hundred cases.

149
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.859 
But we have in one hundred forty five cases, we have a directly follows

150
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.417 
relationship from Czech claim completeness travelling

151
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.049 
along this edge to invite claim review.

152
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.029 
So we skip the review, claim internal internal activity.

153
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.160 
And that's not what we what we should do.

154
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.918 
The second deviation, the second type of noise is that we invite a claim

155
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.600 
review and in most of the time we get it and we can continue here.

156
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:45.760 
But in twenty cases we do not receive the claim review.

157
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.876 
We skip the claim review activity.

158
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.859 
And we have here immediately after inviting an external review,

159
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.120 
we decide on the claim coverage and this

160
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.325 
this information, this as these results show very, very

161
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:07.779 
nicely that we can, using process mining, analyse our process really

162
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.230 
in a very detailed, detailed level of abstraction.

163
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.549 
So we remark that this is very valuable information to analyse

164
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.740 
the process from a domain perspective.

165
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.626 
We always need a domain specific interpretation of this problem.

166
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.639 
So process mining is is a technology, a set of technologies that help you

167
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.399 
see help you investigate problems.

168
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.579 
There's no automatic solution of these problems.

169
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:38.319 
But process mining tells you tells you detailed information

170
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.029 
about the process that you are in a position to fix it and to to see the problem

171
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.570 
and then to to fix the problem as well.

172
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.499 
All right. So we have the missing receive claim review.

173
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.979 
So, again, in twenty cases, we invite a claim review but do not receive

174
00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:00.040 
a response. So we have it here a little bit larger so we can see it here immediately

175
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.380 
and we can enhance the blueprint model with a reminder policy.

176
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.149 
So obviously we sent out the claim review, but we did not send a reminder.

177
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.179 
We just waited for for a certain time.

178
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.710 
But nothing nothing happened.

179
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.081 
So what we can do here, we use this information to avoid in

180
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.740 
the future, have a missing receive claim review activities.

181
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.982 
We can change the process model. We can do another round of the BPM lifecycle.

182
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.219 
If you want, we can do another.

183
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:35.279 
Amount of process enhancement and BPM and

184
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.419 
the language BPM and gives you lots of, say, expressive power

185
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:44.759 
to to specify these things and basically

186
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.229 
what you can do is after invite, claim review, you

187
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.870 
can use this called event based gateway.

188
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.029 
Either you receive you receive an answer within

189
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.215 
seven days. All of these called intermediate time or event fires.

190
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.490 
And after that, if I don't get any information after seven days, I just send a reminder.

191
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:10.529 
Then I go back here and wait another seven days, put another reminder and at some

192
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.070 
point either receive the claim review.

193
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.499 
So that's the example of another of fixing this problem, of not getting replies

194
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.479 
from reviewers that I invite with, let's say, an operation

195
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.600 
or a change to the process more.

196
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.449 
But there's another problem and another problem was this missing rear-View claim

197
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.580 
internally, so we have seen that one hundred forty five cases,

198
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.720 
we invite a claim review without conducting an internal review beforehand.

199
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.979 
Now, the question is, should the blueprint model reflect this?

200
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.090 
We could do so. We can do the change if we wish.

201
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.890 
If we decide that the process should behave in that way, we can do so.

202
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.872 
But we can we do not know this because we are no

203
00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.051 
expert in this insurance claim process.

204
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:07.549 
So that's maybe left as an open point where the domain

205
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.049 
experts need to have the information to decide whether this is acceptable

206
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.519 
behaviour or whether this is not acceptable behaviour, in which case

207
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.559 
we should change the model and the implementation of them all again.

208
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.349 
All right, so overall, we did a number of steps in process enhancement,

209
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.220 
so we like to enhance the blueprint model accordingly by adding sequence flow

210
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.224 
and we might add contraflow already.

211
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.100 
So we could if we say yes, we allow also bypassing

212
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.769 
the review claim internally.

213
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.210 
We could do this by adding this sequence flow edge so that we start

214
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.179 
that process continues here.

215
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.316 
And if we do that, we come to the resulting process tomorrow and

216
00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.394 
the resulting process model you see now here and you see

217
00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.559 
that it's pretty detailed, but it has lots of information, hopefully a number of

218
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.431 
improvements relative to the process that was implemented in that organisation,

219
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.909 
in organisation before it.

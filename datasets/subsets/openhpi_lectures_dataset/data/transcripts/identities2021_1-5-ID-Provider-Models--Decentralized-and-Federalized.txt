00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.250 
In our OpenHPI course about digital
identities we continue to discuss

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.520 
various ID provider models. We already
have discussed the ID provider models

3
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.740 
"isolated" and the ID
provider model "central".

4
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.630 
And you remember in the
central ID provider model, there

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.950 
is only one identity
provider which takes care,

6
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.670 
manipulates and manages the digital
identities and the different services.

7
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.950 
They use these identities of
the central ID provider

8
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.120 
for their work and can concentrate on their
own functionality without taking care

9
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.640 
about dealing with the
digital identities.

10
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.570 
If one discusses, then it would be an
idea to say there should be one

11
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.020 
worldwide central ID provider. One
central ID provider and

12
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.920 
no one has to take care about
IDs, only this ID provider.

13
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
But if you have such a kind of vision,
then we have to ask ourselves

14
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.710 
where this central ID provider
should be located.

15
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.460 
Should it be a
service from US?

16
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.750 
Should it be a service
from China, from Russia,

17
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.740 
or who could provide such a service
that all the world is trusting.

18
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.490 
And this is exactly the question. It
is clear that the Chinese

19
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.120 
services will not fully trust a US
identity provider, and vice versa.

20
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.620 
The American services will not trust
completely a Chinese identity provider.

21
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.380 
So the idea of a single
global ID provider

22
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.160 
is difficult to imagine,

23
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.410 
both in terms of the trust
issue as well as the

24
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.220 
property to be a single
point of failure.

25
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.570 
Therefore, only a decentralized ID
provider model can be considered.

26
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.980 


27
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.250 
And this is what we
want to do now.

28
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.540 
In contrast to the
central model,

29
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.760 
there are several
identity providers,

30
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.800 
and they cooperate together. They
cooperate in a decentralized ID

31
00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.490 
provider model. So one online services can
collaborate with multiple identity providers

32
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.160 
and use their identities, so the
user can select that identity

33
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.860 
he is trusting and the service can
cooperate with those identity provider,

34
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.850 
with those centralized identity provider
it is trusting.

35
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.220 
So users can then choose their
identity provider, same is true

36
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.360 
for the companies. What is the
advantage and disadvantages of these

37
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.790 
decentralized ID provider
models? Advantages are, users can

38
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.930 
choose their ID provider as they trust
this ID provider. So they look into

39
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.560 
the service by means of
the identity they have

40
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.410 
with this ID provider.

41
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.450 
The online services can also choose
which ID providers they trust

42
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.520 
and with which they
want to collaboarate.

43
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.180 
One point is important here
to remark, the

44
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.690 
services is cooperating
with an ID provider,

45
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.460 
then this ID provider learns a lot
about the user of those services.

46
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.790 
The ID provider sees, when a
user logs in to the service

47
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.760 
for what amount of time, this gives a
lot of information to the ID provider

48
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.210 
about the server. So the online
services have to select

49
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.430 
which ID provider should
know so much about their work.

50
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.490 
On the side of the disadvantages, here
the user must deposit their identities

51
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.540 
with multiple ID providers,
not only to

52
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.000 
establish a digital identity with
one ID provider, one has to

53
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.580 
do it with several ones because the online
services collaborate with different ID

54
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.680 
providers. Here the another
disadvantage is not so

55
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.960 
dangerous like in the
case of a centralized ID provider

56
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.790 
model, but also here in the
decentralized ID provider model,

57
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.020 
at least a partial single point
of failure is in place. If a

58
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.690 
user's ID provider
cannot be reached,

59
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.600 
the user can no longer
use this identity

60
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.290 
to log in into online services and
the users of other ID providers

61
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.140 
on the other hand still
have access and

62
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.120 
the user with the defect
ID provider has not.

63
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.140 
Here are some examples of such decentralized
ID provider models.

64
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.970 
And the examples are all websites and
services that support at least

65
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.860 
two identity providers.

66
00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.080 
For example, via
Facebook or Google.

67
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.560 
So this is what you often see if
you want to login into a service,

68
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:12.090 
there is a number of logins, a number
of ID providers behind that login

69
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.430 
that are offered and the user
can freely select with which login

70
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.450 
with which identity

71
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.480 
he or she wants to
use the service.

72
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.010 
So this is important, the
user can choose which of

73
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.760 
their digital identities they use
to log in into the online service,

74
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.260 
and whose information of their
interaction with the online service

75
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.880 
should have. Often people are not
thinking about that the

76
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:52.780 
ID provider sees all what the user
is doing, also with the other service

77
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.670 
because the identity is a very
important tool for

78
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.500 
interacting with
a service.

79
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:10.030 
So OpenID connect and OAuth
are well known protocols

80
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.540 
for implementing such a decentralized
ID provider approach. We will also

81
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.990 
have a closer look
at this model.

82
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:28.170 
Besides the distributed ID provider model,
also the federated ID provider model

83
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.380 
is actually just another name
for the decentralized model.

84
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:40.270 
The federated ID provider model
allows to use digital identities across

85
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.100 
company and
organizations,

86
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.410 
and this is where the
name comes from. We have

87
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.720 
the decentralized ID provider model
in the different companies,

88
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.410 
and then when companies interact
with another they federate

89
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:01.240 
their ID provider model in such
a way that the users which

90
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.120 
have a digital identity in the one
company can also use with that

91
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.300 
digital identity as the
services of the other

92
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:17.170 
company. Such a federation
is also called a circle of trust.

93
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.310 
A circle of trust because

94
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.040 
one company trusts the other one,
the other one trusts the first.

95
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:32.190 
Otherwise, it will not work to federate the
ID provider and this federated ID

96
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.810 
provider will need to have
the same level of security

97
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.060 
provided and the same

98
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:50.930 
level of taking care about digital
identities. Because otherwise, the

99
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.190 
companies from one side
would not trust the ID provider

100
00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.460 
from the other company.

101
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:05.700 
So it is possible to use
with one ID also the

102
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:13.390 
services which are usable typically
with the ID from the other area.

103
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.110 
So if we look at some
federated ID providers in

104
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.680 
practice, then here is a
famous example for our area,

105
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.210 
for the university area,
this is the eduroam.

106
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:35.420 
Eduroam network for universities for
around the world.

107
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.930 
And the idea behind this is with one
account, with one digital identity of

108
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:48.160 
one university, for example the
University of Potsdam, one can log in

109
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:55.700 
to any other university in Berlin or
in Paris, in Newyork or in Beijing,

110
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.310 
and then one can use the network and
the internet resources of that

111
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:07.330 
university without having to re-
register with the universities there.

112
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:13.240 
So this is a federated ID
provider.

113
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:20.800 
Each university trusts the other
university's digital IDs

114
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:26.960 
and allows that a digital ID
of one university can also use

115
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.910 
the services and the resources
of another university.

116
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:38.840 
So to summarize this decentralized
federated ID provider model discussion,

117
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.070 
we can say the decentralized
ID provider model

118
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:49.530 
is in place, because it's not
imaginable that there is only one

119
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.890 
centralized ID provider. So in
practice, we have several and

120
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.350 
for the user it should be as easy as
possible, as well as for the services

121
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:04.990 
to use these different
digital IDs and ID providers.

122
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:11.300 
So the users in this case of the
decentralized ID provider model

123
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:19.720 
can choose between different
IDs, between different ID providers

124
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:26.470 
and the online service can
dynamically decide which ID providers

125
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:31.050 
they trust and can cooperate
with this ID provider.

126
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:38.560 
The federated ID provider model is
de-centralized model, mostly

127
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:44.300 
related to companies and organizations.
The online services trust

128
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.480 
all identities provided by an ID
provider, and have a federated partner

129
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.140 
typically another company or
another organization, so that the

130
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.400 
users from one organization or
company can use the services from

131
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:04.090 
the other company without
establishing a new digital identity.

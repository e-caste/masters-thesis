00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.920 
i my name is Yong Cho, a phd student at cornell university.

2
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.460 
i will present on online field experiment study titled

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.890 
using social norms to promote actions beyond the course.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.090 
courses for a cause aim at contributing to public goods.

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.620 
course takers are expected to conduct rearward actions applying

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.780 
what they learn from the course such as

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.790 
conducting sustainability practices and spreading knowledge

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.540 
in their local communities.

9
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.880 
in other academic oriented courses,

10
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.790 
making rearward applications is also important to master skills.

11
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.530 
the centre question here is how on online course can encourage

12
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.380 
course takers to do. so one way is to utilize social comparison.

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.630 
there are multiple interventions in online education
that implicitly leveraged social comparison

14
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.420 
to increase course participation

15
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.070 
that includes a learning analytics dashboard to design

16
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.610 
a better system or reputation system an emailing peer students' performance,

17
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.190 
as an extension of social comparison

18
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.450 
can also use social norms

19
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.430 
research in social psychology shows that social norm messages can effectively promote

20
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.780 
pro-environmental behaviors.

21
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.400 
for example after receiving more messages,

22
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.990 
hotel guests reused more towels fewer people store petrified wood

23
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.390 
from a national park.
and students ate less meat in a school cafeteria.

24
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.560 
there are three types of norm messages and they are effective under different situations

25
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.900 
descriptive norms which communicate the majority of people

26
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.580 
conduct the target behavior is effective when the target
behavior is already prevalent.

27
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.430 
in contrast injunctive norms communicating people are to
conduct the target behavior is effective,

28
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.020 
when the target behavior is not prevalent yet.

29
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.500 
dynamic norms which typically state more and more people have

30
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.820 
conducted the target behavior is effective when the target

31
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.520 
behavior is not prevalent.

32
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.210 
but increasing there are challenges of crafting norm
messages for online courses

33
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.170 
first behaviors outside of the course is hard to observe.

34
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.620 
thus it is a hard to know if the target behavior is prevalent or not.

35
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.690 
second applying knowledge to reward the situations
may not be readily done

36
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
unlike actions that can be taken immediately after receiving

37
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.890 
a norm message on site.

38
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.520 
in this paper we wanted to answer a question,

39
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.070 
how do different types of social norm messages
influence learners to take actions

40
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.610 
outside of the course and learners perceived the norms about

41
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.770 
taking actions outside of the course

42
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.220 
to get a sense of how much course takers engaged in rearward actions.

43
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.060 
we used a survey to ask their progress and crafted norm messages

44
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.950 
based on their responses

45
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.180 
a survey and updated norm messages every week throughout the course.

46
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.850 
we ran a randomized the contrast study to compare the different types of
norms.

47
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.070 
we also had a control condition where participants received surveys,

48
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.160 
but not any norm messages

49
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.950 
the city was conducted and three online courses these courses

50
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.530 
were open to anyone from anywhere,
but they were not massive open online courses.

51
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.390 
they usually have high completion rates around
a twenty to thirty percentage.

52
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.120 
we only included participants from the us in our analysis to

53
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.170 
avoid any cultural differences based on countries.

54
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.390 
the first course promoted relatively simple behavior which was

55
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.220 
taking climate change actions such as recycling saving water,

56
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.940 
choosing a lunch box with less meat.

57
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.760 
on the other hand the other two promoted relatively complex

58
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.720 
behavior which was conducting educational activities such as

59
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.720 
leading a small event or teaching a class,
therefore we analyzed them separately.

60
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.320 
these are the messages we used in our study between the conditions.

61
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.530 
we manipulated messages and the graphics.

62
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.790 
the percentage numbers were updated every week

63
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.630 
according to the survey responses.

64
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.540 
between courses we tried to keep the messages
in the same format as possible

65
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.450 
over none of the norm conditions outperformed the control condition,

66
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.940 
however in promoting complex behavior sending injunctive
or descriptive norm messages

67
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.270 
were significantly less effective than sending no message at all.

68
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:46.010 
between room conditions dynamic norms were
most effective in promoting complex behaviors

69
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.580 
outside of the course.

70
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.590 
we also found naur messages did not significantly affect,
how course takers perceived

71
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.970 
norms about taking actions outside of the course.

72
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.190 
here take-aways four instructors were recommend encouraging

73
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.330 
students with a nav ignore messages.
they will be more effective in increasing desired

74
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.880 
complex learning behaviors than descriptive or injunctive norm messages.

75
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.230 
we don't recommend using you should do something, or many others

76
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.380 
are doing something message framings.
they may be worse than saying nothing

77
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.420 
for researchers.
we want to highlight that types of norm messages

78
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.450 
do not affect the perception of how important

79
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.110 
conducting target behavior is.

80
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.840 
or so role messages have varying effect

81
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.990 
depending on the complexity of target behaviors.

82
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.390 
this is the end of the presentation. thank you.

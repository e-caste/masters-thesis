00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.050 
Thank you very much, I have contacted Nico Wottke from Walldorf, our head office with product management for our military systems.

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.460 
solutions, which we will also see again later in the demo, welcome also from my side, like Professor

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.199 
Meinel already said: I work here in Potsdam at the Innovation Centre - a department that is involved across SAP in specific

4
00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:31.160 
development projects with architecture, integration and technology issues, and also provides tools for the

5
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.149 
for other software teams, where of course the question of the energy efficiency of these tools also plays a role.

6
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.759 
As I said, I found out at short notice, so it's very good that the notes are there. A little bit, I will have to look

7
00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:55.520 
but I think I can get the main points across on behalf of Mr. Herzlich, who unfortunately cannot be here.

8
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.109 
be able to come.

9
00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.170 
The paper is titled "Digital systems and energy efficiency:

10
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
Contradiction or matter of course?"

11
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.769 
I would like of course in particular, to go a little bit in the latter direction then.

12
00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:13.730 
This also brings us a little bit to the solution space. We have already been shown very well today what the problems are.

13
00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:22.069 
are with regard to energy efficiency, why it is relevant. We have also just seen that: Measurability is of course

14
00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:29.260 
an important prerequisite in order to be able to improve energy efficiency.

15
00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:32.739 
Now I would like to elaborate a bit in the lecture: How do we get into the solution space?

16
00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:34.099 
What are solutions

17
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.530 
in this respect? And there first of all a short recourse: Sustainabilitz Goals have already fallen as a topic today.

18
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.849 
All of these goals are important.

19
00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:49.739 
We are, of course, looking specifically here at goal number 13, CLimate Action, and I will also be talking about that in my presentation.

20
00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.920 
in my presentation. But we will see again in a moment that we also see it as SAP in the larger context, which is

21
00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.060 
topic of sustainability and also the other objectives there, but nevertheless Climate

22
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.799 
Action is of course the area where urgent action is needed, where we also need to react urgently to tackle climate change.

23
00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.240 
and mitigate the consequences.

24
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:18.800 
And in that area, two points in particular to look at are of course the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and

25
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.530 
then also the efficient use of energy.

26
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.490 
As is generally the case today, I will use the two things synonymously.

27
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.240 
So when I talk about energy efficiency, that obviously implies a saving in CO2 emissions.

28
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.849 
Digital systems offer a great opportunity.

29
00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:42.710 
This has already been mentioned several times today, to reduce climate gases, to reduce emissions significantly, and can

30
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.460 
contribute to the efficient use of energy.

31
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.259 
At the same time, the systems also need energy.

32
00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:53.789 
This has already been discussed several times today, and I would like to go into this in particular in the solution space.

33
00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:59.520 
Because today it is still often perceived as a contradiction, we have heard the example today of Bitcoin and

34
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.810 
the corresponding outflow of energy also through video streaming or in data centres in general, which, for example

35
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.409 
in Germany consume 15 terawatt hours of energy a year, which actually corresponds to the size of a large city like Berlin.

36
00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:21.860 
which at just under 13 terawatt hours are actually below that, so you can see the potential behind that.

37
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.520 
On the other hand, of course, there are digital systems that can actually save energy, that are more efficient, and that are more efficient.

38
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.560 
energy: be it in logistics, in production, in communication.

39
00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:40.830 
And efficiency is often the primary reason why companies use, for example, digital systems.

40
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.960 
implement. The whole raison d'Ãªtre of SAP, for example, as an ERP manufacturer, is to create efficient operational processes.

41
00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:48.719 
to enable.

42
00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:55.020 
Of course, this has often been a question of financial efficiency for companies, but increasingly, of course, financial

43
00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.219 
efficiency is related to energy efficiency or is related to each other.

44
00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:06.349 
Today there are also more and more solutions that are primarily concerned with resource efficiency, primarily concerned with energy efficiency

45
00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:15.240 
so digital systems that actually help to reduce the challenges in the climate environment.

46
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:23.509 
We have also already heard the study of the Bitkom Association today, according to which, through the use of digital systems, up to

47
00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.730 
150 megatonnes of CO2 per year can be saved.

48
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.889 
And we have to realise this potential further and actually optimise it in that direction. I would like to point out four aspects

49
00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.310 
especially today, how we can achieve this.

50
00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:46.350 
First of all, "How can digital systems help save energy in the real world?", but then also "How can digital

51
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.220 
systems themselves be built so that they are energy efficient?"

52
00:04:50.220 --> 00:05:00.189 
There are then three aspects, one is the optimisation of the applications, sustainable programming, learning and teaching accordingly.

53
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:08.019 
practices to programme sustainably, using advances in hardware technology, and then also

54
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.420 
the energy-efficient operation of applications within data centres,

55
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:19.110 
the opportunities that are there also through cloud technology. So with these four aspects together, then come digital

56
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.670 
systems actually come into the green area and can also deliver a positive effect.

57
00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:31.930 
So I would like to start with energy efficiency in the real world, I would like to start with a short example from SAP

58
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.319 
but which addresses something that I think all

59
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:40.079 
very present, namely the use of digital communication as a substitute for business travellers.

60
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.069 
This has very concrete implications in the example of SAP.

61
00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:50.850 
For the year 2020, we as SAP have seen a reduction of more than half of our net CO2 emissions due to the fact that we are

62
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.069 
by replacing business travel with digital communication.

63
00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.779 
This continued in 2021, and it wasn't because we were doing badly in terms of business

64
00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.319 
or that we cut staff.

65
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:07.139 
No, on the contrary, within these two years we have grown strongly as SAP we are also very successful in business.

66
00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.250 
and this result was possible,

67
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:16.100 
just by using digital technologies, so it's a very concrete example of how you can save energy here. Now

68
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.430 
we as SAP are of course in a good position, we don't have to produce anything, we don't produce cars or anything like that, that is to say

69
00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:28.660 
of these emissions are of course easier for us to reduce, but SAP also offers digital systems for

70
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:38.259 
other companies that offer leverage to work more energy-efficiently. And there we have a whole range of solutions: Manufacturing,

71
00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:45.790 
merchandise management, logistics. Here's an example from logistics the Transportation Management from SAP, which is there to manage delivery

72
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:52.319 
processes and transport chains, which in the real world, of course, also reduces the number of transports.

73
00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.800 
of journeys, many transport kilometres are saved and traffic jams are avoided.

74
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.230 
Ultimately, existing resources, the vehicle fleet, are also used more efficiently, so that perhaps fewer lorries are used.

75
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.889 
for example, which together then of course enables a direct energy saving and thus a reduction of the

76
00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.850 
CO2 emissions in the real world through these digital digital systems.

77
00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:22.589 
Another point has also been made: Transparency is a very important issue, of course, for one thing in the digital economy

78
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:28.319 
itself, have already heard is not so easy, but I think also in the real economy, so in the economy, the goods

79
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:35.990 
it is not yet a solved problem to have this transparency about the CO2 footprint of products and also about the carbon footprint of the products.

80
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:44.379 
Here, we as SAP have solutions on the market and develop solutions that help companies to reduce their carbon footprint as well,

81
00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:48.779 
because today companies face the huge data problem of getting the data in the first place.

82
00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:52.740 
What is the footprint of my product across the supply chain?

83
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.110 
So of course that plays into it as well:

84
00:07:54.110 --> 00:08:02.740 
What are my producers, what is the CO2-footprint of my producers and we are in the lucky position to have a digital carbon footprint.

85
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:08.310 
systems, with all the data that is already in SAP systems, to offer solutions. And for this we actually see

86
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.459 
a short demo of one of our product footprint management solutions.

87
00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:19.449 
But as already mentioned we see this at SAP as part of the Sustainabilitz Development Goal in general.

88
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:26.350 
so that was now first start also in the view in what do we do for the overall Sustainabilitz Development Goals and briefly nico

89
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.649 
please. thank you very much Henning, just as for one already announced I would like to give you now on the basis of these two example products,

90
00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:37.769 
by the way, these are both cloud products that we released last year, to show you how we as SAP support our customers on their way to success.

91
00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.450 
towards more sustainability.

92
00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:47.220 
What we see here on the screen now is the Sustainability Control Tower. This solution is a 360 degree solution to corporate sustainability.

93
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.980 
sustainability control. Namely, it functions

94
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:59.549 
as a kind of data warehouse, which pulls together various SAP and also non-SAP sources and then, based on this, creates a data warehouse.

95
00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:07.289 
based on frameworks and KPIs. The whole thing, as I said, works on the basis of predefined

96
00:09:07.289 --> 00:09:08.070 
frameworks.

97
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:15.279 
What you see here on the screen now that for example the Stakeholder Capitalism Framework of the World Economic Forum and what

98
00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:20.809 
you also see up here is that this really covers all dimensions of sustainability, i.e. governance, planet, people, and so on.

99
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.950 
and Prosperity.

100
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:29.399 
We're focusing on the Planet area today and you can see we're really reporting different KPIs, starting here.

101
00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:35.309 
with greenhouse gas emissions, you see here also directly the link to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.

102
00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:35.950 
Nations.

103
00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:42.750 
I'll scroll down a bit, but we didn't limit ourselves to greenhouse gases and here, for example, we also included water consumption

104
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.350 
or also land consumption.

105
00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:54.309 
So back to greenhouse gases, I get here exactly how my greenhouse gas emissions have changed, so from

106
00:09:54.309 --> 00:09:59.840 
my overall company, have developed in the last few years. So I see in 2020 they have been reduced compared to 2019.

107
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.029 
strongly lowered, whereas last year they then increased again a little bit. Of course, the whole thing always depends on the current

108
00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:12.429 
Coronalage in the context. If I look further to the right, I also see another breakdown of these issues,

109
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:18.789 
for example, on the far right I see my scope 1, so according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, my scope 1, the direct emissions

110
00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:26.820 
and these again divided according to the respective emission type, i.e. coal, oil and gas, which of course also just in view of

111
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.350 
the current world situation very valuable information for me.

112
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.029 
Since companies are not only interested in their scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, but also in particular the indirect scope 3

113
00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:42.559 
emissions, i.e. emissions along the entire value chain, are becoming more and more important and companies are especially

114
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.500 
ask: "How sustainable are my products?"

115
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.289 
And of course the consumers who buy these products are asking themselves the same question.

116
00:10:48.289 --> 00:10:54.519 
We have already mentioned it several times today, and in order to make this transparent, we have built another solution, and

117
00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:57.120 
namely the SAP product Footprint Management,

118
00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:05.730 
which you see here now. So, this is a solution to manage the footprints of my produce products along the complete

119
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.279 
life cycle can be measured.

120
00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.549 
So really "from cradle to grave".

121
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.340 
And how does the whole thing work?

122
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.200 
We are connecting to a SAP source system here,

123
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:21.679 
an ERP system such as SAP S/4HANA and then we connect, so we replicate business data to ourselves from these SAP

124
00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:27.820 
systems that are available in this system anyway, combine them with environmental data, the so-called emission factors,

125
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:34.669 
which can come for example from databases like Ecoinvent, but can also come directly from my lierferands. Based

126
00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:41.779 
I then calculate these footprints and exactly what the results look like and what granularity I would like to have.

127
00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:49.720 
demonstrate this to you now. I'm going into the Monitor Footprints app. In the first release of our solution, we focus on the purchased goods.

128
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.899 
The whole thing is a cloud solution, as I said, we are continuously releasing new features and functions, so in the next few weeks and

129
00:11:55.899 --> 00:11:59.950 
months we will be able to cover the other steps of the life cycle.

130
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:06.399 
So now you see here: Our company manufactures cookies, so you see here the products that we have purchased

131
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:13.419 
these are all raw materials, ingredients that we need for the production of our cookies and see here the granularity

132
00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:20.580 
so each line item represents a combination of product, in which plant that product is present, and in the particular month,

133
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.639 
so for example here the first line-item.

134
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:31.039 
"Sugar" in the CHN1920 plant, period February 22 and the calculated footprint, the Average

135
00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:41.460 
Footprint per unit here is 0.71 kilograms of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of the sugar, and Average because we are using the

136
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.779 
as a small average, so to speak.

137
00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:50.250 
Of course, you can also configure all this in the tool, which period you want here.

138
00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:57.960 
How can I now use these values to improve myself? To do this, we travel back in time a little and go

139
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:05.580 
to August 2021 and I now filter here to our plant WDF 1010, our main production plant and I see

140
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:13.480 
that in this month, in this plant, I had seven products and I now sort the footprints here in descending order and what I see in the footprints.

141
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:22.940 
now directly, is that our worst product by far, from an emission point of view, are the cocoa beans with 28.7

142
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.250 
kilograms, all other products have a single-digit footprint here.

143
00:13:27.429 --> 00:13:35.759 
So that's what it means for me with the cocoa beans, I want to take a look at them in detail now. So I'm going to go in here and

144
00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.159 
jump directly into the Calculation

145
00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:40.450 
Details of what we can do now, as you can see here,

146
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.490 
we can really go down to the supplier level.

147
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.669 
So we see that this month we have commodity-.

148
00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:52.809 
from three different suppliers from Indonesia, from Guatemala and from Ghana, and I see here to the right then

149
00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:57.250 
exactly the quantity that we bought, that we got delivered.

150
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:03.710 
from this supplier. I'll go into the details and if I look further to the right, I'll also see the corresponding

151
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:10.529 
Footprints: once the relative ones, so per unit, per kilogram, and then based on that the total footprint.

152
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:16.620 
If we compare these now, we see that our supplier from Guatemala has a very low footprint with 8

153
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:23.049 
kilograms, while our supplier from Indonesia has a fivefold higher footprint with 40 kilograms.

154
00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:29.220 
Unfortunately, compared to the amount we have purchased, we see that we have purchased exactly the wrong way round, so to speak.

155
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:35.679 
by far the most from Indonesia and the least from Guatemala. Because I noticed that in August

156
00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:41.690 
I called my colleagues from the purchasing department directly and together we developed strategies to reduce

157
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.750 
to source our cocoa beans more sustainably.

158
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.850 
And now let's jump into current month, previous month, February and see if that has paid off.

159
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.809 
Voila, you see it again here at the top.

160
00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:05.320 
So we have more than halved our emissions from 28.7 to 12.3 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of these cocoa beans.

161
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.360 
And I'm always big on details.

162
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:14.039 
Yes, as you see here now, exactly, why did we make it, because we just made it by far the most from Guatemale and

163
00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:15.850 
the least from Indonesia.

164
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:22.250 
And I'm going to jump up on the summary and we'll sort of calculate it, this average footprint always we're forming

165
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:29.799 
so now an average of these goods receipts, take the inventory from the previous month's stock, add up

166
00:15:29.809 --> 00:15:36.000 
the goods receipts, subtract from them the goods outflows, for example the materials we need for production

167
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.830 
or as you see below,

168
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:44.480 
we also have internal transfers to other plants here and based on that we then just calculate the

169
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:52.120 
footprint at the end of the period. As you can see, there is a lot of information in there, and of course we would like to give our customers the following

170
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:59.830 
the maximum possible transparency, which is why we also provide an interface to analytical applications such as

171
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.149 
for example the SAP Analytics Cloud, SAC.

172
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.720 
And here we also plan to have defined dashboards and that really then our data just comes in, so you see here

173
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:18.710 
the entire footprint of my goods receipts over time over the last two years. You can already see

174
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:25.659 
we always have spikes there. That's before Christmas and Easter, that's when most cookies are bought, so of course you have to

175
00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:33.480 
produce the most in the run-up, but we can see very nicely up here that in February 2022 compared to the previous year.

176
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.809 
we were able to reduce our emissions, our footprint almost by half.

177
00:16:38.909 --> 00:16:44.730 
If we look to the right, this is now again the relative footprint, so per kilogram, then we see here this

178
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.450 
Drop and when was that?

179
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.159 
That was here, see in August 2021.

180
00:16:50.169 --> 00:16:56.740 
So right where I started using this solution and identified our problems in the cocoa beans,

181
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.460 
and from September onwards with the quasi more sustainable purchasing and were able to reduce our footprints.

182
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.230 
I have, as I said, many more analytical options.

183
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.759 
I would like to very briefly demonstrate this heat map to you again.

184
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:17.150 
We have now mainly looked at the relative emissions, but of course the total emissions are also extremely high.

185
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.279 
are also extremely important, and I can see them in this heat map.

186
00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:26.809 
Broken down to my product categories and we see now here we have the cocoa beans, they have a high emission of the total emissions.

187
00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:27.390 
share,

188
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:35.809 
but the highest share with Absatnd has our category oils and fats and now of course once a level lower.

189
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:45.119 
I see now in this product category we have the products butter, coconut oil and palm oil and of these we have again

190
00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:53.539 
the butter has the highest emissions overall and I look briefly above at relatively again and there it becomes even clearer therefore

191
00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:57.180 
butter has the highest footprint.

192
00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:03.369 
Now of course it's a bit hard to source an animal product like butter more sustainably, but what I'm doing now

193
00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:10.279 
can do is, I can talk to my product designer to see if it's possible to make our recipe of our cookie so

194
00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:15.400 
that we replace the butter either completely or at least parts of it with coconut oil.

195
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.799 
Because we see it here the coconut oil has a much smaller footprint, and if we could do that we would

196
00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:24.259 
so we would also reduce the overall footprint of our cookie accordingly.

197
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:33.349 
And last but not least: We are not only addressing sustainability experts with our solutions, but in our opinion, is

198
00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:35.769 
sustainability is already so important and it is becoming more and more important,

199
00:18:35.769 --> 00:18:42.480 
that in the future it will really feed into all business decisions actually, just like turnover and cost

200
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.269 
nowadays.

201
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:51.289 
And that's why we're also pulling for an integration of our footprints back into the SAP solution and that's what I want to tell you now.

202
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.630 
to show you at the end.

203
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:59.880 
We are here in a SAP S/4HANA system and we have now here for example, so imagine I am now a buyer.

204
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.619 
in the company and use my Monitor Purchase Requisition Items app.

205
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:10.500 
So here I see all the purchase requisitions in the enterprise and I'm now filtering back to my plant 1010 and my

206
00:19:10.509 --> 00:19:17.769 
Cookie raw materials and I start down here with this tabular representation and here I see all the raw materials now,

207
00:19:17.769 --> 00:19:21.759 
so I've got sugar, butter, cocoa beans and so on.

208
00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:29.500 
I see here the quantity that was ordered, the respective price, the planned delivery date, I know all that.

209
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:35.069 
I have had this displayed for years in the SAP system, but now it is completely new and possible thanks to the integration,

210
00:19:35.069 --> 00:19:42.529 
On the far right is this column, the CO2 footprint, and I really see per line item, i.e. per purchase requisition, the respective CO2 footprint.

211
00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:43.420 
footprint.

212
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:49.109 
And as you can see, these are not only orders that have been delivered in the past, but here for example November

213
00:19:49.109 --> 00:19:51.910 
2022, so orders in the future.

214
00:19:52.019 --> 00:19:59.329 
So on the one hand, this gives me information about the future footprint, how this will develop, but I

215
00:19:59.329 --> 00:20:03.519 
can also try, for example, if I have an order here in November, possibly, I can still

216
00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:10.259 
and shift it to a more sustainable supplier in advance, so that I reduce these emissions in advance.

217
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:19.180 
And of course we also offer in-built analytics, for example I get in this chart at a glance, also

218
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:28.190 
my costs, this blue bar and compared to that also in orange my footprint and again I see yes

219
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:34.599 
the cocoa beans have a high footprint, but by far the highest of the total emissions, has like I mean butter, that's why

220
00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:37.349 
Reminder to me again: I have to do something about the butter.

221
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.930 
I hope this has now given you a first insight into our solution portfolio.

222
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.890 
As I said, these are cloud solutions that we are continuously developing.

223
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:51.059 
We are also offering more and more integration scenarios here in the coming weeks, months and thank you very much.

224
00:20:51.059 --> 00:21:00.140 
And back to you, thank you Niko, thank you very much.

225
00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:09.450 
yes, an impressive example of how the digital systems can also contribute to raising awareness for energy efficiency, for the

226
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:15.750 
exclusion of greenhouse gases, so an example of how digital systems can act as levers in the real world.

227
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:21.730 
In order for this lever to have maximum effect, however, the software should of course not consume so much energy on the other side.

228
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:29.640 
that this advantage turns into the opposite and therefore to the second half, to points two to four

229
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:36.829 
of the lecture, "How to keep this footprint as small as possible?" To do that, you have to get the application right

230
00:21:36.829 --> 00:21:39.319 
you have to build it sustainably and to do that you have to build it sustainably.

231
00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:45.740 
And especially with applications that are used a lot, you have quite a lot of leverage there, even over small improvements.

232
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.970 
to create a big improvement, a big saving, via the law of large numbers.

233
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.349 
Here on the right hand side is a rough rough calculation.

234
00:21:53.349 --> 00:21:58.509 
Let's say there's a transaction, a developer sits down and reduces the footprint,

235
00:21:58.509 --> 00:22:07.049 
the CPU usage of that transaction, by one second, so one CPU second less is used, that means approximately

236
00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:10.250 
ten watt seconds of energy saved.

237
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:17.880 
Now, if these transactions are accessed 1.5 million times, by 1.5 million users, each 20 times a day, then

238
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:23.170 
that adds up, for example, to the energy saving here of 19 megawatt hours, which is quite realistic.

239
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:23.430 
figures.

240
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:29.430 
SAP as a whole, for example, has 230 million cloud users across applications.

241
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.819 
It is not unrealistic that certain transactions are actually accessed that frequently.

242
00:22:33.829 --> 00:22:35.849 
Now that was a transaction.

243
00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:41.460 
If we imagine that we have 500 developers who improve ten transactions each, we come up with a total of

244
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:48.029 
the energy consumption of a small town with 50,000 inhabitants reduced by such sustainable development techniques.

245
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.690 
can be achieved.

246
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.009 
And how do you do that?

247
00:22:50.019 --> 00:22:54.470 
Actually starts with relatively simple basics and common sense.

248
00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:02.180 
A four-point catchphrase you can actually remember: "Do what is needed, do it once, do it right

249
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:11.009 
and to the point", translated: do only what is actually needed, do it only once with the best algorithm for the purpose

250
00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:12.809 
and only as accurately as needed,

251
00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:18.319 
we have already had the topic today that you also have to consider how many decimal places you need.

252
00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:20.539 
I actually need and with

253
00:23:20.539 --> 00:23:26.319 
this simple basic rule you can already do a lot of good, can of course only go one point further and also for the software

254
00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:35.589 
architecture, for the grand design of the software define what rules look like, can look like, what best practices actually look like

255
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:44.519 
can, and there you have to consider four aspects in principle or four things that you can balance against each other. The

256
00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:52.420 
are at least the ones that we've found to be the most common, one is the CPU consumption

257
00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:59.740 
for one. That's memory, that's network and then finally disk space.

258
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:06.460 
These four factors essentially determine how business applications work energy efficiently, and here we have for

259
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:11.700 
business applications that, in general, we can already say that shifting energy expenditure

260
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:19.940 
to memory has a positive effect on the overall balance in most cases, so in-memory things are called

261
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:27.049 
to be stored temporarily instead of being reloaded again and again from the hard disk, or that you just have to use intermediate memory.

262
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:33.670 
results instead of recalculating them over and over again. Here, for example, estimate with current server-

263
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:41.140 
hardware, a CPU second needs about a milliwatt hour while using a gigabyte of memory.

264
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:48.569 
consumes only 0.1 miniwatt hours, or a tenth of that. So it's worth using 1 gigabyte of memory here,

265
00:24:48.569 --> 00:24:56.579 
to avoid calculating the same results over and over again. The same applies to the network,

266
00:24:56.579 --> 00:25:03.160 
here, too, it is worthwhile to use network cashes instead of fetching the results over and over again via the network.

267
00:25:03.539 --> 00:25:06.869 
That would be the question: How do I build applications?

268
00:25:07.109 --> 00:25:07.660 
efficiently?

269
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:14.700 
The second point was: The progress in hardware technologies actually automatically gives me advantages.

270
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:23.390 
If you look here at the performance over the last years and decades, you can actually see that from a

271
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:29.660 
factor of 10, every seven years the computing power per watt actually doubles, which of course is the progress

272
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:37.220 
in processor technology, ever more powerful energy-efficient processors running on smaller and smaller computers.

273
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.349 
space.

274
00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:45.539 
Of course, this development already helps enormously on the way to energy efficiency, however, these benchmarks are often under

275
00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:48.920 
maximum workload, so how energy efficient

276
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.940 
does my system look when I have it under full load?

277
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:57.869 
This is something that is more artificial, less common in the real world.

278
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:04.109 
So what does it look like now, if you look at like all the applications that don't use the hardware to the max

279
00:26:04.109 --> 00:26:13.039 
here of course comes into play on the one hand how efficiently you can use the energy saving functions of hardware that for example

280
00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:20.630 
are frequency adaptation of the processor, efficient idle states, all of which must then of course also be appropriately used in the operating system.

281
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:26.660 
It's no use if only the hardware can do it and it's not implemented through the appropriate power governors.

282
00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:33.170 
With these points you can already achieve a lot, but special benchmarks are necessary here to determine

283
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.359 
what is the impact and what is the optimal load also for a server hardware?

284
00:26:38.369 --> 00:26:45.250 
And here we as SAP have the great advantage that we know relatively well what typical business workloads look like.

285
00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:53.000 
how is the usual server hardware used, for example, to run an ERP system?

286
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.980 
We have benchmarks for that, which we have been doing for a long time.

287
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.490 
Here you can also see a quite similar development.

288
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.509 
Is now again the maximum load here.

289
00:27:00.099 --> 00:27:06.619 
So that agrees fairly well with the artificial things, so gives some confidence in the results.

290
00:27:06.619 --> 00:27:13.579 
But we also have here as an additional feature that we see the energy demand as a function of the workload.

291
00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:18.730 
we see that drops off relatively quickly, at 100% utilisation,

292
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:26.660 
on the far right, of course, we have the highest relative utilisation of energy, it then drops off relatively quickly, but not to

293
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:26.900 
zero.

294
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:32.319 
And at some point the decrease is also less per

295
00:27:32.319 --> 00:27:35.799 
less utilisation and for the optimal throughput

296
00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:42.359 
it always stays at 15% for example even if I have no load at all in the system. For an optimal ratio

297
00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:50.039 
of throughput that I manage per watt, I should already be above 50% with the utilisation of the system.

298
00:27:50.049 --> 00:27:57.809 
Which is rarely the case in classical systems, so business systems in particular are very..,

299
00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:05.170 
the load is distributed over the working day, and at night, for example, the systems are used less, at the weekend

300
00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:12.579 
the systems tend to bob along with less load. That's not energy efficiency and that also brings you straight to the next thing.

301
00:28:12.579 --> 00:28:20.230 
aspect, the efficient use of digital systems in data centres. Because data centres actually allow you to have this optimal

302
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:27.769 
utilisation of resources, which is a natural sustainability benefit of the cloud, where I'm able to manage the workload

303
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:34.599 
of many companies, many organisations, and then distribute it to the hardware in a load-optimised way and thus achieve energy efficiency.

304
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.250 
can also process.

305
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:43.190 
To this end, I also benefit from advances in the power usage effectiveness of data centres, i.e. how much additional

306
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.160 
energy is

307
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.740 
away from the IT equipment is needed, for example for cooling, etc.?

308
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.410 
That's where the data centres are improving more and more.

309
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:57.680 
And if you also pay attention when choosing a cloud provider, we had the topic of transparency today, can

310
00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.869 
you can profit accordingly.

311
00:28:59.869 --> 00:29:05.799 
We as SAP, for example, have had the topic several times today, too, uses 100% renewable energy, of course, but is not

312
00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:11.609 
everything that has to be considered, and even if you as a company say no, I'm not in the cloud at the moment or no, I'm not in the cloud yet.

313
00:29:11.609 --> 00:29:19.569 
I don't use Software as a Service, you can just look at it when choosing a cloud provider, like

314
00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:26.259 
you plan the workload and also here a tool from SAP, which allows you to plan worklod, business worklod is

315
00:29:26.259 --> 00:29:36.569 
it's called Tool Landscape Management Cloud, which enables me to plan about the load of my business workload.

316
00:29:36.569 --> 00:29:37.400 
systems.

317
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.779 
Here's a screenshot of the tool, what we're looking at now,

318
00:29:39.779 --> 00:29:44.869 
a load profile was planned for the operation of several SAP systems and LaMa Cloud

319
00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:52.809 
shows here what the estimated energy saving can be for this profile, for this bundling of solutions.

320
00:29:52.809 --> 00:30:00.289 
on the same infrastructure, compared to running different servers side by side. SAP also has

321
00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:09.299 
other tools that we support so it's an open source example of scaling, of scaling infrastructure elastically.

322
00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:16.920 
The tool here is called Gardener, it's a tool to manage Kubernetes clusters, larger clusters of servers, which is

323
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:24.359 
automatic scaling up and down of the entire cluster, and also you can

324
00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:30.680 
to hibernate parts of the system at certain times in order to reduce energy consumption even further.

325
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.759 
significantly more.

326
00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:40.930 
So much for the four aspects I wanted to look at today, would like to conclude in the short summary of the lecture.

327
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:47.670 
We have seen that digital systems of course need energy, we should use this energy efficiently through

328
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:53.160 
three points in sustainable development. One is sustainable programming,

329
00:30:53.339 --> 00:31:01.380 
the best practices, which should also be taught, in the education of computer scientists, of developers, we should be

330
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:07.609 
advances in hardware technology and, in order to do this in the best possible way, we should also use the whole thing in data centres.

331
00:31:07.619 --> 00:31:15.450 
and the digital systems that are optimised in this way can then also offer a lever through corresponding

332
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:23.390 
solutions that a positive contribution to Climate Action is also achieved in the real world.

333
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.059 
And so you can actually combine well the digital systems with energy efficiency.

334
00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:34.640 
The whole thing becomes not a contradiction but actually a self-evident fact that with digital system you can combine energy efficiency

335
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.849 
can also be achieved.

336
00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:41.990 
Thank you very much for your attention, I know the last item that was before lunch, accordingly I would also like to

337
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:48.089 
continue to discuss during lunch, for example, at the front of the stand also of SAP. Thank you for your attention.

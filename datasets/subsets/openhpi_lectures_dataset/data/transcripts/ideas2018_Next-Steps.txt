00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.180 
We're very excited that you're with
us at the end of this course.

2
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.280 
In the last MOOC &amp;quot;Inspirations for
Design&amp;quot; we learned how to look

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.630 
around us to find inspirations for solving
problems and designing solutions.

4
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.990 
In this MOOC we made sense
of all these inspirations

5
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.830 
we found, came up with a
lot of ideas for them

6
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.250 
and started to select the
most valuable ones.

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.700 
The next steps are to build
and test your ideas

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.260 
as fast as possible. We want
to validate them quickly.

9
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.580 
This saves you time and money. But
this exciting step will be part

10
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.340 
of our next course.- Yeah, we plan
to publish the MOOC on this

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.110 
final step in next year and
we have to see you then!

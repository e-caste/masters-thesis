00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.279 
Welcome to our third video on the scientific principles and entrepreneurship

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.280 
research.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.159 
Thus far, we have explained the importance of conducting science in a commercial domain

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.596 
and to discuss how to find, read and understand entrepreneurship

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.659 
research as a multidisciplinary field.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.489 
In this video, you will learn about common research processes and designs

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.289 
in those fields. You may now be asking yourself, I am not a scientist

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.130 
and I do not plan to become one.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.779 
Why should I understand research design?

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.687 
Why do I need to understand the science of ownership?

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.639 
To understand entrepreneurship and practice?

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.649 
Here's why. First of all, to understand entrepreneurship

13
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.329 
and to be a better entrepreneur by yourself, knowing certain facts and theories will help

14
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.969 
you to better understand the foundations of entrepreneurial activities.

15
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.286 
Also, as we mentioned in the first video, if you understand the scientific

16
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.769 
approach, the same critical approach could support your everyday judgments

17
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.239 
and entrepreneurial decisions.

18
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.898 
Second, to read and evaluate research, when research

19
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.349 
addresses phenomena you are interested in, you may want to take advantage of that

20
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.120 
research. If you are able to read and interpret scientific research articles,

21
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.189 
you will not only get recent state of the art science insights, but you will also

22
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.049 
be able to evaluate second hand reports of research, for example, and magazines

23
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.050 
or blog posts.

24
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.239 
And third, to protect yourself from fake news.

25
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.283 
Unfortunately, science, non science, and common

26
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.279 
nonsense exist side by side, and it's not always easy to distinguish

27
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.959 
which information is helpful and which information may even be harmful.

28
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.189 
Understanding research designs will help you to protect yourself.

29
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.790 
There are certainly many more reasons to understand research designs.

30
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.069 
However, we hope that we have already convinced you.

31
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.499 
So let's dive in.

32
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.659 
A typical empirical research process consists of five steps.

33
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.849 
First, you develop a research idea and motivation to research

34
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.589 
this topic. The idea could, for example, originate in a problem of phenomenon

35
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.949 
that you observe or in the literature gap that you discover.

36
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.359 
Second, you develop your research strategy, in this way actually mainly

37
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.849 
involves how you design your study, the setting and the population.

38
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.492 
We will discuss this and more depths in a second.

39
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.069 
Next, you retrieve the data that you need to answer your research

40
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.469 
question. Once the data retrieval is completed, you arrive at your

41
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.669 
4th step. You have to analyze the data, including quality, reliability

42
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.169 
and validity checks.

43
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.520 
If data is quantitative, you often conduct statistical tests.

44
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.949 
Finally, and the fifth step, your report, your findings, which means you try

45
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.330 
to write it down so that your target audience can take advantage of them.

46
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.650 
So let's take a more in-depth look at the research designs.

47
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.930 
Empirical research paradigms can generally be distinguished into qualitative,

48
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.349 
quantitative and mixed methods approaches.

49
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.734 
Empirical quantitative approaches are typically used to conduct confirmatory

50
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.389 
research to determine if the theory explains or predicts phenomena of interest.

51
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.700 
For example, when you want to find out to what degree one factor, such

52
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.539 
as motivation, is influencing another factor, such as entrepreneurial

53
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.099 
activity. Empirical qualitative approaches, on the other hand,

54
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.301 
are often associated with exploratory research when the phenomenon one wants to

55
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.659 
study is not yet very well understood.

56
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.509 
For example, when you first need to find out whether a possible relationship between

57
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.019 
motivation and entrepreneurial activity even exists at all, qualitative

58
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.559 
research is based on the assumption that social phenomenon are complex and cannot

59
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.689 
be reduced to isolated variables.

60
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.820 
And of course, also quantitative data can be used for exploration,

61
00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.120 
which actually is a common practice in data science.

62
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.899 
In a mixed methods research approach, researchers collect and analyze both

63
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.319 
quantitative and qualitative data within the same work.

64
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.019 
Generally, it is essential to note here that neither quantitative nor

65
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.810 
qualitative studies are superior to the other.

66
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.930 
Instead, it is about choosing the right approach for the research question.

67
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.181 
That is, to create the so-called theory-method fit.

68
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.570 
Let us make that a little bit more concrete for common research designs of

69
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.349 
entrepreneurship research. Empirical quantitative research involves,

70
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.179 
for example, survey based studies but also data science methods and

71
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.890 
experimental studies.

72
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.588 
Empirical qualitative research involves, for example, case-based studies,

73
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.359 
theory or actual research.

74
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.549 
Apart from those empirical approaches, you will also frequently find conceptual

75
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.319 
works in entrepreneurship research, for example, a systematic literature review

76
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
or theory development frameworks.

77
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.890 
Lastly, we have the mixed methods studies.

78
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.562 
For example, a sequential explanatory design that implies collecting

79
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.799 
and analyzing quantitative and then qualitative data

80
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.310 
in two consecutive phases in one research endeavor.

81
00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:45.509 
Let's take another look at the research process.

82
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.687 
Imagine you have successfully completed all five process steps, including

83
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.079 
the reporting. That means you now hold a scientific manuscript in your hands.

84
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.889 
What's next? What do you have to do to get it published?

85
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.249 
Well, this is sort of out of your hands now.

86
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.260 
Academic journals are typically peer reviewed, meaning that your work is

87
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.869 
reviewed by other scholars, your peers.

88
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.759 
They will assess your manuscript prior to publication to ensure it meets the journal

89
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.379 
standards. This is how you enter this so-called peer review process.

90
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.920 
And to put it briefly, the process goes as follows.

91
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.289 
First, the Journal's editorial office checks whether the paper's composition

92
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.308 
meets the journals offer guidelines, for example, the required sections and formal

93
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.350 
requirements. Further, the editor of the Journal that is the editor in chief

94
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.940 
checks whether the manuscript is sufficiently original and interesting.

95
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.286 
If the paper fulfills these criteria and it will be sent to experts within

96
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.279 
the fields who conduct a review and send their recommendation to the journal.

97
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.439 
They usually have three options. First, in the best case they recommend accepting

98
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.724 
the paper. Otherwise, They recommend rejecting it either

99
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.699 
with a request for revision, which means that you remain in the peer review process

100
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.999 
and get the chance to resubmit an improved version.

101
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.279 
Or when they are not convinced of the paper's potential, it will be rejected without

102
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.779 
an invitation to revise it.

103
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.756 
This means that the peer review process for the Journal and manuscript ends at

104
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.279 
that point, however, you will usually receive some constructive feedback

105
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.350 
that should help you to improve the manuscript.

106
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.709 
And of course, you can decide on submiting it to another journal.

107
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.540 
As soon as a paper then gets accepted, the Journal sends the manuscript to

108
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.470 
copy editing and production, after which it will be published.

109
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.540 
For scientists, this is the very moment to celebrate.

110
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.694 
You now are standing, in fact, on the shoulders of giants, and the following discourse

111
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.779 
can draw from you research.

112
00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:58.125 
Before we come to an end of the session on scientific principles, and after you have

113
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.582 
heard about the research designs and the peer review process, we want to answer one more

114
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.709 
question that may have been unanswered.

115
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.340 
This is what makes for good research design and what are the

116
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.410 
reviewers actually assessing.

117
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.109 
Next to many more important quality criteria, rigor and relevance

118
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.130 
are the two dimensions that come into play when valuers have to decide

119
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.980 
whether to accept your manuscript or not.

120
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.169 
Rigor, on the one hand, implies that scholars are committed

121
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.879 
to developing and applying best practices for designing, conducting and

122
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.739 
reporting scientific studies to enable faster knowledge accumulation.

123
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.157 
However, in entrepreneurship research, we often study uncertain

124
00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.429 
and diverse research objects.

125
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.220 
For example, when we study new venture activity, reliable data for new

126
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.059 
ventures often not available.

127
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.309 
Therefore, many researchers agree that it is difficult to have a perfectly

128
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.790 
rigorous study design.

129
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.486 
Consequently, one of the most critical task for entrepreneurship

130
00:09:03.768 --> 00:09:08.409 
researchers is to carefully consider whether research design matches

131
00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.330 
the research question. This way, they can anticipate and eliminate

132
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.450 
threats to the study's validity in an effective way.

133
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.879 
The second term, then is relevance and implies the scientific

134
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.219 
and practical usefulness of a study.

135
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.870 
Relevant is not, as one might think, at the opposing end of rigor.

136
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.609 
Instead, rigor and relevance can be synthesized by asking research

137
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.139 
questions that matter and then search for the answer to this research question

138
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.620 
by designing and executing a rigorous research design.

139
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.560 
OK, so that was it for our session on scientific principles and entrepreneurship

140
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.669 
research. We hope that you enjoyed it and learned something that

141
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.169 
you can apply it, be it for your own entrepreneurial activities, be

142
00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.789 
it to assess someone else's research, or maybe we could even motivate you to conduct

143
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.790 
your own research,

144
00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:07.389 
Whatever it is, we are looking forward to discussing with you in a forum and to see

145
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.481 
you in our next session. Bye.

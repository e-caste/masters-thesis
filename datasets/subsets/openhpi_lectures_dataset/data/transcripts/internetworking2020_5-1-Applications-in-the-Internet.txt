00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.760 
Welcome to the fifth week of our OpenHPI
course a half-century of internet,

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.890 
how it works today and this
week we want to speak about

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.090 
the applications that make
use of the internet.

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.640 
There is a huge amount of such
application which changed our life,

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.190 
we changed how we communicate, how we
work, how we shop, how we do business,

6
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.670 
so the growth of the
internet was driven by

7
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.550 
more and more applications
that are available.

8
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.200 
over the internet. It starts
the development of the

9
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.400 
internet in 1969, you remember
the first four computers were

10
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.540 
connected to interconnected
on the internet.

11
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.450 
Then a few years later, in 1971,
the first email was sent,

12
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.860 
so email was the first killer
application of the internet, then 81

13
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.010 
first personal computers came
to the market, it was a huge,

14
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.020 
provided by IBM and the personal computer
made it possible that computers came

15
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.410 
in the homes, that computer came
to the offices, so that many

16
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.960 
people have very simple access to a
computer and a wireless computer

17
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.650 
to the internet on the various
applications that are provided there.

18
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.070 
Then in germany '83 the
first email was sent, '89

19
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.830 
was a very important year in the
development of the internet

20
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.980 
because the world wide web
was designed for standards

21
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.440 
were developed and published
and in the internet.

22
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.330 
The world wide web makes the internet
so famous that some people

23
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.630 
speak about the web when
they mean the internet.

24
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.250 
This comes from the case that
there was a browser available

25
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.950 
in 1903, the first browser with
a graphical user interface,

26
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.840 
what we know today you can go
with the mouse to point in a

27
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.610 
certain point and then click and then
the resource behind it's requested

28
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.200 
and delivered over the internet to
be a scene and to be displayed

29
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.690 
on the desktop. So this makes
it easy to use the internet

30
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.020 
and the internet applications,
also for non-specialists.

31
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.680 
Then 1980, another important date
when google starts to work,

32
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.800 
this was based on a search machine
project of the university of Stanford

33
00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.550 
and then it became commercialized and
today it's one of the most important

34
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.110 
a services and most used services on the
internet. Another important date is Wikipedia,

35
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.800 
wikipedia starts
2003, and facebook

36
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.990 
began its work in 2005.

37
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.970 
We speak about the
web too because

38
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.270 
the user of
the internet

39
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.360 
get in a new role, he not only
could use the internet, he also

40
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.350 
could easily, very easily
contribute content.

41
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.670 
So in this way
the people

42
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.280 
use the web in a new way, not
only as a user of information

43
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.440 
but also as a provider
of information. 2014

44
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.350 
another change came because
more and more multimedia data

45
00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.220 
were transported over the internet, video
and music streaming became a popular

46
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.060 
in and out of things
starts around 2015,

47
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.190 
and each of these new application areas
pushed the growth of the internet.

48
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.730 
If we look only for one example
that is how we shop today,

49
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.920 
thanks to the internet

50
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.740 
the traditional opening times do
not play a role anymore, you

51
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.120 
can buy things
around the clock,

52
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.480 
the fastest connection
to reach a shop

53
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.880 
is no more needed to find out, you can
access the shop via the internet.

54
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.760 
For this online shopping, you can
see the catalogue, you can see

55
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.470 
the things which are provided
in the shop, whether it's our

56
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.370 
shoes or other things, you can
do this together with others.

57
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.810 
So you can immediately show your partner
is the right way you can sit together

58
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.790 
in front of the computer to make a
selection and to buy something,

59
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.590 
the payment becomes very easy you
can do this with credit card

60
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.330 
over the internet, you can do this with
smartphones, there are different possibilities

61
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.130 
and you also can compare the goods
and the prices of the shops.

62
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.280 
There are meanwhile portals that help
you a in this price comparison,

63
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.690 
all things became cheaper,
it's easier to access.

64
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:46.040 
There is some topics around
because now one can see

65
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.280 
if you are moving through the
internet, one can track you, but

66
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.260 
you can also track delivery if
the good is sent to you by post

67
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.270 
by a packet service, so it's
exactly to see which plays this

68
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.390 
good is in this moment and then
you can afterwards discuss

69
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.090 
with others about the goods, you can
show your new shoes or others.

70
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.510 
So is the internet is nothing
without such kind of applications?

71
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.060 
So until now in our cause the
first 4 weeks we mainly speak

72
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.550 
about the technical
basis of the internet,

73
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.130 
but now we have to discuss and look
a little bit more into the detail.

74
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.720 
How this huge amount of applications
can make use of the internet,

75
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.870 
here are only a few of the
various internet applications.

76
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.050 
We discuss email search engines, online
bank and trading entertainment,

77
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.320 
online shopping, digital learning,
navigation and monitoring,

78
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:06.540 
control and other things and all
these applications need protocols.

79
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.360 
In the TCP IP protocol stack to be
able to make use of the internet.

80
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.570 
So what we do in this week to
speak about this applications,

81
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.410 
and about the protocols that make it
possible. That with this application

82
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.190 
you can communicate
via the internet

83
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:36.800 
and you remember that we saw the
protocols or the internet protocols,

84
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.390 
which are needed to organize the
communication which provide

85
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.110 
altogether a kind of operating
system for the internet.

86
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:51.000 
as they are placed on different layers
we have seen a TCP IP protocol stack,

87
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.400 
we already discussed
a link-layer and

88
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.660 
the protocols on the transport layer and this
week we will consider here the applications

89
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.240 
which are placed on the
application layer.

90
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.300 
So I hope you have fun and get
a better understanding of how

91
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:18.300 
the various applications are able
to make use of the internet

92
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.130 
communication
possibilities.

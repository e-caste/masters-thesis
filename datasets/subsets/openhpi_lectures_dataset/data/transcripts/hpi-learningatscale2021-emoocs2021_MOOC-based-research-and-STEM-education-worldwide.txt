00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810 
hello everyone. welcome to the first

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.270 
paper session of the international track for the day.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.270 
we have a three planting total today.

4
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.140 
so we hope to see you in our follow up sessions.

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.690 
this session is titled move based research
and stem education worldwide

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.500 
and our agenda for the day includes
two papers and one a lightning talk.

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.830 
so we're going to be starting with the two papers.

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.140 
we've been given a lot of time to cover
these are two papers and lightning talks.

9
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.480 
so we're going to be flexible, when it comes

10
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.190 
to the durations you can expect the paper presentations to

11
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.310 
be about ten minutes long,

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.790 
the lightning talks to be about fifteen.

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.360 
and we'll have

14
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.430 
a session of questions and answers after
each of the papers

15
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.010 
and the big lightning talk.

16
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.670 
and towards the end of the session,

17
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.410 
we'll invite our presenters, our speakers for the session

18
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.370 
to together have a discussion and an extra Q and A.

19
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.000 
so there will be two opportunities to ask questions

20
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.120 
to our various speakers throughout the session.

21
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.320 
and on that note, i think we can start with
the very first paper

22
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.620 
which is titled long term effects
of short term intervention

23
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.280 
using MOOCs for developing cambodian undergraduate research skills.

24
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.710 
and the paper is going to be presented by May Christine johnson karlan

25
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.710 
from tokyo tech. May over to you.

26
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.000 
thank you I know. so hello everyone,
let me share my screen with you.

27
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.580 
again hello everyone as monroe said
i am me a doctoral student

28
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.710 
from tokyo institute of technology.
and today i will be sharing with you overwork

29
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.430 
filled long term effects of short term
intervention using MOOCs

30
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.530 
for developing cambodian under-graduate research skills.

31
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.780 
so together with me in this brick is
chee would sang who led

32
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.080 
this work he was a former dean at the faculty
of science and technology at

33
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.230 
the national university of backbone in cambodia.
and he graduated from the phd last march.

34
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.900 
another co-author is john maurice good.

35
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.030 
he saw that you're teaching english
for academic purposes at the

36
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.360 
university of field blue school of engineering.

37
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.410 
and all three of us conduct our doctoral research
under the supervision of professor geoffrey cross

38
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.410 
who is also the general manager of
architects' on-line application development office.

39
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.960 
so first let us take a look at japan's

40
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.230 
relationship with southeast asia and cambodia in particular.

41
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.870 
so maybe we're all familiar,
japan is one of the leading economic powers in asia,

42
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.730 
however this leadership can be threatened
by several factors and one

43
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.450 
of which is population decline,
and on the other hand south-east

44
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.610 
asia is one of the fastest growing economic regions in the

45
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.250 
world and in 2017 seven percent of
global exports came from southeast asia.

46
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.810 
so it is the fourth largest exporting region in the world.

47
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.590 
so there's so much potential in that region.

48
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.570 
and cambodia is one of these southeast asian countries.

49
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.590 
and just like its neighbours,
cambodia has a very young population

50
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.270 
which advanced and aging nations like japan

51
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.330 
can take advantage of for continuous economic growth.

52
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.180 
and as a matter of fact, japan is
actively investing in south east asia.

53
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.280 
and the demandes of south east asia
that it has extended from

54
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.870 
low skilled jobs. and now they are trying to

55
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.940 
encourage high school, high skill jobs as well.

56
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.640 
and cambodia is aware of its potential economic growth and

57
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.750 
has made several special economic zones
not just within its capital,

58
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.100 
but also in the provinces near their borders.

59
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.780 
and to supply the emerging high school
demand in the provinces,

60
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.870 
higher education institutions that
provide high school training should be empowered.

61
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.190 
however modern cambodian higher education
is just getting started.

62
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.170 
so if you may be aware, it had this

63
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.740 
historical event called the summer rouge
in the seventy 's.

64
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.070 
so much of what we see in cambodia now are
just a few decades old.

65
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.020 
and because of this much of higher education
development resources is concentrated in the capital.

66
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.130 
and we must find a low cost way to improve

67
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.920 
higher education in the provinces where the economic zones are.

68
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.760 
and we think that the key to high skills development is research

69
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.590 
self-efficacy and information literacy self-efficacy.

70
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.520 
and that is because of course research or any kind of investigation

71
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.130 
intended to uncover interesting phenomena or generate new knowledge

72
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.170 
or understanding is important for high skills development.

73
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.280 
and to develop research skills,
one must have information literacy

74
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.380 
or the set of integrated abilities
and compassion the reflective discovery of knowledge

75
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.170 
information and understanding
how it is produced and valued

76
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.190 
and how to use it for ethical
use in different learning communities.

77
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.750 
however research skills and information literacy can

78
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.980 
take a really long time to develop.

79
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.830 
and we may then instead target to
give provincial students something to start with,

80
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.490 
so not really up there something to begin with.

81
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.670 
and self-efficacy is an individual's
belief in their capacity

82
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.980 
to execute behaviors necessary
to produce specific performance assess attainments.

83
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.100 
and research has shown that having self-efficacy
is because they alone

84
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.610 
can give an individual the courage to hone their skills.

85
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.340 
and with that we want to target the research self-efficacy
and information literacy self-efficacy

86
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.720 
of under-graduate students
in public provincial universities in cambodia.

87
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.290 
so they have something to start withï¼Œ
should they decide they

88
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.830 
want to pursue high skilled jobs in the future.

89
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.120 
and to understand where our target students
are at that point.

90
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.350 
we conducted a cross-sectional
study in march two thousand eighteen

91
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.080 
may asked by asking select third year
and fourth year undergraduate students

92
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.830 
from three of the six public provincial universities
in cambodia to answer

93
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.390 
the self assessments research self-advocacy survey

94
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.350 
and information literacy self-efficacy skills survey.

95
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.590 
and these questions are five-point likert
scales with one being the lowest right.

96
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.770 
and a cross-sectional study which we will later on refer
to as the pre-test

97
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.610 
revealed that the respondents had
low research self-efficacy.

98
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.190 
and information literacy self-efficacy.

99
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.640 
and from this study we learned
that under-graduate students

100
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.980 
from cambodia and provincial youth

101
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.860 
from component provincial public universities rate
themselves really low especially

102
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.520 
in terms of quantitative and computer skills
and their ability

103
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.050 
to write research papers.

104
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.420 
actually recently provincial universities had
been receiving

105
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:36.420 
support from organizations such as world bank,
and the japan international cooperation agency,

106
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.520 
however there is always a pressure to
demonstrate positive results asap.

107
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.470 
so within relatively shorter time frames,
so in consideration

108
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.450 
of these constraints we decided to
have a short term training intervention.

109
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.310 
and the short term training intervention is
aimed at addressing

110
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.950 
the lowest points based on the surveys administered
during the pre-test.

111
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.220 
we learned that the students are least confident for their

112
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.530 
quantitative skills and their research writing skills.

113
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.710 
primarily due to difficulty in managing references
and as such we conducted

114
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.920 
training using spss and mandali which are
made available to

115
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.620 
the students through their universities.

116
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.210 
and however using spss and mandali alone
will not make the

117
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.560 
students better researchers. they have to find a way to

118
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.080 
supplement the knowledge that they need.
and to address this concern,

119
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.850 
we added training on how to use the platform index,

120
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.650 
so that they can choose later for themselves
to learn whatever they

121
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.870 
need on their own. and the entire intervention
lasted for 60

122
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.120 
hours divided across fifteen days.

123
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.130 
and the short term training intervention
was conducted in August

124
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.960 
and September 2018 in the same universities where

125
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.720 
the pre-test was administered.
and the students were once again

126
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.240 
requested to answer the same set of
questionnaires after the training

127
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.040 
which we are now going to refer to as the post-test.

128
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.890 
and the self-efficacy is increased
significantly in the posters when

129
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:11.190 
compared with the pre-test.
and this improvements also had large effects sizes.

130
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.160 
and what is most appreciable is that during
the post this no

131
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.180 
student answered the lowest possible
rating on any of the questions given.

132
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.900 
so this means that the students develop some form of
confidence that they can

133
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.750 
have every self-efficacy aspect asked for in the survey.

134
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.340 
so they now have some certain baseline confidence levels.

135
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.810 
so of course while the post-test results are nice,

136
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.940 
it is not something that we can be
complacent amount of course,

137
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.850 
when people receive dreamy.
it is not hard to imagine that those people

138
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.210 
will gain some confidence in their skills
because they learned something new.

139
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.990 
so we decided to follow up with the students
again sixteen months,

140
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.710 
after they have taken the training.
and the same set of questionnaires

141
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.430 
were given and we can see from here that
fell the student scores

142
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.010 
during the follow up is still higher during the preface.

143
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.260 
there was some degree when compared to the posters.

144
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.730 
and a such to sustain the positive effects of
the short term training intervention

145
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.830 
other actions are still needed.

146
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.530 
and there is so much we could have done for this research.

147
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.240 
so for one there were some qualitative aspects to it.

148
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.100 
and the lead author actually discussed them in the dissertation,

149
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.230 
but we recognise there are still more details that we need

150
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.680 
to include identify specific trainings that the students will need.

151
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.480 
also the study was confined to self-efficacys and we were

152
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.390 
not able to probe if the training translated to actual improvements

153
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.070 
in terms of research skills.

154
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.400 
aside from using survey results,
we could have also made more investigation to understand.

155
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.820 
how demands for high school resources have change.

156
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.120 
and we also had questionnaires about research intention.

157
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.110 
so that's another thing if you already have the skill well
you have the intention to do that.

158
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.490 
we were not yet able to analyse that and finally most literature

159
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.360 
indicate that cambodian faculty members themselves also have

160
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.980 
the same lacking self-efficacy,
so faculty training should also be considered.

161
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.010 
and thank you for listening. that's it for this paper and the

162
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:26.610 
daughter was supported by jega and if you have any
questions about class.

163
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.700 
thank you. so as may said

164
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.720 
now is the time for questions.

165
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.570 
we're a small enough group that i think we can just ask them live.

166
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.930 
but if you prefer to write them in the chat,

167
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.560 
i can relay them for you.

168
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.640 
feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question or raise your

169
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.770 
hand, and we'll unmute you.

170
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.120 
as a question.

171
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.790 
man well, could i ask something ?

172
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.010 
go ahead. i just wondered, if i may thank you so much for that
presentation.

173
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.080 
i really really enjoyed it, because we have a little

174
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.870 
extra time this morning could you spend two minutes on

175
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.650 
a little bit more explanation about the actual skills training

176
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.560 
that you gave in your program?

177
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.340 
okay, where was it.

178
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.450 
i forgot to put titles on my slides.

179
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:43.380 
so it was actually made up of fifty,
so remember we have three different universities

180
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.060 
and each university we had fifteen days,

181
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.710 
and then on those days i think the morning sessions about 4 hours

182
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:58.240 
were dedicated for training.
so you could see here in the picture,

183
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:04.640 
so this is my lab mate,
so he is the one personally conducting the training.

184
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.770 
so it was like he would be discussing something short.

185
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:16.390 
and the students were would be working on the

186
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.350 
discussion he made immediately using the software that were

187
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.170 
provided to the student. so it's pretty much very practical.

188
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.490 
thank you, thank you, thank you.

189
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.750 
I believe Jose has a question,

190
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.070 
yes, thank you for the presentation May. i was wondering if you

191
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.210 
could elaborate on why you select this intervention,

192
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.010 
for example why did you implemented this in a more kinetics instead of

193
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.040 
an open alec's instance or whatever other

194
00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:01.320 
management system and so on. can you and also what about the

195
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.760 
design, did you decide about this design for some specific reasons

196
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.390 
about the design of the intervention?

197
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:16.690 
to be frank, we the literature researcher already had some ideas

198
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.440 
on what could have been the problems that the students are encountering,

199
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.640 
but more specifically  during the brief this.

200
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:36.880 
so his hunches were kind of proven,

201
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:42.540 
so he was actually able to get some specific questions

202
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.870 
that the students said that they are not confident with.

203
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.810 
and that is how we decided which specific skills that will be used

204
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.470 
in the choice of software. i'm sorry, it's not so  exciting.

205
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.720 
these are just what is available to them, so that is what we use.

206
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:05.610 
for our side so tokyo tech is actually using an x for our MOOC.

207
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.040 
so it is also the convenient choice,

208
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.130 
but I believe the research

209
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:16.590 
told the students that these are just sample cases.

210
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.790 
so the basics behind it they can use it whatever

211
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.030 
the software they are using.

212
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:26.900 
thank you.

213
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.340 
does anyone else want to ask a question.

214
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.060 
i'd be happy to ask the question if time allows. go ahead.

215
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.320 
can you say something about day.

216
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.290 
well i'm sorry first thank you for the presentation which is

217
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.050 
really interesting.

218
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.260 
can you say something about the outcomes of the intern intervention

219
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.950 
in terms of the different

220
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.610 
higher education institutions

221
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:08.290 
in terms of differences between them?
and the way it was accepted in each one

222
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:13.300 
something about what you thought in the in the results in

223
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.260 
analyzing the results ?

224
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.700 
after there are a lot of research that have been done

225
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.920 
that is similar to these on the city based universities in cambodia.

226
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:35.880 
and generally in cambodia the problem is quite persistent,

227
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.680 
like not a lot of universities do not have the infrastructure ready

228
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.190 
for research, and likewise

229
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.280 
they also don't have the faculty that are trained to do research.

230
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.960 
so it's hard for them to teach the students.

231
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:56.990 
and i think even  the minor details that we kind of take for

232
00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.690 
granted like journal subscriptions,
they are very constricted with those.

233
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:10.950 
and those before this research was done, nothing
was investigated related

234
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.980 
to the provincial university.
so we started out trying to understand if

235
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:20.770 
the same problems are present there.
of course, we kind of expected that it

236
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.140 
just wanted to know what is the gravity and from our

237
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:31.720 
previous it looks like.
there is really a strong need for improvement and

238
00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:38.260 
well the researchers dissertation,

239
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.590 
he also elaborated on the other needs,
so that the students could make

240
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.490 
use of the self-efficacy that they are supposed to develop during
the training.

241
00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.580 
because yeah  it was a little bit

242
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.880 
hard for us to see, if the training actually translated the skills,

243
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.750 
because it is very likely that after the training was conducted the

244
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.180 
students were not able to make use of the training afterwards.

245
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.150 
so our best indication is just their feelings sixteen months,

246
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:17.170 
after we feel that sixteen months is long enough to kind of

247
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.380 
reduce the feeling of confidence as if there is no real effects.

248
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.380 
thank you, thank you, thank you too.

249
00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.020 
and on that note i think we'll move to the next paper

250
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:40.780 
was also going to be presented by May, since she's joining from japan.

251
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.720 
we tried to schedule both at a convenient time.

252
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.450 
and the next paper is called investigating
mechanical engineering learners' satisfaction

253
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.030 
with the revised monitor on a monozukuri MOOC.

254
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.960 
and once again is going to be presented by May christine

255
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.500 
johnson cameron from tokyo tech.

256
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.380 
yeah, so let me share my screen.

257
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.840 
okay so hello again everyone, to those who just arrived there are.

258
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.120 
i am may, a doctor of tokyo technology.

259
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.360 
and this time i will be presenting a work from

260
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:32.810 
a different group of people plus me and professor Cross.

261
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:36.780 
and it is as manuel mentioned that the mechanical engineering learner's

262
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.570 
satisfaction with the device monozukuri MOOC.
and this work was made with the Tokyo Tech

263
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.210 
effects on the patient development office.

264
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.290 
so in 2018 tokio tech released a MOOC

265
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.570 
monzukuri on epic. so this is the alternate

266
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:58.040 
english spelling which we revised in 2020.

267
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.870 
and in this presentation i will be walking you
through the revision process.

268
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:07.050 
so before anything else let me show you the about video for

269
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.500 
the revised municipal records to give you an idea of
what the monozukuri is about.

270
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.750 
but i think the ballad is.

271
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.350 
there's no sound, okay.

272
00:20:36.320 --> 00:21:10.350 
thank you. let me reshare them.

273
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.390 
the word does not only refer to the production.

274
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.010 
and monozukuri it's a japanese wars concept
which literally means making things.

275
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.840 
and it has been used for nearly one thousand and five hundred years.

276
00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.190 
the word does not only refer to the production
and processes used during manufacturing,

277
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.830 
but also the spirit of making an item extremely well.

278
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.580 
so actually it is a philosophy that has a unique meaning different

279
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.940 
from literally fabrication in english.

280
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.750 
tokyo institute of technology has been actively using this

281
00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.530 
concept in its education on making things since its opening

282
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.690 
over one hundred and thirty years ago.

283
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.910 
In this mooc you learn about making things and the spirit of Monozukuri.

284
00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.760 
you will learn knowledge related to mechanical engineering

285
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.540 
by crafting a wooden steamboat.

286
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:27.030 
it involves engineering knowledge covering thermo dynamics,

287
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.560 
fluid dynamics and dynamics of machinery.

288
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.580 
sorry, but basically it will tell you please join our course.

289
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:41.940 
oh yeah, that's an overview of what monozukuri.

290
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.460 
and  monozukuri comes from the japanese words mono which means things.

291
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.900 
and zukuri which means making. so literally it means making things.

292
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:55.990 
and that is why it is typically translated
to english as craftsmanship.

293
00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.260 
but from the japanese perspective monozukuri is more about

294
00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.120 
the repetitive process of creating,
analyzing introducing improvements to one's craft.

295
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.830 
so it is basically the plan to check up that most of us are

296
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:14.430 
familiar with, or the japanese concept of kaizen
or continuous improvement.

297
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.330 
and it is also the understanding of dual monism or the idea

298
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.590 
of yin and yang where objects work because they have the existence

299
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.870 
of a forcing forces called yin and yang, similar to how humans

300
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.840 
work. so we also have over negative and positive sides.

301
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.620 
and thus a deep understanding of monozukuri can also help develop

302
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:42.720 
a deeper understanding of one's own values and actually
toyota popularized the saying

303
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.940 
mono zukuri,  hito zukuri which means making things is making people.

304
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:53.480 
so essentially monzukuri is character building through craftsmanship.

305
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.810 
and character building through creation is central to tokyo

306
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.590 
tec education and from bachelor's to doctoral degrees.

307
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:06.390 
tokyo tech does not only cover specialized education
based on the student course meters,

308
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.050 
but also emphasizes that students should always be mindful

309
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:14.700 
of their intended careers. and roles
in their society through career development and

310
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.330 
liberal arts education. and because of that monozukuri mooc

311
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.610 
is very apt to introduce dacca tech to the rest of the world.

312
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.350 
and in two thousand eighteen we released a four week
course on monozukuri

313
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.840 
one week for principal design make and improvement.

314
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.370 
and every week is made up of four sections.
the first section discusses

315
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.840 
the science and engineering aspects of pop-pop,

316
00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.240 
both which is thought by steam engine both.
and this is followed by a workshop

317
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.510 
where the concepts in the lectures were demonstrate.

318
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.750 
then a special lecture on the philosophy of monozukuri

319
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.790 
is presented and at the end of the week

320
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.310 
learners can watch videos about people  who are actually involved

321
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.250 
in one or monozukuri.

322
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.490 
and while there are learners who enjoy the course.

323
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.770 
we deduce from the learner feedback on course service that

324
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.710 
it was hard to keep focus on the horse.
and the boat making project for

325
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.670 
some students took too long to finish. and the philosophy lesson

326
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.450 
sounded a little bit too sentimental at some point.

327
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.480 
and several learners screamed for more real life.
and really the bull examples on the monozukuri

328
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.930 
and these are feedback that
we all thought took him to heart during the monozukuri

329
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:32.120 
revision. and while the original course was created by japanese tokyo

330
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.950 
students and faculty. most of the original members were no longer

331
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.160 
available during revision. and instead the revision team is

332
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.580 
made up of members from different countries. and being foreigners

333
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.630 
who have experienced japanese academia and industries through

334
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.620 
our part time jobs and internships. we have some level of awareness

335
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.570 
on what makes japan's work values interesting from those outside

336
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.610 
japan. and some similar to these also with our own cultures.

337
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.550 
and based on the original course materials the previous learners'

338
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.760 
feedback and our personal experiences.
and also frequent consultations with japanese staff.

339
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.460 
we created the revised course that is still made up of four

340
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.300 
weeks and each theme highlights a specific monozukuri

341
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.490 
theme. and week one is titled monozukuri philosophy which is deeply

342
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.810 
rooted in the special lectures from the regional course.

343
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.880 
and here we emphasize the teaching on yin and yang. and the importance

344
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.030 
of persistence to overcome the learning curves and build expert b.

345
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.650 
so we needed to emphasize that

346
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.680 
expertise takes time.

347
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.530 
and building upon the relationship between learning.

348
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:46.120 
and monitor curry introducing week one,
we discussed experiential learning in week

349
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.070 
two which is actually from the west. so we hope that they linking

350
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:54.540 
it eastern ideas with western ideas. the learners will find monozukuri

351
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.670 
more approachable. and it's less as esoteric.

352
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.630 
and the students can hopefully appreciate
how it can be applicable to their

353
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:07.040 
own lives even, if they have never been to japan yet.

354
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.170 
and you also showed videos about
the monzukuri people from the original

355
00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.330 
course to emphasize the human touch.

356
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.720 
we then give the learners the chance to experience monozukuri

357
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.610 
for themselves in week three. and this involves the science

358
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.170 
and engineering lectures as well as the demonstration workshops

359
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:28.120 
where the buzz would pop-pop booths in the original course.

360
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.190 
and we also added demonstrations on how to create pop-pop boats

361
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:35.200 
using milk carton boxes and aluminium soda cans which was not

362
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.670 
in the original course.
and this was a very good thing to do in hindsight,

363
00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.740 
because when the mooc was released in march 2020.

364
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.150 
it was the start of the pandemic and
there are a lot of learners who mentioned

365
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.250 
that the pop-pop boat creation helped them stay occupied during

366
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:51.970 
the first few weeks of the pandemic.

367
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.390 
and in the final week we zoomed out again by discussing how

368
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.750 
much zacharie is important. in keeping the skills within the

369
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:04.520 
companies that i by introducing monzukuri
in organizational learning on bbs.

370
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.870 
so basically having a monozukuri culture for a company means

371
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:10.980 
that learning goes beyond the piedra.

372
00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.130 
and it is actually hard to compare the original and the revised

373
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:20.380 
monozukuri courses. and firstly because the revised monozukuri

374
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:24.180 
is released during the pandemic the enrollment during the first

375
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.490 
ten months of the revised monozukuri is
not too far from the enrollments

376
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.720 
for the entire twenty months. the original was deployed.

377
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:35.740 
so even if we can see better numbers in terms of completion

378
00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.780 
and verified certificate enrolments there is a slight possibility

379
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.930 
that it was just because more people were first forced to be

380
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.630 
at home. and online learning is a good coping
mechanism during the pandemic.

381
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:53.130 
so we think that a better measure for us is
how well the new course was received.

382
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.120 
so first of course as you have seen there
were drastic changes in the horse.

383
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.390 
but we did not want to introduce more workloads to the student,

384
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.590 
then so we keep kept track of no workloads that they

385
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.950 
reported and fortunately we learned that

386
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:14.970 
the workload before and after were
not significantly different.

387
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.340 
and a possible measure for learner reception is the learner sentiments

388
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.850 
in their discussion board posts like how happy or sad they are.

389
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.710 
and we used tools we developed previously for analysing

390
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:32.170 
discussion board posts. and we saw a significant difference this time

391
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.730 
between learner sentiments in the original course and the positive
course.

392
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.730 
and the revised course showed more positive

393
00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:41.910 
sentiment. so this is a good sign for us.

394
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.350 
and what actually makes us happier are the direct feedback

395
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:50.300 
we receive from the course responses ordered
by smallness of monozukuri

396
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.080 
course. and we appreciate how learners can see the value of

397
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.840 
monozukuri in their lives.
and how the monozukuri people we featured

398
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.430 
were able to inspire them.

399
00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.510 
and what is monozukuri? of course if we are not going to aim for

400
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.480 
improvement. so so far here are some of the other feedback we

401
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.900 
have received from the learners that we aim
to address in a future iteration.

402
00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:18.840 
and that is it for this paper, thank you again for listening

403
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.050 
and of course if you want to experience monozukuri for yourself,

404
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.300 
please feel free to visit our courses.

405
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:27.880 
thank you very much May.

406
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.980 
well time for questions,
if you'd like to ask a question,

407
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.460 
don't hesitate to raise your hand or virtual hand.

408
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:40.390 
or mute yourself and ask or

409
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.240 
post in the chat and i'll relay for you.

410
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:08.140 
where ruth says she will certainly visit the horse, thank you.

411
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.150 
and if you have anything you want

412
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.420 
raised to us please feel free to let us know.

413
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.690 
i do have a question, because and this is something i

414
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.140 
jeffree cross alluded to yesterday during the

415
00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.580 
plenary round table of the international track.

416
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.110 
this course though something that is very interesting to me

417
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:34.790 
is this integration of japanese culture into a MOOC

418
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:40.250 
that might otherwise be the same subject
could have been covered without

419
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:45.050 
even going into this philosophy, but by adding this philosophy

420
00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.650 
to the mix it makes it all the more interesting.

421
00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.210 
do you think that this is something promising beyond the context

422
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.890 
of this course and something that perhaps at tokyo tech

423
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.740 
you intend to do more of in the future ?

424
00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:05.510 
so i think professor Cross might be the better one to answer these.

425
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:09.020 
but i think this is my personal point of view, okay.

426
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:16.240 
so i feel that the monozukuri course is
really very representative of the Tokyo tech

427
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.410 
culture. so i think not many people even know that there is Tokyo

428
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.080 
institute of technology.

429
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.720 
and this is how we do science and engineering,

430
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.330 
it's not just about building things.
we also want you to develop your director.

431
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:39.440 
and i think it's good, and as professor Cross mentioned yesterday,

432
00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:46.760 
we do not really want to push our own, so when we had this course

433
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.130 
revision we took into account that.

434
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:55.850 
well,during the original course not really everyone was a fan of

435
00:32:55.870 --> 00:33:01.130 
the philosophy lessons and if it expired and if it spent four weeks.

436
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:03.390 
it is kind of bored them so.

437
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:08.060 
but we still recognise that there are people who enroll in the course

438
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.870 
for that reason specifically.

439
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:16.560 
so it's kind of trying to understand what your audience wants,

440
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:21.510 
and what is the messaging that you want to share to them.

441
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.310 
understood, thank you May. Thank you.

442
00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:31.330 
we have a question from the chat,

443
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.250 
can you elaborate a bit on making things

444
00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:37.960 
to making people?

445
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:47.640 
so in the monozukuri MOOC,  so professor mori so he is the father

446
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.370 
of robotics in japan, so he kind of mentioned that if

447
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.890 
you are embracing the spirit of monozukuri, there are times

448
00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:00.820 
when you will be totally absorbed in what you are doing.

449
00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.390 
so maybe this is very similar to what people in the zone.

450
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.650 
if you continuously create things,

451
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:15.950 
you will also start to learn more about yourself like when is your

452
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.300 
most optimal period what puts you in the zone.

453
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:25.350 
so yeah and it is also an understanding that
it's not always perfect all the time.

454
00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:29.690 
so you should always be looking for improvement opportunity beast.

455
00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.230 
thank you May and i think karen wants to ask a question.

456
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.120 
yes thank you so much made for this really interesting and

457
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.590 
project and the presentation. and i wanted to know

458
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:48.650 
in retrospect which of the measures you took to find out about

459
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.940 
feedback or revised was most helpful to you

460
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.290 
now that you look at it in retrospect,
and is there maybe also something else

461
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.390 
that you would try out to measure,

462
00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.460 
yet now that you made this experience is there a new idea that

463
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.520 
you had in the course or something?

464
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:11.190 
yeah so i think it really helped that well after me when we
were starting.

465
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:15.540 
so i mentioned that not everyone from the original

466
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:20.160 
course were involved during the revision. so it was kind of a downer,

467
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.690 
but it has been it turned out to be a positive thing, because

468
00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:31.410 
new people were introduced
so fresh ideas were incorporated in the horse.

469
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.970 
so right now one of the things that we are looking into is the
translation,

470
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.880 
so what happened with the monozukuri course

471
00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:47.220 
is that the science and engineering courses,
lectures are delivered in english.

472
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.640 
but the monozukuri people experiences as well as the philosophy

473
00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.990 
they are delivered in japanese. so it was kind of deliberate,

474
00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:01.130 
because i feel that if well again, i'm speaking for myself maybe

475
00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.740 
professor cross can say something.

476
00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.740 
if you are talking about your experiences and philosophies,

477
00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:14.990 
it kind of gets delivered better in your own language.

478
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:16.120 
but i feel that if you are trying to learn something,

479
00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:21.580 
it's hard to consume it

480
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.630 
that way the same way you would for movies.

481
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.890 
so the really serious students they want to hear it in the language

482
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:33.160 
that they understand instead of reading while watching.

483
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:38.710 
so we have tried in a different mooc,

484
00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:48.480 
how automatic sobs would break.
and yeah it is something still undergoing experimentation,

485
00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.460 
maybe we'll see what happens in the future.

486
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:58.020 
thank you May and i think we have one more question from Jose.

487
00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.490 
thank you mae again for another very interesting talk.

488
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.720 
i was wondering if you could

489
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.880 
let us know if there is a relationship or you see a relationship

490
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.590 
between the major education movement that is quite big in the US

491
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.870 
and in other places. i'm going to agree.

492
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.310 
what kind of movement in the us.

493
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.060 
i make it education

494
00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:26.930 
like the maker spaces yes yes.

495
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.170 
i don't know the timings actually. so i don't know if one is

496
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.990 
influenced by the other well.

497
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.950 
i don't think we are influenced by the maker movement,

498
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:46.100 
because the monozukuri mooc, i am sure that yours was

499
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:48.930 
as you say.

500
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.790 
i actually don't know the answer to your question.
It is an interesting question.

501
00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:03.500 
but i wonder now if that brought some learners in.

502
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:11.190 
and also at you for example in japan do you see that this monozukuri

503
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.860 
style of learning is moving to a schools as well?

504
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:23.990 
you are. yes, so actually here in japan a lot of researchers

505
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.130 
are working on lab based learning and i'm not sure,

506
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.870 
if how different are similarities with

507
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:39.780 
lab based learning in the west.
but the ideas are always having hands-on experiences says

508
00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.690 
it's gaining attraction here.

509
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.730 
thank you very much May.  i think at this point, we're going to

510
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:56.210 
move to the lightning talk.
but just FYI there are questions in the chat.

511
00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.150 
so maybe you can continue taking questions that,

512
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:05.830 
otherwise we can leave them for the discussion
that will follow the lightning talk.

513
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.480 
all right, so thank you.

514
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.960 
next we have a lightning presentation

515
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:21.650 
titled nuclear physics and engineering e-learning.

516
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.720 
and it's going to be presented by beauty

517
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:32.470 
Yuriy Panebrattsev and Ksenia Klygina.
i hope i'm pronouncing those names right,

518
00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.720 
from the joint institute for nuclear research.

519
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.070 
Yuriy, over to you. thank you.

520
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:44.970 
and as well mentioned,
i'll talk is nuclear physics and engineering killarney

521
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.960 
and the and osis of this presentation from different

522
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.670 
institutions from joint institute from a

523
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.500 
national research nuclear university miffy,

524
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:04.250 
from sofia university, from stellenbosch university
and from design centre of

525
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.760 
integrative who produce a lot of

526
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:12.300 
software engineering for this project.

527
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.450 
and the title is nuclear physics. but i would like to explain

528
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.500 
people that the nuclear physics now is

529
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.339 
different in different part of our knowledge.

530
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.560 
first of all is fundamental science in

531
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.750 
standard model collider new elements.

532
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.210 
all this stuff is nuclear physics.

533
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.390 
and the global energetic knew

534
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.810 
i told me reactor and the new sermon nuke

535
00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.620 
future sermon nuclear reactor

536
00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:53.180 
who provide humanity of its energy is also nuclear physics.

537
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:58.560 
it is nuclear medicine, this is money ecology monitoring

538
00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.330 
in different aspects also use

539
00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:07.700 
methods of nuclear physics. it's in new materials and study

540
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:13.650 
of new materials. astrobiology and the nuclear planet planet villages.

541
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.460 
so nuclear physics more than nuclear physics is very interesting

542
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.300 
and very attractive part of our life.

543
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:31.140 
and we need to attract young people for

544
00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:36.060 
their participation in nuclear physics like engineers and

545
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.050 
researchers and technicians.

546
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.520 
and it's probably one of the

547
00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:48.890 
proposal of the project, just they say a little bit about education

548
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.430 
in joint institute.

549
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:57.830 
Joint institute is international intergovernmental
organization located in

550
00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.150 
indiana in russia. and the joint institute,

551
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:11.170 
joined scientists from twenty five countries.

552
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:17.640 
and the our slogan of this organization is
science bringing information together.

553
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.930 
and  of course all projects which we

554
00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.800 
do in our institute should be international.
and we should see every time

555
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:36.590 
that how to deliver new knowledge to students in different countries,

556
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.660 
member states. and is one of goal of our project also.

557
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.840 
and i have mentioned that

558
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:47.140 
modern nuclear physics

559
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:52.770 
have many branches and that our institute

560
00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.990 
is studying neutrino physics and collider physics and new materials.

561
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:08.450 
and we have a huge possibility in the supercomputing and

562
00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:14.870 
a great structure and to work in radio biology as a physics.

563
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:20.610 
and the our institute famous

564
00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.900 
and in this institute to eleusis, since this new his super

565
00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:32.010 
heavy elements of middle-age periodical table.
and all this job concentrate in seven laboratories.

566
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.590 
and to support and organize this

567
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:46.240 
educational part and courses for students for young scientists.

568
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:52.620 
we have a special project educational open educational portal

569
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.380 
general open education june.

570
00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:03.350 
and this part has information about our main
facility aiming in collider

571
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:10.080 
and the reactors and the secret throne for study of heavy elements.

572
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:15.720 
and the if you have courses on main topics of

573
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:22.700 
our research, it's very essential for graduates for students to

574
00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:23.830 
have knowledge

575
00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:29.510 
about new results in science

576
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.840 
that usually takes MOOCs

577
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:38.820 
have some all the information.

578
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.940 
but the in science we have provides students
with new and new information

579
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.100 
and with the information about new detectors.

580
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:53.110 
and you field of research,
new methods of research.

581
00:44:53.650 --> 00:45:00.000 
so such kind of lecture we have prepared.

582
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:02.530 
and the we also use some options

583
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:08.440 
related to modern we are a project and

584
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:15.160 
we are exclusion in our institute.
and we have a tamper to prove project

585
00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:21.260 
which is very sensitive for us to lip.
and i will say a little bit more

586
00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:25.440 
about this with the laboratory in this project too.

587
00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.870 
and the as i have mentioned,

588
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.110 
we have online courses, this is this online courses

589
00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:38.220 
in format which is

590
00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.490 
the same for typical format like coursera or leagues.

591
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:50.500 
but the thought because it's literally

592
00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:55.020 
lectures and courses related to specific of our institute.

593
00:45:55.020 --> 00:46:00.480 
and by the way, part of this information,

594
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.770 
we also present like online courses for coursera and edx.

595
00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.920 
and i would say that the very important part of

596
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:15.110 
our activity is science for  school students

597
00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:16.560 
and for school teachers.

598
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.980 
for example, we have a four russian school,

599
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.930 
such listened collider universe in the lippe

600
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:30.890 
and the of course this is online course. and this is a course

601
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.840 
you can get from youtube or our porto general.

602
00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.390 
but in parallel

603
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:44.120 
we do presentation in different regions of our country with

604
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:46.820 
such kind of lectures about the first,

605
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.480 
about russian colliders about modern

606
00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.420 
particle physics about modern nuclear physics.

607
00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:00.110 
and you see some picture element of such presentation

608
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.480 
in literature was carolee.

609
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.930 
and the nikita who's to say participate in this nikita sidra

610
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.560 
who is also participate in this session of

611
00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:22.220 
the prepared lecture video lecture collider of the 21 century.

612
00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:27.200 
and he has a more than three hundred seventy k

613
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:35.450 
of viewers of his lecture that is i'm from mine point of view

614
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:38.850 
very good for such specific a

615
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.110 
part of our life lake collider,

616
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.010 
since particle physics.

617
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.060 
and together with

618
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.150 
have interest for such project

619
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:03.500 
russian online school a or electoral russian electronic school.

620
00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:06.910 
and we have prepare for the school to his of his

621
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:14.630 
rosatom corporation some lessons about the modern

622
00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:25.500 
view of analysis and this school green square and means that the

623
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:32.170 
carbon free, if we should go to carbon free energy.

624
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.970 
and in this case is the sun,

625
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:46.980 
water and wind and as essential part also is
a new approach to nuclear energy,

626
00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:53.170 
a new approach to new nuclear energy.

627
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.540 
some kind of recycling

628
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.950 
and cycling offices a nuclear material without the spoiling

629
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.040 
environmental spoil in ecology.

630
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:10.740 
and all this new approach in

631
00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:18.760 
energetics we present for school children in
this listen at it looks.

632
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.280 
very good

633
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:28.620 
estimation of the result of this listen
from teachers and from people who take this process.

634
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:34.810 
and as i mentioned we have some project we should call

635
00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:39.730 
the laboratory. of course,
it's for us it's  absolutely clear that

636
00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.660 
it's not possible to

637
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:50.390 
study engineers of experimental physicists with virtual approaches.

638
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:55.150 
but in any case,
if you take an account of the different possibility

639
00:49:55.790 --> 00:50:01.070 
of different university in the world not all universities wear

640
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:04.220 
very good equipment.
there is a university which need

641
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:13.080 
ellipse about new results and new equipment.

642
00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.910 
and you detectors in nuclear physics and nuclear electronics.

643
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.820 
and he decided

644
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:24.540 
to produce this project which we call virtual live.

645
00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:28.190 
but the probably senior say later about the extension of this project.

646
00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:34.770 
of course we have a hands on practical and the remote practical.

647
00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:45.760 
but the main goal of this project is to include in educational process.

648
00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:48.930 
a real experimental data

649
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:56.840 
which is not possible in  a typical university laboratory.

650
00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:01.150 
but possible using on online format the internet

651
00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:06.720 
and the main topic collaboration of a

652
00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:14.430 
good very strong multi-disciplinary
science center of his the university of his member state.

653
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.820 
and the in development of this project participate teachers

654
00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:28.270 
and the researchers from

655
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:34.940 
poland warsaw university, from serbia university,

656
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:42.470 
of course from dubai university,
and the moscow research nuclear university.

657
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:46.520 
also we collaborate with mongolian researchers and

658
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.600 
teachers and the people from bulgaria,

659
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:56.570 
and the also

660
00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:02.640 
there is very active participation of south africa.

661
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:09.910 
and south africa is also participating in the work of our institute.

662
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:16.470 
a south africa university is a symbol ip.

663
00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:21.410 
so it's a really international project and the

664
00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:26.530 
as i mentioned that the who participate in development.

665
00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:31.870 
and through this project a use the students from seventy countries,

666
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.690 
a summer was it an intimate format for some of that we transfers

667
00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:43.380 
is a result of this project for their computer classes.

668
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:51.150 
and beyond that the we organize in Dubna,

669
00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.150 
you see some pictures some practices

670
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:58.980 
students from different continents in particular south africa,

671
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:04.830 
poland, czech republic, egypt, belarus, and the organizers,

672
00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:08.920 
also do some adaptation for school students and teachers.

673
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.870 
and we organize five practice for school students

674
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.480 
specific school students, as they are

675
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:25.780 
for since their future like scientist and from her

676
00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.720 
and very good prepared

677
00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:34.490 
school students. and together with teaches a

678
00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:41.790 
was they were in our institute. and we organize was him

679
00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:45.130 
a few days practices and

680
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:51.830 
he was this result of virtual lab and hands-on practical

681
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:54.240 
for their education,

682
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.870 
initial education in the field of nuclear physics.

683
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:06.360 
and we also sometime organized some workshops in syria,
south africa, bulgaria.

684
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:12.760 
and the its i would say that the results of this

685
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:18.130 
project together with the university professors and teachers,

686
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:20.100 
also included in the

687
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:26.650 
educational program of some universities

688
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:30.960 
like  part of cv.

689
00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.430 
and probably

690
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.370 
seni will show something else suppose his project,

691
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:44.640 
but it looks like such ways of

692
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:53.310 
simulation of detective different detective synthesis is  analysis and

693
00:54:55.030 --> 00:55:00.950 
complicated analysis in a modern root environment which people

694
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:04.940 
use in modern experiments in nuclear physics to explain his readings

695
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:08.230 
and we have a twenty six different

696
00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:16.710 
lipsey in framework of this project together
with some introductory lectures,

697
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.250 
and test and greece everything.

698
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:28.000 
and this is part of our participation in the workshop activities.

699
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.390 
this is our workshop from south africa
and that is a computer class equipped with our two practical.

700
00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:43.900 
and the we have a one week training for students.

701
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:50.420 
and beyond that we have internet version as a governmental.

702
00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:58.010 
and now i go to our collaboration in collaboration of joins office.

703
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.530 
and national research university MEPhi is

704
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:13.700 
one of very famous the universities in nuclear physics and the

705
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:18.440 
Six Nobel Prize winners were

706
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:24.480 
graduated from this university and Nikolay Basov

707
00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:30.460 
was student of this university.

708
00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:39.850 
and the university has 12,000 students and the above allowed

709
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:44.880 
to 50 countries foreign students, and eleven branches, and

710
00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.270 
as i mentioned that no nuclear physics is

711
00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.470 
his a lot different direction.

712
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.210 
and this more than this a more abels is his direction his

713
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:04.690 
immediate scene and the photonic in spintronics and the

714
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:08.340 
cyber security and

715
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:12.450 
nuclear physics and technology

716
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:21.180 
and plasma technologies.
and the of course this university has an educational portal

717
00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.090 
and the internal part of this portal has

718
00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:27.350 
more than four hundred courses for students,

719
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:33.060 
but the outer topic is international component.

720
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:37.250 
and as international companion

721
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:44.820 
we produce a courses for such platform like coursera and edx.

722
00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:51.340 
and now moscow

723
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.300 
research nuclear university has

724
00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:02.800 
forty five courses with one hundred 92 visitor for

725
00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.860 
coursera platform and thirty five courses

726
00:58:08.410 --> 00:58:10.700 
and 131 students in split form.

727
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:17.420 
and from my point of view,

728
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:22.360 
it's not bred for such specific topic like nuclear physics,

729
00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.620 
not economy, not computing,

730
00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.130 
but for such is  not better results.

731
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:38.100 
but i made some additional analysis.

732
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:43.920 
for me it was not so obvious that there forces
our course a nuclear reactor physics basis,

733
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:47.840 
as there was more than two hundred students

734
00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:55.180 
and the via analyzed the from of each country was the student.

735
00:58:55.850 --> 00:59:01.700 
and the india, united states, bangladesh force place russia,

736
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.840 
and philippine, egypt, united kingdom, mexico, brazil, pakistan.

737
00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:13.400 
it is top 10. and it looks like his courses needed people

738
00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.790 
and they walk in right direction. and the

739
00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:23.090 
as he also prepares some very interesting course,

740
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:31.490 
some general view on one physics physics lay global project

741
00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:37.630 
from items to stars. and we have twenty seven thousand students,

742
00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:44.560 
as students and this is a project we have coursera,

743
00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.740 
we have in russian language and the

744
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:51.660 
yandex we have in english. and in this case you see

745
00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:58.610 
in the top 10 united states india united kingdom, canada, australia

746
00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:02.100 
germany, russia, brazil, indonesia.

747
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:10.630 
so it looks like people need some general of you and physics or

748
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:16.770 
nuclear physics and the is part of our culture.
and the i like this course very much.

749
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:21.970 
and  did some course

750
01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:27.850 
introduction to nuclear physics elements of atomic and nuclear

751
01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:31.070 
physics. this course in russia so in top ten russia.

752
01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:36.510 
but also people from ukraine, kazakhstan, belarus russia,

753
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:42.280 
and the united states, romania, uzbekistan, israel probably people who

754
01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:49.940 
use russian in their life. and the by the way, if i have a russian

755
01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:56.520 
who is deaf nicola when we discuss it was decisions
that are for coursera.

756
01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:01.670 
basic course we produce a native language

757
01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.770 
taken in a code probably some

758
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:09.480 
specific of education of different country.

759
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.940 
and in some of, for edx we mainly do courses

760
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:17.960 
in english, but for coursera

761
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.500 
mainly in russian language.

762
01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:29.780 
but it's also in international aspect, as it is also

763
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.650 
if you can't read these useless courses.

764
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:40.570 
and we're giving for interrupting just a couple minutes more,

765
01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:41.710 
there a couple minutes william.

766
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:47.340 
and we did some course history of engineering innovation and discovery.

767
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:51.780 
it's also a very popular course, this course in russia probably

768
01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.710 
needed to translate into english,

769
01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.390 
but now you see that the course is also russia, ukraine, kazakhstan.

770
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.800 
and we have course with 26,000 students.

771
01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:12.870 
it's a special course for students who study
nuclear physics and engineering,

772
01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:17.990 
and russian for foreign students. you see that the

773
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:22.470 
we have twenty six thousand students and the

774
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:30.240 
mainly russian federation,
but the icings that is not the people from russia federation

775
01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:36.400 
that it's students which now we do educated in russia.

776
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:44.160 
and the use this courses from computer in russia.

777
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.420 
but it's also a very interesting course and

778
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:54.610 
especially for people who will work on a nuclear power station.

779
01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.610 
and a lot of nuclear power station producing in
russia rosatom produces.

780
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.940 
and it needed to know russian also for communication.

781
01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:15.130 
and reduces some specialisation about nuclear low

782
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:22.210 
and no nuclear college management some specialisation coursesara.

783
01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.470 
and we collaborate with different business partner like russia

784
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:32.530 
atom and with different university,
and science partner vagrant institute.

785
01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:38.350 
and our future plans it's less like now.

786
01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:41.260 
we won't reproduce some exhibition

787
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:48.090 
about the collider see neutrino physics about astrobiology

788
01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:52.490 
nuclear planet diligence knows this exhibition in dubna.

789
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:59.960 
but via planning also do this some internet exhibition about

790
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.320 
modern nuclear physics.

791
01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.850 
and probably it will be a lighting talk for next MOOC meeting.

792
01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:13.970 
thank you thank you very much yuli.

793
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:18.950 
and on that note i do have questions, if you'd like to ask a

794
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.240 
question please raise your hands, or unmute yourself

795
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:26.460 
or post the question in the chat.

796
01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:27.690 
and we'll relay them for you.

797
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:48.490 
well i'll take the liberty of asking a question.

798
01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:52.990 
perhaps one of the most impressive slides he went over yuri

799
01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:56.490 
is the one where you show all the countries that were involved

800
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.570 
all the institutions all the flags.

801
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:04.440 
well we've just been involved
we're currently involved in the organization of

802
01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:06.630 
a conference. and i know

803
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:10.820 
from experience how tricky it can get even at the

804
01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:16.320 
scale of a track.  so an collaboration that involves so many

805
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.100 
countries, so many institutions that must have its own challenges,

806
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:23.120 
can you tell us how this collaboration

807
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:26.750 
came to be and in practical terms,

808
01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.780 
how it happened and perhaps some of its challenges,

809
01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.530 
by the way either you or senia?  i believe probably senia.

810
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:46.460 
i would say i only want to say that the our institute is

811
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:50.580 
an government international organization.

812
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:52.180 
so if we have a

813
01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:59.300 
24 countries which participate and the communicate

814
01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.880 
through scientific council different meetings conference and people

815
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:07.850 
from this country work and we have very good communication

816
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:12.790 
and very bright collaboration.

817
01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:17.520 
and we communicate personally with professors and teachers

818
01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:24.030 
in different university and we discuss with what we need,

819
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:29.260 
and the decide what kind of flip's of courses
we need to prepare for students,

820
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.970 
which now and in future will come

821
01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:38.740 
for job, for work in our institute.

822
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:44.310 
so if for us is more or less a

823
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:49.260 
natural, but by the way our institute

824
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:54.760 
you know that there is in a very big nuclear organization in europe

825
01:06:55.790 --> 01:06:59.650 
they are in geneva and they organized.

826
01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:05.810 
some classes for teachers and our institute also

827
01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:11.500 
before the pandemic,
we have two classes for teachers four school, for teachers,

828
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.370 
russian speaking teachers one class for

829
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:21.410 
school students was in duma, and in summer and in autumn

830
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:26.460 
was such class in turn sunlight russian teachers, also.

831
01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.610 
so we communicate with these teachers and

832
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:33.810 
some teachers who communicate in this classes,

833
01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:40.780 
after the proposed communication and for example  such was the

834
01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.980 
beginning of our collaboration with is as ran first teachers

835
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.980 
participated in this classes. and said this is

836
01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:53.980 
we want to organize a practical together organized practical MOOC

837
01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:59.300 
in nuclear physics for our students from science.

838
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.860 
so did the different ways,

839
01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:12.780 
but it's a some mixture of science and education, by the way

840
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:17.530 
we collaborate with brookhaven national laboratory
and brookhaven national laboratory

841
01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:23.720 
strongly support a this outreach programs about collider.

842
01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.410 
and our first project was because of is

843
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.940 
became a national laboratory. for all people in the world,

844
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:34.500 
for all  scientists in the world,

845
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:39.480 
it's clear that the now we should work

846
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:47.520 
for to  attract a new generation on young people in science
and nuclear science.

847
01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.760 
and if he will not work in this direction, let it happen.

848
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:56.710 
so for us it's nature. thank you.

849
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:03.040 
would anyone like to ask another question,

850
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.470 
feel free to raise your hand or post it in the chat.

851
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:17.820 
and if not, i think we can simply move on to the

852
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:23.880 
final discussion extra Q
and A which is actually going to be another opportunity

853
01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:26.840 
to ask questions. but now these can be directed

854
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:33.870 
to both May and Senia and perhaps Yuriy since you're still here.

855
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:38.280 
but the three speakers are available at this time.

856
01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:43.560 
so same idea, please raise your hand

857
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:46.640 
or post a question in the chat.

858
01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:54.640 
you are Senia seems to be a question for you.

859
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:59.860 
do you see more need in energy or health?

860
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:05.050 
so i take it this is broadly speaking

861
01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:11.730 
specifically about a nuclear physics.

862
01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.250 
area with question was

863
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:20.930 
more energy was rainhill

864
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:27.630 
growing and more injured usual sources

865
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.920 
produce not enough energy was nuclear

866
01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.610 
energetics was future.

867
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.760 
but no we are talking about

868
01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:52.280 
generation plants which work without waste wish

869
01:10:56.670 --> 01:11:07.900 
you'd environment soul tried there was about.

870
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:18.110 
thank you senior rainhill, if you'd like to provide more context

871
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:22.070 
or more specific question don't hesitate to jump in,
just turn your mic on

872
01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:24.680 
or to give more context in the chat.

873
01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:29.360 
but sorry you wanted to add something with
i had a question in this line

874
01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:33.620 
stop. because he was needed by time and he was afraid

875
01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.560 
to be able to showed some visualization just

876
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:45.800 
maybe direct to show something from our observation.

877
01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:53.260 
station our. Yurie was talking about

878
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:56.910 
virtual laboratory works

879
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:04.450 
and education in physics, i want to say some horse
that is very difficult.

880
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.420 
this is very difficult

881
01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:12.280 
to explain to students in texts

882
01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.200 
about different physical phenomena.

883
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.440 
that is why we pay a lot of

884
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:23.290 
attention to the visualization of

885
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:29.370 
processes and their physical treatment.

886
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:32.310 
how you describe, for example

887
01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:39.590 
he was shown the detection system and hart was

888
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.660 
in one example.

889
01:12:44.170 --> 01:13:04.760 
in our liberty works we tried to explain the processes themselves.

890
01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:14.260 
the instructions was all by themselves.

891
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:21.580 
it's difficult to hear you because of the video.

892
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.290 
so it's very important that

893
01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.600 
we make a simulation of the experimental region.

894
01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:39.500 
the real experimental data

895
01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.010 
in this laboratory words,

896
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:45.470 
before making these laboratory works in digital form.

897
01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:47.570 
we make everything real

898
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:50.910 
and make only simulation

899
01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.100 
on the computer and

900
01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:01.290 
of course we count the feedback from the students.

901
01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.170 
they help us to do so.

902
01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.630 
mistakes educational mistakes and

903
01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.670 
he was no idea

904
01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.850 
about how to organize

905
01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:24.760 
and i thought that we also organised a practical, right show

906
01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.800 
some should be

907
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:31.000 
from the school practice.

908
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:36.380 
we should have asked a couple years ago

909
01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:44.260 
jersey or high school students from israel they work

910
01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.330 
with our supervisors,

911
01:14:54.200 --> 01:15:02.740 
with the teachers who i was reading this group, the askers  are

912
01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:04.700 
the students.

913
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:09.790 
the next year and wanted to come here a third time,

914
01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:20.250 
thank you senior for providing this overview and we're going

915
01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:23.240 
to take another question this time from the chat.

916
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:29.120 
can you or any of the speakers elaborate on the assessment

917
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.930 
parts of your MOOCs, their design the role of the assessments

918
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:36.740 
in the instruction design of the course resources. and effort invested

919
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:42.120 
in developing et cetera and maybe we can hear from May to start.

920
01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:50.660 
for the monozukuri MOOC,

921
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:57.340 
there are a few typical assessments that are

922
01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.960 
what you would always see in a typical mooc like the multiple

923
01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.670 
choice questions and the likes. and we also have

924
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:12.240 
a final project where the students can share videos or photos

925
01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:16.740 
of their pop-pop boots. but i think it is about

926
01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:23.530 
ten percent, or so of the final rates.

927
01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.870 
but basically the goals of the assessments.

928
01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.710 
well from my point of view it's not very hard to pass

929
01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:33.710 
our mooc because it is an appreciation course

930
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:37.310 
and not really intended to

931
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:41.260 
build very strong competencies.

932
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:45.640 
and yeah in terms of all

933
01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.040 
clear, the role of assessment is just to make sure that people are doing

934
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:55.850 
work then they are not left behind.

935
01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:00.340 
and the resources and efforts,

936
01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.530 
this is resources and efforts in developing the assessment part.

937
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:11.970 
so for that we  prepared separate infrastructure. for example we had

938
01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.090 
our own weak site and dropbox that are interconnected together

939
01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:22.330 
with the ethics platform to allow the students to share their

940
01:17:22.330 --> 01:17:25.370 
materials with the rest of the class and with the instructors.

941
01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:30.470 
thank you May. Senia would you like to

942
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.090 
offer more details about specifically the assessment.

943
01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:37.090 
part of some of the courses of your project's big project.

944
01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.290 
we had so many different resources

945
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:56.430 
horses for.

946
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:07.790 
well that's ok.

947
01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:13.330 
i just said say about

948
01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:19.410 
the two was we have automatic

949
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:25.500 
check all steps.

950
01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:30.690 
he was wrong,

951
01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:39.580 
if he was right are they allowed to the right answer

952
01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.340 
right our steps were in issue right.

953
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.610 
so we were not in our rules.

954
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:58.190 
we don't have to make their level obligations.

955
01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:00.300 
we just have to understand about his

956
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:06.280 
experiment to make everything clear.

957
01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.850 
thank you, thank you senior.

958
01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:21.880 
any more questions Jose has a question?

959
01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:30.960 
yes so i was thinking that
we've seen three presentations with different international flavors

960
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.090 
and i was wondering what are the

961
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:38.810 
designs the design petitions or challenges that are unique

962
01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.890 
for your specific case study.

963
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.480 
and if you can tell us about them?

964
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:48.820 
you can start with one with May,

965
01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.180 
then yeah i guess in my case i presented two different papers right,

966
01:19:55.370 --> 01:20:01.610 
so or the cambodia paper, it was really a matter all choosing the

967
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:05.350 
best skills that you want to focus within a very short time

968
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:07.770 
period for the assessment and which ones

969
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:14.180 
we could possibly see improvement
in terms of self-advocacy.

970
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.780 
and then for the monozukuri MOOC,

971
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:22.890 
where we are on the revision team. so we didn't have the problem of

972
01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:28.720 
initialization that other courses would have had.

973
01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:31.430 
but i think the additional problem for us is

974
01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.650 
now how are we going to satisfy the demands of the learners

975
01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:42.460 
that were not very evident at the start. so we didn't,

976
01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:46.890 
i mean if you remember the original style of the mooc.

977
01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:52.410 
it is lectured an application and
an inspiration then another inspiration.

978
01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:57.510 
it sounded good in theory, but in reality it ended up being boring.

979
01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:02.460 
so it was a question of if we are going to rearrange.

980
01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:08.810 
it would are we introducing the problems that we tried to avoid

981
01:21:10.890 --> 01:21:13.720 
during the original course or something like that.

982
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:18.370 
so yeah that is one thing, and then secondly of course,

983
01:21:18.670 --> 01:21:20.580 
it's always a matter of should we

984
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.550 
deliver this in english or in japanese.

985
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:28.130 
and i think that is still a very hard

986
01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.020 
thing to decide at this point, because we recognize that there

987
01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:38.570 
are people who are really interested on what japan is about, and

988
01:21:39.010 --> 01:21:44.650 
delivering these experience materials in english,

989
01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:49.230 
I do not know how much of the japanese spirit will be lost, oh yeah.

990
01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:54.860 
sorry, i don't have answers to this yet, but something that we learned

991
01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.210 
go on I guess.

992
01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.380 
thank you very much May.

993
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:08.210 
Senia do you want to add to this or not.

994
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:09.720 
it's not necessary.

995
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:17.380 
that's okay, well in that case yes we're going to be ending on time.

996
01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:22.910 
thanks everyone for joining this session, thank you naturally

997
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:27.040 
to our speakers, our three speakers final.

998
01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.660 
and four speakers, senia,  also

999
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.150 
right, but made it to paper.

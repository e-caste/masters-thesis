00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.460 
welcome to my presentation blending pure instruction with just-in-time

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.960 
jointly occupied cost scheduling with feedback for classroom flipping.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.130 
my name is chee Wei Tan.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.060 
the lecture is less essential to content delivery than it once was.

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.660 
one way lecturing states on youtube class time is for interaction.

6
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.410 
how should we design and optimize content delivery and interaction

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.180 
between students and instructors.

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.920 
indeed classroom flipping is a pedagogical idea that cost time

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.380 
can be used to engage students through active learning.

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.020 
the instructor integrates a five to ten minutes hands-on
learning activity into a cross pierrot.

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.990 
and consequently lectures for five to ten minutes pass.

12
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.590 
the contributions in our paper is a classroom flipping framework

13
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.710 
that demonstrates the value of feedback

14
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.350 
by blending a synchronous pre class learning as in just-in-time petri
with a synchronous in-class.

15
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.300 
one as in peer instruction using convex optimization.

16
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.810 
our framework can open up avenues for on-line classroom.

17
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.640 
flipping another key contribution in our work is a mobile chat software

18
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.060 
that we used to implement this classroom flipping approach

19
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.370 
in the real world for teaching a large university class in  2019

20
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.530 
and 2020.

21
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.330 
several teaching tourists in classroom flipping

22
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.530 
just in time teaching is an asynchronous approach in which

23
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.930 
teachers close the gap with students

24
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.290 
by giving out some form of shock diagnostic assessments before class.

25
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.310 
and teach us use this diagnostics feedback as talking points

26
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.270 
in class to engage students.

27
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.380 
on the other hand pure instruction is a synchronous approach

28
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.780 
in which instructor relies on the use of clickers
a form of audience response systems

29
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.780 
to quiz students in class and
to encourage students to actively seek out peers

30
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.240 
for class discussion.

31
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.820 
our mobile chatbot software integrates this two approaches

32
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.440 
to achieve blended learning.

33
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.090 
here's the typical blended learning timeline

34
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.460 
for pre class activities students use our software for last year's quiz assessment.

35
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.740 
our software can send out auto prompts to regulates students the new progress

36
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.730 
and to track the individual student's ability thereby providing

37
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.230 
just in time teacher feedback to educate.

38
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.430 
for example, student a may choose easy quiz while student b

39
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.120 
choose the harder,

40
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.620 
print in class activities students can use the same software

41
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.770 
to carry out a pool quiz routine

42
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.140 
that provides instant feedback to the whole class and to the instructor.

43
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.070 
in the following let me present focused team

44
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.820 
instruction using our mobile chat software.

45
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.390 
the routine people typically start off with pull

46
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.570 
that is in the form of multiple-choice questions.
students get around five minutes

47
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.870 
to enter their votes. and once they have entered they can see

48
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.810 
the instantaneous poll response in the form of a high chance.

49
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.820 
the instructor would then encourage the students to take ten to twenty minutes

50
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.570 
for class discussion talking to their neighbors,

51
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.730 
or other friends on this poll results

52
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.960 
at the end of the twenty minutes. the instructor would then

53
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.640 
send out a quiz whose content is related

54
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.060 
and that concludes the poll with

55
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.190 
the original quiz working in pure instruction designed for in-person teacher,

56
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.110 
turns out that this quiz routine can still be very effective

57
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.770 
for remote teaching. in 2020 i taught an online course

58
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.680 
on artificial intelligence to one hundred and three freshmen.

59
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.380 
a key advantage of such a poor quiz routine is that click appalling

60
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.460 
does not embarrass shy students who might be fearful of ridicule,

61
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.340 
if they choose the wrong answer.

62
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.300 
and not a key advantage is that

63
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
instructors who choose to have clickers feel obligated to use them.

64
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.580 
and so must consider interesting polling questions to enhance interactions.

65
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.770 
students can carry out peer discussion in groups online such as zoomed break rooms.

66
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.370 
but they might be other different ways to put students according to ability

67
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.180 
by what the instructor can glean from the feedback of pre class

68
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.990 
activities using our software.

69
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.860 
and here's a typical profound of a three students interestingly students

70
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.010 
who choose to answer the hard quiz can score higher points.

71
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.940 
and here is a

72
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.940 
winning piece, how to incentivise students is key.

73
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.790 
and that opens up new avenues to using machine-learning and

74
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.200 
data science to track students' ability.

75
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.580 
and in general we find our students are very responsive to our mobile software

76
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.760 
oftentimes entering their response within a couple of days,

77
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.470 
once we have to show princesse.

78
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.940 
here's the statistics showing that students are in general
very satisfied.

79
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.740 
we've been a mouths off in class and pre class quizzes that they have encountered

80
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.670 
over the course of a semester.

81
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
and in general students are very satisfied with this form of online classroom flipping

82
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.920 
using blended learning.

83
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.640 
to conclude this classroom flipping approach using mobile chat software

84
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.300 
has been successfully deployed on my classroom flipping,

85
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.790 
teaching a large mass

86
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.780 
of students in a remote teaching, and learning environments.

87
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.490 
the model software can certainly address many more issues and challenges

88
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.450 
and counter insists remote a hybrid formal teaching.

89
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.130 
and then the classroom flipping dataset is available at kaggle.

90
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.490 
in this url and we certainly look forward to addressing more

91
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.620 
challenges using our mobile software. thank you.

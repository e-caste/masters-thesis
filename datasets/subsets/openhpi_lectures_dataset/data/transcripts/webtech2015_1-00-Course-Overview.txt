00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.810 
Welcome to our OpenHPI course on Web Technology.

2
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.470 
The world wide web shortly the Web, everyone knows it.

3
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.570 
But how does it work?

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.490 
Of course it is a very famous service that may be used over the internet,

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.690 
but what is the architecture? What are the principles? What are

6
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.300 
the components? What is necessary to know,

7
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.000 
to exactly understand the World Wide Web?

8
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.250 
Exactly this type of knowledge we want to present in this course.

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.520 
So you are invited to take part. Everyone who wants to understand

10
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.470 
how the world wide web works is welcome to the course. There are no

11
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.990 
pre- requests, course attendance is free and the material that's provided by us

12
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.290 
are mainly learning videos, instructional videos.

13
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.900 
We offer supplementary reading materials, and we provide

14
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.250 
self-tests so that learners, that you can interactively test whether you

15
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.370 
have completely understood what was presented in the video

16
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.770 
in the learning matter. What we expect from our participants if

17
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.540 
that's a seriously study-

18
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.650 
follow the provided material, that's a

19
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.640 
control their individual learning progress

20
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.650 
we provide to this end self tests, we provide weekly homework

21
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.910 
and this is particular important, we expect our

22
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.610 
learners, our participants

23
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.910 
to take actively part in the discussion forum.

24
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.870 
This is a big advantage of such a massive open online courses that

25
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.400 
the learners

26
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.170 
are part of a virtual community, of a virtual learning community.

27
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
All of the people around you in the internet, they

28
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.890 
are interested in the same topic  and they are interested to discuss

29
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.470 
with you, and they are to discuss with us about these learning topics.

30
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.080 
It is possible to get a certificate. To this end, one has to complete

31
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.810 
weekly homework exercises, one has to pass a final exam, and

32
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.180 
then you can get a certificate from Hasso Plattner Institut.

33
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.100 
To give you a short overview about how we have organized,

34
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.930 
the content and the learning event of our web technology course,

35
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.270 
so in the first week, we start with an introduction to the web technology and

36
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.190 
the World Wide Web. In the second week, we have a closer look

37
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.090 
to the uniform resource locators and the http protocol that's

38
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.090 
used for transporting content in the World Wide Web.

39
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.190 
In the third week, we discuss how

40
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.370 
web pages are designed, how html language is used to design such web pages,

41
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.700 
what is the idea of Cascading Style Sheets, by which the

42
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.670 
layout of the web documents may be described, and we discuss XML,

43
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.430 
which provides a meta markup language to design very specific

44
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.060 
languages, to describe web documents.

45
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.340 
And then in the following two week, in week four and five, we

46
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.840 
concentrate on web programming. We start in

47
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.310 
week four to

48
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.110 
introduce client-side Web Programming and continue in week five

49
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.320 
the web as a Server-side Web Programming.

50
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.140 
And then in the last week we discuss Social, Semantic and service web.

51
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.740 
If we go in to more detail, then in the first week, we want to

52
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.510 
answer the key question- "The web has become an indispensable

53
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.830 
part of our daily life. But what is the structure, and how does it work?"

54
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.070 
The learning units we want to present you are about introduction

55
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.080 
into the web. We introduce you to the hypertext

56
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.350 
idea of the concept of hypertext, the HTML language and XML. We

57
00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.080 
have a closer look at how browser are designed, what is the role of service,

58
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.390 
we see and get an introduction into Web Applications and Programming.

59
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.670 
And then we finish the week by some remarks about the history

60
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.210 
of the World Wide Web, the important player in the web, and it

61
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.410 
is also very interesting- how the standardization is working in the internet

62
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.690 
and in the web. Then it's the second week- we try to answer the following key question -

63
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.670 
"How can information and services on the web be identified and

64
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.920 
how can they be obtained via the Internet?"

65
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.940 
The learning units we have prepared for the second week are

66
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.210 
the following. We introduce the concept of URIs- Uniform Resource Identifier.

67
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.310 
Then we explain in more detail the two incarnation URL-

68
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.500 
Uniform Resource Locator and Uniform Resource Name.

69
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.330 
Then we introduce the HTTP protocol. We discuss the history

70
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.290 
of the HTTP protocol and then we discuss some important features

71
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.060 
to see a later version of the http protocol. We discuss about Content Negotiation.

72
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.310 
We discuss Authentication and HTTPs. We will discuss Persistent

73
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:27.820 
Connections, Caching and Cookies. And we will finish as this week with

74
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.470 
presenting some information about http server configuration.

75
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.710 
Then in the third week we will try to answer the following key questions:

76
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.290 
"How can web documents be created? How can they be designed in such a way

77
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:54.100 
that not only we people can use them, but that they also can be processed

78
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.510 
automatically by machines?"

79
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.590 
The learning units in that week are that we explain

80
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:10.450 
the structure of HTML Documents. We discuss the history of HTML,

81
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:17.210 
the basic principles of HTML. Then we have a closer look to dynamic HTML

82
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.900 
and then we continue with

83
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.720 
most recent version to introduce HTML 5- what is

84
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.690 
the state of the art and is just coming into the practical life.

85
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.510 
We discuss about cascading style sheets, cascading style sheets syntax,

86
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:43.110 
cascading style sheets preprocessor and then we finish this week with some

87
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.960 
information about XML.

88
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.190 
Then we reach week four,

89
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:58.410 
and week four we start with introducing web programming and

90
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.380 
the key question we want to answer this week is: How can offers

91
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.290 
"come to life" on the web? How can web applications be developed with HTML,

92
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.610 
JavaScript and with libraries? And learning units

93
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.700 
which are presented by means of videos are the following: the

94
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.210 
introduction to the web programming and client-side web programming. Then we explain

95
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.730 
the document object model DOM and DHTML.

96
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:38.210 
We introduce JavaScript, we introduce JavaScript frameworks,

97
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:45.000 
some selected javaScript libraries and then we give some example applications and

98
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.140 
finish with introduction into CoffeeScript and Dart

99
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:56.330 
frameworks which help to design client-side web applications.

100
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:04.830 
The next week, we look to the server-side web programming. The

101
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.230 
key question we want to answer is : "What kind of software is

102
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.900 
running on the server-side and how can it be implemented with

103
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.560 
the help of web application frameworks MVC, etc?"

104
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.680 
And here are the learning units of that week:

105
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.430 
we introduce a Server-side Web Programming, the concepts we

106
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:33.780 
introduce Session Management, MVC. Then we introduce Persistence and Database Layer.

107
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.130 
We introduce to Asynchronous Client/Server Communication,

108
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:45.810 
concepts of AJAX and JSON, which are widely used and applied in the

109
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.770 
web to tool in the user creation

110
00:09:51.450 --> 00:10:00.010 
of web content. We discuss a web based APIs- application interfaces and Web services.

111
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.970 
We introduce Graphic and Video formats, Character Encodings and

112
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:11.690 
we introduce some Selected Web Application Frameworks and finish with some

113
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.500 
application examples.

114
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.080 
And then we have reached the last week of our course. You see it's an

115
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:24.270 
approach program. In the last week we want to answer the key question:

116
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:31.840 
"How can resources- computers, storage, software- be used efficiently on the Web?

117
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:37.670 
And the learning units we will present in the last six week of our course

118
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.260 
are an introduction to the Web 3.0, the Social

119
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:47.490 
and Semantic Web. We will go into more details, into the principles

120
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.790 
of the social web and social media. We discuss some examples-

121
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.420 
Facebook, Google+, Twitter/ Renren

122
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.450 
Qzone, Welbo and others. We

123
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.680 
have a closer look to understand how search engines are working.

124
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:11.650 
We will make an excursion into the semantic web. We will discuss

125
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:18.010 
Machine-to-Machine Communication and finish with SOAP based web services.

126
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.240 
And this is the teaching team

127
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:27.110 
which supports me in preparing the materials for this course,

128
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:34.750 
which supports me in interacting with you in the discussion forum,

129
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:40.560 
which is perhaps even same importance like the learning units

130
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:47.640 
that you have a forum to discuss your questions, your ideas with other participants or

131
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.880 
with us. So this is Christian Willems, Mathias Bauer, Tom Staubitz,

132
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.750 
Doctor Haojin Yang, Martin Malchow,Xiaoyin Che and

133
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.110 
Cheng Wang, who support me, and you will be able to discuss with them

134
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:10.760 
and we all hope that you have the chance to learn a lot in our course,

135
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.330 
that you are really motivated to understand

136
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.720 
how the World Wide Web is working, and we also hope that you

137
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.350 
have a lot of fun with us with the course participants in this

138
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.860 
OpenHPI course on Web Technology.

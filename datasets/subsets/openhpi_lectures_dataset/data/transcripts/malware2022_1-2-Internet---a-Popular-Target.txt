00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.980 
In our openHPI course about cyber
threats by malware,

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.390 
we start to consider the internet as
a popular target for cybercriminals.

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.270 
Why it's so easy
to misuse

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.040 
the application running in the
internet by cyber criminals.

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.270 
It starts that there are billions
of different entry points

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.290 
to the internet worldwide. We
have internet cafes,we have

7
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.640 
the system running
at home, we have

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.450 
in a company systems that are
not correctly configured. So the

9
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.790 
cybercriminals find many points
to step in, to connect to the

10
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.990 
internet and then to attack
different systems inside the internet.

11
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.830 
The internet, you remember, this is an
interconnection of millions of networks.

12
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.900 
The networks which are run
by different parties,

13
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.330 
there are different administrators possible,
also the attackers run their networks

14
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.910 
and the communication
over the internet is

15
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.800 
organized by going over

16
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.420 
different inter-connected
networks. So

17
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.950 
the attacker have a good
chance to get access

18
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
to the data that are transported over
the internet, they have a good chance

19
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.320 
to attack systems in networks that
are connected to the internet.

20
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.400 
If we look to the tools that
are used - the computers, laptops,

21
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.900 
the operating systems on this tools,
the software application, the

22
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.890 
communication protocols
in the networks -

23
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.520 
there are many design errors. They are design
errors, they are implementation errors

24
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.400 
or they are also errors in the
configuration of the systems. And all this

25
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.240 
provide vulnerabilities that can be
misused by cyber criminals.

26
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.710 
So there is a huge number of
vulnerabilities and security

27
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.180 
holes in the internet
systems which are easily

28
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.680 
misusable by cyber criminals.
There are hacking tools available,

29
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.810 
for example to perform a denial
of service attack, which are

30
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.320 
very easy to use and which can
be accessed over the internet.

31
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.300 
So if we look
to this chart,

32
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.900 
it presents some results
from studies that shows

33
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.330 
attack sophistication.
The attack sophistication

34
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.760 
increases, the knowledge
required to launch the attack

35
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.050 
decreases.

36
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.810 
So there are tools available that
can be used even by people

37
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.800 
that do not understand how these
tool in detail are working. So here

38
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.690 
this is the knowledge that's
needed in the beginning, in the

39
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.840 
eighties, in the nineties
there was a high

40
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.560 
level of experience necessary on side
of cybercriminals to perform attacks.

41
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.290 
Here you see, I

42
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.760 
mentioned some of the attack
methods. Many are based and are

43
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.610 
performed by means of
malware and meanwhile the

44
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.300 
more and more complicated attacks
can be performed by hackers with

45
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.100 
relatively low knowledge because very
powerful attack tools are available.

46
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.920 
So if we look why there are so many
security problems in the internet,

47
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.150 
we have to look back and have
considered the history of the

48
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.450 
development of the
internet. So initially,

49
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.660 
the internet has started
as a research project.

50
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.980 
So it was a discussion
how it's possible

51
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.290 
to interconnect different,
eventually even

52
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.500 
incompatible networks,

53
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.230 
to provide a network that looks,
a virtual network that looks,

54
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.260 
for the user as a homogeneous
network. So it's a great challenge

55
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.840 
of organizations the communication via
the boundary of the different heterogeneous

56
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.770 
and incompatible networks, this was the main
focus the researchers were concentrated on.

57
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.070 
It was a small researcher
community. They are familiar with

58
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.720 
each other, they trust each other.
So safety and security was not

59
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.420 
in this phase a primary consideration when
the internet protocols were developed.

60
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
You can see this in typical sentences
in the internet standards,

61
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.590 
internet standards that are the RFCs,
which says, "Security issues are

62
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.220 
addressed in this
memo, not handled."

63
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.560 
So there are no
solutions provided by the

64
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.110 
researcher. They focused on
this communication part.

65
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.950 
And then is the internet, it is a network
of independent computer networks

66
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.340 
among different
responsibilities. And then

67
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.440 
the internet this research project
immediately started that

68
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.100 
the people used it also for business
and for many applications

69
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.380 
before it was really
design finished.

70
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.130 
It was difficult later on to
improve this because there

71
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.380 
is no central internet authority.
There's no government body

72
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.510 
that can control the entire
internet and can say, for example,

73
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.670 
can insist that a dangerous
protocol within vulnerability

74
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.150 
is replaced by another protocol.
For people that are more familar

75
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.990 
with the development
of the internet, the

76
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.680 
replacement by the IP
version four, internet protocol by the

77
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.560 
internet protocol version six
run over fifteen years and

78
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.790 
it's not finished yet and this is something
which is caused by the situation

79
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.690 
that there is no central
authority for the internet, the local

80
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.820 
users, the local administrators
they connect to the internet

81
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.270 
and they are happy
to have all the

82
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.930 
communication
possibilities

83
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.570 
that are provided
by the internet.

84
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.940 
And if we look to the status
of the internet today,

85
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.720 
the internet and its communication
technologies are the key

86
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.910 
technology not only for communication,
but they are the key technology

87
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.550 
for our modern
information society.

88
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.100 
In all areas - healthcare,
education, business,

89
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.610 
government - we depend from this
internet infrastructure and

90
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.600 
the services that are
provided in the internet.

91
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.840 
So, of course, many commercial,
many private applications are

92
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.220 
run on the internet and
these are especially

93
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.950 
interesting for
the cyber

94
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.510 
criminals. So the commercial use
of the internet has led to

95
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.150 
an extreme increase
in cybercrimes

96
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.450 
which have put the following high
risk. So the computer systems

97
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.880 
themselves which the attackers try
to approach, the communication

98
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:23.140 
links and the networks
like the internet are of

99
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.500 
large interest for the
cyber attacks and

100
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:33.460 
also so called intranets in
companies and enterprises.

101
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.330 
This is the communication
infrastructure inside

102
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:44.020 
a company which is organised
in the same way like the internet.

103
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.610 
And of course users. There are many
users with more or less knowledge.

104
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.980 
So there are different attack
points on the internet.

105
00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:02.850 
Internet and internet based systems have
many risks and numerous attack points.

106
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.810 
So for example the computer system
itself - the PCs, the laptops,

107
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.640 
the smartphones, the tablets
could be attacked.

108
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.040 
When these systems are
connected to the internet,

109
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.870 
a new number
of risks

110
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.760 
become serious in the internet,
in intermediate

111
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.100 
systems of the internet - these
are systems which are needed

112
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.160 
to run the internet but which are systems
that are very attractive for cyber

113
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:45.670 
criminals. Then within private networks
of a company, of institutions,

114
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:52.980 
of our home networks the new
internet technologies and the

115
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.700 
intranet technologies - this is
internet technology inside

116
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.770 
the walls of an company, they
are very attractive and provide

117
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.260 
a huge number of risks that can
be misused by cyber criminals.

118
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.520 
So the attacks via the
internet, we already discussed

119
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.990 
this, are easy
to execute.

120
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:23.330 
They have relative low detection
rates compared to physical attacks

121
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:30.970 
and they are difficult to trace. So if
you are attacked from an IP address

122
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.850 
then it's quite sure that it's not
the IP address of the attacker.

123
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.860 
Typically it's ur machines
that are corporate by

124
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.520 
the cybercriminals,
that are misused

125
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.080 
for running
such attacks.

126
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.780 
So the attractiveness and the
opportunities of attacks on the internet

127
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:04.560 
are high because the internet has
become a central infrastructure

128
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.670 
of our modern society.

129
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:13.630 
So the complexity of the internet, of its
protocols, of its systems, of its application

130
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:20.770 
is constantly increasing. So mistakes
and new vulnerabilities occur.

131
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.780 
Our dependence on the
internet, as humans our

132
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:32.570 
dependence on the internet, of companies, in
industry, in business, in state administration

133
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.960 
and society is becoming
increasingly extensive

134
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:43.730 
and attackers are well prepared. They
are organized, they have powerful

135
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.620 
hacking tools that are
easy to access and so,

136
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:56.840 
for the attackers not difficult
to attack systems which are

137
00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.910 
connected to the internet. The attack
tools are increasingly sophisticated,

138
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.990 
they are easier to use,
you can order an attack

139
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.280 
in the darknet
for a few

140
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:15.970 
amount of money and the attacks
become even more massive.

141
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:24.960 
The rapid growth on the other side, in e-commerce,
in online gaming, streaming video

142
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:29.290 
and audio services, in social
medias. these make it

143
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:38.460 
attractive for the attackers to attack and
to use these means for their purposes.

144
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.850 
So the absence, the lack of
awareness of information security,

145
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.920 
that people are not aware what could
happen, that they are not carefully

146
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.340 
configuring their system, that they
are not careful in the user system,

147
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.590 
that a qualified person for
information security is rare, so

148
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.050 
it's difficult for the
companies to hire

149
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.920 
system administrators. So the
global situation of the internet

150
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:15.300 
make it difficult to regulate,
to say this is allowed, this is

151
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.010 
forbidden because
in the different

152
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:23.040 
nations, in the different
areas of the world different regulations

153
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.240 
are in place. In some context there
are even no regulation yet.

154
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:35.090 
And even if one has a regulation,
the lack of power to enforce

155
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.020 
such regulations -
all this

156
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.030 
make it easier
for the cyber

157
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.380 
criminals to do
their bad work.

158
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.830 
And then the
rapid development

159
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.910 
cycle in computer
software,

160
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.310 
in computer hardware,

161
00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.110 
there are many new offers
created in short time to

162
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:08.590 
attract customers, to attract people and
also systems came with

163
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:16.220 
vulnerabilities. So the vulnerabilities that
can be misused by cyber criminals

164
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.140 
for their attacks

165
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.560 
and to misuse such an vulnerability
that's called exploit.

166
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.470 
So the majority
of attacks

167
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.280 
exploits known vulnerabilities
for where the countermeasures

168
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.530 
could have been possible but people
do not update their systems,

169
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.980 
they are not careful enough
because such an update

170
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:50.320 
typically closes such vulnerabilities,
makes it no more misusable.

171
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:57.540 
This is why the internet is a
popular target for cybercriminals

172
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.140 
and that's the
reason that we

173
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.290 
should know this,
we should

174
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.550 
be able to understand how
such attacks are performed

175
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:15.510 
and to secure our systems against
such attacks and exactly

176
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:21.780 
that's the reason what we want to do in this
course by speaking about cyber threats

177
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.890 
that are organized, that are performed
by malicious software - by malware.

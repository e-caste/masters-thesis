00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150 
greetings everyone. i'm really wonderful to have you all here

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.310 
for our first session

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.620 
of the learning at scale conference perspectives from north America.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.390 
my name is justin reich, i'm the chair of this session.

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390 
i'm also the steering committee chair for learning at scale.

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.390 
so i just wanted to take a moment to offer my very sincere thanks

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.910 
to Thomas and the whole team at openHPI

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.580 
for putting together such a terrific event.

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.380 
and then to maher and marcus and Amy for doing a really fabulous

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.090 
job as program chairs putting together a really terrific program

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.720 
for this event, so as you all know who participate in these

12
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.630 
things. there's a lot of work that comes together

13
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.270 
to make a great event. and we're just thrilled that we can finally

14
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.790 
all be here together virtually to be able to enjoy it.

15
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.580 
so we've got four papers today and the way that i would frame them,

16
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.620 
is to some extent say all four of them kind of assume a certain steady state in online learning

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.840 
that there's going to be a learning management system.

18
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.780 
there's gonna be some learning experiences or students

19
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.690 
showing up, and then they each have really interesting ways.

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.880 
and really interesting perspectives about how to move things forward.

21
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.580 
so the first couple of papers are gonna talk to us about hinting and tutoring,

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.610 
about personalized ways of doing that about automated ways,

23
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.410 
about crowdsource ways of doing that.

24
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.090 
in the third paper we're going to see how we can extend these systems

25
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.250 
through experimentation and iteration and personalization.

26
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.280 
and in the last paper from david joiner's group. David Joyner

27
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.810 
who i should also thank as my co-chair of the steering committee

28
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
talked about how we can improve socialisation

29
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.950 
in the system. so i think we're going to find a lot of connections.

30
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.970 
and opportunities for overlap.

31
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.660 
and I want to turn it over to andrew only from the university of memphis

32
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.180 
to present our first paper.

33
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.970 
thank you, so apologies for my backgrounds, it seems to be very

34
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.490 
sensitive on the illumination of my screen. so uh greetings,

35
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.670 
my name is andrew ohmi. i'm a professor at the university of memphis.

36
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.320 
the paper i'm presenting is titled generating response specific

37
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.760 
elaborated feedback using long form neural question answering.

38
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.210 
so the key problem this work addresses is how to help students

39
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.320 
when they make mistakes.
so this kind of help is commonly called feedback.

40
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
and it comes in many flavors like telling the student
they are incorrect,

41
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.080 
telling them the answer,

42
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.940 
or explaining the mistake to them which is called elaborated feedback.

43
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.590 
so there have been various meta-analyses that show elaborated feedback is better.

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.610 
but unfortunately, it's harder for e-learning to implement,

45
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.900 
because there's just so many ways to be wrong. and you need to provide

46
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.930 
feedback for each one of them, as a result it needs to be dynamic.

47
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.030 
you can't just precompute all of that.

48
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.460 
so in this paper we use a question answering approach

49
00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.710 
where given a test item, like this which is a close item,

50
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
and an incorrect student answer like this.

51
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.770 
we can generate an elaborated feedback which is shown in green here

52
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.810 
using long form neural question answering. so the first part of that.

53
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.010 
that's not green is telling them you know, it's incorrect.

54
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.540 
and what the correct answer is.
so we're focusing on the elaborated feedback.

55
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.960 
and to do this we construct a synthetic question shown in yellow

56
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
which represents a question that perhaps the student should

57
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.680 
have asked, but didn't write and the green portion is the system's

58
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.390 
answer to that question.
so the remainder of this talk will describe this approach

59
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.380 
and an ablation style evaluation using expert human judges.

60
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.110 
so the jumping-off point for this work is the explain
like on five task.

61
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.480 
this is modeled of a form on reddit. you may have seen it.

62
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.060 
it's quite a lot of fun the rules of this form specify that responses to questions

63
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.480 
are explanations not answers. so a real explanation of paragraph

64
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.420 
explanation and it needs to be accessible to lay people.

65
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.470 
the eli five task is one form of one type of long form question answering.

66
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.990 
and in  this type of task, it's open domain.

67
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.140 
it's can be on any topic.

68
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.870 
and the way that these systems work these long form open domain systems work,

69
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.540 
is they typically have two models. one is a retriever model,

70
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.250 
and its job is to get relevant documents.

71
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.930 
and then there is a reader model and the reader model takes those documents,

72
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.920 
reads them and generates an answer.

73
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.360 
thus a dataset for the eli five task consists of the questions.

74
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.220 
and answers scraped from the reddit forum.

75
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.580 
and supporting web documents from common krol.

76
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.310 
so here's an example from the dataset,

77
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.370 
how do jellyfish function without brains or nervous systems.

78
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.030 
you can see the supporting documents that were retrieved.

79
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.030 
and you can see the answer that this system constructed and

80
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.940 
the baseline model published in

81
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.280 
the paper that introduced this. and it's kind of neat, because it

82
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.530 
preset the answer addresses a presupposition of the question which is incorrect.

83
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.950 
so you know, it's potentially pretty cool.

84
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.020 
it is pretty cool.

85
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
okay, so here's a conceptual model for the reader,

86
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.560 
retriever reader model described in the last slide.

87
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.870 
so you know for this work we are interested in how we consume

88
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.330 
this for elaborated feedback.

89
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.070 
so our approach is to leave the models alone. so we're just

90
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.210 
taking off the shelf models. and the reason for that is that

91
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.730 
we don't have training data for feedback ,for this elaborated feedback.

92
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.020 
so instead what we do is intervene on the model io which is

93
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.020 
shown here in the yellow arrows.

94
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.290 
so for the question we use a fixed synthetic question on the

95
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.850 
relationship between the incorrect answer a and

96
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.990 
the correct answer b.

97
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.060 
for documents we retrieve from a course textbook in the normal way

98
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.570 
using elastic search. but inject documents we think would be useful

99
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.590 
for feedback including definitions, and also the test item that was missed.

100
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.270 
we also filter documents that are missing either a or b on

101
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.030 
the premiss they're not relevant to the relationship between them.

102
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.900 
and then for answer we filter out sentences that don't contain a or b

103
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.720 
on the premise they're not relevant to the answer.

104
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.190 
so in the ablation style evaluation that we're going to do

105
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.320 
these last four steps of document answer are what we're going

106
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.670 
to turn on and off. but the question is always going to remain
the same,

107
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.450 
what is the relationship.

108
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.680 
let's talk about the evaluation.

109
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.340 
so really the way we developed this approach was just looking

110
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.300 
at a small number of test cases and just playing around with it.

111
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.060 
so we conducted an ablation style human evaluation study focusing

112
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.410 
on the four steps that i mentioned on the last slide

113
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.490 
at the document answer stages. so we therefore had sixteen conditions,

114
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.700 
where we turned each one of these on or off.

115
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.550 
and then these were presented in a survey with eighty

116
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.590 
real items to rate. so each item looking like this on the right

117
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.610 
hand side of the slide.

118
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.190 
so that there were five items per condition.

119
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.150 
so sixteen times five.

120
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.290 
and these were counterbalanced in a latin square.

121
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.100 
additionally there were twenty control items which are just degraded real items.

122
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.720 
and the purpose of these was to filter out readers who are not consistent.

123
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.250 
so if readers did not score significantly lower on the degraded items

124
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.840 
that we considered them to have low internal reliability and excluded them.

125
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.480 
so as shown on the right hand slide, there are two ratings that

126
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.250 
were performed.

127
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.310 
each measured on a hundred point slider,

128
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.250 
so one was explanation correct and informative and the other

129
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.570 
is the explanation grammatical influent.

130
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.060 
participants were thirty nurses or doctors,

131
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.430 
and this was done because we wanted people who are experts
in the domain.

132
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.680 
and the domain that we evaluated in anatomy and physiology.

133
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.060 
the generator agreement was very high over point eight three.

134
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.910 
in many cases it was in the point nine or higher.

135
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.790 
so we used mix effects beta regression to evaluate the effects of the interventions.

136
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.160 
and for correct and informative ratings we found that definition

137
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.950 
only was the best condition in terms of absolute score.

138
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.390 
and we found that definitions and test items significantly improved ratings.

139
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:13.180 
but we also found that filtering documents and answer
sentences decreased ratings,

140
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.900 
which was interesting.

141
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.140 
for grammatical and fluid, we saw a similar pattern.

142
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.770 
so definition only was the best condition an absolute score.

143
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.420 
and we found that definitions significantly improved ratings a little bit.

144
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.320 
and filtering documents significantly decreased ratings quite a bit.

145
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.050 
so our results overall was that the feedback was generally rated

146
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.090 
quite highly. this is a distribution of the feedback scores

147
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.430 
for fluency and meaning and pink and blue

148
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.130 
respectively. and you can see the medians indicated by the dash
lines.

149
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.090 
so you're generally talking about median ratings of

150
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.800 
point seven five or higher.

151
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.510 
and we generally found that providing more documents was helpful.

152
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.130 
i either helped a lot or a little bit. and we generally found

153
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.470 
that providing fewer documents or taking away documents was harmful.

154
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.430 
and i suspect the reason for this is that

155
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.930 
there just isn't enough information being provided to the model.

156
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.700 
the model seems to do a much better job of

157
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.860 
paying attention to the right things and ignoring the wrong things.

158
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.770 
so it's better just to give a lot of stuff that may be slightly

159
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.460 
off topic. and it'll just ignore it, rather than not give it enough.

160
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.090 
so in conclusion we presented an approach to generating elaborated

161
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:40.790 
feedback using neural long-form question answering.
and a human ablation evaluation study.

162
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.070 
the feedback was generally rated highly.

163
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.870 
and we're currently using this in a college mp course.

164
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.480 
so this has been deployed since january. it seems to be going, ok.

165
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.840 
and the approach is general and only requires indexing a textbook

166
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.450 
using something like elastic search which is

167
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.310 
just an off-the-shelf product and indexing doesn't take more than

168
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.040 
maybe an hour. and that's it. any questions?

169
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.010 
thanks, so much andrew i saw neil kind of pop up at the last there.

170
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.610 
and start looking up what you're saying there.

171
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.360 
so why don't i ask a question then,

172
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.970 
this wicked cool andrew. actually i'm like holy cow so you actually do

173
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.290 
this really detailed two by two by two by two sort of thing.

174
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.540 
i've grabbed each one of those things inside of those two by twos.

175
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.440 
do you get reliable differences between these

176
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.000 
main effects?

177
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.400 
yeah, yeah, so we are getting differences between them.

178
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.220 
so the way that we did this is that it's repeated measures,

179
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.130 
so there's quite a bit of power, right.

180
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.680 
so for each person experiences every condition five times.

181
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.870 
so there's a lot of replication.

182
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.280 
now it's entirely possible because of the overall small size

183
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.020 
number of experts that we use that we could have detected even more differences,

184
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.420 
if we had more power like interactions.

185
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.090 
so you know we weren't really in a position to do that,
but for main effects.

186
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.300 
yeah that's impressive. thank you, sir.

187
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.610 
just as an aside the evaluation is very closely modeled off

188
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.040 
of evaluations that are done in machine translation.

189
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.930 
so i expert human judges evaluating those and so we use something

190
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.660 
called the direct assessment paradigm which came out of

191
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.430 
that literature.

192
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.640 
anybody else have a question for Andrew?

193
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.210 
can i just clarify something that i was little.

194
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.380 
experts making their assertions.

195
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.110 
that's about how convincing the explanation is,
or the quality of the explanation,

196
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.900 
or is there any giving it to a student like in the college course

197
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:05.500 
do you know, like how more effective the neural generated stuff is?

198
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.990 
yeah that's an interesting question. so one thing that we didn't

199
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:14.150 
do in this work that i regretted after doing it and

200
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:19.390 
then looking getting some reviews back is we didn't have experts create explanations.

201
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.940 
and so it makes it hard to score against humans.

202
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.270 
so we're missing that that baseline.
so we have these absolute scores.

203
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.490 
but it's hard to compare to humans. and say ok well how much

204
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.850 
like as a score of seventy five point seven five,

205
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.710 
how much better is that or worse is that than human.

206
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.650 
and we didn't do that. now i can tell you maybe as an aside

207
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.300 
with some hand-waving that in another paper that we did an AI ad

208
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.530 
that we presented. last week using very similar

209
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.920 
techniques we found that the fluency was on par with humans,

210
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.340 
because at that time we did have a human comparison.

211
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.780 
so i think what we're seeing with the outputs of these models

212
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.540 
is the language is very good tends to be very fluid.

213
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.060 
but if you're an expert in the domain.

214
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.350 
you know what is and is not correct.

215
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.640 
you can read some of the explanations and see that they're the wrong,

216
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.460 
right, they're missing something.

217
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.750 
so injury of a question the chat from door I,

218
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.410 
who says i'm just dipping my toes in nlp how is this different

219
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.660 
from the nlp q and a systems and of course we love all kinds

220
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.420 
of toe dippers at the learning in scale conference.

221
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.510 
we're all dipping our toes into something else.
so it could help us just

222
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.810 
for norm that a bit and provide some reference force, andrew?

223
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.820 
yeah, so it's very similar, because it's based of a q a system

224
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:48.320 
right. so it's based of the explain like i'm five or a q a system.

225
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:55.330 
so we're just using that q a system, but we're using it to provide dynamic feedback.

226
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.490 
so instead of people just coming up with some random question

227
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.600 
like i showed an example from their dataset,

228
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:05.870 
like how do jellyfish operate without brains or something like that.

229
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.940 
instead what we're doing is we're waiting for student to make

230
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.530 
mistake or make a mistake in a learning system.

231
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.440 
then we're taking that mistake and we're converting it into a question.

232
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.190 
and then we're using running that question through a

233
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.290 
q and a system to get a response. so and we try different things

234
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.240 
to try to improve the quality of that response right.

235
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.850 
we're all really what the paper is mostly about.

236
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.760 
it's the things the general idea and the things that
we tried that didn't that did not work

237
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.340 
in order to create a better response for explaining the error.

238
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.360 
and helping them learn.  andrew love,

239
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.120 
let's, thank you, and i will be the official klapper

240
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.090 
for this session. but anybody else is welcome too.

241
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.510 
but we're going to give you just like we gave neil.
so the right of first response to your paper.

242
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.910 
we're gonna give you the right of first response to the wp team.

243
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.480 
because i think there could be an interesting dialogue here

244
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.950 
between these approaches. but then let's turn it over to you

245
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.790 
for the second paper here which is another approach

246
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.350 
to hinting at tutoring and supporting students. but this time

247
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.010 
through crowdsourcing and then the personalization of those crowd sourcing approaches.

248
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:18.080 
so hi, i'm Ethan i work in the assistants lab at WPI and i'm going to present

249
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.550 
my our paper towards personalizing students education with crowdsourced tutoring.

250
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.590 
so some background, assistance is an online learning platform.

251
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.860 
i kind of developed with the lab at WPI and we focus on k

252
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.780 
through twelve math education. and just as an example this is

253
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.870 
what it looks like when a students using assessments,

254
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.550 
they are presented with a question. they get to put in their answers.

255
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.180 
they can submit the answers sometimes they get feedback.

256
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.360 
and after students complete their work teachers are given reports

257
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.040 
on how students did and they can use that to adjust their lesson

258
00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:01.510 
plans and what not. so some problems and assistance have tutoring

259
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.920 
available upon request for students that are struggling.

260
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:11.990 
so for the last few years we've been aggregating more and more of these

261
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:18.120 
hints and explanations from teachers through a platform that

262
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.420 
was developed by fan porn patti korn who's

263
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.850 
a recent graduate of our lab. and the platform is called teacher assist. and

264
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:32.720 
it's a crowdsourcing platform for these hints and explanations.

265
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.840 
you can see in these images examples of what the tutoring looks like when teachers make it.

266
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:43.450 
so this teacher has broken down their their tutoring into a series of hints

267
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.810 
that kind of gradually tell the student how to solve the problem,

268
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.410 
whereas this other tutoring is just one big explanation that

269
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:52.860 
explains everything all at once.

270
00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:03.660 
so last year at lac we compiled the results from our original teacher assist study.

271
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.310 
and we found that in an intent to treat analysis and a

272
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:13.990 
treated analysis that giving students these crowdsourced explanations

273
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.130 
had a positive effect on their learning.

274
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:23.150 
so that seems obvious, but we were nervous about it at the time.

275
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.470 
because there's always the chance that a teacher that we don't i mean we

276
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.660 
the teachers who we selected like we know that they're at least

277
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:37.180 
like trained to be teachers. but maybe if you give students a variety of

278
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.610 
different types of explanations. it confuses them maybe

279
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.750 
there's some sort of barrier on like a socio-economic level

280
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.820 
that we didn't think about there were plenty  of things that

281
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.180 
could have gone wrong with the original study.

282
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.590 
but it worked. so then we said alright great. it seems like these crowdsourcing

283
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.460 
these crowdsourced explanations are effective.

284
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:05.650 
let's see how we're doing again. so because of covid and

285
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.950 
the large transition to remote learning we ended up having

286
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:15.180 
a lot more data than in our previous study to kind of do a replication study.

287
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:21.120 
and doing the same thing we did last year. first we found that

288
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.280 
it still had a significant positive effect on students' learning.

289
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.410 
and we were able to see more positive differences than we could before,

290
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.410 
like we can see even in an intent to treat

291
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:38.420 
an analysis that there was slightly and it's so slight that

292
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.640 
you don't actually see it with just two digits.

293
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.590 
a slight decrease in how often students requested

294
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:50.600 
tutoring after seeing tutoring previously. and a slight increase in the

295
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:55.640 
correctness on the next problem that the student was asked after

296
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.250 
being given tutoring. that i'll say right now. that's generally

297
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.830 
how we evaluate the effectiveness of tutoring. it because assignments

298
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.460 
are on the same topic and if they get the problem wrong, and

299
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.040 
then they get a hint. and then they get the next problem right,

300
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.390 
we think to ourselves, ok next problem was right, that's good.

301
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.030 
probably means the hint was helpful.

302
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.940 
so after we confirmed the results of the previous year's study.

303
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.350 
we wanted to take a deeper look and we wanted to see,
if there were any differences

304
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.050 
in the quality of different content creators tutoring.

305
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.140 
so we had to tackle this problem have lots of different content creators

306
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:43.520 
made explanations and tutoring
and stuff for a lot of different problems,

307
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:48.670 
and a lot of different students used those. so even though we were randomizing

308
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.860 
which content was given to which student.

309
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:58.350 
there was still a lot of difference in kind of the problems
and students that this content was being used for.

310
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.910 
so we couldn't just add problem

311
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:08.170 
IDs and student IDs into our model, because there would

312
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.110 
be more variables than we have data points.

313
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:16.170 
so to get around it, we created features for students and problems.

314
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.820 
so that if a student is a particularly high quality,

315
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.940 
that's probably not a great way to say it,

316
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.690 
if the student has high prior knowledge,

317
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:32.070 
then we'll know it, because now we're recording their mean correctness

318
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.770 
on all problems they've completed. so then if the student gets

319
00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.170 
the next problem correct, we can kind of balance that with well.

320
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.260 
how much of that should we attribute to this particular content creators' tutoring.

321
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.130 
and how much should we attribute that to

322
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.040 
the students prior knowledge. and same for problems,

323
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.960 
if there's a particularly difficult or easy problem
we want to take that into account.

324
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.070 
so by abstracting the students on the problems with these

325
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:01.020 
features, it gives us a better sense of how effective the tutoring is.

326
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.540 
so then we fit our model,

327
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:10.990 
it's just a basic least-squares regression with the

328
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.430 
kind of covariates for problems and students, and then one hot encoded variables

329
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.840 
for each of the teachers. i've just given them letters here

330
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.270 
to make things easy instead of their actual long IDs.

331
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.730 
the chat is blowing up, to someone want to interrupt with

332
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.300 
something, because you're welcome.

333
00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.500 
i'll ping you a thing. and i'll keep an eye.

334
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.430 
so this gives you a.

335
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:43.560 
so the what we found is that there were five teachers that

336
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.110 
had a statistically significant differences when their tutoring

337
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.180 
was given as opposed to if no tutoring was given.

338
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:56.090 
and of those five one of them actually has a significantly

339
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.610 
worse effect on students' next problem correctness than if

340
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.570 
the students had been given no tutoring at all. so that's like

341
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:07.430 
a red flag we probably shouldn't be giving this content creators'

342
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:12.710 
tutoring to students anymore.
but the other four have a reliably positive effect,

343
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:16.690 
compared to the control condition. and that's important. because

344
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:21.210 
all we know from this is that you know, f is better than control,

345
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.930 
and g is better than control,
but just because f has a higher coefficient than g,

346
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.010 
doesn't mean that i can say f is better than g. because this

347
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:36.160 
p value, it's only considering the variance of like this variable

348
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.690 
relative to the control having no tutoring at all. so if we want to say

349
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.020 
is f better than g, we have to look at the variance, covariance matrix,

350
00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:50.070 
and calculate those p values for pretty much every teacher

351
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.610 
compared to every other teacher. so we did that.

352
00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:57.830 
because we also want to say is there an opportunity

353
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.470 
here. if we're given two different teachers tutoring to say,

354
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.430 
well we should pick this teacher over this teacher,
because they're reliably better.

355
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.540 
and when you sort from best to worst you get this. and so the

356
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:15.820 
green cells here represent that teacher f is reliably better than teacher c,

357
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.390 
and teacher g and teachers j i and b. but they're not reliably

358
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:24.550 
better than e which is interesting right.

359
00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:29.810 
because e isn't even reliably better than control,
but there's so much variance on e's

360
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.530 
unlike the next problem correctness after getting e's tutoring

361
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.360 
that we can't make a claim that f is better than e.

362
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:46.910 
but this is neat,
because we can now at least begin to more intelligently select

363
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.590 
different tutor strategies, if they're available instead of

364
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.580 
just randomly picking which is what we have done so far,

365
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.230 
so that we could do a randomized control study.

366
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.940 
so then we went a little bit farther. and we said well is there

367
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.630 
any opportunities for personalisation. so in assistance we've

368
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.560 
found a little bit of evidence in previous work that you could

369
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.700 
personalize the type of tutoring students receive based on
their prior knowledge.

370
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.950 
so we found that like in one study a while ago high knowledge

371
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.060 
students prefer getting all the information at once while prefer

372
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.130 
meaning they were more successful after getting all the information at once,

373
00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.980 
whereas the low knowledge students tended to perform better

374
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.580 
after receiving a step by step broken down

375
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:38.480 
explanation. so we split the data between high knowledge and

376
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.610 
low knowledge students and then we do this

377
00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.410 
variance fit again. and for a personal further really to be

378
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.020 
evidence that we could personalize you would need to find that

379
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.360 
these kind of inverse cells

380
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.270 
are both green. and you can see that there was never actually

381
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.070 
a case where that occurred, at least when we split on knowledge.

382
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.830 
because here we know okay well f is better than
c for high knowledge students,

383
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.100 
if we're looking at the red squares right.

384
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.320 
but c is not better than f for low knowledge, so it would still

385
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.780 
be better just to give f every time. in the blue cell you see

386
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.630 
like k is not better than a a. a is not better than k,
there's really no difference.

387
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.710 
and for the yellow you can see that for low knowledge students

388
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:25.750 
h writes better content than i. but vise versa doesn't apply.

389
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.690 
i doesn't write better content than h, when you're given high

390
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.900 
knowledge. so we might as well just give h his every time,

391
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.190 
so when splitting on prior knowledge and when looking at the

392
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.210 
other variables. but i think high in our prior knowledge is

393
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.620 
kind of the most likely. so i focus on that one here.

394
00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.920 
there's not any significant not any opportunities yet for personalisation.

395
00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.490 
but we don't want to stop,
because we know that the crowdsourced

396
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.840 
tutoring is effective overall. we know that we can say some

397
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.340 
content creators are better than control. some are worse than

398
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.780 
control. and some are better worse than each other.

399
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:03.070 
and while we haven't been able to personalize specifically

400
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.740 
on the content creator.

401
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.690 
we haven't been able to personalize which content creator we give

402
00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:14.110 
based on features of students. but there might be in the future

403
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.180 
opportunities to personalize based on the content themselves.

404
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.550 
some teachers make videos some teachers make those broken out

405
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.570 
step by step, hence so there's still a lot of opportunity that

406
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.440 
we can look for to personalize. and to that end we're currently building out

407
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.440 
a little bit of a reinforcement learning system to kind of do that work.

408
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.050 
but that's this is all for now.
so thank you, thank you for your time.

409
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.510 
i'm happy to take some questions.

410
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.120 
thanks Ethan, thanks your team.

411
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.930 
and anything strike you seeing this kind of alternative approach

412
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.610 
where there are questions or observations that you're thinking about

413
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.260 
in terms of comparing

414
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.240 
trying to have an lp methods generates minis hinting versus people.

415
00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.570 
yeah, so it was really great presentation, and i could ask worthen

416
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.010 
one question, but i think

417
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.260 
the question i would most like to ask is on this personalization aspect.

418
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.390 
so you know there's so many ways to personalize,

419
00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.870 
and one way that you sometimes see that's often connected more

420
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.130 
to motivation research than cognitive research

421
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.690 
is taking things that the student is interested in.

422
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.610 
and so i guess, i'm wondering in terms of what you're thinking

423
00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.440 
about like the landscape

424
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.930 
of possibilities for personalization
where you think the best direction is

425
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:44.230 
to go. so right now we are looking into personalizing

426
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:51.530 
based  of indicators of how the student has performed in the past.

427
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.850 
and how much experience they have with our platform,

428
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.280 
things like demographics we have a little bit of information on.

429
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.790 
but it really only comes from their school district.

430
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.360 
so like we know, if their school district is in

431
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.120 
an opportunity zone which is like a legal phrase for an area

432
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.810 
that that's pretty much low income.

433
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.310 
we are, it's hard for us

434
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.490 
to do some type of personalization based off of students personality

435
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.500 
or interest or socio-economic status.

436
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.070 
because we run into this

437
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:37.600 
ethical dilemma of psychological studies show,

438
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.610 
if you force people to kind of report on their demographics and stuff,

439
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.540 
then it tends to bias them

440
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.010 
performance wise, so like i think specifically the example was like,

441
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.440 
if you ask girls, if they're girls and then you give them math

442
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.760 
tests. they're going to do worse, because they've heard before

443
00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.920 
that girls are worse at math right.

444
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.680 
so we try to keep our knowledge

445
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.610 
on students kind of as anonymous and general as possible.

446
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.930 
and it mostly comes down to just we only have what we know from

447
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.790 
how they perform in the tutor.

448
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.120 
interesting. maybe i'll just like share something from my paper.

449
00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.950 
that's maybe consistent with yours and that is

450
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.050 
actually using the specific error that they made and injecting that

451
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:33.030 
helped. but it didn't help very much and just giving giving everybody

452
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.770 
an explanation

453
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.250 
that was not sensitive to the specific error they made,

454
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.740 
seemed to be he said i mean that seems just to be sufficient like,

455
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.180 
if you confuse these two things.
it doesn't matter when you what context

456
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.720 
you confuse the men we can just give you one explanation feedback.

457
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.150 
and that seems to help. so yeah, but it is really interesting

458
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.910 
to think about what you could do if you had more information.

459
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:04.100 
and i wonder if there's things that you could do that wouldn't necessarily

460
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:08.460 
cross the line that you're talking about.
might be interesting to talk about.

461
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.750 
i mean even that is interesting, like i hadn't even thought

462
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.820 
about using the actual text of their answers

463
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:21.150 
to a create features for students,
like i've mostly just been using like

464
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.940 
were they correct what kind of problems are they right or wrong

465
00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.360 
on. but not like specifically what were they wrong about.

466
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.650 
and i know you said that only helps a little bit, but

467
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.890 
a little bit. but it could help like you've got such a huge ad.

468
00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.290 
it could really

469
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.050 
you know you're in a good position to explore even small effects like that.

470
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.430 
so, yeah that's a great idea. thanks.

471
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.120 
there's a few questions in the chat and maybe some of them

472
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.960 
that some of the folks on the wpi team can just kind of hit.

473
00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.390 
as they're going on responding in the chat maybe just one quick

474
00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:59.820 
one, even remind us, what's the domain in which you perform these

475
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.590 
experiments in?

476
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.520 
math education is that what you mean. yeah.

477
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.250 
so these are all mostly middle school math kinds of things school,

478
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.880 
math questions they look like this, where it's just a find the

479
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.040 
area of this polygon or they look like this where it says.

480
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:20.020 
hey, do some basic you know ratio type stuff,

481
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:25.610 
ratios and angles this kind of stuff.

482
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.030 
i'm going to jump in with a question.

483
00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:41.090 
was good i think most of the rest of the ones are chatter either

484
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.620 
being addressed, or they're

485
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:52.330 
or they're, time for another question yeah yeah, one more.

486
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.690 
all right. thanks for the talk really insightful.

487
00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:02.100 
the approach taken was to look at the effectiveness of each of the tutors.

488
00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.610 
and i'm wondering if looking at the actual content rather than

489
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.630 
the person might give you better results, because it's taking

490
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:14.870 
the idea that everything that one person made is either effective
or not effective,

491
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.910 
which may not necessarily be the case that the quality of everything

492
00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:22.980 
that one person makes is the same.
so if you drill down into the actual content

493
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.770 
of the response rather than the person.

494
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.750 
i'm wondering if that might give a different answer a better answer?

495
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.690 
yeah, we also wonder this. that's kind of what we're looking

496
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.830 
into now. this first step here is like, hey,

497
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.410 
is there any evidence that some people are better or worse,

498
00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.600 
right? because that gives us some very immediate practical insight

499
00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:49.050 
to just say like, hey ok. maybe maybe let's stop crowd-sourcing from teacher b,

500
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.760 
which you know it isn't fair. i don't want to trash on teacher

501
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.070 
b. teacher b is not an actual teacher, teacher b is a collection

502
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.190 
of miscellaneous summer higher college students.

503
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:07.290 
so when i am address there no teacher here that's actually,

504
00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.200 
hurting their students with their explanations.

505
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:15.190 
but that all the college students just use the same account and rote explanations.

506
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:21.160 
but anyway yeah, i mean we've done studies and assessments where we showed that

507
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:25.790 
video or text was more effective for certain problem sets.

508
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.140 
and i think like you what you said about the content might

509
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.530 
not be equal for each problem. there might even be opportunities

510
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.280 
for personalization specifically to the problem instead of the student,

511
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:42.280 
like maybe one teacher is like great at geometry,

512
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.350 
but not very good at calculus or something.

513
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.700 
so we want to use their geometry explanations,
but not their calculus ones.

514
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.820 
so in addition to everything else Ethan you've created

515
00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.410 
synthetic metal humans, that's incredible.

516
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:03.240 
we'll give the last question over to René and then we're going

517
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.780 
to move on to the next topic, i'll read for you.

518
00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.750 
how consistent are the teachers in terms of these aggregate

519
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.420 
effects, all the video's good, they're just on average?

520
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:19.420 
just on average. i think, it's i think what we can see

521
00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:25.690 
from the difference between this graph where we can say like,
ok these are better than control right ?

522
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:31.950 
and if all of these results were really consistent.

523
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.850 
then when we go to this graph we would probably see a much

524
00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.010 
like it. it would be half green right it would be like oh this

525
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.260 
teacher is better than all these other you'd have this perfect

526
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.740 
split where like the top triangle is all green.

527
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.850 
and the bottom triangle is all gray right,

528
00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:54.090 
like it was perfect, if everybody was like exactly that

529
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.790 
effective and all of these deviations were really really narrow.

530
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.420 
but you can see that's not the case. there's really only

531
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:06.140 
a few teachers that are consistently better than other teachers.

532
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.870 
and it's only i and b that that they're consistently better

533
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:16.410 
than. and that's i is not reliably worse than control,

534
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.860 
but the coefficient is where so on average. they're worse.

535
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:23.580 
and b which is the reliably worse than average teacher.

536
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:31.100 
so i would say that there's a good amount of noise.

537
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.230 
it probably depends a lot on the type of problem the type of student.

538
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.630 
but even so that we can really only make a couple claims about

539
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.990 
when people are actually better.

540
00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.970 
if i may follow up very briefly on that point.
it's very interesting and i

541
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.610 
suggest that there's an opportunity to give feedback to the

542
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:50.970 
teachers as to which of their videos were effective which ones

543
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:56.020 
were not so much that could then drive better videos in the future,

544
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.660 
and maybe create more opportunities for personalization to work out in

545
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:04.350 
the ways that you were trying to find it might be a feedback loop for teachers

546
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.840 
that could be valuable here, too. yeah i think that's a

547
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.810 
great idea. i think neil has this dream of being able to integrate

548
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:16.780 
some sort of a stack overflow ask platform into assistants

549
00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.160 
where teachers can kind of crowdsource and like see each other's

550
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.010 
work. and you know how stack overflow has points.

551
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.660 
so being able to incorporate somehow a feedback loop is a great

552
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.420 
idea and i do think we will probably try to pursue that at some point.

553
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:35.280 
so thanks, terrific well thanks ethan for a really great presentation.

554
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.960 
congratulations the wpi team for another really wonderful contribution.

555
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.770 
and i think we'll turn it now to murray and colleagues at Toronto

556
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.380 
and cased and maybe a couple of other places.

557
00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.340 
but i think we're going to have a pre-recorded video for them.

558
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.080 
so sebastian i think we can we can turn it to you.

559
00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.840 
instructors platform developers experimental researchers and

560
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.320 
data mining or machine learning researchers in education often wonder,

561
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:16.950 
how can we keep improving an online course?
even after it is deployed to students.

562
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.530 
how can we develop identify and deliver better versions of

563
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:22.860 
course content over time?

564
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.130 
how can we personalize the learning experience of students

565
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.430 
based on their characteristics,

566
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.890 
when new ideas for improvement arise, how can we systematically

567
00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.150 
test these ideas out, and incorporate them into real world online

568
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.650 
courses quickly and efficiently?

569
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.160 
our answer is the euclid framework,

570
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.770 
a novel software architecture that enables experimentation,

571
00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.760 
machine learning and human driven improvement and personalization

572
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:49.770 
by augmenting front-end components of real world educational interfaces

573
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.920 
with back-end api and databases.

574
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.440 
redesign these API and databases, such that course content can

575
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.570 
be flexibly adapted by instructors and researchers,

576
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:02.770 
as they explore new ideas data, analysis techniques, and algorithms.

577
00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.630 
we refer to any interface component augmented with this back-end

578
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:07.620 
architecture as well.

579
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.900 
the overarching goal of the nuclear framework is to make educational

580
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.560 
interfaces future-proof for a broad range of not yet specified research

581
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.740 
involving manual. and automated methods for experimentation,

582
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.570 
data driven improvement and personalisation.

583
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.220 
to operationalize this overarching goal we define eight design requirements.

584
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.810 
derived nuclear framework architecture. and web service implementation

585
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.640 
that addresses these requirements,

586
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.870 
and describe four use cases that exemplify how and where the

587
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:36.940 
framework is most useful?

588
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.740 
the design requirements focus on enabling iterative experimentation through a-b comparisons

589
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.870 
resource improvement using data from past learners and personalization.

590
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.010 
using data on specific individuals or subgroups of learners.

591
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.720 
they also emphasize the importance of easy modification of

592
00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.820 
course content data and algorithms at any point in time

593
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.730 
to allow flexibility with the range of future iterative research,

594
00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.580 
even before it is known exactly which ideas will be tested.

595
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.230 
what data available are useful and which algorithms are most

596
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.550 
effective in the real world.

597
00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.490 
the mcglade framework architecture consists of three key software abstractions.

598
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.390 
the version set for flexible edition of versions of course content,

599
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:22.650 
the policy set for many ways to choose which versions to present.

600
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:26.950 
and the learner data store for curating student characteristics for personalization.

601
00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.730 
the front end learner interface, and the back end admin panel

602
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:34.470 
draw on these abstractions and communicate
with each other via api calls.

603
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.920 
the key conceptual insight is an equivalence in implementing

604
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.240 
software for three different functions. a randomized experiment

605
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.360 
presents two or more alternative versions with equal probability.

606
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:49.610 
enhancement, or improvement is achieved by using data to modify that probability

607
00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.450 
based on human analysis or machine learning algorithms.

608
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:56.560 
and personalization is achieved by delivering resources conditional

609
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.970 
on a feature of a learner. for example, their prior knowledge,

610
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.470 
or their performance on past problems.

611
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:05.530 
the use cases not only illustrate how the framework functions.

612
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.870 
but also demonstrate how the framework enables real world research.

613
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.070 
for example, and use case three we describe how the functionalities of access

614
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.370 
which is an existing system for generating and experimenting

615
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.390 
with learner source explanations can be reimplemented and

616
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.920 
extended using our framework to understand what can be achieved

617
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.560 
with the framework. let's consider the following usage scenario,

618
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.490 
if an online method structure on x wishes to identify the best

619
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.300 
way to explain the concept of standard deviation to students.

620
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.780 
she can have a euclid implemented which delivers an explanation

621
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.810 
of standard deviation on a particular lesson page.

622
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.510 
the motivation for the instructor to use the MOOC

623
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.020 
is that she anticipates that future research could be conducted

624
00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:47.380 
to improve the explanation, although there is not yet a formulated

625
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.930 
plan for what ideas to test. and in its current form the mooc

626
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.430 
simply delivers the single original explanation.

627
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.580 
the framework leaves the door open for future improvement

628
00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.180 
students' questions and comments on the discussion forum later

629
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.680 
suggest an alternative explanation for standard deviation.

630
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.270 
this is added to the mooc version set and the probability of

631
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.290 
assigning the two explanations is manually set to ninety percent

632
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.690 
original and ten percent new at first perhaps out of caution.

633
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.300 
but with no red flags raised, it is later changed to fifty percent

634
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.730 
original and fifty percent new.

635
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.290 
the instructor collaborates with the researcher to evaluate the two explanations

636
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.220 
using quantitative metrics such as ratings of explanations

637
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.780 
and accuracy in solving related quiz questions, as well as qualitative

638
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.840 
feedback such as students comments and questions on explanations.

639
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.520 
the instructor comes up with a third explanation based on this data

640
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.440 
and after another experiment with equal probabilities set to

641
00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.990 
each of the three explanations. he decides that it is better

642
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.240 
than the others and adopted for the foreseeable future

643
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.120 
by setting the probability to zero percent for the first two

644
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.800 
explanations and hundred percent for the third.

645
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:54.450 
the mooclet enables the cycle of iterative experimentation and data-driven improvement

646
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.830 
to be repeated any time in the coming years.

647
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.070 
as new ideas arise or data emerges about how to better explain

648
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:05.940 
the booklet also enables automation of data driven improvement,
for example

649
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:10.500 
logging code can be used to send booklet metrics like student ratings of explanations.

650
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:16.140 
the next time explanations are proposed to avoid manual analysis the course team

651
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:21.450 
could use a built in widely used multi-armed bandit algorithm
for adaptive experimentation

652
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.720 
to automatically analyze explanation ratings, and change the

653
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.380 
experience for future students.
finally the booklet also enables personalization,

654
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.210 
as a more diverse range of students take the course survey

655
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:37.100 
data suggests that changing the vocabulary and examples of an explanation

656
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:39.730 
could make it more helpful to students from different countries.

657
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:44.440 
the mooclet enables the course team to work with researchers to either

658
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.790 
run an experiment to test the impact of alternative phrasings

659
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:53.590 
on different subgroups of students or write if-then rules that give certain explanations

660
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:57.830 
to students from certain countries or apply a range of algorithms

661
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:01.190 
for personalization and recommendation to optimize delivery

662
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.510 
of different course content based on a more complex learner profile.

663
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.230 
the mooc framework provides an ecosystem that transforms online

664
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.970 
course components into collaborative micro labs where instructors

665
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:15.070 
experimental researchers and data mining or machine learning researchers

666
00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.940 
can engage in perpetual cycles of experimentation improvement and personalization.

667
00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:24.620 
such multi-disciplinary collaboration can help improve student outcomes in tandem

668
00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.370 
with conducting real world research.

669
00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:31.660 
mooc platform owners and developers can help instructional teams glean insights

670
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.350 
on ways to improve their courses. experimental researchers can

671
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.610 
go from a single experiment to a sequence of iterative studies

672
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.240 
and use data more quickly.

673
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.830 
data mining and machine learning researchers can use mooc

674
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:47.940 
as a test-bed for applying and evaluating algorithms for adaptive experimentation.

675
00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:51.910 
but the rare capacity to choose actions and get access to outcomes

676
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:54.080 
and contextual or state data in real time.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:02.350 
in your course.

680
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:13.270 
thanks for putting together such a such a compelling and well presented the video.

681
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:19.960 
we have time for some questions, so we invite anybody who has

682
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.910 
one to jump on in.

683
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.150 
Marcus go ahead. um yeah i didn't find my virtual handsaw.

684
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.590 
a great presentation.

685
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.380 
question actually my first idea you run into the typical problems

686
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.890 
of adaptive systems, right?  so you might,

687
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.010 
i mean there are approaches an adaptive hypermedia or hypertext

688
00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:50.650 
that have been researched stretch text or replacing text components.
so one

689
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:55.140 
is more clarification questions to your components,

690
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.840 
you can configure the components. let's say your text component to be

691
00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.840 
substituted, but you might have different sub-groups of learners

692
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:07.090 
that prefer one or the other version of a text.

693
00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.710 
so there is no in that sense best explanation

694
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.490 
for all the students. but there might be differences.

695
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:14.390 
so how do you handle this?

696
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.710 
yeah so one of the key

697
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.750 
things that we're trying to achieve with this framework is personalization right?

698
00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.540 
the idea that one version of a resource might not be good for everyone.

699
00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:30.540 
and so you have a MOOC set up that has a version set.

700
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.240 
so we can have multiple versions of the text explanation right.

701
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:37.100 
and then based on different learner characteristics.

702
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:41.710 
you can deliver different versions of the text to those learners right?

703
00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.000 
based on what works best for them.

704
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:47.620 
joseph. do you want to kind of add to

705
00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:50.050 
what i'm saying here?

706
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.780 
seems like a pretty good response i think the question is a

707
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.810 
bit more about like how do you do personalization really correctly.

708
00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:04.550 
yeah, the issue is more also the learner control issue you have an activity,

709
00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:09.110 
meaning you can have cal specify the criteria of learners and

710
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.600 
map that onto the version you want to present,

711
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:17.230 
but i mean not everything is predictable in this space, right?

712
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.270 
so you can have a lot of meta information. i'm interested in

713
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:26.060 
that part and if i got it right you can also specify models

714
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.140 
that learn the preferences of specific and relations between

715
00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:34.600 
characteristics and versions. so in that dynamic part,

716
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:37.390 
i would be that's my questions focusing on.

717
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.770 
yeah, i might just say that these are great questions and i think

718
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.460 
you are seeing questions that researchers want to answer right,

719
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.130 
like how do you specify the models?

720
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:49.660 
how decide what variables to use and you don't know in advance

721
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.890 
and some questions in the chatter like well what do you precise on.

722
00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.500 
what i would say is that the point for me is not to answer

723
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.580 
those questions for you right now. the point is that if you

724
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:03.100 
yourself want to go into the field and do that research they build obstacles.

725
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.930 
and so the idea here is that this a framework where if an instructor implements explanations,

726
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:15.500 
emails, you know homework problems,
asthma gluts then you can add new versions.

727
00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:19.640 
but also which variables you're using can be changed over time.

728
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.020 
like you said you can't always anticipate what data is going on right,

729
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.380 
once of course a lot of current systems will hard code to say.

730
00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.870 
well you in converse you can press light on these three things.

731
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.990 
but you have to deploy all that before the course, and then you run it.

732
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.590 
but then actually suppose you want to subeditor,

733
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.280 
suppose you want to actually use people's past performance.

734
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.140 
the way the fps set up you could actually add it in.

735
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:46.110 
and so then you have flexibility as you do with searching figure out,

736
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.300 
you know these variables math business issue

737
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:50.780 
these dependent variables are better or worse.

738
00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:55.970 
you actually able to change the method using for doing personalization.

739
00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:01.080 
declare that it kind of provides a framework where all those questions you're asking.

740
00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:03.990 
it gives you flexibility in answering them, because we've kind

741
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.350 
of uncovered the barriers you'll face if you try to go into

742
00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:07.360 
the real world, and do that.

743
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:15.940 
great elegantly answering a couple of questions from the chat there.

744
00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:18.280 
anyone else with the question?

745
00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.150 
hand up yeah,

746
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:27.750 
yeah, so one one thing.

747
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:33.030 
i guess it's kind of like a comment, but also has a question component.

748
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.840 
you know what aspect of this work that really strikes me is

749
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.640 
the adaptive randomized experiment

750
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.020 
component. and the thing i want to highlight about it is this

751
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.180 
idea of of like fairness, which i don't think is really present

752
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:52.990 
in your paper. and i was wondering maybe it's present in some

753
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.510 
of your other work, but if i'm doing an experiment.

754
00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:00.990 
and it's very clear after i've done fifty people or a hundred people

755
00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.530 
that one condition of the experiment is being harmed.

756
00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.940 
i should probably stop the experiment, and you see this in medicine right.

757
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.180 
but you don't necessarily see it in education. it's like education,

758
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.370 
is like we must continue.

759
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:18.770 
so i was wondering if this is something that you had thought about

760
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:24.500 
and whether like ideas of fairness could be maybe even more

761
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:29.150 
broadly ideas of fairness could be integrated into this approach.

762
00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:33.120 
yeah, that's a great question a really important

763
00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.810 
issue to think about right.

764
00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:41.380 
so for example, if so in the mooc nuclear framework you can use different

765
00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:45.430 
policies, so these policies decide how to like translate

766
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.210 
what you learn from the learners at it and use that information

767
00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.010 
to decide which version to deliver right.

768
00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.900 
so if you're using some kind of automated policy,

769
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.970 
and maybe halfway through the experiment, it becomes clear

770
00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:01.270 
that one of the versions is clearly better than the others.

771
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.420 
the instructors can intervene right.
so they can stop the automated process,

772
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.550 
and switch to something manual. and they can say like alright.

773
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.210 
it's obvious to me that exploration, a is better

774
00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.590 
always deliver exploration a two hundred percent of the students.

775
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.240 
so there is this level of flexibility in terms of how you

776
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:24.250 
define the policies. and how you switch between them.

777
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:29.540 
and so basically the instructors can intervene when they

778
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:31.780 
perceive some kind of unfairness going on.

779
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:33.700 
that's how we're currently tackling it.

780
00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.920 
right, right and i  understand i understand that part i guess what

781
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.270 
and i probably didn't say this very well is that i think there's

782
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:45.950 
an aspect of it,
you could i think you could frame this in terms of fairness.

783
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:50.290 
and i think it would it would maybe like reach people

784
00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.760 
who might not be reached the way it's currently framed.

785
00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.500 
and maybe make a different kind of impact, because as we consider

786
00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:03.240 
learning systems that have very large numbers of users.
we can trade power

787
00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:08.150 
for fairness right, we can have more inefficient experiments

788
00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:12.990 
that are more fair. and i think that this framework that you're describing

789
00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:18.590 
enables that and i think you know that's just i think that's maybe

790
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:23.080 
a different argument that can be made and i just didn't want it to be.

791
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.950 
i wanted to highlight it as long as you agreed that it was a fair one.

792
00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.190 
and i think if i can speak to that i think that there was a

793
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:33.940 
lot of and this paper right? like this really could have been three people.

794
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:37.950 
but i think that the key idea there is exactly said andrew,

795
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:41.980 
when we run a randomized person we're getting data and we want

796
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:43.180 
to decide at some point,

797
00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.500 
like when do we kind of give everyone what's best right.

798
00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:50.120 
i think what a lot of us miss is like how complex that question is?

799
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:54.020 
for example Andrew some instructors told us when we use the system.

800
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:57.790 
well when is algorithms running right and there's a eighty percent chance conditioners

801
00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.570 
should be is that enough to stop some instructors said well,

802
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.510 
i don't wanna risk it stop right now, some instructors said

803
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:07.340 
no i've got thousands of students. it needs to be ninety-nine percent.

804
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.190 
some other instructors said well, but suppose actually that

805
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.050 
is better than be no, but how she might

806
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.230 
students change over time.

807
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.210 
and so the problem is like this complexity

808
00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:24.250 
of knowing what's best for who in what context?
that's really hard to answer.

809
00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.810 
and the idea is that when you put something as a mooclet.
it's meant to say

810
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:32.280 
you have all these options you know you can run your study the typical way.

811
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:36.490 
but you can also uses algorithms that will actually unless it's an estimate,

812
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.750 
and change over time from fifty fifty he said to sixty forty eighty twenty.

813
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:44.180 
but then maybe a year later someone comes along. and says well

814
00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.770 
i know you think is best because your study a few years ago,

815
00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.210 
but you know i'm cross pointed in statistics.

816
00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.780 
there's never perfect certainty any publisher may have changed.

817
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:56.470 
so we need infrastructure that would let someone come along and say,

818
00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.520 
well actually let's phase back an explanation.
let's try something else

819
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.710 
out let's have a characteristic we should push lines on.

820
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:07.430 
so that's the kind of thing that happens a lot in industry.

821
00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:10.320 
but we don't have infrastructure in education for allowing

822
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.670 
researchers to do that kind of work.

823
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:16.310 
and i think you're completely right,
it allows us to do more testing i results.

824
00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:20.020 
but really think hard about well how we use india to stop things.

825
00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.290 
they for me it really challenged my whole notion of like, oh

826
00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:25.760 
you're an experiment you learn something and then you're done.

827
00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.240 
but that's not really true,

828
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.210 
we need to keep running studies forever. we need to reran studies

829
00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:34.300 
replicate them we need to check to see if that was an artifact

830
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.320 
of this course or not.

831
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.830 
so it's meant to really make it easier to

832
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.460 
rethink how we're doing research, so we can keep

833
00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.450 
revisiting our conclusions and be more and more sure about

834
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:46.450 
them, instead of simply thinking the experiments prove this.

835
00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:53.560 
i think he said this is meant to say let's use it to help students make

836
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:57.300 
twelve thirty. it's much more practical and more fyn that we're

837
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.690 
using it to help students quickly.

838
00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:00.990 
excellent, thank you.

839
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.940 
so we should just take another minute to between turn over

840
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.990 
david. but there's two questions in the chat here. one is would

841
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.420 
this work with the recommendation recommender system as well

842
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:17.570 
as with the MOOC. and then a second question that Renè asked a bit broader

843
00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:21.140 
is choosing the right objective function is critical for this?

844
00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.530 
and it may not be clear would that be how would you choose

845
00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:26.380 
manually automatically how does it fit into the system

846
00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.590 
and if i can speak about one is

847
00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.900 
let me let you answer could a recommended system work for this?

848
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:36.340 
and you'll tell me you've got some mooc system like problems.

849
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:39.320 
you can argue visuals any point in time. and you can use any

850
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.380 
policy to deliver them.

851
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:44.660 
so yes take a recommendation algorithm and implement.
so yes it would work.

852
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:48.670 
now run is question by choosing right objective function like

853
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.910 
is it ratings of explanations or after see how do you do it

854
00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.650 
again. i'm going to i'm going to push back on you all.

855
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:57.760 
because these are great questions.
this is a important question researchers

856
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.630 
need to answer in every study in every context.

857
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.980 
i can tell you my thoughts about how you choose it.

858
00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:06.540 
but what i would again emphasize is,
this a framework where you have

859
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:10.120 
your first two guesses and you can run a study.

860
00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.270 
but if any point in time you realize ratings are not the best.

861
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:16.120 
i should actually have actress in future problems you can then actually

862
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:19.510 
change that analysis right. you could then actually

863
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.150 
revisit your study and run experiment again.

864
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:26.820 
and if you automatically try to use something
you thought was good like ratings.

865
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.850 
and then you realize there's something better on.

866
00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:33.160 
it would be easy for you to then reverse the algorithm

867
00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:34.470 
and go back to using or switch what using.

868
00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:37.550 
how does contrast to current practice.

869
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.480 
current practice really when you run experiment. you're kind

870
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.900 
of stuck in a way right and if you try to adapt with an algorithm.

871
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:47.270 
i mean good luck trying to go and change the algorithms optimisation.

872
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.700 
that's a problem we face is that you might use an algorithm

873
00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.700 
to optimize for something short term. but suppose it turns out

874
00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.460 
that's not actually good for students. it's actually not trivial

875
00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.850 
to go back and actually change organ's behavior.

876
00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.690 
so what i would say is again.

877
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.980 
when you're not sure as we often research
what's the best dependent variable.

878
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:06.720 
and when you want to help people quickly, but you might have

879
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.430 
chosen dependent or able to optimize on that's not ideal how

880
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:12.360 
do you have the flexibility to change what you're optimising for

881
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.680 
thus would you be allowed to within this framework

882
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.450 
is that helpful reena is that answer what i'm getting at.

883
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:24.690 
yeah i see what you mean you busy punt on  that decision.

884
00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.710 
let somebody else figure it out i think the really challenging

885
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.120 
part is the complexity that arises from all of those different

886
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.560 
variables right, if they are what you character you

887
00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:38.860 
personalized by what your manipulations are
what the outcome measures are.

888
00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:44.140 
it just creates a very big cube of possible things to look at.

889
00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:48.320 
and it would be interesting to see estimates of
how much data you would need

890
00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:52.380 
given a certain number of variables in the system and a certain

891
00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.930 
effect size that we would expect in educational environments

892
00:57:55.210 --> 00:58:00.460 
to give people a reasonable expectation for  when this will work and

893
00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:04.370 
when not to go overboard with the number of conditions or number

894
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:06.420 
of personalization features that they introduce.

895
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.420 
yeah i am absolutely also agree those are fantastic questions and i wouldn't

896
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.650 
say that we punt on the decision in sense of like,

897
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:15.830 
you know make it someone else's problem. it's more that

898
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:18.590 
i can tell you my opinion for the studies i've run.

899
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:21.510 
but who's best equipped to answer those fantastic questions.

900
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:23.320 
that you ask that nr seven asked

901
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:26.040 
its researchers instructed in the context

902
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:29.300 
that the problem is right now they can't answer those questions very easily.

903
00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:32.620 
they don't even have they aren't even being told you should ask these questions.

904
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.680 
and so the idea is this if the sense of it doesn't tell you

905
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.890 
here's what to do right now.

906
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:39.980 
but it enables you to do that kind of work.

907
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:43.860 
it forces people to say well in my course right now why am

908
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.640 
i not making things mclis. i'm making five versions of them?

909
00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:49.770 
why am i not worrying about the complexity of the variables?

910
00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:52.850 
i should be having why am i not trying to use data quickly

911
00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:53.760 
to help future people?

912
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.550 
when i have two ideas why don't i figure out if i should

913
00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.360 
choose one of his lies. so it's kind of meant to be a framework that

914
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:03.260 
opens up research questions. it helps people say you know we

915
00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.980 
should all be testing things out improving personalizing and

916
00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.120 
we need the tools to do this.

917
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.050 
so if it will help, you'll do that more.

918
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:17.340 
i've had a chance to hear joseph talk about and develop these

919
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:21.920 
ideas for a number of years now. so it's been fun to watch that trajectory.

920
00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:26.710 
so i'll be the official platter for bowie and and joseph in their team's video.

921
00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:32.390 
and we're now able to turn it over to david joyner and his

922
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:35.870 
team if the case that joseph was making is that one way

923
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:41.260 
the courses need to improve expanding in innovate is around

924
00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:45.100 
iteration and experimentation and personalization. and david

925
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:49.440 
his team are gonna make a case for socialization and connecting

926
00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.080 
with each other synchronously in this upcoming talk.

927
00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.960 
hi everybody my name is david joyner. i am the executive director

928
00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.250 
of online education and mscs at georgia tech's college of computing

929
01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:01.960 
in atlanta georgia USA.

930
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:05.190 
today i'm going to be talking to you a bit about our attempts

931
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:10.240 
to use virtual reality and immersive environments to complement online education.

932
01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.970 
the specific title of this work is content neutral immersive

933
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.320 
environments for cultivating scalable camaraderie.

934
01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.170 
it's the work of myself and three graduate students at georgia tech

935
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:23.530 
aqeel malik handy, shiny metal and technic as well as blair,

936
01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:26.360 
mcintyre who works with both georgia tech and mozilla.

937
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.890 
now in order to talk about this work, i think it's useful for

938
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:34.340 
us to start by talking about our goal and really operationalizing.

939
01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:39.700 
some of these terms our goal is to cultivate scalable camaraderie in online education

940
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:44.190 
using content neutral immersive environments.
but what does that mean exactly?

941
01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.470 
well to start with the easy part online education for this,

942
01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.100 
for our context is a large online and fully asynchronous degree program

943
01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.570 
in computer science. that's what we work on. but we hope what

944
01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:58.510 
we find here is applicable to moocs and other degree programs

945
01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:00.400 
in other fields and other topics as well.

946
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:05.210 
for camaraderie it has been observed or defined to be the most

947
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:08.430 
advanced stage of community formation in distance learning.

948
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:12.740 
it's characterized by a feeling of connection to your classmates

949
01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.040 
that isn't based on any particular interaction, but rather forms

950
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.630 
as a result of the sum total of many interactions over time.

951
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.520 
many of which may not even be direct interactions.

952
01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:26.480 
when we say scalable what we mean is that the approaches should require

953
01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:30.110 
minimal or no additional effort from the teaching staff as

954
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:33.320 
enrollment grows, if these efforts are going to require teaching

955
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.570 
staff to invest another hour for every fifty students who enroll.

956
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:39.610 
it's not really scalable. we want to develop things that can

957
01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:42.590 
scale no matter how big a particular course ends up being.

958
01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.920 
and by immersive environments what we mean is environments that carry the

959
01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:51.960 
peripheral context and spatial relationships of real world locations.

960
01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:55.510 
very often online we're dealing with web forums and chat rooms.

961
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:59.340 
and things like that, where it's a very narrow channel of communication.

962
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.590 
we're looking at environments that replicate more of what it's

963
01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:04.970 
like to interact in person where it's not just face to face

964
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:08.190 
like you are over a webcam. but it's also the experience of

965
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:11.080 
sitting in the same room with other people, so that even if you're not

966
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.660 
talking to them directly. you still have that sense of being

967
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:18.230 
in the same place with others going through a shared experience.

968
01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.450 
our belief is that kind of experience could be the key to building

969
01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:23.590 
this kind of camaraderie in online environments.

970
01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.830 
and finally by content neutral what we mean is that we want

971
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:30.280 
to develop environments that are not tied to specific content like a

972
01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:33.920 
virtual reality simulation in physics or an immersive exploring

973
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.870 
environment in ecology. but we want to develop environments

974
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:40.360 
that can be used across many different subject areas
very similar to how a

975
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:43.580 
real classroom can be used for a computer science class right

976
01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.480 
now. and a writing class and an hour physics class after that,

977
01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.250 
we want to develop this kind of content neutral environment.

978
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:54.190 
so that they can have a wide impact across multiple different subject areas,

979
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.010 
so that's our goal. we want to cultivate camaraderie in a scalable way.

980
01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.710 
so that students in online education feel more connected to

981
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:04.740 
their classmates. and we want to do it in a way that can be

982
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.770 
used across multiple subject areas using very content neutral immersive environments.

983
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.260 
so how do we actually go about doing this?  we decided to use mozilla hubs,

984
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.410 
partially because mozilla gave us a grant to explore the use

985
01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:20.820 
of hubs in online education but we applied for that because

986
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.720 
mozilla hubs has a number of features that make it uniquely

987
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.810 
compatible with what we're trying to do here.

988
01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.410 
for one it's browser-based, which means anyone with a smartphone

989
01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:32.580 
or laptop or computer can access these environments, so we're

990
01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:34.740 
not relying on students having fancy equipment,

991
01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:39.410 
but hubs is vr compatible so for those students who have a vr headset,

992
01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.760 
they can access the environment using that headset. so we can

993
01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.570 
experiment with whether vr might be a way to foster this kind

994
01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:48.520 
of camaraderie, or whether any kind of immersive environment
could do it.

995
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.840 
so hubs has a number of features that are useful for our purposes.

996
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.750 
it's also open source, meaning anything that we discover here

997
01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.810 
could be more quickly used at other schools and other subject

998
01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:02.020 
areas without having to worry about licensing and everything like that.

999
01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:06.890 
so to start we brainstormed a number of different content neutral

1000
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:10.260 
environments we observed on traditional college campuses that

1001
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.530 
we wanted to recreate in these immersive environments. the first

1002
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:17.810 
we came up with was a lecture hall where students gather to synchronously watch a

1003
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:21.070 
presentation from their instructor, maybe raise their hand and

1004
01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:25.790 
ask questions pause for class discussion maybe work problems in groups.

1005
01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.770 
the second we came up with was a poster session which would

1006
01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:32.460 
be an environment to allow students to present their work to their classmates in

1007
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.700 
a more casual environment compared to an all class presentation.

1008
01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:40.700 
the third were office hours with a faculty member, not just

1009
01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.560 
to talk directly to the faculty member, because that would be quite scalable,

1010
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.210 
but also to do kind of what you do in office hours

1011
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:50.640 
on a real college campus where you might see the posters that

1012
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.850 
the professor has presented conferences, see the moocs that

1013
01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:57.460 
they have in their office kind of get that that immersion in their world.

1014
01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:00.880 
and then the fourth was the social lounge which would be a

1015
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:05.330 
gathering places where students can get together interact and socialize.

1016
01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:08.020 
maybe work on class material together, maybe just talk,

1017
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:14.060 
but a way to create a place for students to gather and interact and

1018
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:18.460 
connect to each other that isn't necessarily anchored to the class meeting time.

1019
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:21.650 
so we built these environments in mozilla hubs, and then we

1020
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:25.190 
wanted to evaluate them with real students. so we did five studies.

1021
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:28.980 
we did a study that just set a baseline to understand students'

1022
01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.910 
prior experiences and beliefs about vr virtual environments and education.

1023
01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.980 
and then we did studies on the social lounge the poster session,

1024
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.920 
and then two different studies on the lecture hall. and we tried

1025
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.210 
one on the office hours, but not enough students showed up for us to really

1026
01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.690 
derive any conclusions.

1027
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.040 
so for the first study we just wanted to understand what students

1028
01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.650 
already think about virtual reality in virtual environments

1029
01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:53.190 
and how they can be useful in online education. so we recruited

1030
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:57.460 
students from two classes to complete a survey about their beliefs and experiences.

1031
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:00.650 
and we found a few different things. we found that very few

1032
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:05.570 
students regularly use virtual reality even in an online mscs program where we

1033
01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:07.940 
would expect to see many early adopters.

1034
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:11.610 
we found unsurprisingly that many students feel relatively

1035
01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:15.060 
disconnected from online classmates and they crave more interaction

1036
01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:18.230 
with their classmates in online education. and we found that

1037
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:21.690 
most students are interestingly optimistic about the proposed

1038
01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:24.470 
virtual environments to aid community building and that will

1039
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.560 
be a running theme. we see through all our studies that there's

1040
01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.810 
some optimism about the future potential of initiatives like this.

1041
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.500 
even when the present hasn't quite caught up with that potential.

1042
01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.610 
for our study on the social lounge we recruited students from

1043
01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:40.910 
four different classes to attend scheduled social lounges specific to their class.

1044
01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.300 
so we just invited them asking to fill out a survey,

1045
01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.310 
if they came we did nothing else to facilitate interaction or to offer

1046
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:49.610 
activities or anything like that we just

1047
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:51.620 
invited them to see what they would do.

1048
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.010 
our key findings were one in the absence of any kind of anchor

1049
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:59.190 
for activity students struggled to quickly establish social norms for interaction.

1050
01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:03.120 
and two only forty three percent felt it improved their experience

1051
01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.960 
in the class. but eighty nine percent would attend a similar lounge

1052
01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.230 
again which was interesting.

1053
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.250 
then for our post-recession study we recruited students who

1054
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:15.570 
were already in a class that had a final presentation. and for

1055
01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:19.660 
them we offered to let them present via this immersive poster session

1056
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.410 
instead of the typical filmed video presentation, and then we

1057
01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:25.940 
invited other students to attend the poster session.

1058
01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:29.790 
and we asked them all to complete a survey students reflected positively

1059
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:33.350 
on the added social connection and on the authentic presentation

1060
01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.170 
experience. i noted they felt it might be a good preparation

1061
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:38.580 
for doing similar things for real conferences. because i got

1062
01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.870 
to answer live questions and have that live back and forth.

1063
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:46.790 
we also found that the technological overhead
was both a distraction and a deterrent.

1064
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:52.420 
all the things that go into having this true three d virtual environment

1065
01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:55.910 
kind of took away from the content of the individual posters

1066
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:58.160 
which suggest there might be something we can do to streamline it

1067
01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.520 
to focus on content while still supporting this kind of peripheral interaction.

1068
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.020 
like i said before we did two different studies
on the lecture hall environment.

1069
01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.740 
the first was exploratory just to get students feedback on

1070
01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.140 
the potential of the interface. from one class
we recruited students to begin

1071
01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:14.920 
attending optional twice a week watching sessions and to complete

1072
01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.170 
surveys on their experience. and what we found was that students

1073
01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:21.220 
attach significant interest to this sort of co-watching mechanism.

1074
01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.670 
there's an enormous amount of interest over a third of the

1075
01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:26.540 
class attended the first one to the point where the environment

1076
01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:30.210 
crashed. and we had to cancel that session, because the interface

1077
01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:32.150 
wouldn't handle fifty people in a room at a time.

1078
01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.990 
but we also found that despite the positive feedback attendance

1079
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:39.090 
fell off fast and attendees mostly said they would be rewatching

1080
01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:41.690 
recorded content later. so they weren't getting

1081
01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:44.610 
enough out of it to keep coming back. and they weren't getting

1082
01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:47.920 
enough out of it to not have to watch the video again
on their own later.

1083
01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.150 
then we also did a controlled study which was partially because

1084
01:08:51.150 --> 01:08:54.370 
we observed it the way students use the vr environment was

1085
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:56.960 
they very often just position their avatar somewhere where

1086
01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.510 
it could see the virtual screen. and then they would do all

1087
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.680 
their interaction via the text chat box, so we wanted to see

1088
01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.010 
could we streamline this could we do something that's useful

1089
01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:08.500 
without all the overhead of vr. so we introduced the third condition

1090
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.830 
using a tool called sync educate which was a chat
based co-watching tool.

1091
01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:16.960 
and what we found in this controlled experiment was none of

1092
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.980 
the conditions affected the level of social connection students

1093
01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:23.590 
experienced. they all had a slightly disconnected feel the beginning

1094
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:26.600 
of the study and that same level of disconnection at the end

1095
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.930 
of the study as evaluated by a standard social connectedness inventory.

1096
01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.730 
what we also found was interesting was the

1097
01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.810 
email condition where we just have students do a little email

1098
01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:40.680 
discussion group totally asynchronously, delivered more immediate

1099
01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.650 
advantages than the other two. but the other two had students

1100
01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:48.030 
reflecting more positively on the experience, and its future

1101
01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.140 
potential. so they got more out of just doing a simple email group.

1102
01:09:51.570 --> 01:09:55.680 
but they were more likely to want to use the chat tool or the hubs tool

1103
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:59.180 
in the future, so we see that as evidence that there's some

1104
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:02.570 
difference between the present reality of the tool and the

1105
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:06.690 
potential students see from the future application of the tool.

1106
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:12.480 
so from those five studies we derived four findings,
and then four softer observations.

1107
01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:17.530 
first we confirmed that students still feel isolated in online educational settings,

1108
01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:20.650 
even though the internet and social networking have gotten so much more

1109
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:24.170 
ubiquitous. we can hope to find that students find it very easy

1110
01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:26.690 
to socialize online in their online classes nowadays.

1111
01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.700 
but that didn't seem to be the case.

1112
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.750 
our second finding though was that students were very optimistic

1113
01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.930 
about the role that immersive environments. and vr could play

1114
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:37.820 
in resolving that isolation they

1115
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.590 
reflected positively on the potential and after experiencing,

1116
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:44.460 
some of these settings they were likely to want to do it again.

1117
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.090 
even when they were a bit lukewarm about how effective the

1118
01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:51.300 
experience they just had was. so they reflect more positively

1119
01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:55.620 
on the future potential than they do on what they immediately experienced.

1120
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:59.660 
our third finding was that students are regularly distracted

1121
01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:02.680 
by these immersive environments. but they regard the experience

1122
01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.240 
positively anyway which is interesting. because it says that

1123
01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.740 
were we're adding something to the experience by adding in these peripheral contexts

1124
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:13.810 
that they're losing and it's worth being distracted a bit from the material.

1125
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:16.440 
especially given that in this asynchronous environment, they

1126
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.160 
can always go back and watch on their own later, if they want to

1127
01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.280 
and our fourth findings are that there are significant technical

1128
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:25.560 
obstacles to further adoption of these environments presenting.

1129
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.360 
what i'd say is a chicken egg problem or causality dilemma

1130
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:33.850 
which is that in order for us to use virtual reality more commonly in online education.

1131
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:36.090 
we need more students to have vr headsets.

1132
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:39.210 
but in order for students to buy vr headsets they need to know

1133
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:41.650 
that they're going to have some usefulness and that's kind

1134
01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:44.590 
of a chicken egg problem. we think that environments like mozilla

1135
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:48.430 
hubs could give us a a powerful way of resolving that, because

1136
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:52.150 
you don't have to have vr to interact. but if you do, you get

1137
01:11:52.150 --> 01:11:54.620 
something more out of the experience, so it gets people in the

1138
01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:58.860 
door and enticing them to invest more in the experience going forward.

1139
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:02.870 
then for our softer observations about the experience, we found

1140
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:05.420 
that students require an anchor for activity to understand

1141
01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.700 
how the environment is intended to be used, otherwise they just

1142
01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:10.710 
stand around awkwardly wondering, am i supposed to talk?  i supposed

1143
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:13.140 
to chat?  should i use all these tools? that i have available to me?

1144
01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.150 
so it's good to provide them some anchors of activities,

1145
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:19.280 
some guidelines on what they should be doing and similarly,

1146
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.180 
our second observation is that students lack a collective understanding

1147
01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:25.380 
of the norms of a virtual environment like, does it matter if

1148
01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:28.060 
i put my avatar too close to other people?  does it matter if

1149
01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.670 
i face them all?  we're talking as long as we can hear each other,

1150
01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.610 
things like that. it's just not clear what you're supposed to

1151
01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:37.080 
do in these new environments. our third observation is those

1152
01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.140 
take time to develop. but typical interventions are pretty short

1153
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.460 
term, and they don't give enough time for these norms to form

1154
01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.680 
in our control experiment. we had groups meeting together for

1155
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.450 
three consecutive weeks. and by the end of those three weeks

1156
01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:53.010 
we were starting to see some norms forming. so it takes at least

1157
01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.390 
a couple weeks of doing this at least once a week for those

1158
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:59.060 
to begin to develop. we won't really know the

1159
01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:02.450 
potential of these environments until
they're given the time to fully develop.

1160
01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.390 
and the fourth is that despite our focus in online education.

1161
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:09.710 
and communities and things like that on direct interaction.

1162
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:14.060 
students reflect most positively on peripheral interactions.

1163
01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:18.080 
so just the idea of being in a room together
and being aware of your classmates

1164
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:22.080 
is what students seem to be most positive about in these environments.

1165
01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:26.790 
it's important to note that these studies all took place
before covid hit,

1166
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.090 
and now we've had a year of doing online education in this

1167
01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:35.430 
emergency situation. we can reflect also on how some
we found in these studies,

1168
01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:40.010 
applies what we've learned over the past year. one is that interfaces

1169
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:43.530 
like gather lee and gather town emerged after we did these studies.

1170
01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:47.090 
and they supply much of the benefit that we saw here they supply

1171
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:50.330 
that peripheral interaction that more casual interaction.

1172
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:54.580 
but they don't have nearly as much overhead as a 3d immersive

1173
01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:58.730 
virtual environment. so i think what we're seeing is that it is definitely possible

1174
01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:03.350 
to create these environments these immersive areas for students

1175
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:07.160 
interact with each other.
in a way that doesn't require so much technical overhead.

1176
01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.860 
our second is that things like the lecture hall

1177
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:13.340 
really seem to have been pressions in what students were going

1178
01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:17.130 
to want to see in education. during the pandemic video watching

1179
01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:19.770 
interfaces on youtube and netflix and facebook and other places

1180
01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.090 
really took off during the pandemic, because i think they offer

1181
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:26.520 
a distributed social experience. and so i think what we'll see

1182
01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.990 
is that students really are open to the idea of co- watching pre-recorded lectures together.

1183
01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:34.900 
so they can talk and discuss and answer each other's questions

1184
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:39.020 
live and get that social interaction anchored
the material itself as well.

1185
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:42.840 
in third hubs and other platforms have added lots of new

1186
01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.820 
features which may fundamentally change the nature of the interaction

1187
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:50.340 
which could change the results of these studies. so i think what we saw

1188
01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:54.990 
is that the optimism students had about the potential of these interfaces

1189
01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:59.890 
has been unlocked as a result of the need for online education in online environments

1190
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:03.950 
over the past year. so that's our study on virtual reality in

1191
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:06.490 
immersive environments in online education. if you'd like to

1192
01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:09.120 
see more you can visit my website at lucey labs that got me

1193
01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.570 
to you. you can email me at david joyner.

1194
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:15.180 
i got to you or we can chat at one of the other conference events.

1195
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:20.160 
i will be presenting a poster during the thursday
poster session here at

1196
01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.310 
scale. and i look forward to talking to you then.

1197
01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.400 
talk to later.

1198
01:15:26.150 --> 01:15:29.190 
thanks for being so active in the chat, if folks aren't the

1199
01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:32.660 
scrolling along there, there's a lot of great conversation.

1200
01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:35.650 
that's happening i see marcus has his hand up. so maybe we'll turn

1201
01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:39.020 
it over to him next. and if other folks want to hop in,

1202
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:42.390 
go ahead and raise your hand and then there's a great question from ten two.

1203
01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.420 
but marcus the floor is yours. thanks a lot.

1204
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:49.280 
great presentation, great work, and we also experimented a little

1205
01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.510 
bit with different versions ranging from the compass in minecraft

1206
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:58.320 
to now more looking into four d volumetric data, us also have

1207
01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:00.060 
classroom settings where you have.

1208
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:01.900 
basically holographic

1209
01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:06.100 
projections embedded in these environments, so i'm interested in the

1210
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:10.630 
the quality kind of quality criteria you applied for like

1211
01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:16.470 
presence or this camaraderie. so first thing is how would you

1212
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:22.950 
measure the camaraderie and what concepts is it linked to and what kind of

1213
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:27.040 
dependent variables you see in the sense of like embodiment.

1214
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:31.310 
these kind of components and absolutely

1215
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:36.780 
for our controlled study the external dependent variable we used was a

1216
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:39.370 
inventory for social connectedness

1217
01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.860 
that i can find the citation for in the paper.

1218
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.870 
it was attempting to understand to assess the extent to which

1219
01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:51.990 
people felt a sense of shared purpose and

1220
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.950 
direction with their classmates. i in that case according to

1221
01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:59.690 
inventory. at least we saw no change over the course of study

1222
01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:04.160 
which was not terribly surprising i think given the short term

1223
01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.980 
nature of some of these interventions. i think that

1224
01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:11.210 
for what we'd like to see change, you really need to see it

1225
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:13.900 
over the course semesters and the course of a full semester

1226
01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:16.590 
or even multiple semesters. and it's one of the interesting

1227
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:20.880 
findings from a separate actually a separate study that

1228
01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:25.760 
was going on same time is that as students persist in our program longer.

1229
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:30.350 
they are sense of social isolation actually increases which is

1230
01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:33.750 
counter-intuitive to me.

1231
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.280 
but that's what we used to assess the social connectedness

1232
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:41.330 
of students in that regard. for the more exploratory studies

1233
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:42.890 
we were more interested in

1234
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.940 
the extent to which

1235
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:52.070 
the benefit students perceive  we keep them coming back.
that's been the

1236
01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.710 
constraint we run into with some other initiatives like this is that

1237
01:17:57.130 --> 01:17:59.090 
any time we're doing something, where we're not

1238
01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:03.580 
more of a making something available to students and seeing

1239
01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.390 
how they use it. we very often see interest dropping off very

1240
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:10.390 
quickly in fact. that's not unusual in this study.

1241
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:13.550 
we've had some trouble getting anything to really stick that

1242
01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.980 
isn't part of the foundational fundamental class experience.

1243
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.750 
i think in large part because our students are very busy,

1244
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:24.040 
but we're trying to find something that they will do organically authentically

1245
01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:28.250 
without being required to or without us locking some kind of

1246
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.530 
content away in this special interface, because we think if

1247
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:33.360 
you have to come over here to get it, you'll benefit

1248
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.200 
in some other way.

1249
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:37.710 
and so that's where our interest was in

1250
01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:41.090 
and what can we do to provide students an

1251
01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.590 
authentic value that will keep them coming back.

1252
01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.530 
i haven't found yet. i think it's an ongoing challenge

1253
01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:51.390 
with a lot of things we've tried here, and i know others have

1254
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:56.890 
tried in similar areas is that we're dealing with a population.

1255
01:18:57.390 --> 01:19:01.280 
that is so already over committed and already overworked.

1256
01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:06.360 
and you need to deliver some immediate value in anything you're asking

1257
01:19:06.730 --> 01:19:08.690 
or adding on you're not requiring them to do,

1258
01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.310 
in order to keep coming back. so.

1259
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.280 
you're really just great thanks david.

1260
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:23.840 
but i'm going to make sure we end a couple minutes early,

1261
01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.500 
so there's a little bit of time in between the sessions.

1262
01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.140 
anybody else have one last question, there's one here from Ken,

1263
01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.910 
which i think as it reads

1264
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.780 
is something along the lines of it sounds like people don't have

1265
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.260 
what people say they want, and what people actually want to

1266
01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:40.400 
participate in are not necessarily the same thing.

1267
01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:43.350 
yeah i think that's definitely a part of it that's where i've

1268
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:45.750 
kind of gravitated more towards wanting to use things like

1269
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:46.970 
gather your gather town.

1270
01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:52.750 
this kind of thing. because what we hear from students is a

1271
01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:56.040 
strong desire for this kind of interface. but then we don't

1272
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.130 
see them actually picking it up and using it, and i think it's because

1273
01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.250 
that desire runs into friction very quickly,
and we have to reduce that friction

1274
01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:08.280 
enormously, if we're gonna get them to participate in something that doesn't have

1275
01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:09.920 
a required component

1276
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:14.270 
to it, so we start experimenting more with that i think that.

1277
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:17.820 
when we drill down into why students say they want what they say.

1278
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:21.680 
i think that we can address why they want that more directly,

1279
01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.510 
even if we don't directly supply what they

1280
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.330 
are dealing with what they're on requesting.

1281
01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:28.340 
i think we work in an interesting

1282
01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:33.050 
way we work in interesting context as well, because we are computer

1283
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:35.090 
science people teaching computer science, and so we're very

1284
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:38.830 
often talking to students who when they say they want x could

1285
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:42.540 
turn around tomorrow. and build x and in fact i think educating that i

1286
01:20:43.090 --> 01:20:47.310 
was part of our control study was something where denise had

1287
01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:49.420 
an interest in that kind of thing. so she turned around and

1288
01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.870 
built it, and then we used it.

1289
01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.380 
and so it's an interesting place to do research,
because we are dealing

1290
01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:58.920 
with a population that can build the things they say. they want to see

1291
01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.980 
and immediately find out the reasons why that might not have

1292
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.540 
been what they wanted. so sometimes the cycles

1293
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:06.070 
go very very quickly

1294
01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:10.430 
great well. david i think your cat is just a terrific place

1295
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:12.900 
to end a really wonderful session on.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.000 
Welcome to the last week of our openHPI
course about Internet security,

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.410 
this week is dedicated
to privacy.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.920 
So we will discuss different
aspects of privacy, of

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.530 
private sphere and
data engineering.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.510 
And what is of particular
interest for us is

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.430 
the digital traces.
Every interaction

7
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.700 
with an Internet service
leaves a digital footprint.

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.600 
Some of those traces are obvious.
For example, if we send an email.

9
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.610 
Email is traced on the email server of the
sender and then the immediate system

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.400 
on the receivers, on some router,
or if we try to connect

11
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.900 
to the Internet, then we
have to give the IP

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.450 
address to the
Internet provider.

13
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.700 
So the Internet provider can
follow all what we are doing

14
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.790 
or what we are doing with that connection. Other
interactions leave less obvious traces, for example,

15
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.560 
cashless payment translations
or use of discount cards

16
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.650 
or so-called hidden
web-beacons in Web

17
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100 
pages. So in most
cases, no one knows

18
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.660 
who is involved in the data
processing, who sees this data, who

19
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.340 
is operating this data, who
is storing that data and

20
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.360 
where is this
data stored?

21
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.780 
So who and the where are important
questions concerning the trustability

22
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.310 
of that kind
of activity?

23
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.310 
So if we look to the
private sphere like

24
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710 
we have it in the physical world,
then the private non-public

25
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.310 
sphere is defined as the
sphere in which a person has

26
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.660 
the right to freely
develop on

27
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
one's own personality unaffected
by external influences.

28
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.640 
And this right to privacy is
considered a fundamental

29
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.640 
human right. Now,

30
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.870 
when we look to the to
the digital world, then

31
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.190 
this data privacy brings
a lot of different

32
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.740 
aspects that need to be
considered, for example, how

33
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.550 
to protect data against
unauthorized data processing

34
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.840 
or against unauthorized
data storage.

35
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.910 
Because when we send data over the
Internet, people that are connected

36
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.410 
to the Internet, they have access to the
Internet and they can also take our data

37
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.850 
to do something with it.
An aspect of the data

38
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.820 
privacy is, of course, the right to
information and self-determination.

39
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.650 
The humans have the right to
determine by themselves what's

40
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.150 
going on with
their data.

41
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.210 
Special protection, of course,
is necessary for personal data

42
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.650 
to protect the right to
privacy in data processing.

43
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
How is this organised is a difficult
question and how the different

44
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.140 
devices and entities
in the Internet

45
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.790 
deal with this, this is what we want
to have a closer look in this week.

46
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.930 
So the term "privacy" today
is a very common used

47
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.600 
in the digital context.

48
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.310 
A lot has changed compared to our
traditional understanding of privacy

49
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.690 
in the physical world.

50
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.370 
Something is necessary, though, is
that the technique is working.

51
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.710 
But of course, we have to think
about how this encompasses

52
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.200 
the digital
private sphere

53
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.900 
and the data privacy in
the digital space.

54
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.200 
The digital footprints, of course,
they contribute to the violation

55
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.200 
of the private sphere.

56
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.960 
So, for example, when we use an Internet
service like Google or Facebook,

57
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.100 
we have to accept that
some data are traced.

58
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.490 
We often give our data, even voluntarily,
for example, to the social networks,

59
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.900 
often without considering
the possible consequences

60
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.270 
that later on it's very difficult to get
back the data, how to delete the data.

61
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.830 
This is a huge problem
in social networks,

62
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.290 
or if one shows his
party pictures

63
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.490 
as a young man or woman

64
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.790 
and then later on, one says
perhaps it not good to have such

65
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.530 
kind of pictures freely
accessible in the Internet.

66
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.730 
But even the correlation of
seemingly unproblematic data

67
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.800 
can lead to a violation of the
private sphere by combining

68
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.780 
data from different sources
so that in each source

69
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.760 
it's not a problem, but in
combination, the data tells a lot

70
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.140 
of the specific

71
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.900 
private life.

72
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.340 
So where and by whom
data is processed is

73
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.240 
often unclear. Where or
who stores our data?

74
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.370 
So the answer to these
questions is crucial for

75
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.600 
data privacy.

76
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.810 
There is an additional fact that
makes it difficult to deal

77
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.130 
with this. Data Privacy
law is a national law

78
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.120 
and when we consider activities in the
Internet, there's a global activity.

79
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.110 
So there are many different
national laws affected.

80
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.870 
The laws for
data privacy,

81
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.220 
they differ from country to country, in
different countries the people have

82
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.420 
different, more strong
or more relaxed

83
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.590 
relation to that topic.

84
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.560 
So if we look at Germany, for example, financial transactions are
sometimes critical since the transaction should be executed via servers

85
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.200 
outside Germany. So another
national rule come

86
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.790 
into place. So what we want
to do in this week, in

87
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.570 
the course week-6 is we
will look at the digital

88
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.400 
technologies, at different technologies,
and we'll ask the question-

89
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.580 
how is this different
digital technology

90
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.590 
can endanger or compromise
privacy and data protection

91
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.470 
within the
digital world?

92
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.770 
So we look and consider card
payment and bonus cards.

93
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.120 
We consider smart phones
and personal devices,

94
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.310 
for example, wearables.

95
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.380 
We consider motion profiles
in the real world

96
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.400 
that can be
concluded from

97
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.320 
services, GPS service,
location services

98
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.690 
from smartphones. We consider the
monitoring on the Internet,

99
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.180 
for example, by national security
programmes like PRISM.

100
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.890 
We discuss various aspects
of cloud computing.

101
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.870 
When can cloud computing is
used for personal data?

102
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.650 
And of course, if we look to the
future with smart home and smart

103
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.540 
metering, then there are a
lot of aspects to consider

104
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.460 
when we consider
privacy and

105
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640 
data protection.

106
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.330 
We in this coming week,
we also will discuss

107
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.200 
where and which data
accumulates and by whom it is

108
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.360 
processed and stored.

109
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.460 
And we want to extend

110
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.600 
your knowledge and give you some
hints on how you can protect

111
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.230 
yourself.

112
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.720 
But like in all courses, because
we hope it's an interesting

113
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.190 
programme. We wish you a lot of
insight and of course, to have fun

114
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.990 
and invite you particularly for such topic,
to have interaction with other learners

115
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.990 
and start discussions in
our discussion forum.

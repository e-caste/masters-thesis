00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.500 
Welcome to our OpenHPI course mastering
design thinking in organizations,

2
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.660 
I'm Dannielly and the topic of
today is creating innovative

3
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.730 
spaces and the
dream team.

4
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.360 
The learning objectives of today's
model are 1.to learn about

5
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.610 
what you should consider when composing
creative teams, and 2. to understand

6
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.900 
some important elements that you should
keep in mind when setting up spaces

7
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.830 
that enable teams to see the value that
diversity brings, and also spaces

8
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.320 
that can foster creativity. If we take a look
at our designing implementation wheel,

9
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.480 
we are in the topic of spaces and
team composition. Now I will

10
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.730 
give you an initial understanding,
just a glimpse of how to

11
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.910 
compose the spaces and teams to
enable designing teams to perform.

12
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.540 
First, let's talk about what we should consider
when we are composing creative teams.

13
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.090 
When striving for innovation many organizations
establish interdisciplinary teams

14
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.970 
due to the belief that innovation
can be more likely to be generated

15
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.220 
by diversity
in knowledge.

16
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.660 
Many academics and practitioners
believe that design thinking

17
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.560 
works best in
cross-disciplinary themes.

18
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.680 
They emphasized that in order
to create solutions that are

19
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.430 
not only desirable, but also feasible
and viable. These analytic

20
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.910 
teams need to be composed of
individuals with technical expertise

21
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.540 
and know-how about the
industry and the market.

22
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.260 
Thus an ideal team would encompass people
from various functions and disciplines,

23
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.820 
such as engineering, software
development, sales and marketing.

24
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.430 
Our further advise is to aim for
diversity in teams of learning styles,

25
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.990 
talents and preferences, for example,
for conducting interviews,

26
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.780 
visualizing ideas
or presenting,

27
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.150 
to include people from different
IQ levels. Was also

28
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.040 
seen to be helpful in creating
alignment within the organization.

29
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.950 
However, there are many studies that have
found positive and negative correlations

30
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.790 
between diversity and
team performance.

31
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.860 
Let's try to understand
why that is?

32
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.320 
Diversity can be defined as
differences among individuals on

33
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.070 
any attributes that will lead
to the perception that others

34
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.890 
are different
from oneself.

35
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.840 
In diverse teams,individuals
have different beliefs that are

36
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.670 
shaped by the own experiences and they
interact following different social norms.

37
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.760 
It's a notable challenge on how to
compose teams, in order to overcome

38
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.840 
cognitive boundaries and transform teams
it into an integrated collaboration.

39
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.110 
For example, you should not expect
to have a high performing team

40
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.780 
just because they are diverse in terms of
nationality, gender, age, and expertise.

41
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.430 
the topic is much more
complex than that.

42
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.710 
The effect of diversity on team
performance depends on the

43
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.750 
belief of the team members
in regard to diversity.

44
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.430 
If the work environment does not
enable the team to see the

45
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.360 
potential that diversity can bring,
it does not matter how much

46
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.550 
diversity you have in your team. Diversity belief
is the individual's perception of diversity

47
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.410 
in a team environment.

48
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.520 
This concept is based on a social
psychological phenomenon

49
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.850 
named self-fulfilling
prophecy.

50
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.020 
The term refers to a situation
where a certain belief would

51
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.890 
lead to a desired or
expected outcome.

52
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.710 
This implies that demographic
diversity is more likely to have

53
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.760 
a more positive impact on team
performance, when individuals

54
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.030 
have a higher perception of
the value of diversity.

55
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.930 
I'm not saying that we should
infuse in the minds of the team

56
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.170 
that diversity
brings value.

57
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.430 
If you try to do that you
will most likely fail.

58
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.390 
What i'm saying is that, we need to offer
a space where teams can collaborate

59
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.040 
and perceive by themselves the
different capabilities that

60
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.320 
they have and how these capabilities
can be put together in a valuable way.

61
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.860 
It's basically helping them to perceive the
benefits that each individual can provide,

62
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.760 
therefore, it's not just about being
different in a demographic level,

63
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.530 
for example, being diverse in
terms of age, nationality, gender.

64
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:49.780 
It's rather how to enrich the work space
in a way that enables teams to shape

65
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.410 
the team members believes and perception
about the value of team interaction.

66
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.240 
Therefore, for innovative organizations
it's not enough to have diverse teams,

67
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
they also have to provide a space that
can positively shape the team's belief

68
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.750 
and perception on their diversity.
But you are probably wondering

69
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.720 
now how should this
space look like?

70
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:27.550 
How can I set up a space that can support
my team to see the value of diversity

71
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.310 
and be creative. And also
how does creativity arise?

72
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.880 
What inspires us? where
do new ideas come from?

73
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.810 
what promotes or increases
creativity and inspiration?

74
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.260 
Good ideas cannot
be forced.

75
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.370 
In general they also do not arise why one
sits at a desk thinking about a problem.

76
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.880 
They typically emerge from the
subconscious and are therefore

77
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.330 
difficult to a list. Inspiration does
not come from oneself, instead

78
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.870 
external factors
provoke it.

79
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.920 
Therefore the right environment is
absolutely able to foster creative work.

80
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.410 
Carrying out a successful project
requires appropriate infrastructure.

81
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:32.240 
Particularly in organizations with no suitable
spaces for designing thinking projects,

82
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.300 
it can be a challenge to
establish the right environment.

83
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.520 
Nevertheless, the appropriate environment
for a successful collaboration

84
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.910 
can be set up with simple materials.
Which can be digital and no digital.

85
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.540 
Private workspace for each design-thinking
member, a private workspace

86
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.050 
should be available for every member
of the designer thinking team.

87
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:05.470 
Despite intensive collaboration
within the team, it must be ensured

88
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.190 
that team members can also work
in peace and concentrate on

89
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.010 
the numerous tasks
required of them.

90
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.170 
Even though this anything is
based largely on teamwork,

91
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:24.460 
team members need work spaces in
which to be alone and undisturbed.

92
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.590 
So that they can concentrate
on certain tasks.

93
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.790 
For example, part time research or a search for
benchmarks required time and concentration.

94
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:42.080 
This is usually difficult to
find in team work spaces, which

95
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.670 
is why it's very important to
set up focused work spaces.

96
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.720 
And when I'm talking about work
spaces, I don't mean physical spaces.

97
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.970 
Digital spaces are as much
valuable as physical spaces.

98
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.970 
In addition to private work spaces, it's
important to build the right environment

99
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.920 
for teamwork and
collaboration.

100
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.970 
In this field team members often
have to work with one another,

101
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:18.730 
for example, when discussing interview
results and arriving at conclusions

102
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:24.340 
that guide the project's next steps.
When it comes to physical spaces

103
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.600 
classical desks are not
suitable for this,

104
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.760 
instead large free surfaces on
which the team can write and

105
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.890 
stick post-its
are required.

106
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.020 
Tables should be free-standing
and accessible from all sides,

107
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.520 
for geographically distributed
teams there are many online

108
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.660 
tools that they can use to cocreate.
The most well known tools are Moodle

109
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.390 
sprint bass, and
blitz minds.

110
00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.890 
Areas for sharing and distributing knowledge
for example presentations to clients,

111
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:07.790 
help them to show their projects i.e.
all results and thereby receive feedback.

112
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.770 
Physical spaces can be simple which
mostly contains only a projector,

113
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.550 
more elaborated spaces could be
smaller stages with simple lighting.

114
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:25.010 
Every designer thinking team
needs prototype in space i.e

115
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.260 
space in which to
build prototypes.

116
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.320 
It's important to provide the
right materials for creation

117
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.940 
that are targeted at
the project challenge.

118
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.730 
For example, soldering tools or
electronics such as Arduino

119
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.020 
should be made available depending
on the need of the project.

120
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:52.490 
Here at the house of the institute we
have a small room with materials

121
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.490 
mostly composed of electronics
to build hardware.

122
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.170 
Teams can help themselves to
all the supplies they need,

123
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.730 
and after a few seconds
begin building a prototype.

124
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.720 
E,verything has
a purpose

125
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.960 
is the saying in our designer
thinking work spaces.

126
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.600 
Designing teams need
frequent workspace changes,

127
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.650 
whether for a short presentation,
that quickly requires a large

128
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:28.450 
area for role play the laying out
and building of a prototype

129
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.440 
that needs
additional space.

130
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.930 
Rules and work spaces must be
adapted to the needs of the team,

131
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.970 
not the other way around. To achieve
this, furniture and other structures

132
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.240 
should ideally roll rather
than have a fixed feet.

133
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.010 
To allow the team to rearrange the
room to suit their own needs

134
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:58.340 
in a very short amount of time the
same applies to digital spaces.

135
00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:04.030 
It's important to test different
tools to see which one meets

136
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.590 
the needs of the team.

137
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:11.580 
Different phases of design thinking
have different needs, therefore

138
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:16.270 
are tools that offers appropriate
features is fundamental.

139
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:24.410 
When setting up designing thinking spaces,
you should first familiarize yourself

140
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.450 
with the general principles
for creative work spaces.

141
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:35.330 
For this there are a number of
recommendations. The most important ones are,

142
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.810 
1: foster interaction
in groups and teams,

143
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.900 
2: stimulate creativity 3.
or four workspace choices,

144
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:55.260 
4. focus and teamwork spaces
must be available, 5. make

145
00:12:55.270 --> 00:13:00.000 
co-creation spaces for work
with third parties available,

146
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.000 
6. open large desks and
lots of table spaces,

147
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:10.920 
7.set up sources of
inspirations such as libraries.

148
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.780 
In this module I gave you just
a glimpse of what you should

149
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:23.990 
consider when composing creative teams
and also some relevant elements

150
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.210 
that you should keep in mind when
setting up spaces that enable

151
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.310 
teams to see the value
that diversity brings,

152
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.360 
and also false
creativity.

153
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.550 
If you want to have a modern
detailed view on spaces and how

154
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.170 
to compose the dream team please
watch our conversation with

155
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:50.010 
Raphael Gielegn Vitra and
also professor Christine Thong

156
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.290 
from Swinburne
university.

157
00:13:54.650 --> 00:14:00.800 
Thank you for your attention and see
you again as part of our next module.

158
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.070 
Ciao!

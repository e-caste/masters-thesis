00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.160 
So, what will our journey look like in the next couple of weeks?

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.199 
Let's take a closer look at our digital entrepreneurship framework.

3
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.360 
This openHPI course will officially run for one month

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.650 
and consists of eight different thematic sessions.

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.260 
As shown on the slide next to me, we are currently in week one

6
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.669 
and this video is part of session one.

7
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.547 
Each week we will unlock two new sessions for you to experience

8
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.900 
and dive into. The individual sessions, build up on each other.

9
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.771 
You will see that the topics get more narrow by focussing on specific

10
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.700 
research streams, as our journey continues.

11
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.299 
Our first week revolves around the principles of digital entrepreneurship

12
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.380 
research, where we lay the groundwork for this course.

13
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.881 
This video you're currently watching is part of the first session: Introduction

14
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.819 
to Digital Entrepreneurship, where we will approach the topic of digital

15
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.446 
entrepreneurship by developing a common understanding of the main concepts

16
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.059 
and terms.

17
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.844 
In the following session: Scientific Principles of Entrepreneurship, we

18
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.899 
will present the tools of trade, of entrepreneurship researchers.

19
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.312 
We will show you how we conduct research, communicate with

20
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.041 
each other and how we communicate our findings to a broader

21
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.980 
audience.

22
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.909 
In the second week, we will talk about the entrepreneurial process

23
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.239 
and focus on the individual entrepreneur.

24
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.909 
We will present which tools, sets and methods are discussed and entrepreneurship

25
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.654 
research and what scientific findings are available when

26
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.659 
measuring their effectiveness.

27
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.342 
Following this session, we will show you what research has

28
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.463 
discovered about the entrepreneurial mindset and whether scientists

29
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.836 
believe an entrepreneur is born or if entrepreneurship

30
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.689 
can be taught and learnt by anyone.

31
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.580 
In week three, we will discuss how entrepreneurial activities

32
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.379 
do not just build on a single person's creativity and

33
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.999 
ideas. Over time this idea has formed the entrepreneur

34
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.283 
as an individual male who comes up with a brilliant idea that leads

35
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.726 
to a breakthrough Start-Up that changes the market forever, this

36
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.806 
is a Monomyth. The reality of most entrepreneurs looks very different, and

37
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.917 
most entrepreneurs need a team to unlock the whole potential of

38
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.490 
an idea. Thus, for the session collaboration and entrepreneurship,

39
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.840 
we will take a closer look at how Start-Up teams collaborate.

40
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.089 
In our next session, Female Entrepreneurship, we will get to the bottom

41
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.079 
of what kind of differences research has found between female

42
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.300 
and male entrepreneurs.

43
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.729 
We will question common assumptions about female entrepreneurs and highlight

44
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.080 
gender bias in entrepreneurship and how research addresses these.

45
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.481 
We will take a bird's eye view for the fourth week and look

46
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.774 
at entrepreneurship from an ecosystem perspective in our

47
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.210 
session, entrepreneurial ecosystems.

48
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.179 
We will show you how individual entrepreneurs and Start-Up teams

49
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.973 
are part of a larger entrepreneurial ecosystem and depend

50
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.923 
on other actors and institutions to survive and

51
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.529 
thrive. Lastly, in our final session, Impact

52
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.479 
Entrepreneurship, we will discuss how entrepreneurs, start-ups

53
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.099 
and whole entrepreneurial ecosystems can together find

54
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.809 
solutions for today's grand challenges such as climate

55
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.129 
change and in the process, create a sustainable

56
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280 
impact.

57
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.409 
Each of these presented eight sessions will consist of different items

58
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.479 
to guide you through the topics my teaching team and I will provide

59
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.910 
the current perspective of the thematic topics and put it into context

60
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.249 
with scientific findings and recent discussions.

61
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.047 
Further, we have invited leading experts from the field to talk

62
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.379 
about their take on these topics and give us a practical perspective.

63
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.300 
These videos will be part of our format coffee with guest speakers.

64
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.719 
We have prepared readings for the different sessions for those who wish to deepen

65
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.860 
their understanding of the presenter topics.

66
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.282 
By reading the papers and cases you can practise your scientific understanding

67
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.988 
in this field. To test your new knowledge of the different sessions,

68
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.850 
we will unlock weekly quizzes.

69
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.671 
We hope that our framework provides you with an overview of

70
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.690 
what you can expect from this cause in the next weeks,

71
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.856 
if you're ready to learn more than continue with our first content related

72
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.220 
video, where we will be approaching the concept of digital entrepreneurship.

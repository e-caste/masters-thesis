1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.770 
and now let's have a deeper look into what we are going to actually learn about

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.120 
in the first week you will have several videos

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.780 
that we will start by having an overview of all the Qiskit components

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.820 
then we will have a tour of the main platform that we will

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.230 
be using during the course which is the idea in Quantum Services platform

6
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.310 
after that Elisa will do a recap of all the concepts that will

7
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.010 
be needed for the rest of the course in quantum computing

8
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.930 
and then we will go back to the platform and explain one of

9
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.050 
the useful tools that you will find there which is called the composer

10
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.900 
and we will use that tool to create your very first

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.650 
quantum circuit and running it on a real device and a simulator

12
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.340 
after that we will go have some and we will start with the coding

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.820 
we will first do some explanations about the basic

14
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.990 
syntax that you need to build circuits and then we will go

15
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.500 
to review the visualisation tools how to run circuits in simulators

16
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.270 
and how to run our experiments in actual real quantum devices in the cloud

17
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.620 
and once you have all these basics we can start implementing real quantum algorithms

18
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.410 
so we start with a Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm where we first give you

19
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.180 
some Info, some theory and then show you how to construct the circuit

20
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.270 
then we will run the circuit both on a simulator and on

21
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.490 
an actual device and then the second algorithm we're going

22
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.580 
to talk about is Grover Algorithm i would again quickly recap the theory

23
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.060 
show you how to implement it with Qiskit and then show you

24
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.830 
an extra example on us of a satisfiability problem that is

25
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.240 
maybe a bit more related to everyday life

26
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.450 
well and then in the last video i'm going to talk about measurement

27
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.990 
error mitigation so we'll show you how to mitigate errors that

28
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.970 
come from during the measurement and then we will apply these

29
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.810 
to our results that we got from the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm and

30
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.790 
the Grover Algorithm so we hope you're going to enjoy this video series and we're

31
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.710 
looking forward to see you

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.150 
Hi, my name is Johannes Greiner. I work for
IBM as a quantum systems developer

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.570 
and I have the privilege to tell
you today about quantum computing

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.390 
and how it
actually works.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.640 
So few words about me. I studied
a physics and already

5
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.350 
went into quantum computing, quantum
information in two thousand ten.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.450 
I did my masters at King's College
in London and then moved

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.650 
on to a PhD in quantum technology,
quantum algorithms in Stuttgart.

8
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.630 
In my professional experience I also
had to do with quantum computing already.

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.780 
First in kind of like an R&amp;D
role at Mercedes where my main job

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
was to look for new technology
and the eye for car production.

11
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.740 
And now as I said I'm a quantum systems
developer and if you want any more

12
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.600 
info you can look me up on Linkedin.
So here's what we'll talk

13
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.050 
about today. You may have seen
this picture already in the

14
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.550 
talk of my colleague but here what
we wanted to is we want to

15
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.170 
really get into more details
about of this quantum computer.

16
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.200 
So as you can see, yeah, there's
this kind of like fridge,

17
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.930 
the cryostat in the middle that
really cools down the quantum chip

18
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
which sits at the
very bottom of it.

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.350 
But around it you have all this
a electronics like on the right

20
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.670 
side of the slide as you see the
the room temperature electronics

21
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.200 
that actually control
operations and send in some

22
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.170 
some microwave pulses to do
operations on the quantum

23
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.500 
states and also to do the measurements
and to get back to signal.

24
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.450 
So in brief the structure is
like this. You see on your

25
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.950 
PC and submit something to the cloud.
It gets sent to this electronics

26
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.020 
that control a quantum chip and
this one communicates back

27
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.250 
and forth with  the
quantum chip directly.

28
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.580 
And remember so the electronics are
kind of warm, at least compared

29
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.030 
to this quantum chip. They're at
room temperature and it's only

30
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.910 
the quantum chip that's really
cold. So the whole quantum

31
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.650 
computer is composed of
different elements and yet there

32
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.550 
would be lot that I could tell
you about today but we have

33
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.880 
to focus on one thing and that is mainly
on how this quantumcomputer works.

34
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.400 
But there again I will not go too
much into the whole physics

35
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.720 
of superconductivity or transmon
qubits or the structure of the chip.

36
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.160 
I will tell you once that like
this these little black squares

37
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.340 
that you see, these are qubits. These
white connections in between

38
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.530 
are microwave resonators that
connect the different qubits

39
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.080 
with each other and then the red
resonator lines that you see coming out,

40
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.040 
they're ones that are used to
read out these qubits or

41
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.470 
set them to certain
states in the beginning.

42
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.430 
But that's pretty much all that
I will tell you about the

43
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.900 
hardware itself, because what I
would, I really would like you

44
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.800 
to see and understand is like what
makes a quantum computer special, right?

45
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.630 
So there are some effects that
come from quantum mechanics

46
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.950 
and that makes this
this quantum computer

47
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.530 
different to any other computer
that you may be familiar with.

48
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.240 
So first there's this principle
called superposition

49
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.690 
and basically as you see
on the slide here, the

50
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.300 
states in which the quantum
bits are at one given moment

51
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.740 
are not just described by
a bit like a zero or one,

52
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.000 
but by two dimensional vectors
which show you which

53
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.670 
are the state that it's currently in and the
whole point about the superposition is

54
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.140 
then you can be basically in
zero and one at the same time,

55
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.030 
right? So that's very different
from normal classical computers.

56
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.880 
You have this superposition
of both states and

57
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.650 
you have the state one and it's
here really vector one and the

58
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.140 
vector zero. So here they are called
ket zero and ket one. Why's

59
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.750 
that? So I added some explanation
for that as well. Pretty simple.

60
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.360 
The english word bra|ket is split
up in two. So the one kind of

61
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.140 
vector's called bra and the
other one is ket and what

62
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.900 
kind of vectors are these? So in
fact this is just like a offensive

63
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.670 
way to ride like a vector product.
So you know this normal vector

64
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.800 
product, if you have two vectors,
here two components each, so

65
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.650 
you know that if you wanted
to make it in the matrix

66
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.880 
multiplication you would have
to transpose the first vector

67
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.570 
and multiply to the second which you
end up summing up all the entries.

68
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.520 
Here it's a little bit different.
So remember we're dealing

69
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.070 
with complex lectures that will
tell you why in a minute.

70
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.010 
And here this scalar product is
this funny bra|ket notation

71
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.850 
is defined in such a way that you have
to complex conjugate the first

72
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.100 
vector and transpose it before
you multiply it to the other. So

73
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.830 
it's pretty similarto
the normal added products that

74
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.300 
you know except you also have to
do this complex conjugation.

75
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.760 
So that's a bit like the
math behind it and yeah

76
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.470 
as I said, so if like
this a and b vector here,

77
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.180 
which are both complex vectors,
if only one of them is a or

78
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.210 
if both of them are non-zero
then this qubit state contains

79
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.910 
both zero and one. So it's not like
just to involve it is like the

80
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.870 
state that can be displayed on a whole
sphere as you see, the little sphere

81
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.240 
on this light called Bloch Sphere.
It's a pretty special

82
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.930 
sphere and I'll explain you a
bit more about this as well.

83
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.080 
So the reason why we can where we can
display this as a sphere at all

84
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.570 
is that each of these states
that describe the qubid always

85
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.300 
have to always have to have the
norm one. The reason for that

86
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.330 
is that there are ultimately
assigned probability,

87
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.880 
so in the end when you do your
measurements all the probabilities

88
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.240 
of course have to sum up to one,
right. And here the reason why

89
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.000 
you can display this as a sphere
is that you can rewrite

90
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.050 
every single state size or in the
picture as well you see there's little

91
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.240 
side there which points
in some kind of direction on the sphere

92
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.570 
and it can always be parametrized like
this. So a cosin θ/2 and

93
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.290 
e by the iφ sine θ/2
or the other state and by

94
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.060 
this you can pretty much reach
any state on that sphere.

95
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.440 
Now one thing that is special about
the Bloch sphere, it's not just

96
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.610 
the normal sphere where you turn
things around like you would do

97
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.020 
with the ball. One thing is special.
If you go around at once,

98
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.120 
you're actually not back to the same
state, right? So if you started zero

99
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.080 
you go around the sphere once, you're
actually going to end up in minus

100
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.180 
zero and only if you do this two
times you get back to the normal

101
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.390 
zero state you started from.
The reason for this is a little

102
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.030 
bit subtle but ultimately it's
just because we're dealing with

103
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.620 
complex vectors here again and
the rotations that would take

104
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.310 
around is these complex vectors are
just a bit different than the normal

105
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.200 
rotations you know from
everyday life in three dimensions.

106
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.090 
So at this point you're probably
thinking, so what's this all about?

107
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.280 
You should get real here. So
you're talking about complex

108
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.020 
vector, you're talking about complex
sphere. How does this

109
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.820 
relate to our reality, like if we measure
something, it can't be complex right? So

110
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.950 
indeed that's true. So to
get real, we'll have to measure

111
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.540 
the qubit. So before it's in some
kind of superposition state

112
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.440 
as we said and once we do a measurement
it will actually always like

113
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.470 
if the state is over here
in a sphere, as you

114
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.690 
see in this picture, it would be
projected, always be brought

115
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.510 
here to zero or down to one
while doing the measurement.

116
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.880 
So there's a probability that you
reach either zero or one and

117
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.320 
that probability is given by
these factors a and b. So

118
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.700 
a squared, a norm squared, so
the kind of like a

119
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.230 
complex times its conjugate,
you get this real number

120
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.300 
which is the probability to
get state zero and also b

121
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.470 
norm squared is the
probability to get one.

122
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.950 
So what does this mean? You see
these two examples. There is

123
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.290 
the example of a state where
you have the same probabilities

124
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.530 
for getting zero and one. Still
it's just fifty-fifty, right?

125
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.770 
So if you do one measurement that's
not, I will stress that again.

126
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.740 
And the lower stage you see okay,
squared of three over two, if

127
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.990 
you squared it you get
three quarters and that means

128
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.720 
you have a seventy five percent
chance of getting zero and as

129
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.130 
I said stressing again, so with
normal bits obviously if you

130
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.160 
measure one you always know its
state, right? So it has been zero,

131
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.340 
it has been one and you do the
measurement and you know exactly

132
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.780 
what state it was, right? Here it's
a bit different. It's quantum mechanics.

133
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.380 
So before it's some kind of complex
state as we discussed and

134
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.180 
only when you do the measurement
you get back your real zero

135
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.430 
or one, right? So then the
result is classical but if you

136
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.840 
do just one measurement you can
never get the full state that

137
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.390 
you have access before. So here
you have to do one, more than one

138
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.120 
shot. You actually have
to redo your algorithm a

139
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.860 
few times to get to the state
you're interested in and then

140
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.560 
and then do like a thousand shots
of measurement. For example

141
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.280 
to get proper statistics to
really find out these probabilities

142
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.190 
and the pre vectors a and b
ultimately to really address the

143
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.500 
state. Right. So you remember
you're going to have to measure

144
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.080 
many times in
quantum computing.

145
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.500 
Now we come to my favorite and
actually it should be the favourite

146
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.900 
of everyone who's really interested
in quantum computing, that's

147
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.790 
quantum entanglement. So what
is this all about? This

148
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.190 
is like the, to me is the one
resource that really makes

149
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.340 
quantum bits different from
anything else you have seen before.

150
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:58.500 
So if you have two quantum bits and look
at them together then you get

151
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.440 
you get states like these, like the ones
shown on the slide where you have

152
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.750 
you have in this ket vector
you would have two entries

153
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.420 
were the first is for the first qubit
and the second is for the second qubit.

154
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.220 
And once again all amplitudes sum up
to one because their probabilities

155
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.910 
of what you can
measure in the end.

156
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.990 
But here the interesting thing
is that that some states are

157
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.300 
entangled states where you can't
tell apart which one

158
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.950 
is qubit a and qubit d. I'll show you
more about that in a second.

159
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.270 
And other states are not entangled.
So you see in this example

160
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.750 
already the one that's not
entangled. Yeah in both cases the

161
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.540 
the first entries are zeroes, that
means the first qubit is in

162
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:48.200 
the well defined state zero. In the other
two examples where it's entangled

163
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.760 
it's not clear what state the
first qubit is or second qubit is and

164
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.270 
that's why requirement tangles.
There will be more about that. As I

165
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.480 
said in the one case you
can kind of take out

166
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.280 
the state of that first qubit and
it's pretty clear yeah that's

167
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.170 
in space zero and the other one is
in some kind of superposition state.

168
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.530 
But in this other case we cannot
write this as the combination

169
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.030 
of two single qubit states and that's
actually really remarkable.

170
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:24.580 
You just can't tell them apart
anymore. So physically right

171
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.490 
they're obviously two
different quantum bits.

172
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.570 
Right? So the one is one is in that
one position, we call it a,

173
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.620 
the other is at the other
position, we call it b,

174
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.970 
and here I give you a bit of
annotation of how this is

175
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.380 
meant. So the first line
you see this is the collective

176
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.160 
state of qubid a and b and then you can
separate it into a state where it's only

177
00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.400 
where there's a on the left side and
b on the right side. But in

178
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.920 
this other case it's just not
possible. So generally that's

179
00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.810 
kind of the formula you're
looking for. You have

180
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.690 
this state that describes
both a and b but you cannot

181
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.930 
write it as something that
describes only a and only b. So

182
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.870 
think about that for a minute and
let it sink in, because it's

183
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:18.010 
quite amazing. So there's two
different quantum bits but this

184
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.200 
wave function that really describes
the state can only can

185
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.290 
only be written in such a way that
you describe both of them.

186
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:30.320 
So that means like two things
really have become one thing or

187
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.400 
it's like the wave function that
describes this one quantum-bit

188
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.800 
physically, it has kind of spread out
over both of these quantum bits

189
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.880 
and you can only describe them
as this combined entity, right?

190
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.560 
That's really entanglement. You
just can't take it apart. So

191
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.570 
you can combine into whatever you want
if you're, poetic compare it with

192
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.490 
with marriage or compare it with some
kind of organisms in nature that join

193
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.870 
together and try to become one.
That's really what quantum

194
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.250 
entanglement is and because
that's so central to quantum

195
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:05.080 
computing I also prepared like
a Qiskit demonstration that

196
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:12.600 
I'll show you in the later video of
like what does entanglement really mean.

197
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:19.500 
Then obviously to run
some kind of algorithm you

198
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.110 
need some kind of operation, some
kind of dates that

199
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.430 
run through your algorithm. So
you're used to AND, OR, NOT,

200
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.960 
NAND and XOR gateways in
classical computing. Here

201
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.000 
the operations as well
are different but you

202
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.800 
can write them as well in such a circuit
form. So see the different examples here.

203
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.800 
In this first case there's
just like one operation that's

204
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.410 
run on one qubit and you measure
it and in this case you get

205
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.120 
some, you get a fifty fifty chance as
well to measure zero and one

206
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.070 
and some other examples like
that and on the bottom you see

207
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.680 
another circuit that has been
between two different qubits, right?

208
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:07.110 
So this first thing is like a
controlled NOT operation, I think

209
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.640 
my colleague already told you a
bit about that, and well it's

210
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.460 
just a state of two quantum
bits. But a bit more detail

211
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.440 
on how this works. So we pick
out this one simple simple

212
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:27.170 
algorithm here which just has one
operation and one thing that

213
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.700 
you have to do if you don't want
to write it as like a matrix

214
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.260 
acting on that entry
states, so on the left

215
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.510 
sorry, on the left you have
that interstate zero

216
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.610 
and then something adds in it.
So if you want to write

217
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.920 
it as the matrix operation acting on that
complex vector, obviously you have to

218
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:52.050 
turn around right and left,
so you have this H acting on

219
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.790 
the state zero and then you get
a superposition state. If you

220
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.360 
want to run this in a simulation or
if you wonder how the simulations

221
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.300 
are done you can write each of
these operations as a matrix

222
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:08.190 
and acting on a vector. So in the
beginning of the talk it was written

223
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:13.480 
that the sketch zero can also be just
just written as a normal vector,

224
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.980 
normally would have complex entries
here because it's a simple

225
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.030 
vector, it has real entries and
you act with that matrix on

226
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:26.900 
that vector and you get some resulting
state. Here it's the superposition state.

227
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.300 
So just so you've seen it
once these operations are all

228
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:36.330 
at least one qubit operation or belong to a
group of matrices called special unitary

229
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.920 
group and it has the properties
that each of these matrices

230
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.480 
if the complex conjugate and transpose
it you end up with the same matrix

231
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.380 
and like all other rotation matrices
this has the determinant of one.

232
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.420 
So really what it does, it really
rotates things around the Bloch

233
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.770 
sphere here and that's also a
remarkable thing and also gives

234
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.180 
you an idea why quantum computers
are not perfect today because

235
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.800 
even if you do a simple NOT
operation, right, normally you'd

236
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.720 
just flip your bit but here what
you have to do, you're going to

237
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.680 
have to rotate around the whole
sphere and go down and in fact

238
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.160 
you can make a few errors, right.
You cannot, it can happen that

239
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.890 
you don't get exactly the right angle
but you go a bit too far or a bit

240
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.630 
too short, so what I'm saying
here is that all of these

241
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.130 
operations are never completely
perfect. It may be ninety

242
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:32.100 
nine point nine nine percent perfect
but that's one reason why errors

243
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.080 
add up in a quantum computer because it's
just a bit more subtle than doing normal

244
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.280 
operations that you
would do classically.

245
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.150 
But still you can run complex algorithms,
like this one for example.

246
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.700 
So this one has like a lot of
different qubits were there

247
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:56.640 
in fact the whole purpose is
to just encode and decode

248
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.500 
something where an error could
happen in between so there it's

249
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.770 
called quantum error correction
but the main point here is

250
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:07.200 
that you see some gates that act between
two different qubits, there's even some

251
00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:11.160 
that are written in such a way that
the act between three different

252
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.640 
qubits and that's kind of like, that
is extendable to kind of as

253
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:22.210 
many qubits as you have. And one
thing I want to say about that, so

254
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.360 
some of these gates between two
different qubits, they already

255
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.720 
act between more than one qubit
obviously but they may not

256
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.020 
be already causing entanglement
right? So for example the controlled

257
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.930 
NOT operation does nothing if the
control qubit is in state zero.

258
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.020 
So that point is not an entangling
operation but there is still

259
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.040 
some kind of interference between
the different qubits and

260
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.760 
in fact looking at this
whole algorithm, there's interference

261
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.070 
between different states, right?
So remember all these states

262
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:56.990 
are really described as wave
functions and wherever there

263
00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.200 
are waves you know that there is
interference just like when

264
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:06.030 
you throw two stones in a lake
and you can use that for within

265
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.880 
your algorithm, then you canbasically
promote one possible outcome, right?

266
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.260 
junior algorithms that such that
one of the outcomes

267
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.420 
is the most likely and that's ultimately
the result of your algorithm

268
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.060 
and that's all based on this concept of
interference between the different

269
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.740 
qubits in the
different states.

270
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.980 
So to sum up these are the
most important effects that

271
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.170 
you have in quantum computing. You
don't just have normal bits,

272
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.020 
you have the superposition of
different states that that are

273
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.160 
described on a whole sphere.
You have measurement that

274
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.040 
does give you real result
but has to repeat it has to

275
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.620 
be repeated many times. You have this
crazy notion of entanglement

276
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.500 
where two different qubits are no
longer separable at all. Then

277
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.860 
you have quantum gates
which are operations acting on

278
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.520 
on one or more qubits.

279
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.050 
And you have this interference between
different qubits that really helps you

280
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.660 
run your algorithms. That's basically
the summary of what makes a

281
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.310 
quantum computer special compared
to normal computer and if

282
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.620 
you really understand this then
you know what quantum computing

283
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:19.980 
is all about. So there's one
one announcement I can't stop

284
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:25.060 
myself from making. So you'll
know that IBM is gonna

285
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.520 
have like the first quantum
computer outside of the

286
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.410 
US pretty soon in Germany. So
I'm working on that as well

287
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.540 
and I hope you will also be excited
to try out some algorithms,

288
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.040 
once we have that quantum computer
installed over here in Germany.

289
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.550 
Another thing that you may benefit
from if you want to know

290
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.420 
more about quantum computing in
all these other resources listed

291
00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:56.760 
here on the chart. You can just
look up the IBM academic initiative

292
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:02.010 
ibm.com/academic and find
lot of materials for free on there.

293
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.420 
And that's what I want to
close with. So I told you

294
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.130 
a bit about quantum computing and I
think getting into it is really easy.

295
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:16.210 
You can just try out
quantum-computing.ibm.com or

296
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.710 
if you want to dive a bit deeper
deeper try to the Qiskit

297
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.420 
textbook. You can just search for
that and that will open the

298
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.740 
doors to quantum computing for you.
Thank you for your attention.

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.019 
I thank everyone who contributed to this day today, on the very different, with the very different

2
00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.519 
inputs.

3
00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:17.550 
I learned a lot, even though we've been dealing with this for a while. Am very grateful that you all contributed there.

4
00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:29.739 
It was also certainly a good omen that we're also doing this again in the old tradition here eyeball to eyeball together at networking coffee

5
00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:36.429 
when we started to prepare this, there was still the question: Do you do plan B?

6
00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:46.710 
I said, we don't do a plan B, because there we are too fast with the plan B. Fortunately, that also worked out, that

7
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.450 
we could be here.

8
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.579 
So

9
00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.750 
SAP, we have to tell you that you live up to great expectations here.

10
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.000 
I will tell the board.

11
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.149 
And you please, Mr. HeitkÃ¶tter, also with the team,

12
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.510 
because of course such a big, such a big company can actively do something worldwide, but I would also like to have all the other

13
00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:19.650 
because we always see from the technology perspective that nothing works alone.

14
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.609 
So SAP without VMware doesn't work without that, that doesn't work without that.

15
00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.560 
And at the end of the feed or at the beginning?

16
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.180 
These are small research institutes that

17
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.909 
can stop some effect by making an effort to train the young people the next generation well, well

18
00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:51.019 
select, train well also confront them with the right questions maybe this design thinking alliance that's there

19
00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:59.950 
mentioned was also this is an HPI driven activity so all the D Schools that are now around the world

20
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:12.169 
a little bit together and also with IEEE, constantinos, tries to bring in what they are doing there.

21
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:21.930 
presented earlier, the claim, which I also found very impressively formulated: we have to do more, the mission to

22
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:33.150 
accomplish, and when a director of IEEE says that, it wrings a certain respect out of me, and I believe her

23
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.969 
Outreach is going right there.

24
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.949 
But to fulfill the mission, just not just looking at the technological, but always looking at the context as well

25
00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:52.430 
So I thank everyone, things are recorded, Mr. Asjoma not?, and will be at Tele-Task.de

26
00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:01.539 
like all our conferences, two days how long do you need?

27
00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:10.520 
so in the next few days there also be available also be accessible, be freely accessible so they like to work up there

28
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.930 
can.

29
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.250 
Our MOOC has started all the participants from Open HPI.

30
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:26.199 
1.2 million are alerted in the Global Announcement that this course is now available.

31
00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:30.150 
I think the first 2000 are already enrolled.

32
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:37.750 
They are making an impact here and the idea of connecting that to the label.

33
00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:39.530 
Let's see.

34
00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:49.000 
So as a university professor, I'm always a little bit stricter, have to do even more than I do now, just one course, but

35
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.460 
in any case, this is a top start to make and I thank there also for the activities, has also temporally

36
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:06.340 
fit well that you can now combine that with today, and with that I would like to A: promise that it was the first,

37
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.960 
If you don't know if you want to continue, then you don't give a number, if you say this has been the first one, then

38
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.340 
clear

39
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.699 
there will be a 2nd Clean IT conference next year.

40
00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.000 
We are trying to push that further.

41
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.319 
I hope we will see each other again at the latest then and wish now still nice conversations on the way out a good way home

42
00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.259 
and then at the latest see you again next year.

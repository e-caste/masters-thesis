00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.700 
Now we want to answer the question,
what is a "Digital Identity"?

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.030 
Why do we need
digital identities?

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.140 
The answer is very simple,
the reason is there

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.680 
is a huge and rapidly increasing
number of online services and

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.810 
before we can use such
an online service,

6
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.780 
we have to register.

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.500 
This registration is necessary to
tell the online service

8
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.930 
who we are and what we want to have from
them, and to give the online services a chance

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.910 
for example, to send us a bill, to know
our address and to know what we are

10
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.670 
interested in. So the
service needs to know

11
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
its users. Who is shopping?
Where to deliver the goods?

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.080 
Whose exam results
are these?

13
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:06.840 
So this registration leads to the
establishment of a digital identity.

14
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.050 
And you know such a button

15
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.360 
for example, when you
want to register to openHPI,

16
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.750 
then you have to give your
name, your email address,

17
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.870 
we asked you to tell us a little bit
about you, about your professional

18
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.490 
experience, and what you are
interested in. And this data helps us

19
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.910 
to provide our service in
the right way. And when you

20
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.880 
for example are
doing homework

21
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.330 
or answering questions, then
we exactly send the results

22
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.860 
of this homework or of

23
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.830 
this quiz questions to you.

24
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.840 
So a digital identity uniquely
represents a person, but

25
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.230 
digital identities are not only necessary
for humans, but also for objects

26
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.990 
which are connecting
and using

27
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.790 
the internet and moving
around in the digital world.

28
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.110 
This digital identity contains
attributes. Attributes that help and

29
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.920 
are necessary to distinguish
the different users,

30
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.940 
to distinguish the different
persons, to distinguish different

31
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.170 
objects from each
other because the

32
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.500 
goods that are bought in

33
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.480 
an e-shop should be delivered
exactly to the right buyer.

34
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.670 
So how do such attributes
look like? An example here

35
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.510 
is for example the name, the
address, the birthday, and

36
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.180 
such kind of data which help to
characterize a certain person and

37
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.150 
which helps to distinguish
between two persons.

38
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.710 
Which attributes are
necessary when you

39
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.070 
register with a new domain? It
depends of course on what the

40
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.790 
domain or the service is doing for
you. Sometimes it's enough only

41
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.790 
to have a single attribute for
example the name. But you know

42
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.010 
there are different persons
with the same name.

43
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.980 
So typically more than one
attributes are needed.

44
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.960 
For people with the
same primary attribute,

45
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.720 
a distinctive
secondary

46
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.390 
attribute is necessary.
For example, an address or a

47
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.160 
age or birthday or others.

48
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.670 
If we have

49
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.750 
this published digital identity in
the course of registration with the service,

50
00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.870 
then one has to prove that a certain
identity belongs to a certain person.

51
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.210 
So this is the
authentication.

52
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.940 
But first let me state that
one physical person

53
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.240 
can have many different identities, for
example identities with another user name

54
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.220 
or with another email. Different
types of digital identities

55
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.030 
can serve for different purposes,
for example, in some context

56
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.970 
you want to be anonymous, so you
want to use for example an

57
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.890 
online forum with
a pseudonym,

58
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.420 
or in one you want
to have a

59
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.710 
private identity. For example, your
Facebook account you want to add your hobbies

60
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.930 
which you want only to share with your
friends. Or then there are business

61
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.820 
identities, when you are for
example using LinkedIn

62
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.410 
and speak about your
professional skills.

63
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.290 
So depending on the purpose, the identity
contains different attributes.

64
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.560 
So one person can be characterized
by different collections

65
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.020 
of such attributes.

66
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.460 
I already mentioned this,
identity is needed

67
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.620 
to recognize a person, but in the digital
world all the machines are using

68
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.570 
online services. So digital identities
do not only refer to people,

69
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:40.710 
but also to objects, computers, smart cards,
IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

70
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.580 
They all need a digital identity
to be specified by the service,

71
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.750 
so that the service can

72
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.950 
deliver something what is
requested exactly to the right

73
00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:02.850 
entity. For example, when there is
a homework on OpenHPI, to which

74
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.140 
of the five devices
should the file be sent?

75
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.070 
Or when a website is
opened here on OpenHPI.

76
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.120 
A website clearly describes which
computer or server delivers

77
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.500 
the OpenHPI websites. This is an
identity of the web server of Open

78
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:31.990 
HPI and without a digital identity the object
cannot be distinguished and it's difficult,

79
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.640 
it's impossible to interact
with the different devices.

80
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.860 
The question now is whether we have a
person or whether we have an object,

81
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.500 
it's necessary to prove

82
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.990 
to the service

83
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.220 
who is that digital identity
it has stored in its

84
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.560 
customer database
exactly is owned by me.

85
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.610 
And this process, this proof
that I have a certain digital identity

86
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.910 
is called authentication.

87
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.180 
Authentification is

88
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.550 
a person gives a proof that he or she
owns a certain identity. For example,

89
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.570 
by entering a password,
an email and

90
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.680 
here in our case, the OpenHPI can
recognize you and can assign

91
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:39.620 
all that it knows about
you, all the number of

92
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.310 
homeworks you did, the number of
points you received and others.

93
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.570 
And then we have the authentication.

94
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.740 
Here the online service
checks the evidence,

95
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.790 
it compares
the password

96
00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.440 
which is entered by this owner
of the email address,

97
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.770 
with the password that it stored
in its customer database

98
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.270 
which is connected to the email, and
if both agree then it's considered

99
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:18.460 
positively proved that this
identity belongs to that person.

100
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:26.370 
So anyone who successfully authenticates
can then use the digital identity

101
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.670 
and can work, can
shop, can do

102
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.280 
e-government activities or in
case of OpenHPI, can make

103
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:40.880 
some homework or give some
give some discussion

104
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.030 
or some statements.

105
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.860 
Let's summarize what
we know up to now,

106
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:54.520 
we have discussed that the digital
identity uniquely represents

107
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.990 
a person or an object
in the digital world.

108
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.730 
So the digital identities are
characterized

109
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.180 
by a collection
of attributes.

110
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.280 
A person or an object can
have multiple identities

111
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:17.790 
for different purposes and the
connection between the physical

112
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.970 
identity and
the digital identity

113
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:27.720 
is established by verification,
for example, with

114
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.970 
something the person knows, a
secret pin or TAN or

115
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:41.500 
in a physical way we call it biometric,
with biometric characteristics

116
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.510 
having a certain fingerprint
or iris or face.

117
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.230 
This verification can be done
by proving the ownership of a

118
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.030 
certain object of a credit
card or smartcard.

119
00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:01.270 
So in this way digital identities are
collection of attributes and these are

120
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.960 
the identities we can use the services
in the internet and

121
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.810 
we can move through
the digital world.

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.810 
In our openHPI course "Blockchain:
Revealing the Myth",

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.750 
now we can consider the next
component of the bitcoin system.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.380 
Let's speak about
anonymity and ownership.

4
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.520 
Let's start with considering a
transaction in a standard banking

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.270 
system. In a standard banking system
a transaction is a request

6
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.320 
to move a certain amount of money
from one user's account to another

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.050 
user's account. Here for example Alice
transferred two dollars to Bob.

8
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.340 
This transfer reduces the value in Alice's
account by exactly this two dollar,

9
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.640 
increases the value in Bob's
account by two dollar.

10
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.960 
If Alice's account has
less than two dollars

11
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.710 
the system returns an error
message and no transfer is done.

12
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.660 
In bitcoin system, the transactions
have a different structure.

13
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.980 
A completely different structure
this idea of two having accounts

14
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.760 
is no more true in
the bitcoin system.

15
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.850 
In order to credit a user
with a bitcoin value,

16
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.320 
with a coin cryptographic
methods are used.

17
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.700 
On one side user
accounts are anonymized,

18
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.810 
so it's not the name or
the identity of the user,

19
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.740 
a system works with
addresses of the user.

20
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.370 
And then for the creation of coins
also cryptographic methods are used.

21
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.460 
In both case the methods came from the
field of public key cryptography.

22
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.020 
Here I remind you to consider the
openHPI courses which discuss these

23
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.560 
methods in detail. And also here
as additional material we have

24
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.390 
given compact courses to see what kind of
methods from public key cryptography

25
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.990 
are used here in
the content

26
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.410 
of the bit coin system. The characteristic of
such in public key cryptography is that

27
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.580 
each user has two keys - a
private key and a public key.

28
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.650 
So let's start with considering
what is the transaction

29
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.300 
and what is the
anonymous addresses

30
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.990 
of the users.

31
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.810 
Each user in such a public key system starts
to generate a cryptographic key pair.

32
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.980 
This pair consists
of a private key.

33
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.180 
The private key
is to use

34
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.010 
for signing the
transaction

35
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.140 
and it's this way for
confirmation of the ownership.

36
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.780 
What means a signing of a transaction?
Transaction is encrypted

37
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.570 
with a private key, no one
else has his private key,

38
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.510 
and it can be checked
with the public key

39
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.980 
and the public key is
freely available.

40
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.420 
So if the encrypted transaction can be
decrypted by the corresponding public key,

41
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.300 
then it's proven that this
transaction really comes

42
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.050 
from this person,

43
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.610 
from this owner of says private
key. And then the other is a

44
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.210 
public key, I
already mentioned

45
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.140 
I already mentioned how it
works and this public key

46
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.790 
is used for generating the
addresses of the user.

47
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.050 
Let's have a closer look to this.
First the private key is generated

48
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.920 
and we consider this
as a random number.

49
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.190 
From the private key the
public key is derived

50
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.410 
and then this public
key is hashed.

51
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.140 
So in a way
encrypted that

52
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.740 
you cannot see immediately the
public key but every time one

53
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.520 
has a public key one can check
whether the hash is a real one.

54
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.780 
To this end, the one hundred and
sixty bit alphanumeric value,

55
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.940 
the hash value for example of the
public key has such a structure

56
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.470 
and this structure, this hash of the
public key of an owner of a user

57
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.400 
is called the address and
this is the

58
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.920 
anonymized form of
the name of the owner.

59
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.480 
So when a transaction
is verified by a user,

60
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.240 
the user checks
among others

61
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.580 
among other validity rules
whether the transaction is

62
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.940 
addressed to
this address,

63
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.540 
to this address which
belongs to the

64
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.050 
public key. And the user

65
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.010 
does not need to be identified, and this
is important in such a cash system

66
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.550 
because the user where all the
transaction are public, because

67
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.940 
a single user does not like that all
the other participants know exactly

68
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.880 
what amount he
is owning.

69
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.700 
So hence the user do not need to be identified
since the transactions are not rooted

70
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.370 
to any particular node. It is not
like in an email that there

71
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.630 
is an email address to send exactly
the email to this person. No,

72
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.580 
each transaction is broadcast
to all the participants.

73
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.280 
So it's not
necessary to

74
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.790 
address this transaction
to this one person.

75
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:28.080 
It works well with this way to
anonymise the owner

76
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.650 
of such a transaction and the
away they are delivered

77
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
on a best effort basis and even
if it's not reaching everyone

78
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.570 
with the next from the next user he can get
the information about this transaction

79
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.310 
or with the next block where
the transaction belongs to.

80
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.970 
So the public can see someone is
sending an amount to someone else

81
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.190 
but the public has
no information

82
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.990 
who user is sending
to which other user

83
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.950 
this amount and there is no
information about the user who

84
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.260 
is linked to this
transaction.

85
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.650 
As an additional
firewall,

86
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:25.710 
the users in every time can
generate a new keeper

87
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.150 
could be used for each
transaction to keep

88
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.570 
them from being linked
to a common owner.

89
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.340 
The system works because
the transactions in

90
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.050 
encrypted transactions are
broadcasted to everyone.

91
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:51.420 
So the user can permanently
change his address.

92
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.990 
He can do this by generating
a new key pair and then

93
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.880 
computing the hash
of the private key.

94
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.720 
Let's summarize this idea
how to minimize the user

95
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.840 
in the bitcoin system -

96
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.050 
in order to gradually user with
a bitcoin valet with a coin

97
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.660 
cryptographic
methods are used

98
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.090 
exclusively in the
creation of the coins

99
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.240 
and the anonymization
of user addresses.

100
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.270 
The private key of the

101
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:34.320 
public private key pair of each user
is used for signing transactions.

102
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:41.880 
So the user proves that the transaction
comes from him, that he is the

103
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:47.320 
owner of this transaction that
he has started the transaction

104
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:53.380 
and the public key is used
to generating his address.

105
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.310 
So in this way in
bitcoin system as well

106
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.710 
the ownership the anonymity
and the addressee

107
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.340 
are encrypted, are anonymized,
are non-visible for other

108
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.870 
members of this
blockchain network.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.910 
Hello everyone. Hello to all the
participants. Thank you for joining in today.

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.980 
We welcome everyone to our open
exchange live talk. I think

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.090 
this is now our eighth live talk
already and welcome back also

4
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.570 
to our new sessions
into the new year.

5
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.380 
My name is as always Nils
KÃ¶nig and I'm here today with

6
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.060 
Maximilian and Sophie again from
the clean-IT team at HPI.

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.020 
Today's guest with
us is Mei Lin Fung

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.560 
Mei Lin Fung is chair and
co-founder together with Vint Cerf

9
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.640 
of the People Centered
Internet foundation.

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.010 
In 2017, she presented
the digital economics

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.690 
launch at the World
Economic Forum in Davos.

12
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.190 
Mei Lin is an early pioneer of
Customer Relationship Management

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.730 
and she also served as a socio-technical lead
for the US Federal Health Futures Initiative.

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.940 
She is the IEEE standards
associations chair for the industry

15
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.220 
connections social impact
measurement and she is also on the

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.220 
executive committee for the IEEE's
humanitarian activities committee.

17
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.650 
Mei Lin is born in Singapore but
she lives in the Silicon Valley

18
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.640 
where she has also worked at different
companies such as Oracle and Intel which

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.940 
most of you probably know
from the name. From 2016

20
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.420 
to 2018, she was on the
WES Global Future council

21
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.610 
on digital economy
and society.

22
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.610 
Mei Lin earned her Bachelor of
Science in Maths from the Australian

23
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.630 
National University and also a Master
of Business Administration from the MIT

24
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.310 
where she studied under two future
Nobel economics prize winners.

25
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
Today she will be talking about
the importance of clean-IT energy

26
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.850 
on an international level
and on a global level.

27
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
Please welcome together with me Mei
Lin Fung and I'm very excited for your

28
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.640 
presentation.

29
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.180 
Thank you. Hi everyone. I'm going
to share screen but first let

30
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.370 
me just say how delighted I am to
be part of the clean-IT session

31
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.350 
and to be invited by the
sustainability club of the students

32
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.850 
because I think for students this
is one of the most important topics

33
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.620 
that you can be paying
attention to and

34
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.350 
here's why in the 1960s

35
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.560 
students like yourself and you'll
see an example in the movie

36
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.160 
the graduate we're told,

37
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.210 
THE FUTURE IS
PLASTICS!!!

38
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.560 
Unfortunately, 50 years later we
have a major plastic problems.

39
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.410 
There's a giant pile of plastic
three times the size of France

40
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.150 
in the pacific ocean.

41
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.670 
So we have a better understanding
that things that initially seem

42
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.570 
so promising..
Wow!! Plastics

43
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.470 
can end up with so much harm for
the environment and for humanity

44
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.640 
and for our planet.

45
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.370 
clean-IT is addressing this
problem but it is not going to

46
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
be easy and we
have to concentrate.

47
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.900 
I want you to remember this
picture of the plastics problem.

48
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.750 
We know it can happen we must
make sure that we avoid it.

49
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.840 
So at the G20 Italy,

50
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.360 
the CEO of Hasso Plattner Institute,
Christoph Meinel and myself

51
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.010 
proposed a paper called clean-IT
policies to support sustainable digital

52
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.030 
technologies and it was adopted as one
of the important ones to move forward.

53
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.830 
So this year,

54
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.100 
we have to take action.

55
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.350 
Here, I'm going to go
into the background.

56
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.770 
Digitization ahead of us

57
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
is almost beyond imagination for us
if we think the pacific ocean is vast

58
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.089 
the digital universe
ahead of us is vast.

59
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.970 
So, most of you may be aware that
IPv6. Internet Protocol version four

60
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.620 
was the addresses
for the internet

61
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.240 
and it had to be replaced because
we ran out of space on the internet

62
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.980 
by IPv6 but if you put all
the addresses of IPv4 into

63
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.840 
the size of a beach ball,

64
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.020 
IPv6 is the
volume of our sun.

65
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.840 
So our practices, our intuition
what we think digitization can be

66
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.990 
developed in something the
size of a beach ball cannot

67
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.050 
continue on some kind of linear
trajectory or we use our intuition

68
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.510 
and get to the sun.

69
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.530 
It's even larger than that
because it's likely within your

70
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.110 
lifetimes we will run
out of addresses in IPv6

71
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.710 
and over the
next 20 years.

72
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.840 
The possibility of connecting every
person, every object in the world

73
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:34.300 
is here but can we do it safely? Can
we do it in a way that doesn't promote

74
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.640 
colonization? Digital colonization
that assumptions of how life

75
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.360 
is and what we want in a
digitization would apply to everyone

76
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.700 
in the world no matter where they live
no matter what culture they're from.

77
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.110 
And the answer is No.

78
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.120 
So how do we avoid
the plastics problem?

79
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.960 
How do we take action?

80
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.250 
The paper that we wrote

81
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.290 
starts with this proposition
that sustainability by design

82
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:15.900 
must be the new paradigm in digital engineering,
education, research and application worldwide.

83
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.440 
This picture of the
rise of internet traffic

84
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.100 
is simply one example
that we gave in our paper

85
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:33.610 
of how exponential the
rise of the internet is?

86
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.820 
And as I said people are excited
today about digital, that's

87
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.350 
why many people come to study
at HPI but we can and must make

88
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:51.880 
sure we avoid creating more problems
through poor digitalisation practices

89
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.330 
and the use of energy
is the most prominent.

90
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.930 
Through this paper I've been
invited to participate in the German

91
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.530 
G7 summits for preparation
for the summit in June

92
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.610 
at Schloss Elmau.

93
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.310 
This is our proposition,

94
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.610 
HPI and myself, the
people-centered internet

95
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.540 
that the G7 should regard
the rising energy consumption

96
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.760 
of the global adoption of
digital technologies as a serious

97
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.670 
threat to the world climate.
Therefore monitor the issue, raise

98
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.730 
awareness on the topic. In the
respective states of the G7,

99
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.210 
incentivize research across the states
discover the methods of reducing

100
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.900 
energy consumption and finally, and
most importantly, negotiate standards

101
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:59.440 
which could be the basis for an
internationally agreed on clean-IT label.

102
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.650 
Here at HPI, and
here in Germany,

103
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.330 
we can make the change

104
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.700 
Hasso Plattner Institute is
uniquely positioned for this.

105
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.880 
The German G7
presidency in 2022

106
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.920 
must be remembered as the time
that this change was made.

107
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.420 
Just another example,

108
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.289 
for training an artificial
intelligence model

109
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:38.970 
uses up the equivalent energy of
300 world wide flights between

110
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.780 
San Francisco and New York
city, I'm here in San Francisco

111
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.310 
See, it's the equivalent of the
energy taken in five car life cycles.

112
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.060 
People are not talking about this and
we must raise it to global attention

113
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:00.970 
How can we do this?

114
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:08.110 
Let me share some of the themes
of the G7 German presidency.

115
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.220 
It's a fantastic
theme that we

116
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.670 
can together make progress
to an equitable world

117
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.050 
and the highest priority
for the German presidency

118
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.880 
is to pioneer a
climate neutral economy

119
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.160 
but not in an unjust world. We
must make sure that a climate

120
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.640 
neutral economy is not at the
expense of the poor, the vulnerable

121
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.080 
or those whose voices
right now cannot be heard.

122
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:49.370 
And this is a very good example
of German practicality. We have

123
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:55.170 
to be concrete, this is not about having
lots of time to talk. This is about

124
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.540 
achieving concrete
improvements

125
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.770 
and I believe the Hasso Plattner
Institute is in the point position

126
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.780 
to play a significant role
because digital can assist

127
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.760 
us to get to a climate neutral
economy and a just world

128
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.630 
but it can also hurt.

129
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.570 
The key areas within
the climate neutral

130
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:31.190 
theme is for the G7 to take a pioneering
role in protecting the climate,

131
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.300 
the environment
by five diversity

132
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.190 
so that we accelerate the
global energy transition

133
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:46.440 
to a less carbon generating
energy fossil fuel world.

134
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:52.230 
But to make the transition in a
cooperative and multilateral spirit,

135
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.890 
to form the climate club and
there will be more on this later.

136
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.390 
And to lead by example

137
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.550 
for the German presidency to
lead by example for example to

138
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.700 
put 60 billion euros to
shift to renewable energy,

139
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.780 
with a common denominator
of the 1.5 degree target

140
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.440 
and an overall climate
neutrality goal of 2050

141
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.880 
but Germany to achieve this
by 2045 and each one of you

142
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.840 
need to help us make sure
that we can make this happen.

143
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.210 
These are recommendations
for policy

144
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:48.290 
Professor Christoph Meinel and myself
not only did we raised the problem,

145
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.780 
we made policy recommendations. The
first one of which was sustainability

146
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.970 
by design.

147
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.180 
As the premier school
of design in the world,

148
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:09.270 
the originator of the Global Design
Thinking Alliance in 17 countries

149
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:15.170 
HPI is already working on
this but we have to step up

150
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.980 
and make sure that this goes
into every engineering school.

151
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:31.440 
The other piece, the second is to actually
establish and coordinate incentives for research

152
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.080 
so that we are paying
attention to clean-IT

153
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.110 
Today you can go through an entire
engineering curriculum and not even know

154
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:47.650 
about the energy load of digital
algorithms or the data centres we use.

155
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.390 
We have to change this

156
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:56.190 
The tobacco problem was really
turned around when we taught

157
00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.070 
children about the dangers
of tobacco smoking.

158
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:06.800 
We must start that now in
K3-12 to make sure that digital

159
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:14.420 
is good for humanity and our planet
and doesn't create the plastic problem.

160
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.450 
A third policy proposal
that we are making

161
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.710 
essentially out of
HPI and through the G7

162
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:34.850 
to measure how we use energy but in
particular as we digitized that we prioritized

163
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:41.070 
the procurement, the use of those
digital technologies that use less energy

164
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:49.590 
and so that in particular
SAP, the German tech giant

165
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.860 
actually handles on the majority
of the supply chain data that

166
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.380 
goes through the world. If we are able
to have software procurement guidelines

167
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:08.910 
with clean-IT labels as a piece pipes
could detect what's going through

168
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:14.180 
that is generated by
clean-IT versus not

169
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:21.900 
and could prioritize the clean-IT
software supply chain

170
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.250 
infrastructure and I've already
alluded to the fourth recommendation

171
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.070 
which is to have
a clean-IT label

172
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.830 
We as consumers need to know
are we buying something that is

173
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.020 
making the environment worse or
not? We do that in the food we

174
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:48.110 
eat, the products we use but we do not
have a clean-IT label for software

175
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:55.370 
and software and digitization is now in
every part of our lives and increasing

176
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.710 
so it's best for us to have a
clean-IT label so we can make

177
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.620 
an informed choice
as consumers.

178
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:10.670 
I believe that our
trajectory together from HPI

179
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:17.710 
is to drive sustainability by design through
the Global Design Thinking Alliance which

180
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.120 
has already 17
members around the world.

181
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:28.130 
We start with what we've got the
17 global design thinking schools

182
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.190 
we partner
with GIZ

183
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.550 
initiative on
digital transformation

184
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.870 
centers that's in 16 countries
throughout the world already.

185
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.660 
The aim is to be in 32
countries in two years

186
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:51.700 
and we bring forward these
concepts of clean-IT

187
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.890 
for sustainability
by design.

188
00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:00.850 
The next step on the journey is
to partner with the International

189
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.010 
Technical Associations,
the IEEE,

190
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.850 
the ACM (Association
of Computing Machinery

191
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.830 
and UNESCO created IFIP which
is the International Federation

192
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.410 
of Information
Processing professionals.

193
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.260 
Together these are
almost one million people

194
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:30.670 
technical leaders technical students like
yourselves in a 160 countries.

195
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.570 
We can pioneer the international
standards and certification

196
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.810 
that would be needed to
take clean-IT forward.

197
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.340 
So we're proposing sustainable
engineering certification

198
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.700 
and from this year 2022,

199
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:58.240 
if we, within HPI and for German
students in engineering and young people

200
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:04.339 
and old people and all of us push
for the German G7 presidency

201
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:09.030 
to have the clean-IT label
we can make this happen.

202
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.410 
the IEEE already
is working with

203
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.099 
dean Ulrich Weinberg on the P7000
certification which

204
00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.150 
is about ethical
use of technology.

205
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:29.060 
That is so many ways in which clean-IT
we can talk about the energy efficient way

206
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.280 
but there's the ethical use of
IT that's incredibly important

207
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.630 
and the IEEE P7000
standards address

208
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.610 
begin to address that.

209
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:47.040 
The ACM has the computing and
sustainable societies and they

210
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.150 
are proposing certifications and methods
and finally at the IFIP 60th anniversary,

211
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.060 
they've proposed data science
certification which of course

212
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.150 
we must utilize data more
effectively. We must also make sure

213
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.830 
that the algorithms we use
are not energy intensive.

214
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:18.660 
And finally out of the G7 we
can pioneer climate clubs for all.

215
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:25.260 
This picture of the world actually
shows the heating up of the world

216
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.860 
and there's a larger version
of it in the next slide.

217
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.080 
What is the temperature
anomaly in 2021?

218
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.030 
I, sorry! I didn't know
it was going to move!

219
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.100 
We can have communities of
practice for the climate club and

220
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.240 
these could be
hosted on openHPI.

221
00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:57.810 
We can take the wonderful
example that the WHO COVID

222
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.590 
community of practice on HPI
went from 40 thousand people

223
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:09.090 
to seven million people and in a
matter of months in 2020.

224
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:15.220 
We can host these climate club
communities of practice. The

225
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:20.510 
communities of practice can be
about different topics and people

226
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.560 
around the world can share their
ideas and what they're doing.

227
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:31.080 
For this we need moderators,
facilitators who can be trained

228
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:38.990 
at HPI and the Global Design Thinking Alliance
to have effective communities of practice.

229
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:45.300 
These communities of practice can
use the iterative design thinking

230
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:51.110 
improvement cycles; I call
it from my federal health

231
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:59.310 
days - PLAN DO STUDY ACT
and in it we organized

232
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:07.020 
eight thousand locations to go in six
month cycles with a rhythm and a beat

233
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.500 
to all work together. Start at
the beginning of the six months

234
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.330 
everybody would report
on what happened with the

235
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:20.320 
parallel testing and hypothesis.
The previous six months,

236
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:26.040 
out of say 100 experiments still
might have extraordinary breakthroughs.

237
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.060 
Well now that the next 100
experiments can

238
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.990 
include the learnings from those
breakthroughs so that in the next six months

239
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.010 
more people can have
more breakthroughs.

240
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:45.630 
These iterative cycles constantly
going on over time are in

241
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.150 
fact the basis of the technology
improvement that we have today.

242
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:56.470 
We now need to take it socio-technically
into the every day lives of people.

243
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:04.760 
So, I will stop here. This is currently
our submission for the G7.

244
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.920 
We will be going through the
process over the next few months

245
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:15.460 
to get it adopted and with
that I want to close and

246
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.870 
leave it open
to questions.

247
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.870 
Wow! Thank you. Thank you very
much for your presentation Mei Lin

248
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.260 
and we will now go over to the
Q and A session, and so everyone

249
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.360 
who has some questions can
either raise their hand and so we

250
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.330 
can pick you up and then you
can ask a question or just type

251
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.070 
in the chat and yeah,
thank you very much, and

252
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:43.380 
while everyone might be still
thinking I have one first question

253
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.410 
a little open question so,
what would you say what is the

254
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.650 
current state of clean-IT
and sustainable digitization

255
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:54.310 
on the international level so
are there many other initiatives

256
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.890 
like the clean-IT initiative
or many other organizations

257
00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.980 
which focus on the same topic or do you
have the feeling that you are really

258
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.070 
the first one together with
Prof Meinel who proposed such

259
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.080 
an initiative and
such a topic?

260
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.730 
I must give all credit to
Prof Meinel in proposing the

261
00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:18.070 
topic. He spoke about it at the 2020
Davos World Economic Forum.

262
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:29.870 
The issue of ICT sustainability is
broadly recognised around the world. The

263
00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:35.450 
different communities I mentioned
the IEEE, the ACM, IFIP

264
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.230 
are all working on it

265
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.080 
but this one, the clean-IT
energy efficiency

266
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.020 
has not been taken up anywhere
else that I'm aware of,

267
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.360 
which is why it's so
important for us to do this.

268
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.260 
I want to refer
in the chat to

269
00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:01.090 
the thing about nobody
cares about clean-IT

270
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.580 
intentions or
clean-IT label.

271
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.700 
Nobody cares until there is
requirements for compliance.

272
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:19.630 
So, if for example, all government service
procurement that means anything that

273
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.900 
the German Ministry of Health or
the Singapore Ministry of Health

274
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.660 
or the Ministry of
Transportation in Zimbabwe or the

275
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:35.980 
Ministry of ICT in Colombia, if
they require that every piece

276
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:41.550 
of software and hardware they
buy have the clean-IT label,

277
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:49.590 
that translates good intentions
into real action which is why

278
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:56.260 
the importance of a groundswell of
support in Germany for the German G7

279
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:02.810 
presidency to drive for a clean-IT
label is so critical today.

280
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.120 
I think the
respondent was so

281
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.390 
the person also said that
the problem with certification

282
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.030 
processes is that they are very
slow often and you could

283
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.070 
with defining taxes you might have
faster results and faster measurements.

284
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:26.330 
I think you need to use every
instrument. There is no point

285
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.160 
for us to compare, "oh! is this
better that?", we want it all

286
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:37.210 
and the only way we can have it all
is for this to be a mass movement.

287
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.710 
We should get the tax specialists
to work on the tax side but

288
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:46.920 
here I am at HPI talking to the premier
digital engineering school in Europe.

289
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.640 
So, I say to you this is
what you need to get behind.

290
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.500 
So yeah you already spoke
about certifications

291
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.710 
and labels quite a lot and another
problem with these certificates and labels is

292
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.570 
that they often can be used to
just greenwash products when

293
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:10.010 
they're not really controlled
thoroughly and

294
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.820 
so how what do you think how
should we bypass that code or

295
00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.230 
how do we tackle that
problem with greenwashing and

296
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.050 
in-transparent standards?

297
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.860 
Let me give you my theory about
how greenwashing happens. Greenwashing

298
00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.100 
happens because the
engineers are not involved

299
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.870 
and so the engineers let

300
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.050 
people in companies who want to
greenwash that companies make

301
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:38.130 
claims that are
completely unprovable.

302
00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.880 
So if you let people get away
with claims that are not provable

303
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.790 
I have to say
shame on us.

304
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.830 
When we see greenwashing, we should
be saying, "Ok! what's happening?

305
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.870 
How are you making that claim? What is
your algorithm? What is your data source?

306
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:04.750 
How are you taking the original data
and translating it to some kind of

307
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.510 
greenwashing outcome?"

308
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.770 
Let's check it. Let's do compliance.
There's no need

309
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:15.930 
to wait for a government body
to check on something if you

310
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.460 
live in a village and dirty
water is flowing in are you going

311
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.590 
to sit there and say, "Oh! I hope
the government will do something"

312
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.160 
No! because your feet are in dirt
because you cannot have clean water.

313
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:35.850 
We have to act, we can't, I know
longer I'm pulling away the

314
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:42.010 
veil for each of you. Don't stand
behind, "Oh! it's the government's fault!"

315
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.270 
"Oh! it's the professors' fault!"
"Oh! it's the bureaucrats' fault!"

316
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.810 
It is your fault for allowing
this sturdy order to continue

317
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.950 
for people to
make claims that

318
00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:02.240 
are not true. Engineers know how
to investigate. Let's investigate.

319
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:08.380 
I think, so, transparency and
and checking things yourself is

320
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.890 
only possible if you have access
to maybe the code of programs or

321
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.480 
all that stuff. So you would
also advocate probably for

322
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.170 
more open-source programs
and more open-source

323
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.050 
platforms, probably?
Yes, I do.

324
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:31.220 
Open-source is the only
way for us to truly validate software.

325
00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:37.930 
So I have a concept which is
that clean-IT isn't a ON and OFF

326
00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:45.010 
that this different levels of maturity
of clean-IT labels. So, the top

327
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.260 
one would be where the

328
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.780 
IT is open-source where you
are able to check the code and

329
00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.140 
you can look at it.

330
00:27:55.810 --> 00:28:01.410 
A less mature version of clean-IT
say that might be number

331
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:05.450 
one, right? Open-source. It's
checkable. If there's any problem

332
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.140 
with it, we can look at it.
Say, number two might be

333
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:15.180 
if this code can be
scrutinized by an authorized body?

334
00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:21.850 
I believe that engineering schools
should get or become authorized bodies

335
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.460 
so that they're able to
check the code and the

336
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:31.130 
device technologies
for things that are being used

337
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:36.710 
in their community. So I am a
proponent of something that I call

338
00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:42.640 
"Community Living Learning Labs" that
have formed around all universities,

339
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:49.680 
all science centers, all museums
of science and technology, and

340
00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.650 
in there, in those Community
Living Learning Labs,

341
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.660 
we have the right to scrutinize
the technologies that are being

342
00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.860 
used in our community and
we have the right to say

343
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.150 
"You know, this
doesn't pass our

344
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:11.510 
test of what is good for our
children, for our older people, so

345
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:16.900 
we need to work out a way in
which everybody can participate".

346
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.960 
And so the idea of the
climate clubs should be

347
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.780 
"Join the climate club!" Do something
everyone can do something.

348
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.150 
I'm going to talk longer
here because I think

349
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.020 
I am personally able to
see how this can happen

350
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:43.110 
I'm from Singapore. In Singapore, in 1965
when Singapore became independent,

351
00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:48.300 
we had the income
per capita GDP of

352
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:55.060 
sub-Saharan Africa, less than 500
US dollars per capita

353
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.490 
in 1965.

354
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.070 
Today the per capita GDP in
Singapore is 20% higher

355
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.470 
than the United States.

356
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.630 
We did not do this by waiting for
the government to do something.

357
00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.510 
We just decided we wanted to
survive. So when the world banking

358
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.410 
kept coming among
multinational corporations

359
00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:23.420 
they said, "what can you do to help
us learn the skills that we need?"

360
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:29.970 
So, for example, money was offered
to build housing. Singapore said,

361
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.600 
"we don't want you to come in,
build a housing, and go away, and

362
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.510 
then we're in debt.

363
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:42.300 
Give us the master engineering
plan and we will break it up

364
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:48.760 
into different pieces that our small
businesses can participate in building.

365
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.590 
Those small businesses in Singapore
that started 50-55 years ago,

366
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.840 
they are now the world-class
engineering companies of the world.

367
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:03.490 
So this is the kind of
attitude that we need to have

368
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.520 
we are not
passive victims.

369
00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:14.030 
Like Singapore, people just
decided we're going to survive

370
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:18.440 
and if to survive we have
to take charge of our future.

371
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.090 
And so maybe as a quick follow
up question so you also said that

372
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.730 
open-source and more open-source platforms
might be very useful or even crucial

373
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.520 
for this to be effective
and so what do you

374
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.240 
think how we can incentivize
big companies or big firms that

375
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.280 
are already out there to maybe
share the code as well? So I

376
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.370 
think that many new
companies or startups

377
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:49.720 
start to more and more
keep their code open and

378
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.370 
for everyone to look at it but
most old companies that have

379
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.470 
already been there for quite a
long time wouldn't do that from

380
00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.160 
now to the next
moment because

381
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.390 
it doesn't offer them any benefits
probably and they fear that they might

382
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.450 
lose some information or something
like that. And what do you

383
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:12.880 
think how we could, how they could be
incentivised to share their code

384
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:18.640 
more openly? I believe
that it should be required

385
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.300 
within a controlled
laboratory. Meaning that

386
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.160 
I have the vision of eventually
Community Living Learning Labs.

387
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.910 
Hey! but we
can start with

388
00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:37.620 
a place where code must be submitted.
Now let me take the example

389
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.890 
of the Boeing Max 737 disaster.

390
00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.190 
There were two
plane crashes that

391
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.810 
in Indonesia and Ethiopia where 346

392
00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.340 
people lost their lives.

393
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.300 
Underlying this
was software.

394
00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.790 
The MCAS software pulled
the nose of the plane down.

395
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:07.350 
The code in fact was
scrutinised by the

396
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:12.230 
FAA.

397
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.230 
However, when they
approved it to go forward

398
00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:21.570 
they scrutinized an
approved version C

399
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.620 
but the actual
rollout was version E

400
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.070 
which had the
fatal difference.

401
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:36.750 
We do not, within our own compliance
requirements today, certainly

402
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:43.200 
in the US but I am sure every country
has problems. We do not have

403
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:50.550 
a good approach to certifying software.
We need more people involved with this.

404
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.200 
Three people in the FAA cannot
certify the software that's

405
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.280 
going to use be used that
has hundreds of millions

406
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.060 
of people's lives at stake. We are
not approaching this appropriately.

407
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.679 
It's not a blame thing, suffer
has just come up very quickly

408
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:12.330 
but we have to start to put in
the guardrails that are needed

409
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:17.580 
to protect our people and I
believe that the best way is

410
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:24.659 
in fact open-source compliance that we
allow for the certification, for example,

411
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:29.300 
of young engineers to participate
in Community Living Learning

412
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.290 
Labs to have access
to the source code

413
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:39.949 
by permission and by certification. It's an
engineering certification, a professional

414
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.730 
engineering certification that
would allow you access and you're

415
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:48.010 
not supposed to go out and invent a new
company or share with all your friends

416
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.630 
because if you did then you'd
lose your professional engineering

417
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:57.030 
certification. So there are
ways to address this at a human

418
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.530 
technical solutions
and not enough.

419
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:07.550 
Our social institutions are what have
made humanity able to have civilization.

420
00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:12.760 
Let's apply a social
savvy to this big problem

421
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.390 
which is existential.

422
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.310 
I think there's
also been a

423
00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.140 
question in the chat
that so you said that

424
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.640 
putting up metrics to really
certify software isn't that easy and so

425
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.670 
someone also asked, "do we
really know already

426
00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.010 
how good (product) looks like or what good
software actually means when

427
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.130 
it comes to energy
consumption or other factors?"

428
00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.110 
So how far are we with
it? We are far away. So

429
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:48.220 
I answer questions on Quora
and there was a Quora question

430
00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:52.080 
that said, "what do you know in your industry
that the general public doesn't know?"

431
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.660 
And I said how
buggy software is.

432
00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.700 
Absolutely doctor Jens!

433
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:05.190 
Things are terrible in terms of the
software that is currently being

434
00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:10.890 
rolled out because we have no
guardrails, we have no scrutiny,

435
00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.010 
insufficient scrutiny
where we do have scrutiny,

436
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:19.950 
and sometimes the scrutiny
is on the wrong things. So,

437
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:26.040 
there's a whole new wave of
digitization. We have not caught

438
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.650 
up with it, with our
social institutions.

439
00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:34.660 
We need to and with the G7
and Germany's presidency with

440
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:41.380 
HPI in the road and respect that HPI
is held by the German presidency,

441
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:47.710 
the students and community out
around HPI can move forward

442
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.580 
with vigour on the clean-IT.
It's just a start

443
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:57.190 
with a journey of a thousand
miles begins with a single step.

444
00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.530 
I'm not saying it's going to
solve the problem, I'm saying if

445
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:07.400 
we don't take the step we are
not going to have humanity.

446
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.950 
So I think they already refer to
something that Jens said in the chat.

447
00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:22.230 
So another question is which also comes
back to our what we've discussed about just

448
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.420 
and what do you propose in order
to stimulate the free enterprise

449
00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.710 
in Europe and also in Germany
or maybe just in general which

450
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:33.070 
role should the state have? So
you already said that maybe it's

451
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:38.100 
good if companies are obliged
to open-source their code or

452
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:44.390 
what do you think how many
or how far should we have laws that

453
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.880 
make it or that force
companies to do something like that?

454
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.200 
I am not into

455
00:37:54.790 --> 00:38:00.460 
let's make a future by regulation.
I really think that

456
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.180 
regulation is done by a few people.
How can a few people understand

457
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.870 
what's needed
by everyone?

458
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:16.120 
So, a combination of people looking for
the dangers with free enterprise

459
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.150 
and a market economy
is the right way to go.

460
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.770 
How this can be achieved?

461
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:31.560 
Digital finance. So today digital
footprints actually allow us to

462
00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.980 
monitor a lot of things and
certainly in Europe this is not

463
00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:42.800 
done much because of GDPR
and privacy issues.

464
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:51.510 
Once said, in the United States, the US
constitution is not a mutual suicide pact

465
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:58.240 
that means we won't follow the constitution
to all go off over a cliff together.

466
00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.140 
GDPR is not a
mutual suicide pact.

467
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:07.850 
There are reasons for data to be
shared, for example, to do health

468
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:13.320 
research, to know about cancer,
you have to share data. I propose

469
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.450 
that we have digital utilities
which are well managed for

470
00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:23.680 
the data to be used for science
but also for digital footprints

471
00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.260 
for SME financing.
SMEs being

472
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.530 
Small Medium Enterprises.

473
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.670 
Within Amazon today,

474
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:41.110 
they make 70 to 80 thousand
parallel experiments every day.

475
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.480 
They do this by tracking digital
footprints and analyzing mostly

476
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.890 
is just simple A/B testing, which
works and which doesn't throw

477
00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.360 
away the one doesn't work, keep
going on the one that works.

478
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.770 
We should be doing this with the digital
financing of research and companies.

479
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.140 
Small Medium Enterprises. We
should be financing the things

480
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:07.230 
that are making progress and
closing down the faucets of finance

481
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.540 
for the ones that are
not making progress.

482
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:16.210 
And by having this kind of ability
to look at digital footprints,

483
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.990 
we can encourage the ones that
are more clean-IT moving up

484
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:24.100 
the maturity ladder
for clean-IT and

485
00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.320 
discourage the
ones who are not.

486
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:32.740 
So we could actually make access
to financing easier for those

487
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:38.010 
who are willing to keep the
code either open-source or

488
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.480 
available for open-source
scrutiny for clean-IT.

489
00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:47.940 
Thanks a lot! I also want to
mention at this point and

490
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.930 
we've talked a lot about
certification and metrics for sustainable

491
00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:55.730 
software and good software and
we've actually talked about

492
00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:00.230 
this very topic a few months ago last
year with Jens KrÃ¼ger from the

493
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.250 
German eco institute and he
developed the Blue Angel for software.

494
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:07.960 
So the Blue Angel is a very
famous German sigil which is used

495
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.670 
on a lot of products and he
explained a lot about how they

496
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:15.060 
started just by measuring some
data on programs and then they

497
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:19.550 
try to develop some metrics on
that and to define what

498
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.150 
what criteria software
has to meet in order to be certified

499
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.320 
as a good software and sustainable
software. And I think, yeah,

500
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.050 
everyone who's interested in that
might want to hear that talk again.

501
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:35.990 
And so I think the
questions have come to an end at

502
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:39.190 
this point and of course if
you have another question that

503
00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.620 
you want to ask at the
end, please don't hesitate.

504
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.450 
I also have one quick
little question for the end.

505
00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.310 
What responses did you get since
you started this? So the clean-IT

506
00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.780 
initiative was started around
a year ago by Prof Meinel

507
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.840 
and did you get any responses or
did you see any progress already

508
00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:04.160 
maybe since you submitted that
paper for the G7? Yes, so the

509
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:09.650 
take up by the IEEE which
is the largest technical

510
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.700 
organization in the world for
electricity and electronics so

511
00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:18.350 
it's right at the heart
of the clean-IT question.

512
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:24.870 
They are setting up, they have
a sustainable ICT group and

513
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:28.250 
then I have been asked to chair
the technical committee for

514
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.850 
the SSIT, the Society on
Social Implications of Technology.

515
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:36.560 
Society for IEEE, so,

516
00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.210 
I would put that down to, I would
not have been asked to chair

517
00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:46.080 
if I had not done this and so the
clean-IT paper. The second thing is

518
00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:52.470 
IFIP, the International Federation of
Information Processing, they are now

519
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:58.700 
beginning to collaborate with us on
how their data science certification

520
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:05.290 
can also incorporate the in
discussion the clean-IT label.

521
00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.780 
And we would like to

522
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:14.300 
also spread the data science
certification because so much

523
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.530 
of the statistics is
actually used to derive

524
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.680 
products in new devices.

525
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.240 
There are problems with how statistics
is being used and applied as

526
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.430 
there's a lot of

527
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:34.140 
time bombs in the algorithms
that are currently being used.

528
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:39.260 
Statisticians know this but very few
people are listening to statisticians

529
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:44.920 
so we have to keep the engineers
data science certified as well.

530
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.880 
Okay, thank you. So I see one
more last question that was just

531
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.680 
put in the chat and
Mathias asked, "so what would

532
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.890 
be an appropriate
approach to enable and stimulate

533
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:02.810 
a decision making that is more
based on natural law?" So I mean

534
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.290 
physics and everything we do
with computer science in the end

535
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:10.970 
follows or has to follow physical
laws and the law of electricity

536
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.810 
and everything that comes with
it and so I think his question

537
00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:18.160 
aims at how we can make
decisions in the future

538
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:21.100 
more based on these laws that
take these physical laws that

539
00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.770 
we can't really change
more into account.

540
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:29.370 
I thank you so much Philip,
this is really important.

541
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.220 
The way we educate
is not working.

542
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.060 
Children learn by doing.

543
00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:49.270 
Physical laws all around us, why
aren't we taking the opportunity

544
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.920 
to use physical laws to help
children learn about them?

545
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.950 
What happens in science centers
we can learn by doing?

546
00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:06.020 
What happens in the design
thinking where you try and you see

547
00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.870 
does it work or not? This is
normally how humans learn.

548
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:16.750 
Digital technology can allow us
to go back to the future

549
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:21.710 
how normal people used to learn
as they would watch their parents,

550
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.620 
they would watch other people,
they would see what happens, that's

551
00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:28.030 
why I'm a proponent of
Community Living Learning Labs.

552
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.560 
Our whole communities should
be learning opportunities.

553
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.590 
Half Moon Bay in California
which is about 20 miles from

554
00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.370 
me, 20 kilometers from me,

555
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:44.590 
created an approach to education
that meant that the entire town

556
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:53.610 
was the school. Every signboard,
every light pole, here's

557
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.230 
what we/you
can learn here,

558
00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:00.690 
so I think that transforming
education into something that

559
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:07.860 
is far more natural will allow for
the acquisition of this understanding.

560
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:10.510 
I will say in Singapore,

561
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:16.330 
95% of school
children learn calculus.

562
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.160 
I learnt calculus when
I was fourteen years old.

563
00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:27.490 
This innumerate
society can do more,

564
00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:34.570 
that's just a fact but if we
don't have mathematics taught

565
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:39.750 
in a natural and intuitive
way and we turn people off,

566
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:46.160 
the use of numbers, we are really
cutting them off from having

567
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:52.210 
an income in the future because as the
world gets more digital numeracy is

568
00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.270 
is the ABC
of the future.

569
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.750 
Yeah, thank you
very much. So

570
00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.790 
for the for the answer I hope
this answered the question

571
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.870 
and sufficiently. I see a few more
comments in the chat, so maybe

572
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:14.280 
we can just quickly go over
them if that's fine for you?

573
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.500 
If you want to. Sure! So,
Philip also said that

574
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:21.390 
he said that he understands from the
presentation that the mission

575
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:24.810 
will be to raise political
commitment to tackle the issue of

576
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.900 
rising energy demand
for IT applications.

577
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.760 
However, he thinks that it's
also important to start doing

578
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.110 
things right now and so he proposes,
for example, that he starts to

579
00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:40.590 
move all his web services
and websites to energy,

580
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.970 
more sustainable data centers
and so and he asks, "don't you

581
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.820 
see this also as a vital
move to do things like this right now?"

582
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.920 
Yes, yes!

583
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.610 
Remember, I talked about

584
00:47:56.330 --> 00:48:00.670 
amazon having 70 to 80
thousand experiments in parallel?

585
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:07.350 
We should do that there's no
great leader, just each of you

586
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:12.150 
is a leader. Go do that! What I am
saying is that Hasso Plattner Institute,

587
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:18.690 
the openHPI platform can be a place
where you can see what everybody is doing.

588
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:23.160 
So that you can be encouraged
where you can gather in communities

589
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:28.320 
of practice to say, "Oh! I got my
town to do this. Here's how I did it"

590
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:34.650 
Yeah, I would agree with
you and I think that's what

591
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:39.890 
you really tried to focus on today, so we
don't have to just wait for politicians

592
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.490 
or policy makers to do any
moves. I think you really try to

593
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.270 
urge everyone here to look
in your own surroundings and

594
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.360 
look what you can do yourself
and so I think what Philip said

595
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.680 
in the chat is a very great
example. Just start moving things

596
00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.580 
to more renewable data centers and
and start trying things yourself and

597
00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.470 
then more important maybe even
share your experience. I think so

598
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:04.270 
that's what we're trying to do with
the initiative at the openHPI

599
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.880 
clean-IT forum that we're
really really trying to

600
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.850 
highlight sustainable digitization
ideas and share them with everyone so

601
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.950 
many people can
try to apply them.

602
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.450 
Yeah, I think with that being
said, thank you very much for your

603
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.190 
presentation and also for all
these answers, very kind answers and

604
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:24.520 
for all the
questions as well.

605
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:28.470 
Thank you very much, I will just
quickly share my screen again

606
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:31.100 
for the end, so, as always

607
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:35.510 
we will have another talk in
four weeks again and so we've

608
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.540 
started making up the schedule
for the next year and I am very

609
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.030 
pleased to announce that we have
a very very interesting talks

610
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:45.650 
this year and the next one
will be at the 28th

611
00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:50.790 
of February and again at 16o'clock
CET and this time

612
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.290 
Benno Schmidt will be with us
and he will be talking about

613
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.010 
Sustainable Software
Design Patterns and

614
00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:00.520 
I will be, I am very excited for
that already and I also want

615
00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.000 
to quickly mention again that
we will have the clean-IT

616
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.920 
community conference here at the
end of March, I hope very much

617
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.650 
that we can hold this conference
in person and also one or

618
00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:13.180 
two weeks before that
we will host a hackathon

619
00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:16.730 
where people can try to
implement more sustainable

620
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:21.240 
algorithms, for example, and test
their skills on different challenges

621
00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:25.830 
and also by the day that the
community conference takes place

622
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:30.680 
we also want to start with the new
course on the openHPI platform

623
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:34.360 
which you can already see
in the channel view and

624
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.020 
yeah we would love
every one of you to see,

625
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:40.460 
to join in this course
and take part.

626
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:45.820 
And yeah as always to the end,
you can reach us via

627
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:49.160 
clean-IT(at)hpi.de and
if you haven't already,

628
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:53.070 
please do sign up for the clean-IT
forum for any further information

629
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:54.280 
and announcements.

630
00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:58.630 
And so with that being said, thank
you very much everyone again

631
00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.960 
and I hope we will see you
again in around four weeks.

632
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:05.270 
Good bye and have
a good afternoon.

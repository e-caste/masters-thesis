00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.810 
Welcome to the second video
regarding Intercultural

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.430 
competence for virtual teams. In
this video i will talk about

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.910 
a team work faces, success factors
in intercultural teams, empathy

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.010 
being open, being ethno-relativismtic
and principles and

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.920 
maxims. Intercultural
virtual teams or groups

6
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.590 
of people who work together
and use communication,

7
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.310 
means especially if
there are distributed

8
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.890 
and the team members work
together on a common goal to

9
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.170 
achieve a reasonable output.
Working together means

10
00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:01.770 
that communication is involved and
the match off the communication

11
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.240 
in nonverbal
communication

12
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.440 
with verbal communication
is very important.

13
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.710 
However in intercultural teams
and virtual teams especially

14
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.150 
in virtual teams you do not have
much nonverbal communication

15
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.150 
if you use communication
technologies.

16
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.490 
So you have to take this
into account and remember

17
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.920 
that you have just the
verbal and your voice tone

18
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.190 
to communicate and to express the
content of your communication.

19
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.090 
This is also the channel for
challenges in intercultural virtual

20
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
teams, mostly because of language.
Because virtual teams are

21
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.720 
geographically dispersed and the
members are from different

22
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.030 
countries and cultures, several
challenges arise from this

23
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.810 
constellation and
situation. First of all

24
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.450 
there could be personal
conflicts and from

25
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.740 
a restricted communication there
can be misunderstandings

26
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.360 
and it could come to a lack of
trust which is very important

27
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.800 
to avoid in teams.

28
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.570 
The Effects that the goal setting
could be wrong and goals could be

29
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.200 
understood differently in
the team within the team

30
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.410 
and therefore that team
efficiency and team

31
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.620 
effectiveness could
be diminished

32
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.180 
The cause for this is the
cultural differences,

33
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.960 
mostly in such teams. According
to Hall: Culture is a silent

34
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.970 
language and also Tenzer investigated
that for virtual teams

35
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.180 
language is the most important
aspect that has to be considered

36
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.750 
and improved in order to have
successful virtual teamwork.

37
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.690 
Most important examples
for language-based

38
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.730 
challenges are that
you have the same

39
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.410 
communication language
in the team

40
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.520 
you cannot simply

41
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.960 
determine, that english because
it is a global language

42
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.160 
is a team language. It depends rather on
the members and on the constellation

43
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.090 
of the members
in the team

44
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.570 
concerning the
cultural background.

45
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.390 
The language-based
challenges are especially

46
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.540 
important for people who
are working with words,

47
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:28.970 
like hr, marketing or sales teams.
This is also a in line with

48
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.680 
holes findings according to low
and high context communication

49
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.920 
patterns as presented
in the last video.

50
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.940 
The successful factors in intercultural
teams with the same goals

51
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.100 
und understanding the same
goals, to trust the team

52
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.340 
and to have coordinated
working methods and the same

53
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.910 
communicating
occasions.

54
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.640 
The faces in virtual teams
are known from Tuckman

55
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.960 
and especially four
intercultural virtual teams

56
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.770 
some aspects have
to focused on

57
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
for example to have
a kick off meeting

58
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.020 
in the forming face in
order to integrate all

59
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.090 
people and to arrange their
own positions in the

60
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.330 
virtual team. The second phase
in the storming phase it's

61
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.820 
very important to agree
and different conflicts

62
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.510 
and different conflict
cultures, in order

63
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.940 
to generate a group contract
in the norming phase

64
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.890 
to determine who is working
with whom and how.

65
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.440 
In the performing phase
it's important to

66
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.680 
conduct milestone meetings in order
to revise the group contract

67
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.920 
and adapt it to the team
situation. And finally

68
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.900 
the adjourning phase is to save
the knowledge experienced in

69
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.420 
the virtual teams and especially
in the intercultural virtual

70
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.770 
teams regarding the intercultural
communication and

71
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.670 
teamwork in order to have lessons
learned and findings for

72
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.040 
next and future projects. Normally
the first three faces or

73
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.660 
face to face in order
to be successful in

74
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.840 
closing and finishing these
phases and to avoid for example

75
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.800 
a lack due to nonverbal
communication.

76
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.510 
Overall it is very
important to be

77
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.130 
open and relativistic. This means
to welcome others and be warm

78
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.610 
and be warm hearted.

79
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.530 
You should be empathic and it is
important to optimize communication

80
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.830 
as the basis of successful
teamwork. You can use for example

81
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.630 
the principle of charity
by listening to others

82
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.670 
and give by to the
explanation of others

83
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.820 
in order to understand.

84
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.510 
The principle of humanity
is also very important,

85
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.960 
as you have to interpret
a speaker in the

86
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.260 
way you understand
the others.

87
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.440 
And you can put yourself into
the position of the other

88
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.460 
You can also use rice
maxims, to be clear,

89
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.380 
and just to say what
is actually the case

90
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.060 
regarding the quantity or to say
the truth regarding the maxim

91
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:18.240 
of quality and also to say the
relevant things in a very brief

92
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:24.140 
and concise way. If you need more details
on this aspects i have mentioned,

93
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.840 
please refer to
the references

94
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.640 
on this list.

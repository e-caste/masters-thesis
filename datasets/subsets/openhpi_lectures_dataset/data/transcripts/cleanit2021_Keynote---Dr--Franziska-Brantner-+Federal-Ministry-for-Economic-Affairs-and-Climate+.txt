1
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:16.390 
thank you very much, Dr Meinel and always nice that you are still described as young with, so already over midlife.

2
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.379 
so, but it is

3
00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:29.309 
quite wonderful I always say, my mother at over 70, still looks like 50, I say when I see her genes

4
00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:30.519 
everything is okay.

5
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:38.030 
No, I'm very happy to be here today and also in live, as you said very much, that we're not just

6
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.130 
digitally meet, but again in persona, and of course these are crazy, bad times right now and they

7
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.789 
are all getting this debate about how we're now managing to save energy and that it's going to take a national effort to do that.

8
00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
and that's why it's good that we're also talking here about how the digitization sector can make its contribution.

9
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.250 
to ensuring that we consume less.

10
00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:13.950 
I am grateful, by the way, for all, including companies of Germany, who are now behaving very consistently with regard to Russia

11
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.209 
I know it's painful sometimes, too, but I'm still really thankful for it because it's part of a common

12
00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:31.530 
effort, even if we all had imagined and wished differently. With

13
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.260 
the forewords, I would also like to start with a figure, Mr. Meinel you have already said the CO2 emissions, which to me to reduce

14
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.890 
the number is 324. 324

15
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.349 
Megatons of CO2 we need to reduce in relation to 2019.

16
00:01:51.939 --> 00:02:00.569 
Is simply the task we have and in recent years saved an average of 15 megatons per year. That is

17
00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:09.750 
in the next eight years it has to be 40 megatons per year, again to make it clear what the magnitude of the

18
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.139 
task that we have in front of us

19
00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.129 
and a key to achieve

20
00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:24.069 
of this goal can be digital technologies and there is the study of Bitkom, which also gave a figure

21
00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.150 
namely 151 megatons of CO2 that could be saved by accelerated digitalization.

22
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.150 
That would be great, of course, if we could achieve that much via these technologies.

23
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.439 
The area that are strongest it of course in industry, mobility, energy, building that is in theory also

24
00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:52.659 
all not new, which means that we then also really have a lot of potential to exploit, and that's why we also set in the

25
00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:59.449 
Ministry is now really just rebuilding the toolbox of incentives, funding, regulatory instruments in order to really

26
00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.349 
to exploit the potential that digitization offers for climate protection.

27
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.759 
But and Dr. Meinel,

28
00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:17.139 
You said it, of course, there are the rebound effects, there is a great risk that we may end up with efficiencies in facility

29
00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.650 
but use even more energy in the other and therefore the technologies need to be more energy efficient

30
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.050 
more efficient.

31
00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:32.319 
And that is, I think a must today is no longer a question of if, but only how.

32
00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.840 
and there must be no question mark

33
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.330 
behind it. You said earlier, what is the criterion?

34
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:46.919 
That has to be added as a criterion, in any consideration, and I would like to give three examples that we just got from our

35
00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:55.120 
House are also advancing. One is that, the first one is the data center example you gave.

36
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.949 
It's actually a no-brainer, but are we still not far enough along.

37
00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:08.069 
We agreed in the coalition agreement that we really want to reduce energy consumption here as well.

38
00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.550 
And it's not just about replacing one energy with another.

39
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.650 
So that's really important.

40
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.230 
Of course, we always have the challenge to say, it has to be green energy then, But that's enough even with the

41
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.279 
Data centers is not.

42
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:29.129 
We need less energy consumption because if we extrapolate it from what we're currently seeing, what we're consuming

43
00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:37.050 
then that goes from currently 15 terawatt hours up to 23 terrawatt hours by 2030.

44
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.819 
We can't really afford that,

45
00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.829 
that's why it's going to be in energy efficiency law

46
00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:45.060 
be passed this year.

47
00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.850 
You probably picked up on that.

48
00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:51.949 
That's part of this, now, immediate action Easter-summer package.

49
00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:59.779 
Those are in departmental coordination right now, and there's part of that is an energy efficiency registry to make comparability

50
00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:06.579 
of electricity consumption and efficiency levels, and the data centers are going to be in that registry in the process of

51
00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:06.949 
be.

52
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.889 
That means we're really creating comparability with respect to the energy efficiencies in the different data centers

53
00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.850 
Not just whether they're getting green power, but how efficient they are.

54
00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:23.050 
And then, of course, there's what you said about what can be done with waste heat recovery.

55
00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:30.410 
That's still on-top, but really just the efficiency of the processes themselves and we're hoping that that will also allow us to

56
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.290 
competition again, that in the end it's all about that:

57
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.949 
Who has the most efficient data center?

58
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.379 
And looking at the use of waste heat, because they mentioned that earlier.

59
00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:50.029 
Doctor Meinel, there are also again explicit legislative plans for that so that the use there is easier.

60
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:58.970 
I can't give away any details yet, it hasn't been completely coordinated yet, but something is coming and I believe it.

61
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.750 
is also right that we really facilitate and improve the use of waste heat here.

62
00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:08.670 
The second point, they mentioned that as well.

63
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:18.670 
That's where it goes to the AI models. You mentioned the impressive numbers, I would have mentioned those again otherwise.

64
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:24.939 
I find it also that is yes five cars over the entire life cycle, they had said five years as far as I know the data

65
00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:32.139 
it's five cars, over the whole life cycle - an AI model, that's

66
00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:43.680 
very very much and we know that it needs more efficient computational hardware now, but also just

67
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.790 
support along the way. You said there is no journal for this, so no scientific journal,

68
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.009 
that does that. No in the sense ecosystem where there is in competition underneath.

69
00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:00.750 
And we have therefore now initiated a pilot project to identify energy efficiency potential in the AI area.

70
00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:10.449 
We are doing this with the Frauenhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute and are explicitly looking at energy efficiency in the AI models there.

71
00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:11.569 
at.

72
00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:19.420 
And I hope that can be a good first step in how we move forward here.

73
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.550 
And important other element is about DENA, the German Energy Agency.

74
00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:31.850 
You have also probably already heard the establishment of the Future Energy Lab, there it is also part of the agenda

75
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:39.649 
to what extent different compression technologies can really help make the whole thing more energy efficient.

76
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:47.649 
That is that is the second big block AI, If you have any ideas there, suggestions on what else we can do there, should,

77
00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:51.610 
What legal basis would we need differently,

78
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.649 
What guidelines, legal guidelines would help,

79
00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.750 
Are we very open about that, because we know how big the challenge is, that we make AI energy more efficient

80
00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:04.550 
And third 3rd point software.

81
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.459 
So far, that's just not a criterion in development, and that's the big challenge, and that's where we've come up with

82
00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:15.589 
the Federal Environmental Agency.

83
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:22.329 
That's why I'm also pleased that Mr. Messner is here, a joint project, that's called SoftAware, where it's just about

84
00:08:22.329 --> 00:08:23.800 
the awareness

85
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:31.819 
goes, about it in the software, how high the energy consumption is and that is now started with open source software

86
00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:32.570 
Languages.

87
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.799 
And I hope that we can make some real progress on that quickly as well.

88
00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:46.049 
That runs through 2024, as far as I know, and it started last summer, and hopefully, though, it's one of the projects that's really

89
00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:53.919 
that can show the developer the differences in development, and that you have criteria there for deciding

90
00:08:53.919 --> 00:09:02.169 
which building blocks to use and which ones maybe not, that is worked out together with the software community.

91
00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:08.549 
I think that's also right, that you don't do that in the quiet chamber, but in the exchange and also here.

92
00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:15.559 
Since can then turn to Mr. Messner if they have suggestions or say here the/the actor should still be there and

93
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.149 
that could be taken forward.

94
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.350 
This is a very, very important project for us where we hope we can make a real difference.

95
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:32.460 
So from there, in our house, digitization is seen as an enabler for climate protection and on the other hand the

96
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.450 
enormous need for optimization potential is also seen.

97
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:46.620 
And on both fronts we are working from therefore we hope that the net benefit, as they say the net benefit in the end will be

98
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:54.200 
remains positive and becomes even greater, that we can maximize it, and that's why I'm very happy that they're holding this conference

99
00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.129 
here, that there is work being done in their institute on this, that there are so many people here today working on this issue

100
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:10.710 
in the end, it is you who are driving this forward, not us, but you have to develop these technologies, and I am

101
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:19.059 
really very grateful that you are on this path. We actually need to accelerate it everywhere, like we accelerate everything

102
00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:26.549 
need to do and if you're ever interested in coming by, giving some more input, also for our work.

103
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:34.080 
Honestly, we're very open about that and we look forward to their input and at the same time count on them to move forward.

104
00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:34.750 
Thank you.

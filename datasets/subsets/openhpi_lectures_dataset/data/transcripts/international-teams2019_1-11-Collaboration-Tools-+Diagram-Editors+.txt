00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.020 
Ok Tom, let us continue talking
about collaboration tools. What

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.550 
other tools are there? So one
group or an important group of

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.270 
tools that we think at
least is important:

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.340 
A diagram editors because they
really help to visualize

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.620 
whatever you need to visualise
whatever you need to talk about

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.490 
with your team, and we
have a lot of different

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.950 
use cases for these tools, lot
of different diagrams, UML

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.090 
diagrams and a few relationship
diagrams, business process modeling

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.530 
notation, flow charts, floor plans
business concepts depending

10
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.210 
what you're doing
what you're...

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.230 
Yeah, what your businesses is
basically and what you have to

12
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
discuss with your team
and there's a lot of

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.760 
these tools available
as online tools which

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.340 
can be used so that you can
share diagrams with your

15
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.280 
team, in real time? in real time you
can work on them collaboratively.

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.610 
Again same as with all the
other tools that we had so

17
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.420 
far, there are paid plans. there are free
plans that depending on what you pay.

18
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.210 
It is a kind of..
It is the privacy

19
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.640 
you pay as well. It is the privacy
and also the the amount of members

20
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.360 
that you can invite, a lot of
team members that you can

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.110 
invite to join and the
amount of real time.

22
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.260 
Why will you use collaborative
diagrams, in which case?

23
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.820 
I mean we have.. maybe I just
show an example. Ok perfect!

24
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.730 
let me get that
started, this is just

25
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.930 
one example of these tools
that you can use and we

26
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.320 
we just kind of did an example
for our course here and

27
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.800 
this kind of diagram shows who
of us, you, me or Hanadi

28
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.460 
is kind of taking the lead in
each of the weeks and who's

29
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.080 
kind of also contributing
to the course you can

30
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.660 
see like in week one
many of the videos

31
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
have been.. Well, I
was kind of like the

32
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.230 
main speaker so to say and
you've been a sidekick

33
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.990 
and in the other ones is different
and then you have kind

34
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.080 
of like just as one
example maybe

35
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.530 
a UML diagram and in
software development

36
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.870 
are used to plan which way
you're going and then you have

37
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.060 
like a lot of different tools
that help you plan things.

38
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.490 
I can see there in the browser I
see an address it means that

39
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.450 
file is on the cloud, it is somewhere?
it is not on your PC? No,

40
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.900 
it's not on my PC, it's on the cloud,
it's a tool this tool is called

41
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.000 
particularly if you're
working a lot with google

42
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.390 
google docs, google drive then that's
kind of fits in that suit very

43
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.850 
nicely but if you're working
with a different tool set

44
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.270 
other tools might fit better, so
depending on what other tools

45
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.220 
you're using and we will be
covering that in the next video

46
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.940 
kind of like joining all that
stuff in a kind of one

47
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.240 
tool. I find this
tool pretty useful

48
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.820 
in a remote structure because
you are trying to share

49
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.420 
what you have in your thoughts,
and when we are missing the

50
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.200 
face to face communication this
is something that really helps.

51
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.560 
To diagram to make to point out
something that you imagine

52
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.550 
and then you can share with
all the other people. Yes,

53
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.950 
yeah it's really useful
and particularly

54
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.990 
I mean you can do that as
well if you work with

55
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.460 
local tools and you
use screen sharing

56
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.620 
in a video conference
for example.

57
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.920 
But as we've said in
one of the first

58
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.950 
videos, in one we've been talking
about these video tools.

59
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.870 
The problem often is that
you have kind of bandwidth

60
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.960 
that's just not good enough
or it takes some time till

61
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.090 
the screen is building and so
you don't see it kind of in

62
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.410 
real time. With these tools, with
these browser-based tools,

63
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.700 
everybody can open up the
same diagram and you can

64
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.290 
see the same and it
doesn't require

65
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.030 
the bandwidth that the video tool is
requiring. You are interacting with

66
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.980 
the same idea. Yes exactly!
and you can add it to the

67
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.940 
tool right away. Ok,
like google docs and

68
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.100 
all. Ok great. Is there any any
experience we have with other

69
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.670 
tools? Can we combine different
tools of this diagramming

70
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.630 
as we said before, google dogs
with a something different..

71
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.980 
Are there any kind of compatibility
issues there? each one of the

72
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.340 
diagrams style had their
own particularly?

73
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.760 
draw.io really fits
very well with

74
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.000 
the google suite. The
others or I mean..

75
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.910 
It depends on the whole
landscape that you're building

76
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.860 
in these tools and a we will
come to that in the next

77
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.860 
video. We will be talking about
project management tools.

78
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.480 
Tools that kind of help you to
integrate.. They are more complex.

79
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.900 
Ok, perfect. I think you in
the community you will

80
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.760 
have some experience already
using some of these tools. Will

81
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.530 
you suggest any other diagram
editor or something similar?

82
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.850 
Please join the discussion. We
are looking forward for that.

83
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.900 
Thank you Tom.Thank
you Salim.

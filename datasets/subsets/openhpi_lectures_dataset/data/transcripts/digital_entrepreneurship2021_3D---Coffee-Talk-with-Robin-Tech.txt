2
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.730 
Welcome. Welcome everyone, welcome
to the Coffee Talk session

3
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.050 
for our openHPI course "Digital
Entrepreneurship". With this course,

4
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.150 
we aim to introduce students to the
world of digital entrepreneurship.

5
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.450 
We are glad to have today as an
expert on entrepreneurial processes

6
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.610 
and tools, Dr. Robin Tech and
we're really excited that you're

7
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.840 
taking the time today to talk
to us about your perspective

8
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.100 
on digital entrepreneurship,
entrepreneurial processes

9
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.200 
and entrepreneurial tools. So I
hope you have your coffee, tea,

10
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.100 
water or whatever ready
and let's get started.

11
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.480 
My special Japanese
roasted tea.

12
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.400 
First of all, could you please
introduce yourself to our

13
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.730 
viewers? Who are you, what is your
background, what do you do?

14
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.010 
Yes, I'm happy to. Thanks for having me
Katharina, and also a warm welcome to everyone

15
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.750 
who's tuning in. So I'm Robin. I
am the founder and managing

16
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.440 
director at the AI
startup Delphi

17
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.330 
and my academic background is
in engineering and economics.

18
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
I studied in

19
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.870 
multiple universities in multiple
countries ranging from

20
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.880 
Germany, Stockholm,
Hong Kong.

21
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.040 
My PhD was co-financed
by Google research

22
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.390 
and it included research at MIT, Humboldt
Institute and the University of St. Gallen.

23
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.940 
And as I said, I'm really happy to
be here and I hope that I can

24
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.130 
share some ideas

25
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.310 
some thoughts on
entrepreneurship.

26
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.350 
So that's already the keyword. What
does digital entrepreneurship

27
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.940 
mean to you and how do you interpret it?
What does it mean to you in your

28
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.560 
work or personal life?

29
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.390 
So, I don't know.
As an entrepreneur

30
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.580 
it's interesting that you try
to make this distinction, like

31
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.940 
professional life and and private life
and if that actually exists. But

32
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.880 
when I look at entrepreneurship,
you know let's kind of

33
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.170 
dissect that for a second, so
digital entrepreneurship. When

34
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.130 
I look at
entrepreneurship,

35
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.380 
to me it's always about a combination
of mindset and skill-set.

36
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.210 
So, one of my PhD mentors
for example Bill Aulet,

37
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.710 
who's the director at the MIT Martin
Trust Centre for Entrepreneurship.

38
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.720 
He often speaks of a kind of
internalized toolbox to build

39
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.760 
enterprises based on - ideally
based on - innovative products.

40
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.630 
To him and I think to me as well,
that's entrepreneurship and

41
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.150 
combining mindset and
skill set. And

42
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.120 
what I think what I find particularly
fascinating about this entire

43
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.050 
paradigm of entrepreneurship,

44
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.710 
you know even though a lot of people
talk about toolboxes,

45
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.520 
processes it's not linear. It's
not linear or sequential at all.

46
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.910 
But sometimes it is, I'm sure
it is - but it has never been for me.

47
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.850 
And on the contrary,
actually I think it's

48
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.530 
entrepreneurship is a lot about
open mindset, about recombining

49
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.960 
elements, kind of on
an ongoing basis and of course,

50
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.220 
in the end it's also about timing. You know,
there's been many great entrepreneurs

51
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.890 
with super innovative products but without
any commercialization potential.

52
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.700 
And, so you know, timing is actually
something that you at least

53
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.590 
like externally speaking,
external timing you can't influence.

54
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.510 
But a lot of the other things you can
influence and obviously entrepreneurship is

55
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.100 
to me at least kind of
this kind of

56
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.630 
sensing, maybe in a way,

57
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.710 
you know, of what's the right
timing to apply my mindset

58
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.990 
and my skill-set to
this, whatever this is.

59
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.880 
And when it comes to
digital entrepreneurship,

60
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.010 
I very much connect that
to the internet.

61
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.710 
And to me, I mean I
still remember a time

62
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.810 
when the internet
was not ubiquitous,

63
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.380 
that old,

64
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.030 
but to me especially in the entrepreneurship
scene that kind of supercharged everything.

65
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.310 
When you

66
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.970 
read about the history of Silicon
Valley, for example. You know, the

67
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.960 
kind of these iteration
cycles - how long did it

68
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.010 
take to build a
business, etcetera.

69
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.680 
We talked about years here, sometimes
decades and nowadays we

70
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.150 
talk about months and weeks and
days and I think that very

71
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.310 
much kind of, you know,
it's kind of this

72
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.820 
epiphany of supercharging entrepreneurship
because entrepreneurship, as I said,

73
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.620 
it's about open mindedness, this
recombining elements, timing

74
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.450 
and with the internet we now have
access to basically all the

75
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.980 
information and it's also my
personal experience, right. I mean,

76
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.580 
Delphi could not exist
without the internet.

77
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.040 
And you have all the information,
you have access to people,

78
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.850 
you have access to customers and
it's a completely new ball

79
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.160 
game in my opinion. I don't know if it's
a level playing field. I mean there's

80
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.530 
this big debate on that. When it
comes to platform economy, you know,

81
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.720 
players such as Alibaba, Facebook, Amazon
dominating spheres of the internet

82
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.200 
and actually hindering
entrepreneurship again but,

83
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.560 
yeah, I think in essence you know that's
what digital entrepreneurship is to me.

84
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:47.390 
Thank you, thank you, just because I
kind of got stuck when you said

85
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.390 
it's all about the right timing
and about the sensing. Now

86
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.130 
I would assume that there are
many people saying okay, I'm out.

87
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:05.310 
How do I know when the right time is? Can
you, dear Robin, actually tell me

88
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.440 
when the right timing is? So, and
I think that already kind of

89
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.030 
leads us to the topic
of our conversation

90
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.080 
can that be learned?

91
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.180 
Can that something be
learned? Can this be

92
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.890 
learned? Yeah, I think
so. I think so. I'm - so

93
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.340 
in my opinion, you know, who should
you learn from as an entrepreneur?

94
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.260 
Who should you learn from the
most - it's your customer

95
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.400 
and your user. And they will tell you
whether or not it's the right timing.

96
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.160 
Right now you know it's really bad
timing to sell super innovative

97
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.320 
products that don't save costs, you know,
all that are highly complex in nature

98
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.860 
it's not it's not
the ideal timing.

99
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.490 
However, especially with
you know a big container ship

100
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.910 
stuck in the Suez Canal
- well, not anymore -

101
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.930 
well, I mean, it's still kind of
stuck, right? I mean, like halfway

102
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.550 
there maybe. I don't know but if
you're in the business of supply

103
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:18.670 
chain tracking or re-routing of
supply chains, boom! there you go.

104
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.320 
I mean, I said it before, right. You
only have so much influence over that.

105
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.180 
You know, a lot of the other elements of
entrepreneurship you can influence and

106
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.390 
you're right. And you always have
to be bold, you always have to

107
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.960 
deal with ambiguity and uncertainty
etcetera etcetera, like

108
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.110 
that's a given but you do
have a lot of influence over

109
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.000 
many aspects of entrepreneurship.
When it comes to timing, when

110
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.070 
it comes to sensing

111
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.320 
I mean, you of course know
as an entrepreneurship research I know

112
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.320 
that different schools of thought
you know, are opportunities

113
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.070 
created or are they
identified etcetera but,

114
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.220 
yeah, in the end, in my opinion,
I think it's a bit of both

115
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.730 
and both are equally
important, right. You

116
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.390 
you have to create, you have to be bold,
you have to distinguish yourself

117
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.550 
from your competitors because that's
what digital entrepreneurship

118
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.270 
also entails nowadays. You
always have a competitor,

119
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.150 
right. And then on the other
hand you kind of have

120
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.780 
to sense you know it's like okay,
you know they're already couple

121
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.850 
players in the market

122
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.670 
but I think you know now
is the right time to do

123
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.910 
this again, whatever this is. And
that can be learned and you

124
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.410 
know, talking to
your customers

125
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.300 
really helps you understand if
now is a good time or maybe

126
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.360 
tomorrow or maybe next year. Right.
Yeah, thank you for that, yeah, I see.

127
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.080 
So with respect to process, you
already said that for you process

128
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.420 
definitely is not linear. It's
iterative, it's cyclical probably.

129
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.390 
Would you, I mean can we then say
there's like this one standard

130
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:09.740 
process. So, always think in cycles,
always be iterative and we

131
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.800 
know that lean startups ask
for that, kind of have that

132
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.680 
always, you know, well planned
do-act-check-test, okay.

133
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.680 
What's your view on this?

134
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.130 
Well, first of all, I
think lean startup

135
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.270 
certainly did a lot of good
for the entrepreneurship

136
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.880 
and startup scene
in general

137
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.350 
because it kind
of offered a

138
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:48.180 
new notion and that notion was, you
know, whatever you want to do -

139
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.990 
you can do it because you
can start super small.

140
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.890 
I think, until that
point a lot of people thought

141
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.420 
you know okay, well, that's Apple,
you know, and sure you know at

142
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.660 
one point they started in a garage
and Microsoft as well, etcetera,

143
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.610 
but now they're like super big and incredibly

144
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.500 
they built these incredible multi
national corporations.

145
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.460 
How am I ever supposed to
compete with something like that?

146
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.520 
And lean startup
introduced the idea of, well,

147
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.570 
you can because two decades ago
they did that same thing.

148
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.750 
You know, they started
super small, super lean

149
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.660 
and you can do that too.

150
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:44.670 
Now my problem with that
probably is that it's you know

151
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:50.070 
it very much favours the idea that
are very low in complexity,

152
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.270 
very easy,

153
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.790 
easy you know and oftentimes also
you know B2C driven you know

154
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.890 
quick access, sale cycles
of, I don't know, an hour.

155
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.380 
But, you know, I mean, this is also
about my personal experience

156
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.310 
right and we're in the B2B business
we are in the B2B software

157
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.240 
as a service business. Our
sale cycles

158
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.640 
when I'm lucky it's two
months. Sometimes it's eight.

159
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.750 
I mean, how's that lean?

160
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.410 
And also you know we're tackling
pretty big problems as you know

161
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:39.910 
and, you know, obviously
iteration and and kind of

162
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.990 
step by step is super important
but each of these steps

163
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.400 
also entails a lot of complexity
and you need a lot of like

164
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.010 
a very specialized talent

165
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:56.770 
to do that and you can't rely on
a couple of freelancers

166
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.270 
to, I don't know,

167
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.470 
set up your website and

168
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.300 
an e-commerce
shop. So

169
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:12.740 
yeah when it comes to lean startup, I think
it's great for not so complex ideas

170
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.170 
and especially the B2C sector.
The more complex the more B2B

171
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:23.310 
it becomes, the more difficult
it is to kind of follow that,

172
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.810 
you know, that notion, that paradigm.
What I really like, when

173
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.110 
you want to know about
processes, what I really

174
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.900 
like is disciplined entrepreneurship
began by Bill Aulet.

175
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.680 
And he too says

176
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:44.660 
this is a path, you know, it truly is a path
with forty steps or something

177
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.590 
but he also says, you can
skip some steps,

178
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.700 
sometimes you have to kind
of go back to square four

179
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.770 
and do that again. But
yeah, so this is, I think,

180
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.470 
regarding processes I think
that's a pretty good framework

181
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.320 
but in general that's about
super-fast iteration, I think and

182
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.090 
especially in the early phases - again that's my
personal experience - experiment, experiment, experiment!

183
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.220 
You know, don't involve
architects or bureaucrats.

184
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:22.290 
I mean, we too met and
you know made these experiences

185
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.620 
when we wanted to set up some reporting
infrastructure and were like

186
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.150 
we can spend two to three
weeks on that but it's

187
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.460 
pretty likely that this is completely
irrelevant in two to three weeks.

188
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.980 
So in the early phases
super-fast iteration

189
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.430 
and then step by step
professionalization.

190
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.760 
Is that the right way of doing
it? I don't know, but that's

191
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.030 
my way.

192
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:57.890 
I think also kind of the blessing
of today that we actually

193
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.650 
have the freedom of trying it out
and probably with all those

194
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.230 
digital tools, although as you
pointed out correctly in B2B

195
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.120 
it might not be as easy as just
setting up a landing page

196
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.060 
and doing AB
testing, but again,

197
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:19.790 
as I know also from your business, working
with your customers, using digital tools

198
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.390 
also makes it a little easier to
collect feedback, seeing whether

199
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.660 
you're going into the right
direction and so on.

200
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.380 
I'd like to come back to one
point you mentioned earlier and

201
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.370 
we already talked about the
sensing and timing issue. Now,

202
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.960 
on the notion of forsight, and
I know you're also kind of

203
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.190 
an expert in
this one, now

204
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:47.370 
in this process cycle, obviously
we somehow need to know where

205
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:51.610 
we want to go and where
there is potential. So

206
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.260 
if you were to give a
recommendation for entrepreneurs,

207
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.850 
should they use forsight or is
that too big of a word for

208
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.200 
an entrepreneur
to start with?

209
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:10.590 
That's a good question.I think, generally
speaking, every entrepreneur

210
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.050 
should have a
sound idea

211
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.280 
of what the future
could look like. Right.

212
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.270 
If you don't
have that,

213
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.950 
you're just navigating
blindly you know and

214
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.680 
kind of hope for
the best. And,

215
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.250 
I don't know, maybe say in
this kind of metaphor,

216
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.260 
Christopher Columbus, he still
had a goal. I mean, he wanted

217
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.960 
to find a new - right - I
mean, he had a vision -

218
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.320 
and yeah, he had a
goal and he had this

219
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.970 
idea of what the future could look
like which was well an easier

220
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:55.180 
and sea-based way to go to
Asia and especially India

221
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.510 
to not have to deal with
the Ottoman Empire.

222
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.270 
I mean, and then he
ended up in America.

223
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.370 
That was not planned but he still had

224
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.170 
this idea, he was not just
blindly navigating the oceans.

225
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.760 
And I think every
entrepreneur needs that.

226
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.700 
Not a single one of us can look
into the future but I think

227
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:20.070 
we can all kind of, you
know, construct an idea

228
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:23.780 
of what we think the future could look
like. We can extrapolate what's happening.

229
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.000 
You know, also in our case, at
Delphi, we extrapolate that

230
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.210 
you know manual
competitor research -

231
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:40.250 
it is something of the past.
We extrapolate that sales people

232
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.250 
are not interested and sometimes
probably in the future not

233
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:49.690 
even able to collect like manually
collect all the sales relevant data

234
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.140 
on their customers and

235
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.420 
that's our idea of
the future and that's why we

236
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.990 
build a product to serve
that future market. So now,

237
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.240 
already unfortunately coming to
the end of our conversation,

238
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.340 
how do you see the future? I mean
now we're still in the pandemic.

239
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.460 
I think we learned a lot with respect to
digital entrepreneurship using digital tools.

240
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:24.980 
What will come? How do you see
our future perspective with

241
00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.510 
respect to digital entrepreneurship
maybe also with respect to

242
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.890 
this process and a tool
foresight mindset?

243
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.670 
Yeah, that's again a really
good question and,

244
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:45.420 
you know, doing what I just said,
extrapolating from what we

245
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.230 
have seen, especially
in the past year,

246
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:55.050 
I think entrepreneurship
will become even more dynamic.

247
00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:03.330 
Maybe will even see some some large scale
introduction of temporary organizations

248
00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.140 
and organizations tackling like
one very specific problem

249
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.250 
and then when the problem is
solved, everyone is rich and

250
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.380 
goes their separate ways
again, I don't know maybe

251
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.170 
and what I
definitely foresee,

252
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.810 
and now I really hope that
it actually happens,

253
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.830 
what I definitely foresee is that
entry barriers for specific

254
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.820 
industries will
completely disappear.

255
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.010 
I mean, this is actually a
pretty linear process here.

256
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.010 
It becomes easier
and easier

257
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.960 
in the e-commerce business,
for example. But also in banking.

258
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.940 
Right, I mean you still have a lot
of regulation to deal with but

259
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.230 
I expect that it becomes easier
and easier as well and at some point,

260
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.000 
you know, you may have to rely
on an intermediary for sometime,

261
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.970 
but that's not really an entry
barrier anymore. And we've seen

262
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.080 
that in a couple of
industries already

263
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.190 
and I foresee that will happen in
other industries as well. Even

264
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:22.930 
those that are relying on physical assets,
you know, manufacturing plants for example.

265
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.480 
There are lots and lots of initiatives,
startups, big companies out there

266
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:34.550 
that now kind of rent out their manufacturing
capacities to other companies.

267
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.680 
And you know basically
enabling you to kind of

268
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.170 
start a manufacturing
business with zero capex.

269
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:51.090 
I think that's amazing and
that will, to me this is a

270
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.580 
kind of disappearing market
entry barriers that's probably

271
00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.420 
going to be a
defining element of

272
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.460 
digital entrepreneurship
in the future.

273
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.360 
It's a challenge and an opportunity,
right? So it's like a challenge

274
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.230 
once you are out in the market
you don't have your barriers

275
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.420 
to entry it's an opportunity for
all of them who are not in

276
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.030 
that market. So yeah,
well great. Thank you.

277
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.240 
And as a last wish,

278
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:22.090 
you know as kind of thank you for you
spending your time with us today,

279
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:28.840 
I'm a fairy now. I grant you one wish
what would that wish be with

280
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.230 
respect, well obviously
we all hope for

281
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.630 
health, hope, love and happiness
but maybe a particular one.

282
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.220 
Well to be very specific but
also not too surprising, I just

283
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.590 
hope that this pandemic,

284
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.810 
you know, is over as quickly as possible
with everyone vaccinated, no more

285
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.120 
no more deaths, no more
no more remote

286
00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.800 
work, home-office, lockdowns,
curfews etcetera.

287
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:07.270 
I think we're all getting
a bit mad and not in a good way.

288
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.680 
And so if you are the fairy,
please grant me this wish, make

289
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.670 
it stop - make it end. I'll
try! So Robin, thank you so much

290
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.610 
for spending your time with us
today. It was a pleasure having

291
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:24.310 
you. I think you really set out
some mind stimulating thoughts

292
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:30.480 
and ideas. So I hope for all of our
listeners and viewers, this will kind of

293
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:36.630 
lead their thinking and I hope
to see you again soon. Thank you.

294
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.920 
Yeah, thanks for
having me. Cheers!

295
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.030 
Bye.

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.440 
Welcome to the week on
business decision modelling.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.700 
In this week we will
have seven sections,

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.010 
and we start with the motivation
of business decision modeling.

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:20.530 
We will then provide an overview of DMN which
stands for Decision Model and Notation

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.140 
and the DMN consists of two
part. It allows us to specify

6
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.940 
decisions on high level abstraction in the
form of decision requirements diagrams

7
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.550 
and it also allows us to specify
decisions on a lower level

8
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.710 
of detail and that
is decision logic.

9
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.490 
Afterwards we will look at the
semantics of decision tables

10
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.140 
more concretely, we will introduce
a number of so called hit

11
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.930 
policies that decision
tables have.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.500 
In section six we look at how we
analyze decision tables and we

13
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.900 
prove certain properties that
decision tables should have.

14
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.860 
Finally we investigate the
relationships between processes

15
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.910 
and decisions.

16
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.720 
So let's start with the motivation
of business decision modelling.

17
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.490 
So far in this course we learned
how we can represent a business

18
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.960 
process in the business process
model that has activities, that

19
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
has events, that
has branches

20
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
and when we carefully look at
business process we see that

21
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.390 
many of them actually have
decisions embedded in them.

22
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.930 
Decisions might impact sequence
flow so often a decision

23
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.850 
is taken before an exclusive
OR gateway and depending

24
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.540 
on the decision either branch
of the gateway is taken.

25
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.820 
The decisions can also used to
assign values to data objects.

26
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.780 
In the lower part of this slide
we have a business process

27
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.230 
and I use the laser point you
to certain parts of that

28
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.210 
process model. Here we have the
event credit card application

29
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.600 
received. When the credit card
application is received we first

30
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.670 
record the application information.
Then we have an activity called

31
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.150 
determine basic credit
card eligibility.

32
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.680 
And that's basically a decision
task and that is represented

33
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.420 
by this little table in the
upper part of this shape.

34
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.340 
And depending on the outcome
of the decision either

35
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.250 
the eligibility is not there and
then we can complete the process

36
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.970 
with rejecting the application
or when the basic credit card

37
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.660 
eligibility is true then we can
go this path and we would do

38
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.310 
another check, a refined check and
then afterwards we can either

39
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.730 
say no we have to reject the application
or the application is granted

40
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.020 
and the application accepted end
event occurs at this place.

41
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.920 
So we like to take a closer
look now at this activity and

42
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.080 
actually we call this a
decision task because it is a

43
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.430 
task in a process that
carries a decision.

44
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.030 
And people say of course decisions are
very important and I have a quote here

45
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.780 
saying that it's the decisions
that make or break your company.

46
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.790 
Looking at process automation
we now take a closer look at

47
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.580 
the activity or the decision task
that we discussed earlier and we

48
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.850 
we discussed how we can automate
these types of processes.

49
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.310 
In a previous lecture we introduced
the architecture of business

50
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.510 
process management systems where we have here
component called business process modeling,

51
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.040 
then after modelling a process it is
put to a process model repository,

52
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.910 
the process is then deployed in
the engine and the engine sits

53
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.380 
there and waits for events to occur from
the business process environment.

54
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.780 
And the event that occurs here is of
course when we receive the application.

55
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.040 
The process engine first executes record
application information so maybe

56
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.100 
provide and that is done by
the service provider one,

57
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.060 
And then it comes to the decision task
determine basic credit card eligibility

58
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.300 
and of course a service provider
is invoked and the result

59
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.270 
is given back and then the
process engine decides on the

60
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.620 
branch to be taken. That is
in general how it works.

61
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.250 
Looking a bit closer at the
implementation of decision we can

62
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.840 
have one part where the decision
is implemented in software. So

63
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.050 
when it when we come to the to this
activity to the decision task

64
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.360 
a piece of software is invoked and
the software says either yes or no.

65
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.300 
That's basically characterized
by this, by the figure

66
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.440 
here on the left hand
side of the slide.

67
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.310 
The issues that is related to
the implementation in software

68
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.430 
by decisions are as follows. So
we are not really clear how

69
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.740 
the decision is taken because
it's implemented in software

70
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.110 
and it might not be an
excellently documented as well.

71
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.100 
We are not very sure which data has been
used to do or to take the decision.

72
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.490 
Also we don't know exactly which
policies are taken into account

73
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.660 
during decision taking and we are not
really sure who actually is responsible

74
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.750 
for the decision.

75
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.320 
Often case the decision is taken
just by a process participant

76
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.890 
by a knowledge worker who has the
experience and all the skills

77
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.970 
to take that decision. And that
is here characterized by these

78
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.100 
yes no buttons saying
that either yes

79
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.280 
are the result or the output of
the decision is yes or the

80
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.250 
output of the
decision is no.

81
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.980 
Some of the questions are answered
in this setting but some

82
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.660 
of the questions are again not
answered. So it's not answered

83
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.480 
how the decision is actually
taken, which data

84
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.270 
has been used to take the decision,
which policies are taken into account.

85
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.370 
At least we know who is responsible
for the decision or at

86
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.450 
least who took the decision we
know due to the role assignment

87
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.470 
that we had for this
for this task.

88
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.150 
We investigated a number of
business processes or actually

89
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.300 
more than five hundred processes
from financial industry and

90
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.940 
we saw there another motivation
for using decision modeling.

91
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.260 
Here we have a business process
that takes an employment

92
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.910 
history of an applicant and also
the current debt of that person

93
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.240 
to decide on the
credit rating.

94
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.830 
The credit rating can be
set to A or B or C.

95
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.500 
And so the process works like
follows here. So first

96
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.550 
the employment history is determined,
then the debt is determined

97
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.660 
then we have a split, an XOR split
that if the history is good

98
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.730 
and the debt is low we can
set the credit rating to A.

99
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.590 
If the history is bad and the
debt is low we can we can go

100
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.820 
to B and also here there's
another branch saying

101
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.570 
if the history is good and the debt
is high we can also go to B.

102
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.640 
And otherwise we will have to
set the credit rating to C.

103
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:10.840 
What we see here is that a business
process somehow encodes the decision

104
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.080 
and any change to do through the
decision would require a remodelling

105
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.940 
of the whole process and actually
kind of misuse to the process

106
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.820 
because processes are not
introduced, process models are not

107
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.130 
introduced to represent decisions
but to represent the process.

108
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.320 
So actually we can say that the process
model are being misused to model

109
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.810 
decisions and we have seen that a number
of cases in this model repositories.

110
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.400 
So this I guess gives us enough
information and motivation to

111
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.780 
take a very close look
at decision modelling.

112
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:53.530 
So we need to describe decisions in a dedicated
and separate expressive decision model.

113
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.370 
The focus here is on well-defined
operational decisions like

114
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.810 
the one we've seen before so like granting a
credit or processing an insurance claim.

115
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.320 
The focus is not on strategic decisions
like entering a new market.

116
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.120 
So we have to be able to
also capture the decisions

117
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.510 
in a very concise way.

118
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.900 
We have a number of modeling
goals so we want to improve the

119
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.730 
transparency and maintainability of the
decision and we also want to support

120
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:32.690 
change and we like to support the
automation of repeatable operational

121
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.340 
decisions and we will learn
more about this in the in

122
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.280 
week five of
this course.

123
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.250 
We also have an explicit representation
of the decision structure

124
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.150 
and the decision logic to provide a common
language for domain experts and engineers

125
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.790 
and so the modeling goal with
decision model is basically very

126
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.810 
similar to the modeling goal of processes
where we had the same observation

127
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.360 
that models serve as a common
language for the persons

128
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.970 
involved in the
design of systems.

129
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.130 
This brings us to the
end of video clip one.

130
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:17.740 
So we want to avoid undocumented decisions
and we want to also avoid representing

131
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:24.260 
decisions in process models. Thereby
we are able to answer questions

132
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.060 
like how is the decision actually
taken, which decision logic

133
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:35.620 
is being used, which data also is being
used during the decision taking,

134
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.830 
which policies are taken into account and
who is responsible for the decision.

135
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.570 
And decision models allow us to
answer exactly these questions

136
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:53.090 
and this is very important information for
any auditing that organizations today are

137
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.180 
are facing in an
increasing fashion.

138
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.570 
And finally we like to provide a
common language for domain experts

139
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.500 
and engineers.

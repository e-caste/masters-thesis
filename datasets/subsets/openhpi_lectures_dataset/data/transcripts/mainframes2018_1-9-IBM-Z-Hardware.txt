00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.960 
Hello it's me again, Wolfram Greis from the European Mainframe Academy

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.630 
and in this video clip I want to give you

3
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.050 
a short overview concerning the IBM

4
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.010 
mainframe hardware configurations.

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.710 
With a few files, in this case I just talk about the so called CMOS generations,

6
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.370 
CMOS are for complimentary metal oxide semi conductor technology

7
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.830 
that replaced the older and no longer available ECL technology

8
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.390 
sometimes also called bipolar technology and it started in the IBM mainframe

9
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.380 
environment in nineteen ninety four with the first machine

10
00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.610 
and went up to today two thousand and eighteen with the z14 generation

11
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.880 
and the number fourteen, the most current generation means this is the fourteenth

12
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.990 
generation of these machines. And beginning from the

13
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.300 
z900 which was announced in the year 2000,

14
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.150 
one year later in each and every case there is a smaller machine available

15
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.350 
with needing less place because the big machines these

16
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.350 
first machines that always

17
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.610 
is announced is a two frame machines, means you see in this

18
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.290 
case by these machines in each and every case here, these are

19
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.100 
the pic machines with two frames and starting with the z900

20
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.550 
one year later after the announcement, a smaller machine is

21
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.300 
announced, just a single frame machine for

22
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.910 
smaller environments and smaller configurations.

23
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.720 
And just one thing I think is important to mention with the z14,

24
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.460 
z14 machine here we see on this picture the two frame machine,

25
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.920 
and in April 2018 the smaller machine

26
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.770 
was announced and in this case this is a rÃ¡ck machine with the

27
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.980 
19 inch rack that are normally the standard today in computer centers.

28
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.840 
So IBM now

29
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
takes part of this standard configurations and with the nineteen inch racks.

30
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.040 
This is the IBM z evolution path beginning in this case with the

31
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.730 
z990 in 2003

32
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.440 
and in the upper

33
00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.280 
numbers you see the capacity of a single CPU and I mentioned

34
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.240 
already in a formal video clip that the

35
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.310 
highest clock rate that was available on commercial machines

36
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.980 
was with the zEC12 with 5.5GHz

37
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.100 
clock rate with the next machine in two thousand

38
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.820 
and fifteen the z13,n the clock rate was reduced to 5 GHz

39
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.480 
but the capacity of the machine was increased by twelve percent

40
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.960 
and I already mentioned that the clock rate is really just

41
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.330 
one factor that influences the CPU capacity.

42
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.680 
And with the newest machine with the z14, we have a clock rate of 5.2GHz

43
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.810 
and again an increase compared to the former

44
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.210 
machines, the z13 of eight percent. It's a

45
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.450 
the next increase and the upper number here

46
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.690 
indicates the capacity of a single processor and the lower

47
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.260 
numbers here, not the lower numbers,

48
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.110 
the numbers in fact are much bigger.

49
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.750 
These numbers in the lower area here indicating the

50
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.700 
full capacity set is available with a maximum

51
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.860 
configuration of such

52
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.550 
a machine.

53
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.990 
Here we see a z14 under the cover with the different components.

54
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.040 
I will show you a very nice

55
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.820 
application that is available. It's a so called IBM

56
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.130 
interactive product catalog where you can have an interactive

57
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.270 
look into these machines. I just show you afterwards one more file here

58
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.460 
concerning the balanced system. Balanced system means that in this case

59
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.760 
you see a comparison between the different models and the latest model, the z14,

60
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.560 
I already mentioned the huge I/O bandwidth with eight hundred and

61
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.440 
thirty two gigabytes per second, so it is available.

62
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.280 
This is the capacity on the right side of a

63
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:36.190 
single processing unit, a single CPU and with the z14, we can configure,

64
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:42.860 
the customer can configure up to hundred and seventy processing units.

65
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.770 
This is a really huge number and in fact there

66
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.490 
are more processors within such a machine because these one hundred and seventy

67
00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:01.110 
are just the CPUs, the processing units that the customer can configure.

68
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.100 
In fact there are more

69
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.620 
processing units in place, for example spare CPUs for

70
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.570 
redundancy, if one processing unit fails and a spare processing unit, a

71
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.270 
spare processing unit can take over the

72
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.110 
work of the failing processor. And we have a really again a huge increase

73
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.940 
in the memory capacity from the z13 ten terabyte up to

74
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.650 
thirty two terabyte with the new z14 machine.

75
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.910 
And this is the already mentioned IBM interactive product catalog.

76
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.330 
Let's have a look into it. I go now with this link directly into the

77
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.550 
internet hope you can see it here.

78
00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:03.590 
And you see this is well that was on the file and there are

79
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.990 
different possibilities. Yu can install this application on your android

80
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.700 
or iOS platform or you can

81
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.700 
run it online via

82
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.020 
the web. I take now the online version, click here on

83
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.350 
the order catalogue. We have three categories available. I now

84
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:35.890 
just really just go into the systems and servers. So I click on the left

85
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.280 
application here and here we see now the different machines

86
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.840 
that are available and now let's have a look on the biggest machine

87
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.250 
the z14, the two frame machine. And when we click on these two frame machine

88
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.100 
we get the machine now

89
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.330 
presented and now we have a lot of possibilities, as example

90
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.410 
I don't show you each and every detail. You can play around with

91
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.100 
this application by yourself. I just want to show

92
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.880 
you that as example I can open the doors

93
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.860 
and now the doors are open and I see the two frames and what is

94
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:26.050 
in these two frames. And here you've got a lot of explanations, you can

95
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.810 
read them. There are some markers where you can see where is which

96
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.710 
component in this machine, we can

97
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:38.790 


98
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:46.300 
switch them off and as example we can do a lot of more activities. Now I can

99
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.210 
show you the processor tower

100
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.110 
let's remove one of these drawers where the

101
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.460 
memory is on and the

102
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:07.200 
CPUs and now one of the drawers is shown and we see here all the components

103
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.640 
on this drawer again we can switch on the markers here and can

104
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.470 
have look. Here we have see the memory teams and so on, we have the

105
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.560 
chips on these drawers and so on.

106
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.140 
Let's a look at the last

107
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.180 
thing I want to show you here. As i already said you can play around with this

108
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.970 
machine as long as you want of course I just want to show you as example

109
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.550 
the OSA express cart. It's the

110
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:51.160 
I/O cart where all the network can be connected to the

111
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.010 
mainframe. And now the drawer is

112
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.970 
set back again into the machine and now we go to the I/O cages

113
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.590 
and in one of these cages or the

114
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.900 
express cart is shown and here you can directly

115
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:16.690 
configure your gigabit ethernet configuration and so on. I think a very nice

116
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.390 
tool to have a look onto

117
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:27.240 
this IBM machines. And it's not just the z14, you can have

118
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.090 
a look at all the other machines also.

119
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.390 
Okay let's go back to our

120
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.280 
only just to feel out.

121
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.630 
Yeah have fun with this

122
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.810 
application I've shown you. And thank you for attending

123
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.680 
and we see us again in one of the next video clips.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.970 
In our OpenHPI course about digital identities,
now we want to start to consider

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.040 
ID providers and the
models they are working.

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.800 
So different models of how to
deal with digital identities

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.590 
have been developed over time
and the goal was every

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.430 
time to make it more easy for the
user to use a digital identity,

6
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.990 
and to make it more secure for the service
to deal with its digital identities.

7
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.790 
The main difference between the
models which were developed is

8
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.690 
who and where digital identities
are stored or managed.

9
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.860 
In the following, we start to
consider different models and

10
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.920 
we start with considering the
isolated model for such ID provider

11
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.200 
and the centralized model
for such ID provider.

12
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.340 
Let's start with a look at
the isolated ID provider.

13
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.740 
The idea here is that in the isolated
model each service manages and stores

14
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.390 
a digital identity
by itself

15
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.250 
Each service in this way is
isolated, works independently

16
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.450 
from other services and the user
when they want to use such a

17
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.340 
service that uses such an isolated
ID provider model have to create

18
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.590 
and register a new digital
identity for this service.

19
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.700 
So for the many services the user has
many different digital identities.

20
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.300 
For each service
a single one.

21
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.430 
Ofcourse there are advantages and
disadvantages of this isolated ID

22
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.270 
provider model. Advantages are that
the service has the full control

23
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.960 
over the identities
of its users.

24
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.900 
The digital identities are trustworthy
for the service because

25
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.810 
the service has created them by
themself, has stored them by

26
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.490 
themself, and has the full control
about the identities of its user.

27
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.960 
But there are other disadvantages
for the user

28
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.480 
as well as for the service. Let's look
at the disadvantage for the user.

29
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.190 
It's clear the user have many identities,
he needs a new identity

30
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.570 
for every new service working
with such an isolated model.

31
00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.990 
And when he is registering with the service
to establish a digital identity,

32
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.820 
he has to give the same attributes
several times, the address, the bank details,

33
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.140 
he has to repeat
it over and over.

34
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.780 
And also for the service, it's a
problem because no matter how small

35
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.290 
the service must take care to
protect the database of its user's

36
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.180 
identities by its own, he has to develop
the system, he has to run the system,

37
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
he has to provide the protection
against false authentication,

38
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.170 
and he has to provide
protection against hacker,

39
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.910 
hacker that are interested in
its user database. And this needs

40
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.980 
a great effort.

41
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.470 
Besides the isolated ID provider model,
we have a centralized ID provider model.

42
00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.300 
This is a central service that only
takes care of the registration

43
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.490 
and the management of
digital identities.

44
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.760 
A service that it's later on used by
the different service providers

45
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.110 
and this is a real notion
of an ID provider,

46
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.700 
this is a service, its only task
is to establish and take care

47
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.560 
of the digital
identities.

48
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.900 
We speak here of ID providers
and this

49
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.030 
ID providers are not only responsible for
establishing and storing digital identities,

50
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.700 
they are also responsible for
the authentication process, for

51
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:52.110 
the process that the user proves that he
is owning a certain digital identity.

52
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.460 
Other services which have to trust the
ID provider can then be used

53
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.520 
via this one identity.
So the user

54
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.020 
identifies against this identity
service and the services he

55
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.710 
wants to use, the e-shop or openHPI, they
are trusting as a service and take over

56
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.960 
the information if the
service says yes

57
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.270 
this is the owner with that digital
identity, then the user can

58
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.190 
work and can use the service
with that identity.

59
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.940 
If a service needs certain attributes,
they get them from the ID provider.

60
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.380 
So as different services need different
attributes, for example, delivery address

61
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.730 
or bank account or other
things and those ID provider

62
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.180 
when

63
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.260 
establishing a digital identity
asks for lot of attributes

64
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.160 
and then he gives exactly
the services they use, they

65
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.910 
works with the corporate
ID provider, he

66
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.480 
exactly provides the attributes
the service needs.

67
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.410 
Also here for the centralized ID provider
model there are advantages and disadvantages.

68
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:25.170 
Advantages that a dedicated service
specialized on ID management is established

69
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:31.340 
which takes care and provides all the
security that's needed to handle

70
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:38.080 
a digital identity. And the other services can
only care about their own functionality.

71
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.700 
There's no necessity to establish
ID provider functionality,

72
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.230 
they do not have to care about managing
the digital identities, they can

73
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.740 
exactly concentrate on
what they are doing.

74
00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.810 
For the users, the advantage is that they
have that they can use different services

75
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.510 
with one digital identity.
It's not necessary to

76
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.840 
newly establish a digital
identity for each service.

77
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.390 
What are the
disadvantages?

78
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.650 
Disadvantages are a property that's
called single point of failure.

79
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.540 
If the ID provider does not work,
if something got wrong whether

80
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.370 
it was compromised
or whatever,

81
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.920 
all the other services

82
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:37.180 
that are using a digital identity as
provided by the ID provider cannot work,

83
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:44.650 
cannot be accessed. So a failure or an identity
leak makes all other services unusable.

84
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:51.900 
And of course this ID provider needs
a very high protection because

85
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.270 
all services depend on it and it
cannot happen that this ID provider

86
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.190 
fails.

87
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.850 
A trust is necessary. So it's
another disadvantage. There is a

88
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.910 
single service that cooperate
with the ID provider that

89
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.690 
need to trust this ID provider,
they have no control what

90
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:22.120 
this ID provider is doing with
the digital identities. They

91
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.420 
have to trust that he takes
care in a correct way

92
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:34.270 
and that they can trust also the
identities which are provided by the

93
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:42.100 
ID provider. The central ID provider
model has several applications.

94
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.600 
So you can find it in many
places in the internet.

95
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:55.220 
So it is for example in a company a service
that may manage the employees' identities

96
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.640 
or what the employees
need to do.

97
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:05.060 
It cares what data they're allowed
to access, which data is

98
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:11.430 
not allowed to access and such
identity is established in the moment

99
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.230 
the new employee starts
with the company.

100
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.530 
So with this one identity the employee
can access emails, calendars,

101
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.770 
internal file system and
database, all what is needed

102
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.900 
and the systems that are
in place typically

103
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.910 
for such application in the
companies are LDAP and Kerberos,

104
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.340 
we will later speak
about these.

105
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.150 
About the technical implementation
of such an ID, of such

106
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.920 
a centralised ID
provider model.

107
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:50.250 
The central ID provider model is
increasingly found in the internet because

108
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.810 
in distribution of work
it makes sense to

109
00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:02.080 
have a special service only dealing and only
responsible for managing digital identities.

110
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:08.690 
So there are websites that do not
offer their own registration but

111
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:14.420 
rely on log-in via third parties
and very often it is facebook

112
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.150 
log in that is used or google
log in or twitter log in,

113
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:25.610 
and in this way the service
that allows users to

114
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.360 
log in via
Facebook or Google

115
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:39.950 
identities, they are very popular
and here Facebook and Google

116
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.440 
play the role of a
centralized ID provider.

117
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.740 
So in summary, if we look to this
isolated ID provider model

118
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:55.790 
then each service manages its own
digital identities, the users

119
00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.010 
as a consequence have many
digital identities as they need

120
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.540 
one for each service.

121
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.070 
Compared to that in the centralized
ID provider model, a

122
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:15.340 
specific service as the ID provider takes care
of digital identities and other services

123
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.030 
rely on the

124
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.630 
digital identity

125
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.340 
is provided by the one ID provider.

126
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.840 
They trust this and they
have not to care about

127
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.010 
ID management
functionalities.

128
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.440 
For the user it becomes easier
because they have only one

129
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.960 
or at least a few digital
identities and so

130
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.020 
they are well distributed
models in the internet, the

131
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.940 
isolated is more in the starting
situation of the internet,

132
00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.570 
services and more and
more such centralized ID provider

133
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.240 
models you can
find in the web.

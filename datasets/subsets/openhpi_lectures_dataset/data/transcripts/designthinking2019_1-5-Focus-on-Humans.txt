00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:08.410 
So, what we have been learning
and addressing so far is that

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.410 
there are 2 important principles
when it comes to Design

3
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.780 
Thinking nowadays, the first one
is about being a principle

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.950 
of leading change within
the organization,

5
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.720 
from Brockhaus Thinking to
a Network Organization.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.420 
And the second principle is actually,
about creating innovation opportunities

7
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.000 
to reinvent or invent new offerings,
new products, new services;

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.740 
everything with which you face the
market and also your customers.

9
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.710 
And this is why we are focusing
very much, and intensively on the

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.530 
user or rather human issues.
And we spend a lot of time,

11
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.420 
we ask our participants in the
workshops and our students

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.270 
to spend quite a lot of time to really
find out about the needs, the real needs

13
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.090 
of the people in a certain
environment. And they are

14
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
trying to figure out how can we
address best, those needs, with our

15
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.280 
ideas, with our prototypes, with our
solutions. And then we combine

16
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.340 
the humans and the perspective with
the perspective of technology.

17
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.870 
And also the potential technology might
have to create solutions: so for example,

18
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.580 
Virtual Reality is a technology that you
can use for organizing team interactions,

19
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.610 
meetings amongst individuals
across the organization,

20
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.300 
but is this a good way of connecting with
somebody on a very personal level?

21
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.130 
And these kind of questions are what
we're playing back and forth,

22
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.390 
between the human-centeredness and
the feasability of technology in

23
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.790 
this framework. And, If you know enough
about the users, the human needs,

24
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.830 
and also about which kind of technology
we want to use to address those needs?

25
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.010 
Next question to answer is, Does
that make sense in a financial

26
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.300 
way, So is it a business coming
out, if it is viable? And,

27
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.230 
out of the combination of these
3 perspectives, you actually

28
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.260 
are able to tackle the sweet
spot, what we also consider as

29
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.000 
being the spot for an
innovation opportunity.

30
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.350 
However, to actually achieve an innovation,
it needs more than just an idea

31
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.100 
about a new combination of human
needs, desires, and technology,

32
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.630 
in terms of a potential solution,
and also the business model.

33
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.180 
It also includes the implementation
and understanding of

34
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.240 
the impact that new idea will make.
Because not everything that

35
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.000 
new is perceived good and also
promising. So, therefore, this

36
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.300 
is our perspective on framing Design Thinking
for creating innovation opportunities,

37
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.530 
within a holistic framework. And
throughout the last years we

38
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.120 
saw somehow confusion coming up,
people were mixing up Design

39
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.430 
Thinking with Service Design,
with User-Centered design, User

40
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.590 
Centricity and so on But
actually, Design Thinking and

41
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.280 
the 3 core elements of design
thinking are moving a step further.

42
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.740 
Therefore we do consider design
thinking as being an agile framework.

43
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.220 
An agile framework prepares
an organization to become

44
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.510 
more flexible and more adaptable to
uncertain developments in the future.

45
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.770 
And if you look at the range of all the
agile frameworks we're discussing

46
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.150 
so far, like lean
startup, Google sprint,

47
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.170 
agile programming; we would consider
Design Thinking is probably

48
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.380 
the most holistic one in this
range. And this is what we want

49
00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:01.290 
to discuss and learn together with
you through the next weeks.

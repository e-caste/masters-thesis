00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.420 
Welcome back everyone! We're very happy

2
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:10.970 
you're here with us for the end of this course.

3
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.370 
In this video, we'll talk about what happens

4
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.740 
after the design research phase in the design thinking process.

5
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:20.500 
So in this course,

6
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.460 
we walked through the phase of finding inspirations.

7
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:25.720 
We paid attention to workarounds

8
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:28.530 
and interesting findings in our environment,

9
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:30.770 
and already started to interpret them.

10
00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:34.260 
So this MOOC was about exploring the problem.

11
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:36.590 
Instead of coming up with solutions

12
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:37.300 
right away,

13
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:39.770 
you looked outward for inspirations.

14
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:41.420 
In the next step

15
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.760 
you would use these inspirations to move towards solutions,

16
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:47.220 
and validate those solutions with users.

17
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.100 
But these are the topics for our next modules.

18
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.080 
We are planning to publish our next MOOC on

19
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.640 
generating solutions in 2018.

20
00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:57.680 
So stay tuned and see you then!

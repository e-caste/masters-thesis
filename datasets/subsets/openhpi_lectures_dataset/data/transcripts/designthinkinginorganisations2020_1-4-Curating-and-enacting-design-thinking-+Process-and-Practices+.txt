00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.440 
Welcome to our openHPI
course on mastering

2
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.130 
design thinking in organizations.
I'm Danielly and our topic

3
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.010 
of today is curating and enacting
design-thinking in organizations.

4
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.820 
The learning objectives of today's module
are one, to learn about the different ways

5
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.690 
that design thinking
can manifest itself.

6
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.080 
Two, to have an overview of
a design seeking process.

7
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.740 
Three, to grasp some of the
most recommended tools,

8
00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.840 
techniques and practices and four, to
understand the principles of design thinking.

9
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.000 
If we take a look at our design thinking
implementation view, we are on

10
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.860 
the topic of process and practices. To
complement the practical knowledge

11
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.200 
provided by Florian Huber from
PWC IXDS, I will talk a little

12
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.370 
bit about the theoretical views that
scholars have on design thinking.

13
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.720 
We'll also look at design-thinking beyond
its traditional role as a process

14
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.770 
to understand what it takes to
reconfigure our capabilities

15
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.370 
to develop a design
thinking mindset.

16
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.050 
When trying to understand how to
conceptualize the different

17
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.470 
applications of design thinking,
Core Green and her co-authors

18
00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.130 
have created a model that illustrates
design-thinking as the interplay between process

19
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.270 
and techniques combined with
principles and mindset.

20
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.760 
The techniques are referred to
the methods and tools that are

21
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.830 
part of the design thinking implementation.
The tools support the

22
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.730 
practice of design thinking
by means of a process model

23
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.810 
or by the embodiment of the
principles to develop the mindset.

24
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.270 
And the principles
enact the process.

25
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.430 
As you can see the different
manifestations influence one another.

26
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.090 
They are connected. Now let's take
a look at these bubbles and

27
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.740 
learn a bit more
about them.

28
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.910 
Let's talk about process and what
are the techniques that support

29
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.840 
each step of
the process.

30
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.810 
I believe that you probably have seen
many design thinking process models

31
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.320 
that have been proposed by
different institutions.

32
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.410 
Even though these models propose
different process steps, the

33
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.610 
concept is almost
the same.

34
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.100 
Let's talk a bit about
the concept behind it.

35
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.880 
Design experimentation is about
knowing when and how to move

36
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.160 
between analysis and synthesis
and also abstract and concrete

37
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.750 
in order to reduce the
complexity of the challenge.

38
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.530 
As we can see in the bottom left of our
diagram we start with field exploration.

39
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.240 
The goal of this phase is to talk
with different stakeholders

40
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.460 
to understand the problem
space under investigation.

41
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.860 
Then we analyze the data collected
from the field research

42
00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.170 
and derived from works that illustrate
the insides of the analysis.

43
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.010 
During the analysis process we
move from a concrete space

44
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:14.590 
to a more abstract level in order to understand
people's needs, behaviors and motivations.

45
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.230 
With that understanding we then
develop more imperative directions

46
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.400 
by using ideation techniques
to develop solution ideas.

47
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.240 
This direction will then guide us
in the process of converging back

48
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.680 
to a more concrete space when we use
prototypes to test our assumptions.

49
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.650 
This is not a linear process. We move
between the different process steps

50
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.680 
depending on when it's
necessary to diverge

51
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.840 
and when it's necessary
to converge.

52
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.900 
So this is the concept behind the
design taking process models.

53
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.180 
As I mentioned before, there are many
different design thinking process models.

54
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.320 
I brought to you some examples. As
you can see they are different

55
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.500 
in terms of nomenclature of the
phases. However as I said before,

56
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.010 
they follow the same concept of
analyzing and synthesizing

57
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.520 
and moving between
abstract and concrete.

58
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.500 
Let's take a look at one of the oldest
models, the SUGAR ME310 model

59
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.920 
as an example and walk
through it together.

60
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.720 
Basically the model
follows a five step phase.

61
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.560 
As you can see, it's not a linear
process. That means that you

62
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.040 
would not necessarily perform
one step after the other.

63
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.830 
As design thinkers we need to
learn how to be able to move

64
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.330 
back and forth in the phases of the model
to meet the needs of the project.

65
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.040 
The model starts with problem
definition and redefinition.

66
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.470 
This phase of the model aims to gain
an empathic understanding

67
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.050 
of the problem we are
trying to solve.

68
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.260 
First within your team and then it involves
talking with different stakeholders

69
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.750 
to find out more about
the problem space

70
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.510 
and then the
final challenge.

71
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
Need finding and synthesis involves
different qualitative approaches

72
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:44.960 
such as observing, engaging and empathising
with people in order to understand

73
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.760 
their experiences and motivations
as well was immersing yourself

74
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.640 
in the physical environment so
you can gain a deeper personal

75
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.100 
understanding of the
issues involved.

76
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:05.820 
This is where you will analyze your
learnings and synthesize them

77
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.620 
in order to define the core
problems that you have identified.

78
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.710 
This photo represents a project
that we did in south africa

79
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.590 
where we conducted an investigation to
better understand how nozzle sprays

80
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.130 
can treat patients
with cold symptoms.

81
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.590 
In this project we went out and
talked with different stakeholders

82
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.820 
and for our surprise we discovered
that not only the nurses

83
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.310 
and community doctors are relevant
to the problem space, but

84
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.000 
also they reach doctors.

85
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:49.230 
If we hadn't gone out into the wild
and conducted a proper need-finding

86
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.080 
we would not have
found that out.

87
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.140 
Just to show you how the outcome of a
proper need-finding can look like

88
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.990 
it can be in the form of hot reports
such as summarized transcripts,

89
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.250 
another format is picture and
videos showing particular scenes

90
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:16.200 
that provide in-depth understanding
of the context and also

91
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.080 
in the format of news and articles
such as political trends,

92
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.900 
business reports
and benchmarking.

93
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:29.450 
After seeing this you might
believe that you already do that

94
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:36.710 
and maybe you actually do, but as professor McKim
from the Stanford university mentions,

95
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.530 
need-finding is easy
to get started with

96
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.600 
but deceptively
hard to master.

97
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.210 
The only way to learn it is to
do it and the best way to do

98
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.800 
it is in the wild.

99
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:58.950 
Ideation is the phase in which we build
on our need findings and synthesis

100
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.380 
by generating ideas for solutions.
Brainstorming is definitely

101
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.480 
one of the best known techniques.
However there are many more

102
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.270 
techniques that
we can use.

103
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:17.290 
Ideation becomes useful when we know
what needs the customer may have.

104
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.570 
Prototyping is a technique in which real
products, services and business models

105
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.350 
are simulated to test ideas and
concepts as soon as possible.

106
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.740 
Real prototyping is
moving beyond post-its.

107
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.770 
Therefore prototyping is neither
a plating nor a craft session.

108
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:47.220 
By making real prototypes we can
articulate ourselves to tell

109
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.440 
a story, to achieve
mutual understanding.

110
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:56.700 
In the early phases of the project
we use a low fidelity prototype

111
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.440 
to quickly test
our assumptions.

112
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:07.560 
The idea is that early on we detect
flaws in our concept and then iterate it.

113
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.750 
For example on the left
side of your screen

114
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.260 
you can see an example of
a low fidelity prototype.

115
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.310 
We did this project some years
ago to investigate the topic

116
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.680 
of blood sampling
automation.

117
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.250 
As part of this project the students
wanted to test their assumptions

118
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:37.100 
that patients could use wristbands to
support the process of automatically

119
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.220 
pairing a blood sample
with the patient record.

120
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:48.100 
After many rounds of testing the students
developed a high-fidelity prototype.

121
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.850 
On the right side of the screen
you can see the high fidelity

122
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.220 
prototype that the students created.
The goal of a high-fidelity prototypes

123
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.810 
it should test whether our concept
is viable and feasible from

124
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:09.020 
a technological point of view. It
also aims to test it with the

125
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.330 
users in an environment where
the experience is closer to a

126
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.050 
real product
could provide.

127
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.580 
Just to summarize you should start
with a low fidelity prototype

128
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.240 
before you move on to a
high-fidelity prototype.

129
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:30.410 
The main goal of the low fidelity
prototype is to test your assumptions.

130
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:36.350 
A high-fidelity prototype aims to
test the feasibility, viability

131
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.140 
of the solution and also the
experience of the user.

132
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.810 
In the testing phase ideas and
prototypes are tried out and

133
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.250 
evaluated by customers and
all the stakeholders.

134
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.570 
Testing assumptions and filtering out
these assumptions are important.

135
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.500 
So we can learn about important aspects
of the problem and solution spaces.

136
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:07.220 
They before mentioned qualitative
approaches such as interviews

137
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:13.830 
are normally used for testing. Testing
helps to discover flaws in our solution.

138
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.580 
So these are the process steps of the
sugar ME310 design-thinking model

139
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.150 
and also the techniques
that we use.

140
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.100 
Of course this is a very
brief explanation.

141
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.780 
To get a real understanding it's
necessary to put it into practice.

142
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.320 
In order to help you with the
practice I have prepared a list

143
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.920 
of four critical practices that we
should consider when starting

144
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.670 
to implement
design thinking.

145
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:54.350 
I have identified these practices
as part of my PhD research

146
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.970 
when I developed a capability model to
support companies in their journey

147
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:06.140 
from the initial steps in the design thinking
implementation to actually develop a mindset.

148
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.670 
For now I will only show you the
practices that are recommended to do

149
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.000 
when you want to have a
comprehensive process in place.

150
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.930 
If you are interested in knowing
the practices there are necessary

151
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:29.240 
to develop the mindset, you can
download my PhD thesis as part

152
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.570 
of the course material.

153
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.000 
And will also discuss them as part
of education and training model.

154
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:43.690 
The first practice is provide
necessary material, which means

155
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:50.640 
to provide the necessary resources for the team
to perform design-thinking related activities.

156
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:56.290 
Then in order for the design thinking
implementation to be sustainable,

157
00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:03.170 
it's critical to integrate it with
related processes for instance

158
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:10.210 
drive approaches or link start-up. Providing
access to the user is fundamental

159
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.930 
if teams want to conduct
proper need-finding.

160
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:20.950 
And finally it's also critical to provide
spaces that encourage teams to meet,

161
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.320 
discuss and co-create.

162
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.900 
But as you know COVID-nineteen
created a disruption in our work mode

163
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.510 
and therefore we had to
evaluate our behaviors.

164
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:40.460 
The current situation indicates
that a combination of digital

165
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:46.940 
and physical spaces is necessary.
Therefore, having a hybrid concept

166
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:53.990 
of innovation spaces is critical when it
comes to collaboration and co-creation.

167
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.250 
The four practices are not
listed by rank of relevance.

168
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.950 
They rather provide an understanding
of the core elements the

169
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:11.140 
teams should consider when starting to enact
design thinking in their organizations.

170
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:18.170 
In a paper published recently in the
journal of product innovation management

171
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.620 
which is a leading journal in the
area of innovation management,

172
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:28.160 
professor Pietro Micheli and
his co-authors identified ten

173
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.270 
principles for
design thinking.

174
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:36.910 
They are user-centered and involvement,
creativity and innovation,

175
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.580 
problem solving, interdisciplinary
collaboration,

176
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:47.090 
iteration and experimentation,
ability to visualize,

177
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.370 
gestalt view, tolerance
of ambiguity and failure,

178
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:58.290 
blending analysis and intuition
and finally abductive reasoning.

179
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.940 
I would like to talk now about
the four principles that are

180
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:10.330 
the most important ones for me. The first
one is user centred and involvement.

181
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.600 
Being user-centered is a fundamental
characteristic of design thinking.

182
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.600 
It's necessary to learn how
to co-create with a user

183
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:27.160 
when developing solutions. The principle
of interdisciplinary collaboration

184
00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.650 
tell us about the importance of
having cross-functional teams

185
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:39.420 
and promoting an environment that
helps them to see the value

186
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.330 
that diversity
can bring.

187
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:48.680 
Iteration and experimentation
refers to the ability to clarify

188
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:54.270 
the problem being addressed through
validation cycles with the user.

189
00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:02.160 
Iteration and experimentation are
often aided by making ideas tangible

190
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.690 
through sketches, mockups
and prototypes. The principle

191
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:13.740 
of blending analysis and intuition
refers to the ability to

192
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:19.270 
combine analytical logical thinking
from traditional management theories

193
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.580 
with intuitive thinking.

194
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:27.330 
Finally failure is considered
to be valuable for learning

195
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.240 
because it can enable
innovators to fail early

196
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.670 
and therefore in a
relatively inexpensive way.

197
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.980 
Organizations that tend to avoid
failures at all costs risk

198
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.420 
missing potential
opportunities for innovation.

199
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.000 
To sum up, design-thinking can manifest
itself in terms of a tool,

200
00:17:54.810 --> 00:18:02.820 
process and mindset. The ten mentioned principles
are the foundation of design thinking

201
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:09.450 
and they should guide your behaviour in case
you want to develop a design-thinking mindset.

202
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.000 
However, if you are a novice, then
starting from the principles

203
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.690 
can be too demanding.

204
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.970 
In that case it's recommended that
you first familiarize yourself

205
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:28.610 
with the tools and methods. Then you
should start seeing design-thinking

206
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:34.130 
as a dynamic capability and
therefore you should learn how

207
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:39.370 
to reconfigure your skills in order
to meet organizational needs.

208
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:45.970 
If you want to learn more about how to develop
your design thinking capabilities,

209
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.230 
you can watch our module on
education and training.

210
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:58.750 
For now I will end our module with the
following quote from Hillary Collins -

211
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:06.580 
"Design thinking is not a linear
process, it's a paradigm shift.

212
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.710 
Businesses that think of design-thinking
as a methodology that

213
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:18.150 
can be easily adapted to their own culture
may be in for a disappointment."

214
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:26.090 
Thank you for your attention and see
you again as part of our next module.

215
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.220 
Ciao.

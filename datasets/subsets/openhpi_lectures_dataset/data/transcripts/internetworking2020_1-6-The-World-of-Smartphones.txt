1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.880 
Speaking about half a century of Internet,
we have also to speak about the world

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.920 
of smartphones and this is
really a young world.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.600 
If one looks for the
beginning of this

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:22.400 
area of smartphones, then it's fair to
mention the Nokia 9000 communicator.

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.480 
So it was smartphone
for opening

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.840 
and it was a sold as a
pocket sized office.

7
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400 
So it was possible to
send and receive

8
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800 
facilities and then Internet
browser with HTML support.

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.760 
So it was a
small computer

10
00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.120 
with a possibility that you can
use it for telephone activities.

11
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.720 
Price was about
800 US Dollar,

12
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.800 
So of course, for a telephone
it was very expensive.

13
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.160 
To mention another device from the
very beginning of the smartphone

14
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.200 
area, then Siemens S10 mobile
telephone is worth to be mentioned.

15
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.520 
This was the first mobile telephone with
a color display, and this was the idea

16
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.920 
that the display

17
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:44.800 
of a telephone can use for more than only
to display the number you have called.

18
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.520 
different information.

19
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.720 
See, the problem with using the Internet,
connecting smartphones with the Internet

20
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.640 
in the beginning, where many folds.
So a special feature which is

21
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.520 
indispensable today is the mobile access
of a smartphone to the Internet.

22
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.600 
And the initial problems
with such an Internet

23
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.920 
access for mobile phones
was the websites.

24
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.120 
were not designed to be viewed on
a small mobile phone display.

25
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.240 
Such big displays we had in the phones
today in the beginnings as well,

26
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.680 
small displays and the
websites were not designed.

27
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.400 
So even if you have
to get access

28
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.440 
And that's a problem because the Internet
bandwidth, which was initially very low.

29
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.160 
So loading the media, for
example, from a website

30
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.400 
with such a mobile connection,
took a very long time,

31
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.960 
So in the first days, I
remember the first days

32
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.680 
of the World Wide Web, I remember that
www was read as a world wide waiting.

33
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.480 
So these were
two problems

34
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680 
and people look
for a solution.

35
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360 
And the solution came
with this protocol,

36
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.680 
is web protocol is a wireless
application protocol.

37
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:43.680 
And the first version was released in 1997
and it helped for better representation

38
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.280 
of HTML resources of websites
and a small display.

39
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.920 
It takes care about the data
volume that are transmitted.

40
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.880 
So it was lowered so that the faster
transmission and shorter waiting time

41
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.760 
were possible at the end also lower
costs because in the beginning

42
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.920 
of the transmission of data on mobile
devices cost a lot. Nowadays,

43
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.520 
Nowadays it is
rarely used.

44
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.880 
WAP is almost not
in place today

45
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.920 
because the modern smartphones
achieve much higher transfer rates.

46
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.400 
So there are more and much
better technologies.

47
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.640 
then of course, we have to
speak about the iPhone.

48
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.320 
So as the first iPhone

49
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.160 
was presented in 2007 and this
was really a breakthrough

50
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.760 
in the smartphone technology,
so some people took

51
00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:03.800 
the 2007 appearing of the first iPhone
as the birthday of smartphones.

52
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.480 
So the

53
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.840 
first iPhone.

54
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.240 
The first iPhone combines three devices,
three devices in one of the mobile

55
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.880 
telephone, the music player and
mobile communication device.

56
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.960 
And the input was done
via touchscreen.

57
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.000 
This was a big step, you remember,
to the Nokia Communicator's.

58
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.120 
There was a keyboard provided
in the smartphone.

59
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.400 
If you can do this
with touchscreen,

60
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.280 
operation also, it became
much easier to use.

61
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:57.200 
Setting in this way with this
touchscreen and the intuitive usage,

62
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:05.320 
which gets our standard set for the
future development of smartphones.

63
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.200 
So today's smartphone
became the real

64
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.000 
computer parallel to the
computer's development.

65
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.720 
The smartphones

66
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.200 
are also becoming more
powerful, more sophisticated,

67
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.160 
so a much better hardware equipment, more
sensors and each side smartphones are

68
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.640 
about sixteen sensors
measuring different things.

69
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.640 
There is a large, larger and
higher resolution displays.

70
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.560 
Very good cameras
are involved today

71
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.600 
and also a number of modern
security technologies are used.

72
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:53.640 
So this all helped for a rapid spread of
smartphones and mobile devices around

73
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.400 
the world with this
breakthrough of smartphone

74
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.800 
by the iPhone, the distribution
increased significantly.

75
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.920 
So today

76
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.160 
there are around 3.5 Billion
smartphones in place

77
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.960 
and 35 to 40 percent of the world's
population is using such a smartphone.

78
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.960 
Also in Africa and in parts of the
world where they do not have a PC,

79
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.160 
where they do not have a laptop,
they are using a smartphone.

80
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.560 
So almost seven billion
mobile devices worldwide.

81
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.640 
In addition,

82
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.640 
in addition to the smartphones, cell
phones, tablets, Iot devices.

83
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.840 
So it shows that there
is a really huge

84
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.200 
number of such devices, which, of course,
push the digitalisation of our world

85
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.920 
and the access to the services that are
provided in the Internet in a huge amount.

86
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.440 
Today, many users have even
multiple mobile devices.

87
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.480 
So the statistics in this way,
it's difficult to have,

88
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:12.640 
for example, in the Western world is
doing business activities often are

89
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.560 
strictly divided from doing private
activities with different devices.

90
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.120 
So if we look at the
share of the web

91
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:30.320 
traffic by the type of devices
we see, a laptop was

92
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.480 
has about 45 calls,
about 45 percent

93
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.240 
of the Web traffic as it is
measured in this year in 2020

94
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:49.480 
and compared to the year before,
it is minus 4 percent.

95
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:56.560 
See Smartphones says an increase
to the year before 2020.

96
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.880 
There are more than half of the web traffic
is caused or is done by smartphones.

97
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.680 
And we have tablets.

98
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.800 
We have other devices.

99
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.680 
of the smartphone in using the
Internet and Internet services.

100
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.560 
Here are graphics
that shows

101
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:34.320 
the smartphone sales between
2009 and forecast 2022, where

102
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.000 
measures are done in
millions and millions.

103
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:46.440 
So here 1 billion boundary
was exceeded in 2013.

104
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.840 
And today we have around
one point five billion

105
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.880 
smartphones sold
in a year.

106
00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.920 
What makes the
smartphones.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.800 
In the time of our openHPI course
- A Half Century of Internet,

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.040 
a lot of things happened on the
internet and I will mention

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.630 
a few of them. Corona, of course, Coronavirus
has pushed digitalization in many many

4
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.820 
different areas.

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.250 
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
many businesses had to adapt

6
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.930 
their model to what is
called "the new normal".

7
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.650 
Lockdown, contact
restrictions and others

8
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.680 
all these provide a floor for
accelerating digitalisation.

9
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.450 
The digitalisation of the business,
digitalisation of services, so,

10
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.740 
it could be served as a reshaping
of the current workforce with

11
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.770 
new technology
and services.

12
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.310 
Of course, theoretically, the
people know that digitalisation

13
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.240 
would provide a lot of means to
change their businesses but

14
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.570 
now they are forced to use
and apply these means

15
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.740 
for overcoming the restrictions which
are provided by the pandemic.

16
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.960 
Restaurants, for example,
provided QR codes. QR codes

17
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.350 
that allow customers to see the
menu and check-in online.

18
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.300 
The idea was to minimize the physical
contact and help contact tracing

19
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.770 
or the companies were moving their data
and business processes to the cloud.

20
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.350 
Better services were available,
it was more agile than running

21
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.730 
in-house. Running and taking
care of the computing centre

22
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.440 
often was difficult and working
at home became, particularly

23
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.090 
in the weeks of lockdown, the new
way of how we work. So, the

24
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.360 
number of employees that work
from home was increasing

25
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.060 
due to COVID-19
pandemic

26
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.780 
lockdown. sorry. Online meetings
were done via Zoom, MS

27
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.610 
Teams, Skype.

28
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.040 
Many of them caused a lot of data
protection questions, also

29
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
BigBlueButton or Jitsi as open-source
systems were available,

30
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.710 
the online collaboration
was possible with Git,

31
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.800 
Google Doc, Office
365 and others.

32
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:53.060 
Here is the development of how many
people, how many employees used

33
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.310 
to work from home? In the information/TMT
services, the professional

34
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.040 
business service, financial
activities, manufacturing, education

35
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.840 
and health system; and you
see some of the branches,

36
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.660 
it was easier to work from
home, in other, it was more

37
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.310 
difficult but in any case you see
this huge increase in the usage

38
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.760 
of such a digital
system.

39
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.570 
So, Remote Desktop Connections (RDC)
are needed to access the enterprise

40
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.660 
workstation when
working from home.

41
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.190 
RDC - Remote Desktop
Connections;

42
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.920 
when COVID-19 pandemic began, the number
of such remote desktop endpoints

43
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.830 
increased by 41%.

44
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.650 
The remote working
mode brought various

45
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.920 
effects. Some studies say work
became more productive, many

46
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.400 
studies say work became less
productive and efficient by

47
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.230 
having this remote
working style.

48
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.190 
There are the problem
with confidential data

49
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.190 
that when people
work at home,

50
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.950 
it was not clear what they do with
the data, so, the potential

51
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.510 
confidential data could be
lost, could be stolen.

52
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.470 
Blurred work, personal lives and
such effects, I do not have time

53
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.150 
to discuss its details but what
was clear is in the moment

54
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.110 
such remote desktop connections
increased the number of

55
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.560 
all those attacks against such
remote desktop connections.

56
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.680 
They are
increasing in a

57
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.690 
broadway and a visible way. This
statistic coming from Kaspersky

58
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.350 
and with different colors to
different countries are observed.

59
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.140 
How one can secure such
remote desktop connections?

60
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.570 
We discussed a lot about these methods
- use strong passwords, update

61
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.830 
in particularly your
remote desktop software,

62
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.220 
use remote desktop
through a corporate VPN

63
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.870 
Virtual Private Network, we discussed
this in the course. Use firewalls,

64
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.370 
limit the number of users who
can log in via remote desktop.

65
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.680 
This is important for the
administrators to do.

66
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.390 
Enable two-factor authentication,
if possible. You see, we spoke

67
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:58.220 
about all those methods that help
also in such a crisis to secure

68
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.710 
own system or network.

69
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.540 
During the course, there was a
very serious ransomware attack

70
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.300 
in Germany against the University
Hospital in Düsseldorf.

71
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.520 
On September 10th, 30 servers of the
University Hospital Düsseldorf

72
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.920 
were encrypted by a
ransomware attack.

73
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.110 
So, the attacker
spelt out later,

74
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.720 
actually, they wanted to
attack the university

75
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.060 
and not the university hospital
but they attacked the hospital

76
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.710 
and a person died
on that day.

77
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.000 
So, what the attacker did? They
made use of a vulnerability

78
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.240 
weakness in the software,
in a VPN software

79
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.530 
which became public

80
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.660 
at the end of the last year and
they use this vulnerability to

81
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.920 
install a backdoor and then over this
backdoor to infiltrate the network.

82
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.280 
Although the VPN software was
patched quickly, so already,

83
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:16.390 
in 2019, you can have
fixed this backdoor,

84
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:24.110 
here it was not fixed,
so when they looked

85
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.360 
in the system, then they found
out that the attackers

86
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.100 
came via the VPN software
but they were not aware

87
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:39.200 
of the backdoor which meanwhile the
attackers have had installed.

88
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.360 
So, the encryption of the server led to
a breakdown of the hospital operations

89
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.770 
and since IT systems which are
necessary for many processes

90
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.550 
and during that
breakdown a woman

91
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.100 
which was in
urgent surgery,

92
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:06.240 
it could not be performed, was
transferred to a nearby hospital and

93
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.170 
she died on the way.

94
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.100 
Now police
investigations

95
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.990 
investigates
for negligent

96
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:21.130 
homicide and when the police informed the
attackers that the hospital was affected

97
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.090 
the attacker then sends the digital
key for decrypting the server but

98
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.690 
it was too late,
this woman died.

99
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.920 
Even if the administrator had a
digital key for an encrypted

100
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:43.080 
data, it needs time to let the
system work again and to

101
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.780 
reach the status of a full
operational situation, so, this

102
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:55.560 
was a very serious cyber attack which
ends up with the death of a patient.

103
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.500 
To round up the importance
of internet security,

104
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.760 
the media almost a daily report about
malware infections, about attacks,

105
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.730 
about data leaks, about
identity leaks.

106
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.410 
So, security has to play a central
concern when using the internet.

107
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.650 
You have to be clear that you
are responsible for your data,

108
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.990 
you are responsible for your system
to run it in a secure way.

109
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.960 
Internet users are
responsible,

110
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.000 
some of the systems that are
available on the internet do

111
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.560 
not provide enough security means,
so, the user him or herself

112
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.890 
is responsible to protect
his or her personal data,

113
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.060 
his or her system
from attacks.

114
00:09:51.788 --> 00:09:55.420 
If you are interested
particularly in cybersecurity

115
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.820 
there are more
openHPI courses

116
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.550 
we can recommend in
this situation.

117
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.980 
There is the

118
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.010 
openHPI course -
Tatort Internet -

119
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.010 
uh uh uh uh uh start
on the internet

120
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.270 
Angriffsvekoren und Schutzmaßnahmen
(attacks and protection measures).

121
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.770 
It was from earlier this
year and there is another

122
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:27.400 
openHPI course on cybersecurity. It is
called Internet Security for Beginners.

123
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.770 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

124
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:22.420 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

125
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.400 
uh uh uh uh uh cybersecurity it was is a
cause internet security for beginners

126
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:33.080 
It was done in 2018 and this
is an English course.

127
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:41.090 
So, I hope you had fun with
our course, you had a lot of

128
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:47.470 
new knowledge and insight you can get,
I'm very thankful to all participants

129
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.090 
that contributed to the discussion
forum, that contributed to

130
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.540 
the discussions that help
the other learners

131
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.010 
to learn and to better
understand what we offered

132
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.850 
in the course, the knowledge, the
information as protection measures

133
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.070 
about the internet and the use of
the internet and of course, I'm

134
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.020 
very thankful to my team who supported
me in designing the slides

135
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:22.870 
in helping me with the discussions
in the discussion forum.

136
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.660 
Hope to see you in one
of our next courses.

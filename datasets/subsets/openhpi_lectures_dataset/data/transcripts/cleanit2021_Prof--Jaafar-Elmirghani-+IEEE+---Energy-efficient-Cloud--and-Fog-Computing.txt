00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.509 
Welcome everyone to our now fourth clean-IT

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.669 
openXchange live talk.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.909 
My name is Nils KÃ¶nig and today with Sophie

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.029 
and Max from the clean-IT team, I'm going to moderate

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.679 
this live talk today.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.625 
With us today is Professor Jaafar

7
00:00:19.626 --> 00:00:22.529 
Elmirghani. He is Fellow of the

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.919 
IEEE organization, Fellow of the IET

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.979 
and Fellow of the IEEE Sustainable ICT

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.179 
initiative.

11
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.179 
He has published over 500 papers

12
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.149 
and his work in this field has led to more

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.669 
than five IEEE standards.

14
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.489 
Today, he will be giving us an introduction into cloud

15
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.909 
and fog networks, including wireless, IoT,

16
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.680 
core and data networks.

17
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.759 
And he will be talking about sustainability in general

18
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.699 
through the ICT technology

19
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.209 
in general. Without further delay, please welcome

20
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.210 
Professor Jaafar

21
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.869 
Elmirghani. Thank you.

22
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.309 
Thank you so much for the

23
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.369 
introduction and I'm delighted to be here.

24
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.339 
So I'm just going to share my screen

25
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.189 
and hopefully we can

26
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.419 
get started.

27
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.819 
OK.

28
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.069 
So thank you so much for the very kind introduction.

29
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.119 
I'm Jaafar Elmirghani from the University of Leeds in

30
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.239 
the

31
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.909 
UK and I'm delighted to be able to talk to you

32
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.479 
today about sustainable cloud and fog networks.

33
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.479 
So this work was sponsored by the Engineering

34
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.389 
and Physical Sciences Research Council in the UK,

35
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.139 
and I'm co-chair

36
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.019 
of the iEEE Sustainable ICT Initiative.

37
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.219 
So this is an outline.

38
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.209 
I'll start

39
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.169 
talking to give an introduction

40
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.069 
to sustainability and its need in cloud

41
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.399 
and fog networks.

42
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.019 
And then for the majority of the time,

43
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.199 
I'm going to focus on specific areas on wireless access

44
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.124 
networks, IoT networks, core

45
00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:56.969 
networks and data center networks to

46
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.829 
try to give you an idea

47
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.319 
about how sustainability can be ensured in those

48
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.249 
segments.

49
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.909 
I'll talk a little

50
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.329 
bit about test-bed implementations that we have done.

51
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.809 
I'll talk

52
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.989 
about the IEEE standards that we have introduced

53
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.789 
in this energy and sustainability

54
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.099 
that were already mentioned.

55
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.969 
And then I'll talk

56
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.819 
about slightly different angles so that are

57
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.819 
two angles to sustainability, and ICT making

58
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.939 
ICT self-sustainable or energy-efficient and so on.

59
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.949 
But then also using ICT to make our area

60
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.009 
sustainable, and this is the last part that I'm

61
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.299 
going to go

62
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.179 
through. Hopefully, the slides and so on would

63
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.249 
be shared. So if we

64
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.269 
were to look at

65
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.119 
energy and issues, this is a chart that was produced by

66
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.149 
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US.

67
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.209 
And what it does is it lists on this side here

68
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.469 
all the sources of energy.

69
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.029 
So we have solar, nuclear,

70
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.709 
hydro, wind,

71
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.669 
geothermal, natural gas, coal,

72
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.469 
biomass and petroleum, and on the right hand

73
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.619 
side that lists the areas in which

74
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.709 
energy is used. So residential, commercial, industrial

75
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.119 
and transportation.

76
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.399 
And the thickness of the line going from the energy

77
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.459 
source to the particular area where it is used

78
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.859 
indicates how much of the sources used in this

79
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.619 
particular sector. So a lot of petroleum, for example,

80
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.949 
is used in transportation, a little bit in industrial, a

81
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.349 
bit in commercial and a bit in residential.

82
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.049 
If you look at electricity, so many of the different

83
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.929 
forms of energy are used to produce electricity.

84
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.459 
This is the effective

85
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.089 
energy that

86
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.459 
we produce out of the production process.

87
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.319 
We saw all the input energies.

88
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.839 
And this is how much we actually waste.

89
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.009 
And therefore, if you look at

90
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.029 
how much we waste versus how much we use

91
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.709 
in the electricity generation, but also in all the other

92
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.559 
sectors, we actually waste about two-thirds

93
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.649 
of the total energy that we receive and only use maybe

94
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.969 
about one-third of the energy.

95
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.619 
And this tells us that that is

96
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.829 
a very big need for energy efficiency

97
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.089 
in general.

98
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.150 
In the ICT area, what

99
00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.099 
the carbon

100
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.009 
footprint of ICT is made up of is shown in this

101
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.649 
chart here, which comes from the agency, the Global

102
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.739 
Enabling Sustainability Initiative, SMARTer

103
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.359 
2030 Report.

104
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.179 
And what it does is it shows the ICT emissions

105
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.379 
broken down into

106
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.499 
individual sectors, end-users devices,

107
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.419 
data centers and networks.

108
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.439 
So data centers account for about 28%,

109
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.719 
networks for about 24% and end-users

110
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.099 
devices for about 47%.

111
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.399 
In this stock here, I'll talk about data centers and

112
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.489 
networks and waste, whereby we can reduce our carbon

113
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.489 
footprint. So in data centers, we need to be aware

114
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.829 
of servers, the data that is transported

115
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.559 
and the computing units.

116
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.379 
In networks, wireless, enterprise,

117
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.319 
data transport and different networks at

118
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.459 
home.

119
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.669 
So if we look at the driver behind the growth

120
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.670 
in

121
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.599 
ICT power consumption, it's mainly been traffic and

122
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.239 
traffic at the turn of the century was growing at about

123
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.689 
300% because the internet was just being introduced

124
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.709 
and people expected

125
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.499 
it to grow even further

126
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.529 
instead, this is a trend that we ended up seeing, and

127
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.089 
therefore we have the best of the power

128
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.039 
around the year 2000.

129
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.039 
Currently, traffic still continues to grow at about

130
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.599 
30 to 40% per year,

131
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.599 
and you will be pushed to find a sector

132
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.929 
that

133
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.379 
continues at this point in time to grow up 30 to 40%

134
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.189 
per year.

135
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.669 
This is data that came from the Green

136
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.339 
Touch consortium and Bell Labs.

137
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.499 
If we look at growth at 30 to 40%

138
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.009 
per year, 40% per year.

139
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.939 
That means traffic doubles every three years, increases

140
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.159 
by a factor of 30 in 10 years and by a factor of 1000

141
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.979 
in 20 years.

142
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.999 
What this means is

143
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.249 
that if we're able to improve the energy

144
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.189 
efficiency of ICT of networks

145
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.029 
and so on

146
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.879 
by a factor of 1000, then in 20 years,

147
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.469 
we'll be able to accommodate

148
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.469 
1000x more traffic while consuming the same

149
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.879 
amount of energy as today.

150
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.599 
This is the breakdown of the traffic

151
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.139 
in

152
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.349 
North America in Terabits per second

153
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.349 
vs Years. We see that the smallest by volume

154
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.149 
is wireless voice, the fastest growing is

155
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.139 
wireless data, the largest by volume is internet video

156
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.029 
and then the second is peer to peer.

157
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.159 
And therefore, those are the strands that we have to

158
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.969 
give attention to try to reduce support consumption.

159
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.179 
The Green Touch consortium was set up to improve energy

160
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.119 
efficiency by a factor of 1000, it published a number

161
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.349 
of white

162
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.699 
papers.

163
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.949 
There are some members of the consortium.

164
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.299 
It had about 50 member

165
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.179 
organizations and gave a number of awards.

166
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.059 
Those papers are interesting white papers to look at

167
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.819 
to see how energy efficiency can be improved.

168
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.729 
Now, energy efficiency networks

169
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.729 
was divided into three main sectors - the core

170
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.269 
networks, access networks and wireless networks.

171
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.179 
So core networks and data centers are what

172
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.259 
are shown here in this

173
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.499 
graph and that part of the network have to achieve

174
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.679 
an improvement by maybe a factor of 100.

175
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.949 
Effectively, we achieved the factor of 300x

176
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.669 
improvement

177
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.929 
or shown how

178
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.529 
315x improvement in energy

179
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.089 
efficiency can be achieved.

180
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.119 
So in 2010, it was about the average

181
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.389 
power consumption in these networks was about

182
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.259 
360 nJ/bit,

183
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.369 
that bit

184
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.529 
of information that you want to transmit.

185
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.899 
And in 2020, the

186
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.189 
projection was

187
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.189 
1.14 nJ/bit.

188
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.829 
Also what this table here shows is that there isn't one

189
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.279 
single

190
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.319 
measure that you can take that gives you

191
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.539 
all the improvements. So there are many small things

192
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.436 
that we can do that amount to that

193
00:07:41.437 --> 00:07:41.569 
total

194
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.749 
improvement. So business as usual and more slow

195
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.459 
improvement, maybe factor of four.

196
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:47.999 
Green Touch

197
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.179 
introduce innovations in equipment,

198
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.649 
optical interconnects,

199
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.739 
changing packet processing according

200
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.589 
to the size of the packets, optimizing

201
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.529 
the signal processing and transponders, that's a factor

202
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.939 
of four.

203
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.149 
Deploying and managing protection

204
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.059 
equipment, usually, production equipment is left on

205
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.929 
all the time, and

206
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.389 
many times you, for every working party, have a

207
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.699 
protection plan, especially when you get closer to the

208
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:13.969 
core

209
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.789 
of the network and therefore a factor of

210
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.029 
two

211
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.529 
almost improvement.

212
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:18.949 
Router

213
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.019 
bypass and sleep modes.

214
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.469 
A lot of

215
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.459 
the energy

216
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.009 
in the network is used in the electronic layer,

217
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.519 
and not in the optical

218
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.399 
layer. So if you are able to bypass the routers

219
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.489 
and stay in the optical layer as far as possible until

220
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.808 
you reach the destination, you

221
00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:35.449 
can save a factor of two.

222
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.459 
Dynamically Allocated Line

223
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.689 
Traits, meaning trying to look at

224
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.569 
exactly the amount of traffic

225
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.999 
you have and matching that with transponders that

226
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.199 
exactly

227
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.559 
can accommodate

228
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.019 
or just have a little bit

229
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.189 
extra

230
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.599 
reduces wastage a lot.

231
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.719 
So you're not sending 10 gigabits over a 400 gigabit

232
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.879 
transponder, for example.

233
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.899 
And that gives a factor

234
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.099 
of 1.2.

235
00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.869 
Optimizing the network

236
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.059 
topology and then doing cloud

237
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.119 
virtualisation. So hopefully I'll go through a number of

238
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.779 
these

239
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.000 
in turn and show you how they can be achieved.

240
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.439 
So this work was done in part also

241
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.589 
in the EPSRC Intelligent Energy aware Networks

242
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.309 
Internet

243
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.058 
Project, and we have got the follow on

244
00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.709 
how project now started also 2019 to 2020.

245
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.689 
For each of them, a six million pound project funded by

246
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.939 
EPSRC.

247
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.279 
So we looked here at how you can use renewable

248
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.619 
energy effectively networks.

249
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.349 
Part of the issue is that usually, we design networks

250
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.389 
and communication systems with the assumption that

251
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.189 
energy is always available

252
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.479 
and renewable energy is not

253
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.979 
available all the time. But there are

254
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.269 
things you can do.

255
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.609 
We can move, for example, processing and virtual

256
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.189 
machines to wherever the sun is shining or the wind is

257
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.119 
blowing.

258
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.339 
We looked at the policy of the network and

259
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.529 
how to optimize that quality to minimize power

260
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.789 
consumption. It turns out

261
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.049 
that the optimum

262
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.169 
network topology when traffic is symmetric, that

263
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.419 
means everybody wants to talk to everybody at the same

264
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.439 
rate. The optimum topology is a full mesh.

265
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.279 
And when there is one

266
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.099 
dominant, which has a very big data center, then

267
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.229 
the optimum topology is a star.

268
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.079 
We looked at how content can be distributed in

269
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.509 
the network. Where should we place content?

270
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.179 
Where should we build clouds?

271
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.229 
How large should those clouds be?

272
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.489 
And then which content should

273
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.719 
be placed in which cloud?

274
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.889 
And then how do we route the

275
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.739 
traffic from the content

276
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.399 
to the

277
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.400 
end-users.

278
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.059 
Also looked at content caching.

279
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.849 
So if you look at a large library like YouTube, for

280
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.499 
example, it may have a few hundred

281
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.059 
million videos, but only about

282
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.839 
maybe 50 or

283
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.259 
100 videos account for about 80% of the hits.

284
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.299 
And therefore, if you were able to

285
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.359 
cache those top 50 or 100 videos

286
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.459 
somewhere close to the end-user,

287
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.069 
then

288
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.429 
the end-user can consume that video locally.

289
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.349 
So traditionally what happens is you

290
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.899 
connect to your router, you go down and you go to

291
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.869 
a faraway city, for example, I'm here in Leeds and maybe

292
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.429 
the content is

293
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.399 
in London and I have to go all the way to London, maybe

294
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.309 
in California and get the content

295
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.429 
from the server, and come and consume it here.

296
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.129 
And these journeys up and down the network consume a lot

297
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.379 
of energy. If I was to store some of the

298
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.359 
content locally, then I have very

299
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.269 
short journeys. The downside is, obviously you have

300
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:19.389 
to

301
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.399 
adapt the equipment to the network, which are the

302
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.439 
content caches, and therefore actually the

303
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.939 
network consumes

304
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.319 
more power by

305
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.879 
adding those equipment.

306
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.059 
But since the content is used locally,

307
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.219 
you avoid those long journeys and overall you

308
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.939 
win. Also big data networks,

309
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.359 
how can we process

310
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.299 
data? Big data can come from social media, can come

311
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.639 
from healthcare, can come from

312
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.839 
financial institutions and so on.

313
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.960 
And traditionally,

314
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.459 
this big data is sent to central

315
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.529 
data centers for processing.

316
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.719 
In reality, you are not

317
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.929 
usually interested in the data itself, but in content

318
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.649 
or knowledge embedded in the data.

319
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.629 
So imagine

320
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.939 
if you have a health rate monitor

321
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.979 
that is monitoring

322
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.039 
a

323
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.269 
heartbeat or something like

324
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.609 
that, then most of the time

325
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.459 
this waveform being sent to the data center will

326
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.469 
be saying "This person is fine".

327
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.679 
So there was no point to sell this

328
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.649 
waveform for the next 20 or 30 years to the data

329
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.169 
center when the answer is "the person is fine", you

330
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.289 
could have processed it locally and just extracted

331
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.529 
the incidence or whether the person needs help and

332
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.989 
some of those incidents are ambulance or the doctor so

333
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.629 
that the person gets help and therefore we're interested

334
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.614 
in transmitting knowledge and not data, and therefore

335
00:12:39.615 --> 00:12:42.429 
edge processing here can help us a lot.

336
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.346 
Here is an example where we can do edge

337
00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:48.159 
processing. So this is a network where we have big data

338
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.229 
centers in the center of the network.

339
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.799 
We have

340
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.709 
got smaller data centers in the metro

341
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.209 
area. We have got

342
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.089 
fog or edge processing and the access, and

343
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.279 
then we have got the end-user devices.

344
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.159 
And the trade-off is that we can process things

345
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.359 
locally. So if we

346
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.069 
are able to accommodate

347
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.949 
the request in the local access, then that results

348
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.359 
in very short journey only

349
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.199 
to your local

350
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.269 
telecom office in part of the city, not

351
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.399 
even all the city.

352
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.269 
And these

353
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.579 
short journeys reduce the power consumption in the

354
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.699 
network and the downside

355
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:21.909 
to

356
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.619 
and therefore you end up winning.

357
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.529 
The downside is usually that the

358
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.259 
servers that you implement in the access network

359
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.969 
tend to be less energy efficient than

360
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.639 
the very big ones and also

361
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:33.789 
the

362
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.669 
cooling and so on that is done in the access

363
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.966 
is not as efficient as the cooling that you do in the

364
00:13:38.967 --> 00:13:40.869 
very big data centres and

365
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.439 
therefore looking at best in a kind of a countrywide

366
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.279 
implementation.

367
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.889 
This is the policy of the ATnT network.

368
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.949 
You would see that depending on how much idle power

369
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.599 
we have, usually in many

370
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.119 
servers, as soon as you switch it on, it may consume,

371
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.529 
say, 200 Watts.

372
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:56.859 
By the

373
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.509 
time you put a full load on

374
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.839 
it, it only consumes, say, 250 or 300 Watts.

375
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.919 
So that is very high

376
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.699 
idle power and that high idle power means that

377
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.449 
it is not very

378
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.359 
efficient to switch on many of those servers and use

379
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.979 
them only slightly.

380
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.849 
And therefore, consolidation is very good.

381
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.429 
But imagine a scenario

382
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.299 
where we get to energy proportional computing,

383
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.319 
in which case

384
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:20.499 
it

385
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.689 
is very good to actually

386
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.509 
place processing everywhere and place it close

387
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.239 
to the end-users. Because according to how much

388
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.539 
processing we use, the power consumption

389
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.019 
goes proportional to that

390
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.009 
amount of computing in which case

391
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.059 
the

392
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.759 
as you can see, a lot of the processing is placed here

393
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.639 
in the green, which is the access fogs and a

394
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.549 
little bit is in the metro and in the clouds.

395
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.849 
At the

396
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.499 
other end, if you have got

397
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.259 
these kind of servers that more or less, as soon as you

398
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.229 
switch them on, consume the same amount of energy

399
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.459 
as when they are

400
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.379 
fully loaded, then it

401
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.259 
is much better to go for consolidation and therefore go

402
00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.639 
for the central clouds.

403
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.459 
One of the standards, that we were

404
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.399 
developing in IEEE has just been

405
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.259 
approved, looks at this power

406
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.159 
proportional computing, the holy grail in computing

407
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.499 
and shows how this can be achieved.

408
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.669 
And here is

409
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.729 
another area which is virtualization.

410
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.849 
Many times you have a substrate network like this here

411
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.489 
where you have a number of users that

412
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.449 
need to be connected and you have got

413
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:26.819 
virtual

414
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.669 
network requests. So those may come from an enterprise

415
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.519 
that has got three branches that wants to

416
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.009 
be connected. Or this substrate network

417
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.039 
may be owned by a big operator, the equivalent

418
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.919 
of a DT or

419
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.529 
ATnT or something like that.

420
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.869 
And then you have a small operator that wants to help a

421
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.099 
slice of that network.

422
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.619 
The question is, and these are different slices, the

423
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.339 
question is how do we translate those slices,

424
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.099 
virtual slices into the actual substrate network?

425
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.889 
How do we go from the virtual network to the substrate

426
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.229 
network? In other words, how do we do this process

427
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.339 
called embedding

428
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.059 
in a way that

429
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.289 
is energy efficient?

430
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.089 
And here is an example where you can

431
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.029 
do one connection or embedding for the

432
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.869 
red request,

433
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.449 
for the blue request and for the green request.

434
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.519 
And as you can see, there are many ways of doing

435
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.649 
this, and therefore you can formulate

436
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.559 
this as an optimization process, solve it in a way

437
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.529 
that minimizes power consumption.

438
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.349 
As we go along, there are papers related to each of

439
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.319 
the areas. So if you wanted to find out more please

440
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.349 
refer to those. So here is the example of the blue

441
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.230 
request being embedded in those nodes.

442
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.509 
The green request embedded here and here, and

443
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.389 
the red request embedded in those

444
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.009 
three nodes here.

445
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:38.849 
This is an

446
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:39.359 
optical

447
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.539 
layer that has got optical cross-connects, transponders

448
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.719 
and so on. An IP layer that has got routers

449
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.779 
and then a processing layer that has got

450
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.139 
data centers, servers and so on.

451
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.539 
If we were to do this, embedding an energy-efficient way,

452
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.659 
we can save up to a total or a maximum of about

453
00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.099 
60% of the energy

454
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.719 
in the network, an average of about

455
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.720 
20%.

456
00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.399 
I'll talk a little bit about test-bed implementation.

457
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.809 
So many of these techniques that

458
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.969 
I talked about we implement in

459
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.059 
test-beds. So this is one example test-bed that we have

460
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.279 
in our lab in the University of Leeds.

461
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.039 
This has got three core nodes here.

462
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.949 
Each of them can support 100 Gigabits per second,

463
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.588 
about 400 kilometres of fibre.

464
00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:24.159 
A number of

465
00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.789 
racks that have got servers and this represent

466
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.869 
a big data

467
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:29.799 
center in the center

468
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.329 
of the network.

469
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:31.779 
And then a

470
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.719 
number of servers at the edge that represent edge

471
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.269 
processing. And therefore you can come up with a video

472
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.909 
process at the edge of the network, process it again

473
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:40.689 
and again

474
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.119 
then transmit it to one city.

475
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.909 
So one of these nodes will be able to carry the traffic

476
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.729 
in a city, say, the size of Leeds, then distribute the

477
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.199 
other cities and

478
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.679 
then come

479
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.499 
out and process at the other end or

480
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.899 
other edge processing, and therefore demonstrate

481
00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.509 
so many of these concepts.

482
00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.649 
And we implement many of the algorithms in FPGA

483
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.959 
boards like these that would plug into your servers and

484
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.279 
therefore

485
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.359 
we can do many of the energy

486
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.259 
efficiency

487
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.699 
techniques.

488
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.809 
Here is an example

489
00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.489 
where you have got remote radio

490
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.299 
heads, you have got processing cells, you have got a

491
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.699 
regular application, for example, cellular application,

492
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.259 
residential and so on,

493
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.399 
and video

494
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.619 
being processed at the edge of the network, maybe

495
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.359 
somewhere in the network itself

496
00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.019 
and then being consumed at the other end.

497
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.439 
And this is an overall view of the

498
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.848 
test-bed itself.

499
00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:35.499 
There is the IP network.

500
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.409 
There is a distributed processing and virtual machines

501
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.839 
that you can place in different locations and

502
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.279 
then you have got the different

503
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.649 
optical

504
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.469 
line terminals and the optical network units and

505
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.829 
so on connected to the wireless final drop.

506
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:53.499 
I'll just mention one or two things quickly about the

507
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.790 
IEEE sustainable ICT initiative.

508
00:18:56.919 --> 00:18:59.979 
So following the work that was done in Green

509
00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.729 
Touch, a lot of the

510
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.861 
activities now are done within the IEEE sustainable

511
00:19:03.862 --> 00:19:04.029 
ICT

512
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.030 
initiative.

513
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.099 
IEEE has obviously got electrical and electronic

514
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.019 
engineers, has got a number of societies such

515
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.629 
as the Computer Society, the Communications Society,

516
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.149 
Micro Economics Society and so on.

517
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.849 
And one of the ways of IEEE tries to remain

518
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.079 
current and ahead

519
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.369 
is to have these initiatives.

520
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.229 
So these initiatives try to

521
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.789 
look at things that are current and

522
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.579 
are growing. For example, there are initiatives on

523
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.299 
computing, on

524
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.259 
electrification of

525
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.759 
transportation,

526
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.309 
on 5, 6G, etc.

527
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.739 
If these initiatives become very successful and they

528
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.729 
grow, then they become

529
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.259 
can become a council.

530
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.409 
And if councils grow, then they become societies.

531
00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.729 
And therefore,

532
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.059 
this is a cross IEEE society's initiative

533
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.259 
that has got contributions from the Communication

534
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.099 
Society, Vehicular Technology Society, Microwave

535
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.169 
Theory and Technique Society, etc.

536
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.629 
And it develops things like standards, conferences,

537
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.659 
publications and education, and tries to introduce

538
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.689 
metrics into the different societies

539
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.159 
that relate to sustainability.

540
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.559 
And sustainability is obviously not only about energy

541
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.859 
efficiency, but there is the social and economic aspects

542
00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.379 
and so on. And therefore there our societies, such as

543
00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.679 
the Society for Social Implications of

544
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.299 
Technology in IEEE that

545
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.279 
will be ideal for

546
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.739 
doing this. So through this, nine standards were

547
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.039 
developed since 2017

548
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.779 
IEEE standards, and

549
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.229 
we had a

550
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.409 
number of summits, also introduced some

551
00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.719 
new IEEE transactions on green communications and

552
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.439 
networking in

553
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.729 
2017.

554
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.909 
And we are introducing an IEEE magazine

555
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.945 
on sustainability and ICT, and a number of short

556
00:20:42.946 --> 00:20:44.279 
courses.

557
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.309 
So I'll just give you

558
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.259 
quickly an

559
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.569 
idea about some of the standards.

560
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:49.919 
So those are nine standards.

561
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:51.749 
1922.2

562
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.169 
is a standard that looks at the methods for anticipated

563
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.149 
emissions. So this looks

564
00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.479 
at how can we quantify the actual

565
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.969 
emissions that are produced by

566
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:03.989 
computing and

567
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.622 
communication and data centers and so on.

568
00:21:06.623 --> 00:21:08.579 
Currently, what is done is to look at the country and

569
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.399 
you say this is a fuel mixture they have, this

570
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.369 
much nuclear they have. This much energy that comes

571
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.739 
from coal or from other fossil fuels.

572
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.439 
They have this much renewable and so on, and therefore

573
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.329 
a kilowatt-hour on average

574
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.639 
in this region of the country or in this country on

575
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.339 
average produces so many grams of CO2.

576
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.389 
But this is very

577
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.949 
variable during the day, during

578
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.192 
the year and so on. So this time there are actually

579
00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:34.289 
instruments the power plants, etc.

580
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.730 
Instruments, data centers and produces

581
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.219 
real-time emissions or the anticipated

582
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.529 
emissions. This one compliments it and looks at the

583
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:44.549 
real-time aspects.

584
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.529 
1923.1, which has now been approved,

585
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.466 
looks at this power proportional compute, sorry,

586
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.309 
1924.1 looks at the power-

587
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.829 
proportional computing that I talked

588
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:59.039 
about. That is, when you switch on a server,

589
00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.559 
how can we ensure if it's doing no work, the power

590
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.529 
consumption is zero and as it does or as close

591
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.589 
to zero as possible and as it does model work,

592
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.369 
the power increases linearly and the way it is done is

593
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.279 
partly, it's the switch on and off supplies and

594
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.669 
other elements, at almost GigaHertz rates

595
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.900 
of microwave frequencies.

596
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.799 
This standard here looks at the

597
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.059 
waveforms and

598
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.789 
quantifying their energy efficiency.

599
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:28.859 
1925.1

600
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.269 
looks at dynamic line rates.

601
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.119 
I mentioned those trying to use exact or as

602
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.239 
close a line rate as possible to the amount of traffic,

603
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.329 
so you'd not say carrying 10 gigabits over 400 gigabit

604
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.589 
transponder

605
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.590 
1926.1

606
00:22:42.489 --> 00:22:45.359 
looks at energy-efficient big data processing.

607
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.599 
As I mentioned, we're interested in transmitting

608
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.389 
knowledge and not transmitting data, so therefore

609
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:52.379 
you can go from data

610
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.379 
to knowledge using edge processing, for example,

611
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.999 
and then only transmit the knowledge.

612
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.609 
And the knowledge is very small and therefore you save a

613
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:00.209 
lot of

614
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.210 
power in the network. 1927.1

615
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.439 
looks at virtualization.

616
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.529 
The picture I mentioned earlier having virtual requests

617
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.709 
slicing the network, slicing the data centers

618
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.009 
and slicing the edge processing in a way that achieves

619
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.279 
energy efficiency. 1928.1

620
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.319 
looks at energy efficient

621
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.969 
virtual machine placement.

622
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.519 
Where should we place virtual machines in the network to

623
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.679 
maximize energy efficiency?

624
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.769 
And 1929.1 looks at energy-efficient content

625
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.299 
distribution.

626
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.419 
So how can we cache content?

627
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.749 
Which content to cache? And where should we cache with?

628
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:36.989 
Etc.

629
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.769 
Those

630
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.229 
you may be familiar with some of the IEEE standards, for

631
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.639 
example, IEEE

632
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.209 
802 is a family - 802.11

633
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.939 
is Wi-Fi, 802.3 is Ethernet.

634
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.879 
So those are families so for standards in a similar

635
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.880 
way.

636
00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.929 
Finally, I'll talk about the last part, which is the

637
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:56.930 
greening through ICT.

638
00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:00.999 
So the SMARTer 2030 report had

639
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.489 
the previous version, there was a SMARTer

640
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.689 
2020 that came out in 2008

641
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.779 
and basically it quantified the carbon

642
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.999 
footprint of ICT, but it

643
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.999 
also identified ways whereby ICT

644
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.209 
can

645
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.819 
be used to improve

646
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.729 
and reduce emissions in other

647
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.609 
sectors. So in transportation, for example, making

648
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:25.539 
transportation more

649
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.899 
efficient in manufacturing, making manufacturing

650
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.339 
more efficient and so on.

651
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.549 
And essentially, the conclusion was that if

652
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.209 
ICT is used in

653
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.369 
a good way, then it can

654
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.479 
reduce the carbon

655
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.099 
footprint in the world by an

656
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.559 
amount that is five times its own carbon

657
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.901 
footprint. In 2012

658
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.869 
this report was revised with a new edition

659
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.789 
2020, and that factor

660
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.109 
increased to 7.2,

661
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.989 
partly by the actual footprint

662
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.869 
of ICT going down and partly by identifying

663
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.559 
new areas where ICT can be used to improve

664
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.929 
and reduce emissions elsewhere.

665
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.489 
And the 2030

666
00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.549 
report has increased up to a factor of almost 10.

667
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.429 
So this is something that we should also bear in mind.

668
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.779 
ICT is not all

669
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.159 
the time what you think.

670
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.149 
Yes, it has got a

671
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.159 
carbon footprint comparable to the global

672
00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.779 
aviation industry,

673
00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.709 
the same carbon

674
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.919 
footprint as the global maritime industry.

675
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.259 
But it is. It can be used

676
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.849 
to reduce the world carbon

677
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:25.869 
footprint by an amount

678
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.909 
10 times based on carbon footprint.

679
00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.549 
And therefore, that is a positive message that we should

680
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.149 
be, I think

681
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.799 
sharing with people.

682
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.099 
Here

683
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.139 
are areas I'm not well aware on those.

684
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.499 
So in mobility, for example,

685
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.849 
ICT can help in manufacturing.

686
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.449 
It can help in agriculture, it can help in buildings,

687
00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.429 
in energy use.

688
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.459 
And therefore this is how many gigatons of CO2

689
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.749 
equivalent it can produce.

690
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.569 
And as mentioned, it is about almost

691
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.509 
10 times its own carbon footprint.

692
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.599 
So in terms of future directions, I'd like to

693
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.119 
advocate a number of areas, a lot of the work that is

694
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.059 
currently done. It looks at the operation of energy

695
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.619 
and how we can reduce it.

696
00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.299 
We have to look at the embodied

697
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.279 
energy as well. So a lot of

698
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.159 
the equipment that we have in our city

699
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.069 
has had a lot of energy that was used to manufacture

700
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.109 
it and that is embodied energy.

701
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.379 
And there is a lot of energy that is used in disposal

702
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:20.829 
of this

703
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.799 
equipment. And all of this have got

704
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.759 
to be included every

705
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.049 
time you optimize the network.

706
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.229 
So, for example, we found that for some elements

707
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.009 
of the ICT

708
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.919 
network, the embodied energy is equivalent

709
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.219 
of the

710
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.679 
energy that was used to manufacture this part of

711
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.629 
the network is equivalent to the

712
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.539 
operational energy that is used by those components over

713
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.459 
10 years. That means over the

714
00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.039 
lifetime of the network and therefore ignoring the

715
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.589 
embodied energy is not a very good idea.

716
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.899 
Intelligence everywhere we're seeing machine learning

717
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.839 
and AI and so on being used everywhere,

718
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.599 
and therefore a lot of work should be done on improving

719
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.279 
their energy efficiency

720
00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.059 
and

721
00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.109 
also using them

722
00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.789 
to improve energy

723
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.200 
efficiency elsewhere.

724
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.229 
There is a lot in terms of interplay between

725
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:07.729 
resilience and efficiency.

726
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.549 
In the recent pandemic, we saw that many of

727
00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:11.749 
the systems before the

728
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.549 
pandemic were driven to improve

729
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.129 
their efficiency, not only ICT, just make everything

730
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.259 
more efficient and functioning more efficient.

731
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.929 
Everything just arrives in time, gets manufactured and

732
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.839 
gets sent out. And this drives to do more and more

733
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.829 
efficiency usually comes at the expense of resilience.

734
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:30.529 
Under resilience usually means redundancy, and

735
00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.629 
redundancy means less efficiency.

736
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.659 
And but we need to weigh the two and

737
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.759 
we need to be aware of the

738
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.799 
need for resilience and not on the efficiency.

739
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.879 
And then also at the edge of the network

740
00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.809 
has now become even

741
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:45.709 
more important

742
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.659 
than it was always designed,

743
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.369 
with the aim of it

744
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.619 
not being resilient. So if the put in front of your

745
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.259 
house, it's got that, OK, you just have to wait.

746
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.229 
So and therefore reliability

747
00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.049 
is another angle that we always have got

748
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.029 
to consider with efficiency.

749
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.909 
There are a number of references hopefully that would

750
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.559 
be shared with you.

751
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.249 
And I'll

752
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.609 
just stop here and hopefully we can have

753
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:11.749 
more discussion,

754
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.629 
and I'm delighted that

755
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.159 
we have this opportunity.

756
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160 
Thank you.

757
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:23.359 
Yeah. Thank you very, very much for your talk.

758
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.239 
Of course, the slides will also be shared in the

759
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.479 
recording of this video, so everyone can then

760
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.729 
take a look in these publications and further

761
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.730 
information.

762
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.499 
Thank you very much. We'll now proceed with the QnA

763
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.859 
session. So every one of our participants,

764
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.739 
if you have a question, you can either ask or

765
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.739 
unmute yourself directly or raise your hand,

766
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.859 
or you can also type your questions in the chat so that

767
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.309 
we can then say it out loud.

768
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.779 
Just keep in mind, we're still recording.

769
00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.299 
So if you don't want to be recognized in the recording

770
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.879 
afterwards, then maybe leave your camera turned off.

771
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.139 
And so I have prepared the first question

772
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.869 
while the others might be still thinking.

773
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.899 
You have mentioned many of these, I

774
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.819 
EEE standards and you have also created some of those

775
00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.229 
yourself.

776
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.349 
Do you have some examples or do you know of any examples

777
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.720 
where these are being used in practice already?

778
00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.149 
Thank you so much for this question.

779
00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.969 
So many of those are still being developed

780
00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.129 
at present, but

781
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:27.939 
there are

782
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.279 
already elements that

783
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.299 
were developed

784
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.389 
with industrial partners and so on, and therefore

785
00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.189 
we hope to see them being used in those contexts.

786
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:38.649 
So, for example,

787
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.299 
1925 to 1929 came from

788
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.189 
the activities that were done

789
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.069 
Green Touch. And therefore we

790
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.665 
hope that there would be update.

791
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.539 
1922

792
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.679 
and so on we have

793
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.709 
put together quite a group of people

794
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.769 
from the power industry, from the ICT and so on.

795
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.259 
And that obviously just being approved now.

796
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.109 
So hopefully we'll see elements of real standard being

797
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.110 
used

798
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.369 
and the

799
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.429 
metrics in terms of energy efficiency

800
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.519 
and so on. We hope also to capture them

801
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.119 
in something a

802
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.999 
little bit broader within IEEE, the equivalent

803
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.719 
of maybe

804
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.159 
an energy star or something like

805
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.229 
that, rating.

806
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.289 
So it is a little bit early days, but

807
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.749 
we see very good signs, I think.

808
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.089 
Thank you very much for your answer.

809
00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.969 
I think Holger Karl is raising his hand, so I

810
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.519 
hope you are able to unmute yourselves now and then you

811
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.969 
can ask a question.

812
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.299 
I think so. Hello.

813
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.429 
Can you hear me? Yeah, OK.

814
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.239 
Thanks for unmuting. I'll keep the camera off my

815
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.010 
internet line is not so good.

816
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.889 
First of all, Hello! Thank you.

817
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.559 
It's fun to see somebody from Green Touch again.

818
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.929 
It was a long time ago, but was a very nice project.

819
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.100 
I also participated there.

820
00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.329 
My concrete question regards the idea

821
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.179 
of turning off servers and or routers and

822
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.649 
or base stations, etc.

823
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.679 
And any time I talk to people running actual

824
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.680 
infrastructure,

825
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.389 
they get their whites!

826
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.119 
The whites in their eyes starts popping out and they get

827
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.779 
afraid of

828
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.129 
operational stability,

829
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.649 
etc. And basically, it boils down to saying, "Yeah,

830
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.619 
maybe we can save a little bit of energy there, but the

831
00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.769 
operational stability, the risk involved

832
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.679 
with all of that is just simply not worth

833
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.619 
the potential marginal

834
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.869 
saving in energy cost".

835
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.289 
And also this much specifically when you talk about

836
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:38.259 
servers, data centres, you want to run them

837
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.659 
because they need to be busy all the time.

838
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.959 
If you have not enough workload, your data centre

839
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.689 
is too big and was ill-planned and goes badly, they

840
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.539 
mentioned. So do you really actually

841
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.539 
honestly see a chance to do any significant

842
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.569 
amount of turning the equipment off,

843
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:58.359 
given that it should be mentioned for the proper

844
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.269 
workload and that operational stability

845
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.089 
is really the key criteria

846
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.259 
there?

847
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.419 
Yeah, a very interesting question,

848
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.349 
and I think we

849
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:11.709 
had these kind of discussions quite extensively

850
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.419 
with operators and so on.

851
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.239 
And as you would appreciate many times when some

852
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.119 
of these more radical ideas come at the beginning,

853
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.099 
there is a little bit of hesitancy,

854
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.219 
hesitating to take it.

855
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.719 
But we see now

856
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.999 
and so many good features.

857
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.939 
So to start with, for example, some of

858
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.939 
the techniques that are used for energy

859
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.289 
efficiency do not

860
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.709 
involve, you know,

861
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.499 
turning things on and off and so on.

862
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.969 
So, for example, content

863
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.079 
caching

864
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.959 
does not involve that, so you would simply cache some

865
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.759 
content closer

866
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.439 
deciding where to

867
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.589 
build clouds and datacentres and so on does not involve

868
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.889 
that optimizing network topologies is not

869
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.679 
doing processing at the edge of the network instead of

870
00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.619 
doing it at the center also does not involve them.

871
00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.429 
But in terms

872
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.699 
of the actual substantial part of your questions,

873
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.649 
which is turning things on and off,

874
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:06.369 
I think people are

875
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.369 
now realizing that that is going to be part

876
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:12.489 
of the overall kind of picture

877
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:12.819 
that they

878
00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.089 
will have to live with. So we see a lot of intelligence

879
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:18.069 
being introduced in terms of, say, machine

880
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.629 
learning, etc.

881
00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:19.839 
And

882
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.479 
people are interested in things like self-deployment,

883
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.689 
deploying base stations, things that

884
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.539 
look like self-adjusting according

885
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.509 
to the traffic and so on, maybe

886
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:34.539 
also responding to the particular

887
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.909 
users and so on. And once you start introducing these

888
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.469 
forms of intelligence

889
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.849 
and adopting in that way, then

890
00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:43.179 
if you

891
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.649 
are adopting, say, for traffic

892
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.649 
or you're adopting for deployment or you're adopting for

893
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.619 
changes in the users, I mean, the applications

894
00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.509 
then adopting for

895
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:53.529 
power consumption can

896
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:57.489 
be another feature that can be included

897
00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.149 
in addition

898
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.579 
to these, also, we see

899
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.059 
in the

900
00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.010 
big data centers and so on,

901
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:05.589 
and

902
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.709 
may be first to the base stations, part of the drive

903
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.589 
for having this kind of intelligence and adaptation and

904
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.529 
so on. As you know, in 6G, part

905
00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.408 
of the vision anyway is having intelligence

906
00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:18.789 
everywhere.

907
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.799 
The reason for that is that the cells are becoming

908
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.968 
smaller

909
00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.888 
and therefore the dynamic behavior

910
00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.529 
within the cell becomes very large if you have a 500

911
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.589 
meter radius cell like in 4G.

912
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:29.859 
That is one story.

913
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.129 
By the

914
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:31.269 
time you get to

915
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.658 
maybe smaller cells with 50 meter radius or

916
00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:36.698 
10 or 20 meter radius,

917
00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:39.169 
then suddenly a cell may become very highly occupied,

918
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.408 
say, at lunchtime

919
00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:42.939 
or during congestion

920
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.959 
or something like that.

921
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.039 
And maybe less than an

922
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.988 
hour or half an hour later, it is totally

923
00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:48.789 
empty. And therefore

924
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.678 
adaptation has to be

925
00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.499 
part of the picture when you have the 500 meter

926
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.049 
radius or maybe larger.

927
00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:58.479 
Essentially, things outrage out and

928
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.569 
you, you have your loads and

929
00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.699 
everything, it's almost kind of constant.

930
00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.679 
Now you get to these small cells.

931
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.999 
Everything is so dynamic.

932
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.779 
So not

933
00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.029 
liking the dynamic part for

934
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.219 
energy efficiency was one story.

935
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.489 
Now it has to be dealt with because that is exactly

936
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.669 
how traffic and some varies.

937
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.919 
And therefore, you would have seen separating,

938
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.859 
say, the base station into elements and

939
00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:24.909 
remote radio head

940
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.409 
in 5G, then you have

941
00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.229 
got a central processing unit and distributed

942
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.419 
processing unit based on processing units

943
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.649 
being moved.

944
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.799 
All this notion of disaggregation, which then helps

945
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.639 
you with the dynamic

946
00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.519 
behavior and therefore adopting in a dynamic

947
00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.499 
way I think is becoming part of it.

948
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:41.769 
For

949
00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.770 
data centers,

950
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.499 
I think,

951
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.629 
seeing those new use cases and

952
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.919 
communication and

953
00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.249 
we are also seeing, I think something very different

954
00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.929 
operators used to be

955
00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:53.439 
network

956
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.379 
operators and data center operators used to be data

957
00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.479 
center operators. Now we're seeing a merger.

958
00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:58.989 
So many

959
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.059 
of the big kind of telecom

960
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.029 
companies, I think, are starting to act

961
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.179 
or starting to introduce the notion of

962
00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.579 
edge processing in their networks and therefore will

963
00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.249 
become also data center operators.

964
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.679 
And therefore, you start now seeing this kind of dynamic

965
00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.629 
behavior in data centers.

966
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.569 
So I hope this gives you an idea in terms of the

967
00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:22.509 
changing maybe landscape that people would have

968
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:24.309 
to react to, I think in the future.

969
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.769 
I think Holger, can you unmute yourself again if you

970
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.770 
want to or.

971
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.300 
You know, I think I can.

972
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.029 
I think I only partially agree with your answer,

973
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.999 
but I don't want to monopolize the conversation here.

974
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.829 
Let's pass the talking to somebody else.

975
00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.420 
Thanks.

976
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.409 
OK, sure. Yeah, thank you for your answer again, of

977
00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:53.229 
course. And so I will leave a bit

978
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:57.199 
of time if anyone else has a new question.

979
00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.009 
And of course, if you want to,

980
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.919 
you can also continue this conversation

981
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.279 
on the Clean-IT Forum.

982
00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.089 
So we have a big discussion section where

983
00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:10.389 
everyone is welcome to open a thread

984
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.909 
on something like these topics.

985
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.430 
So Maxim, and you have a question.

986
00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.369 
Yes, hello, everybody.

987
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.579 
So thank you again for this wonderful

988
00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.699 
talk about these many ways

989
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.460 
of optimizing cloud and fog computing.

990
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.379 
What is clean-IT forum is also about is thinking

991
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.709 
of how to maybe regulate

992
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.319 
such digital spheres, right?

993
00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.449 
So what is your impression?

994
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.269 
Is this kind of research,

995
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.329 
your research applied widely

996
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:48.709 
in the real world?

997
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.709 
Or do you feel that there is a necessity

998
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.919 
for policymakers to

999
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.459 
step in and also make recommendations

1000
00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.909 
to companies to adopt those standards?

1001
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.919 
Yeah, and it's an excellent point.

1002
00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.809 
I think leaving

1003
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.749 
things said to the market forces is

1004
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:11.770 
one aspect,

1005
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.609 
and having the

1006
00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:18.219 
intervention is another, and I think

1007
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.579 
it's part of this talk about sustainability.

1008
00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.929 
So sustainability is more than energy efficiency.

1009
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.899 
So what you see is that when

1010
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.829 
the energy prices are really high and things become

1011
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.179 
really expensive, people

1012
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.619 
look at energy

1013
00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.859 
efficiency and power usage and so on, more critical

1014
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.979 
and try to reduce their consumption.

1015
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.099 
And that goes a lot into the operational energy and ways

1016
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.239 
to reduce it.

1017
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.089 
Now where I think a lot more kind of

1018
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.749 
policy

1019
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.280 
and so on is needed

1020
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.479 
is in areas like embodied energy, for example, the

1021
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.329 
kind of energy you use for manufacturing and

1022
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:58.329 
so on. And therefore maybe ways that this can

1023
00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.509 
be reduced. Those emissions can be reduced, but also

1024
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.199 
where equipment

1025
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.069 
can be kind

1026
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:06.279 
of reused or repurposed for other

1027
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.949 
ways. Disposal energy is another

1028
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.830 
kind of part where may be more

1029
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.149 
kind

1030
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.769 
of policies needed.

1031
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.949 
Standardization cutting across, I think is essential

1032
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.569 
and we're seeing this you've gone beyond

1033
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.239 
IEEE people are taking this up.

1034
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.169 
So I think it is kind of a continued effort.

1035
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.279 
So you

1036
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.579 
need to do the work like

1037
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.509 
here it has been done,

1038
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.299 
introduce the standards and hopefully see compliance

1039
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.739 
with standards. But then

1040
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.139 
there will

1041
00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.009 
be elements, hopefully where policy can help

1042
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:40.719 
and should shape things more.

1043
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.199 
And Maxim I hope that gives you a good

1044
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.200 
idea.

1045
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.519 
Yeah, I hope that that answers the question.

1046
00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.759 
Very interesting, I think we have a little

1047
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.359 
more question in the chat.

1048
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.189 
So David Simon asks Do we really need

1049
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.799 
technologies like 5G or 6G?

1050
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.779 
In my eyes, it's a big step back.

1051
00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.829 
What do you think about that?

1052
00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.300 
Interesting, and I think

1053
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.429 
it depends on

1054
00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.939 
the sort of applications and so on.

1055
00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.009 
Maybe a bit of clarification on

1056
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.859 
why he thinks it is a step back and it's useful.

1057
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.099 
But essentially we saw

1058
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.529 
many elements that

1059
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:31.739 
are

1060
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.659 
driven by applications that are needed.

1061
00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.559 
So that has

1062
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.059 
been the kind of

1063
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.939 
drive in terms of data rates and so on all the

1064
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.829 
time. And we saw that

1065
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.619 
happening and up to 4G,

1066
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.739 
everything was about increasing data rates.

1067
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.069 
And suddenly we saw a new

1068
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:53.189 
kind of scenarios where IoT, for example, is needed

1069
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.889 
to make things like smart manufacturing, smart cities,

1070
00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:57.749 
smart transport and so on.

1071
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:58.919 
And therefore,

1072
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.349 
these were started to be introduced in

1073
00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:04.409 
5G, in addition to the high data rates.

1074
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.799 
And then we also saw new sets of applications coming

1075
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.549 
things in vehicular, for example,

1076
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.849 
where reliability becomes very important.

1077
00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:12.149 
If you

1078
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:15.179 
are watching a scene and the pedestrian, say, jumps

1079
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:15.689 
in front of

1080
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.849 
a car and you want to be able to react

1081
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.079 
and give a message quickly to

1082
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.959 
the vehicle, you need the reliability and you need

1083
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.309 
very low latency.

1084
00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:24.239 
If you're controlling

1085
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.209 
power plant, sorry, manufacturing plants

1086
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.079 
and so on, you

1087
00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.139 
need reliability and you need low latency.

1088
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.609 
And therefore this kind

1089
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:35.459 
of triangle in 5G was formed where

1090
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.079 
you still push the data rates.

1091
00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.929 
But now, because you have these applications

1092
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.609 
that requires a IoT

1093
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.549 
that require the reliability and low latency,

1094
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.619 
we need to look at

1095
00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.079 
new forms of technology beyond what 4G was

1096
00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.459 
able to do.

1097
00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.669 
In terms of do we also need 6G

1098
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.199 
and beyond and so on.

1099
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.209 
As you know, for

1100
00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.730 
people in this area, usually they would say that

1101
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.079 
the odd numbers in those generations

1102
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.899 
make the promises and the even numbers deliver the

1103
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.419 
promises.

1104
00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.469 
So we had the first

1105
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.829 
generation was on the log and it was all about just

1106
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:15.029 
talking and so on.

1107
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.849 
And the second generation of the GSM and

1108
00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.699 
so on actually introduced data and started delivering

1109
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.829 
on the mobile kind of

1110
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.769 
promise and started seeing mobile

1111
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.739 
go in a big way, 3G promise, all the big data

1112
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.669 
rates and so on.

1113
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:32.759 
4G developed it or delivered on it,

1114
00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.949 
hopefully to a good extent, 5G

1115
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.499 
promised all this kind of triangle of different things.

1116
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.029 
Hopefully, 6G will

1117
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.768 
build on that,

1118
00:42:40.769 --> 00:42:43.049 
deliver it but also that interview, say, AI and machine

1119
00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:43.379 
learning

1120
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.899 
and so on. But maybe if the

1121
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.509 
person who asked the question can just explain a little

1122
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.419 
bit more first if this answers

1123
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.419 
the point, but then also, why do they think

1124
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.429 
these new generations may not be needed?

1125
00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.979 
Yeah, so I think, of course, if

1126
00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.859 
you want to, you can hopefully unmute yourself if you

1127
00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.649 
want to explain your question yourself.

1128
00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:11.139 
Meanwhile, in the chat, there's been, I think, a little

1129
00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.049 
bit of explanation. So David said that

1130
00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:15.639 
5G needs much more cells.

1131
00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.519 
And however, Holger already

1132
00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.579 
responded that, that might not be true maybe.

1133
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.391 
So I think we have a kind of good two discussions

1134
00:43:24.392 --> 00:43:25.392 
here.

1135
00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:27.550 
Well then! Well then!

1136
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.600 
That's excellent!

1137
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.574 
OK, so,

1138
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:38.409 
of course, if you want to unmute yourself, David,

1139
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.349 
go ahead, but also you can, of course, as

1140
00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:44.169 
I already mentioned, continue the discussion

1141
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.879 
in the Clean-IT Forum.

1142
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.429 
You're very welcome to do that.

1143
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.279 
And I think Maximillian is also raising

1144
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.189 
his hands. So maybe then we

1145
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:55.659 
go ahead to the next question.

1146
00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:57.740 
And.

1147
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:02.790 
Yeah.

1148
00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.639 
You mentioned the renewable energy

1149
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.640 
study, two terms to compute

1150
00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.899 
where there's sunshine.

1151
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.959 
So how far is the dynamic pricing

1152
00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.049 
in the industry and how far

1153
00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:20.229 
is, how big is the range of the pricing

1154
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.089 
so that the big

1155
00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:25.089 
data centers are motivated to

1156
00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:26.349 
implement such

1157
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:27.699 
scheduling algorithms?

1158
00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:32.199 
That's a very interesting question.

1159
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.169 
So I guess there are

1160
00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:36.699 
two elements to this.

1161
00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.149 
First, down to the question about

1162
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.399 
policy or standards and so on.

1163
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:42.849 
If things

1164
00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:44.829 
were mandated

1165
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:45.819 
in terms of

1166
00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.659 
maybe a carbon footprint or carbon

1167
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.609 
with some kind

1168
00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:52.449 
of limit for

1169
00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.189 
companies and so on,

1170
00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.969 
then there will be a

1171
00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.209 
motivation other than the market forces.

1172
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.659 
And for example, we

1173
00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.849 
have BT in the U.K.

1174
00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:01.119 
and they

1175
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.309 
have been asked to reduce their carbon footprint through

1176
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.049 
legislation to

1177
00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.959 
reduce their carbon footprint by 80% and therefore they

1178
00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.059 
have to find ways to do it.

1179
00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.839 
So that's part of it.

1180
00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.549 
And the other

1181
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:15.549 
part is depends on the

1182
00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:16.239 
application.

1183
00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.309 
So there will be

1184
00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.579 
obviously cheaper forms of energy

1185
00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.219 
somewhere else. So for example, if there's a

1186
00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.029 
hydroelectric

1187
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.009 
dam, or maybe if you have

1188
00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:30.399 
got some of these very big wind farms,

1189
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:30.759 
you may

1190
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.380 
choose to migrate

1191
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.709 
workloads there.

1192
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.299 
If the part.

1193
00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.459 
The other part, I think that is interesting and the

1194
00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.773 
question is what are the techno-economics of

1195
00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:45.309 
this happening?

1196
00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.079 
So how

1197
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.309 
far does it be

1198
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:51.549 
or if you transmit data

1199
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:52.779 
to a remote data

1200
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.999 
center, then you will be using energy in the network

1201
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:55.899 
itself

1202
00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.729 
and therefore you're losing there.

1203
00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:00.999 
And maybe you save because the energy price

1204
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.699 
where the renewable energy is, it's much lower

1205
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.959 
and therefore

1206
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.629 
you save that. Now, I have not seen studies that

1207
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.359 
quantify things in this way, and I think this is a very

1208
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.519 
interesting point and a very interesting question that

1209
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.989 
you have raised.

1210
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.909 
And I think it can be quantified.

1211
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.639 
Now, one area which we did work

1212
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.639 
on was where should

1213
00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.879 
you build data centers? Meaning if I had the choice

1214
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.979 
from an energy efficiency point of view, not the

1215
00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.019 
economics, just the energy efficiency point of

1216
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.929 
view, of building the data center next

1217
00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.569 
to renewable energy or next

1218
00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.789 
to population, which one is better now?

1219
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:39.999 
If I build it next to renewable energy sources,

1220
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.269 
then I have to send the data to that data center

1221
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:45.789 
and therefore I lose energy in the network and you can

1222
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:47.889 
say I lose money also in the network

1223
00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:48.459 
to get to

1224
00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.189 
where the data center is, and we refer to that as bits

1225
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:54.159 
to energy. You move the bits to where the energy is.

1226
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:54.429 
And the

1227
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:55.629 
other alternative is

1228
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:57.579 
to build the data centers actually where

1229
00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.019 
people live and

1230
00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.459 
therefore transmit

1231
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.049 
energy from

1232
00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:03.999 
the wind farms in the sea or whatever

1233
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.819 
they are to where the data center

1234
00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:07.959 
and the people live.

1235
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.509 
And in this case, you lose energy in the electrical

1236
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:13.779 
transmission lines and we quantify how much energy you

1237
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.479 
lose in the electrical transmission lines.

1238
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.529 
And it then and we

1239
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.179 
refer to this as energy to bits.

1240
00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.609 
You move the energy to where the bits are.

1241
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:24.679 
And it turns out that actually it is cheaper to move

1242
00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.169 
the bits to where their energy is.

1243
00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:28.989 
So it is more energy

1244
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:32.049 
efficient to lose energy in the communication network

1245
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.539 
than in the electrical transmission lines.

1246
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.069 
And therefore it is.

1247
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.859 
And that was one of the first proofs that we have seen

1248
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.799 
that from an energy efficiency point of view, it is best

1249
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.309 
to build big data centers next to renewable energy

1250
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:46.779 
sources.

1251
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.519 
But the techno-economic

1252
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.699 
kind of studies, I have not seen those, but

1253
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.138 
I think they are very interesting to do.

1254
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:56.810 
Thank you.

1255
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.099 
OK, I think that I hope that answers

1256
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.389 
the question.

1257
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:07.299 
So I think we're going to wrap this one up

1258
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.789 
here. Thank you, everyone, for your questions.

1259
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:10.810 
Thank you for your talk.

1260
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:13.959 
Maybe as a last little question.

1261
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.989 
I want to ask what you are currently working on or

1262
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.869 
what are the next big steps on your projects or

1263
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:23.082 
in the ICT, Green ICT

1264
00:48:23.083 --> 00:48:24.083 
initiative are?

1265
00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.069 
So I try to

1266
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.169 
maybe quickly

1267
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.169 
headline some of those here, but yes, so there

1268
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.929 
are a number of areas, I think

1269
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:36.729 
the whole area of energy

1270
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:37.689 
efficiency we

1271
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:40.420 
have not dealt with that in a very good way.

1272
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.829 
The more cynical parts, they said that

1273
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.989 
the point when industry was

1274
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:48.579 
putting it at the forefront of the

1275
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.699 
agenda in song, the whole world stage

1276
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.529 
was focusing on energy.

1277
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.299 
The prices of energy were so high

1278
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.209 
they went down. But we have a finite amount of energy

1279
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.479 
and therefore prices probably would go up again.

1280
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.709 
And therefore, that

1281
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:04.089 
is a problem that stays with us.

1282
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:06.879 
We also have one planet earth, there is nowhere else

1283
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.679 
where we can live, at least now,

1284
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.239 
and therefore we really need to

1285
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.569 
take care of it. So that is another kind of cultivation.

1286
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.279 
And therefore, from a kind of

1287
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.429 
a practical thing for people working in ICT, working

1288
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.159 
in research, working in deployments and so on.

1289
00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.369 
I would first invite people not to focus on operational

1290
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:27.099 
energy on this. So every time you design servers, you

1291
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.949 
design communication networks, you optimize them.

1292
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.349 
Every time you write the cost function, the mathematical

1293
00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:34.659 
cost function, don't write it only in terms of

1294
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.939 
operational energy. Please include those embodied

1295
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.029 
energy. Please include disposal, energy and so on.

1296
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.189 
And then that may mean that the shape of the

1297
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.479 
network or the design of the

1298
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.539 
network may look different.

1299
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:48.909 
And another area that is very important

1300
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:49.629 
that is happening

1301
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.719 
in a big way is machine learning and so on.

1302
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.989 
So you would have seen examples from groups,

1303
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:57.939 
different research groups around the world that have

1304
00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.829 
published their results, saying that

1305
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.780 
training one deep neural network

1306
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.219 
produces the same amount of emissions as five vehicles

1307
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.679 
over the lifetime of those five vehicles

1308
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.769 
and therefore we'll get into an area where

1309
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:12.069 
people

1310
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.109 
are thinking more and more of these deep

1311
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.539 
learning and the amount

1312
00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.609 
of emission, especially in the training phase, can

1313
00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:19.599 
be huge.

1314
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.909 
And the question is how much of this do we need?

1315
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.079 
Can we revisit that

1316
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.219 
area of machine learning

1317
00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.959 
and focus on energy efficiency and so

1318
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.049 
on. And if we're able to learn about

1319
00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.150 
networks using efficiency,

1320
00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.209 
sorry, machine learning, AI etc.

1321
00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.969 
and are able to adapt the network

1322
00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:39.459 
according to what is required, I think that is another

1323
00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.219 
very hot area that people should look at.

1324
00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:42.549 
And one

1325
00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:45.009 
of the lessons I mentioned that we learned from the

1326
00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:46.360 
recent pandemic is that

1327
00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:48.069 
we should

1328
00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:50.949 
not just be running after efficiency all the time,

1329
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:53.659 
we should really be looking at resilience as well.

1330
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:56.619 
And I think that is a very important area.

1331
00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.739 
We saw everything almost designed to maximize efficiency

1332
00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.849 
to the limit, which is great

1333
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.589 
when the whole

1334
00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:04.659 
kind of system is working fine.

1335
00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.959 
When you start having these kinds of big events,

1336
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.489 
then everything can

1337
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:11.590 
collapse because you just made it

1338
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:14.709 
so that there is no redundancy at all.

1339
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:16.539 
Efficiency is maximized

1340
00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.679 
and

1341
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.689 
it may still be the best thing to do.

1342
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:22.569 
I do not know, but I think we have to look at

1343
00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.759 
the kind of interplay of the two.

1344
00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.459 
So I hope this gives you an idea about some of maybe the

1345
00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.159 
important areas, at least the way I see them into the

1346
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.160 
future.

1347
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:35.429 
Yeah, thank you very much. I think especially the first

1348
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:37.889 
point you mentioned that the cost function should

1349
00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.379 
include all the costs.

1350
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.090 
This is very important and may not be overlooked.

1351
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:46.019 
OK, so thank you for all your answers and for your

1352
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.669 
presentation.

1353
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:49.949 
I will quickly share my screen for the end,

1354
00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:52.530 
which is right here.

1355
00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.609 
So the next live talk is going

1356
00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.459 
to be, I hope I can move to the

1357
00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.539 
next slide right now.

1358
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.309 
Yeah! So the next live talk is going to be at the

1359
00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:08.219 
25th of October, so in around four

1360
00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.729 
weeks again, as always on Monday at 12

1361
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:14.649 
pm and our next guest will be Jens

1362
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:17.549 
GrÃ¶ger, who has been working

1363
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.429 
on standards for the Blue Angel, which is

1364
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:23.849 
an eco-label in Germany, and they've been working on

1365
00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:27.019 
a way to certify its software as sustainable.

1366
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:30.179

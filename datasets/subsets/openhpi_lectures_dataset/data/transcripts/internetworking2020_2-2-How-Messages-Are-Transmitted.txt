00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.760 
In our openhpi course "A
Half Century of Internet"

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.350 
we now want to see how messages
are transmitted and we want

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.060 
to consider the role
of bits in them.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.060 
Characteristic for all kind of a work
with computer are binary data.

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500 
So information and data
need to be encoded

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.740 
in bit strings, in sequences
of bits; bit is zero or one.

7
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.740 
So is it smart devices
computer can process them.

8
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.210 
The smart devices and computers
can process and exchange texts,

9
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.880 
pictures, videos, audio whatever
but only if this information are

10
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.910 
binary encoded and
binary encoded means

11
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.690 
encoded with
zeroes and ones.

12
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
We will see why we need
this binary encoding.

13
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.230 
Of course the encoding must be standardized,
so that everyone involved can understand

14
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.330 
the coded text if

15
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.760 
from one computer a photo is
sent to another computer and

16
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.370 
this photo is
encoded binary

17
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.170 
then of course the receiver and the
receiver system need to understand

18
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.460 
how the translation from the binary
string, from the sequence of zero ones

19
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.840 
into a photo needs
to be done.

20
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.750 
This exactly meet standardization the
systems in this exchange process.

21
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.020 
They need to know how to interbreed,
how to encode this binary strings.

22
00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.390 
This binary encoding is not only
needed for processing a task in

23
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.260 
smart devices it's also needed for the
transmission of the information.

24
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.420 
So it is very important to
understand this when we

25
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.630 
look to a binary to
computer networks.

26
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.880 
What is a bit? A bit is the smallest
possible unit of information

27
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.520 
that smart devices and
computers can distinguish.

28
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.170 
So a bit is a word
formed by binary digit

29
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.360 
so it's a name for
a binary number.

30
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:47.460 
So as the only two characters we have
to encode messages, videos, images

31
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.400 
are zero and one. And the reason this
we can simply interpret zero and one.

32
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.580 
So we can say one stands
for yes zero for no

33
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.850 
and when we want to transform
it in signals we can say one

34
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.930 
is light signal and zero is no
light, or one is electrical

35
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.770 
signal and zero is no
electrical signal.

36
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.060 
So in this way the information,
the bit can be transformed in

37
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.900 
a physical easily transformed
into physical signal and with

38
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.400 
the physical signals
they can be

39
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.590 
computed in chips, they can be
transmitted over networks.

40
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.280 
So here we have sender and receiver
and the receiver can see

41
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.730 
what kind of information is sent
to me, he can see: Oh, there

42
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:59.050 
is a sequence of zero and one;
light- one, zero- no one, and then

43
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.400 
knowing the encoding description
the receiver can get back

44
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.500 
the information behind this information
of signals, this sequence of signals.

45
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.830 
So this is important for the work of the
computers and smart devices themselves.

46
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.490 
We have circuits, we have processor
motherboards and also are working

47
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.540 
with electrical
signals,

48
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:40.010 
signal stands for one, no
signal stands for zero.

49
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.880 
And we have the cable, and over
the cable signals can physical

50
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.540 
signals can be transported and
electrical signal, so as a receiver

51
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.090 
system can see its one or no electrical
information receiver system

52
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.010 
can say no is zero.

53
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.610 
And of course we can also do this
with the air with radio in

54
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.860 
wireless LAN and
digital radio.

55
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.170 
The physical signals light
on light off or electrical

56
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.910 
on or off, we have such kind
of signal characteristics.

57
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.720 
And then the systems need to
scan this signals. And you see

58
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.120 
if systems can in this situation
then an encoding of a one

59
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.590 
and if signal scans in this
situation there is a zero.

60
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:49.310 
When we see the zeros are blue, the
ones are yellow, in this way the

61
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.390 
sender and receiver systems
have a common language

62
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.750 
where they can encode
the information.

63
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.650 
When the scanning is done
here in that situation,

64
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.690 
then it's not clear, is this for
a signal or it is no signal.

65
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.970 
So it is very important

66
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.000 
to make clear what kind of signal,
what kind of bit is transmitted.

67
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.450 
Next point considering
computer networks,

68
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:31.500 
is the line code. And line code
defiance in digital data transmission

69
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.010 
how a signal is transmitted
on the physical layer

70
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.420 
in form of a
physical signal.

71
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.450 
So there is an assignment. So
a certain level of sequence

72
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:50.470 
so an individual bit sequence
by the light intensity if its

73
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.510 
light cable or in
electrical cables voltage

74
00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:01.280 
and over this sequence the
information with this sequence

75
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.610 
the information
is encoded.

76
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.150 
So the main task of line coding is
shape the signal to be transmitted

77
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:16.350 
so that it's optimally adapted to the properties
of the corresponding transmission media,

78
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:23.710 
so that for the receiver system its very
clear was this a signal that shows me

79
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.050 
that there was a one information
sent or is this a signal that

80
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.190 
exactly says me there was
a zero transmitted.

81
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.190 
So to give one example
of such a network,

82
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:44.220 
I already mentioned the most important
technology used in the internet

83
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:50.390 
is the so called ethernet, the technology.
And ethernet is a technology

84
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.810 
for local area networks and the
characteristic the properties

85
00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.500 
of such ethernet is that they
share transmission cable.

86
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:07.080 
There's not a situation that two
systems exactly are connected

87
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.680 
and another system
is then connected.

88
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.920 
Here with the ethernet
we have many systems

89
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.110 
and they use

90
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:26.910 
common cable together for the common
infrastructure a connecting infrastructure

91
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.230 
together for exchanging
the information.

92
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.600 
Second characteristic is
that in a certain moment

93
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.580 
because the
infrastructure

94
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.180 
cable infrastructure
is used together

95
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.930 
only one of the connected system
can send an information.

96
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:55.400 
So each system need to listen to
this connecting network whether

97
00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.260 
another system is sending a
transmitting information

98
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:07.130 
then it's not allowed and has to wait
up to the moment the network is free

99
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.700 
for then sending
information.

100
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:16.220 
They need some mechanism to control
this that is CSMA and CD.

101
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.530 
We will speak in more
detail later about this.

102
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.180 
So the sender must
make the beginning

103
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:31.930 
and the end of a transmission
visible, understandable

104
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:36.500 
better to say for the other systems
connected to the network.

105
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.950 
So the receiver must
scan the right rhythm

106
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:47.370 
in which information is sent to
get the information to get the

107
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.920 
ones and zeros in the
right sequence.

108
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.850 
So it's important that
the system clock

109
00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:02.240 
for all the connected system is synchronized,
so that the receiver exactly know

110
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.780 
when the sending of an information
is started and when not.

111
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:15.600 
The next question is what to say about
the amount of data that can be sent.

112
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.430 
And this is a
question how we

113
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:26.120 
measure the size of an information
in the size of storage we can use

114
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.480 
to store information.

115
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.860 
So let's ask the question, someone
buy a computer, a laptop

116
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.810 
with 500 GB hard drive

117
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.970 
but when this person
turn on his computer

118
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:49.490 
he or she sees that
there is only 466 GB.

119
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.210 
What happened here? What is the
problem? And the problem is

120
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.260 
involved in the unit

121
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.740 
of measurement and in the
abbreviation of this.

122
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:10.080 
You remember one bit was a small
type of information and eight bit

123
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.100 
are connected
to one byte

124
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.100 
often described
as a b and a B.

125
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:26.100 
And if we have a byte and we can say kilobyte,
megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte, exabyte

126
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.920 
as you like but this of course
is done in the decimal system.

127
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:39.090 
So now the question we asked here
depends that we can measure

128
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.110 
in a decimal
interpretation of the

129
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.990 
prefix kilo and we could do it
in a binary interpretation.

130
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.500 
What is correct? One kilobyte
is a thousand bytes

131
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.340 
or is one kilobyte thousand
twenty four bytes?

132
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:07.140 
So both is correct but in both case
they are different interpretation

133
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:15.210 
whether kilo is counted a thousand
or whether kilo is counted as

134
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:22.350 
to the tens. And if we have a closer
look to this we see that there are

135
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.320 
differences, so
thousand byte

136
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:32.430 
equals to ten whole three byte, so
this is one kilo in the typical

137
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:39.390 
interpretation is one kilobyte
according to the SI unit system.

138
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:45.030 
SI is the international system
of units which is defined and

139
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:50.060 
then we have here to see it ten to
the three is kilo, ten to the six

140
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.530 
is mega, ten to the nine as giga, ten to
the twelve is tera, to fifteen is peta

141
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.320 
so this is the decimal
interpretation.

142
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:06.100 
But we can also interpret it as
that a thousand twenty four

143
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.020 
bytes is two to
the ten byte.

144
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:17.080 
And if you look very close then this
is not kilo, this is Kibi byte

145
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:23.980 
two to the ten byte is called a
kibi byte according to the IEC

146
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.460 
measurements, the International
Electrotechnical Commission

147
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.060 
and then we see two to the tens, two
thousand twenty four is a kibi

148
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:39.010 
then Mebi, Gibi,
Tebi, Pebi.

149
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.410 
You see there are
differences,

150
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.440 
bigger and bigger, so
higher the potential is.

151
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.500 
So when we look to such for example
announcement of a description of a laptop

152
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:03.050 
we have failed to understand do
they describe this in a hard disk

153
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:08.130 
in kilo in the decimal system
or in the binary system.

154
00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.870 
So when we interpret the five hundred
gigabits that was the amount

155
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.030 
this was the size of the hard disk
in the laptop in our example

156
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.550 
in this five hundred multiply
thousand times thousand times byte

157
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:27.140 
so it's exactly five
hundred billion bytes.

158
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:32.560 
If we interpret this five on
its gigabyte as five hundred

159
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:39.140 
thousand divided by thousand
twenty four times thousands

160
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.340 
divide by two thousand twenty
times thousand divided by twenty

161
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:50.470 
this is GiB, then we reach
four hundred sixty five

162
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.030 
billion bytes. So

163
00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:02.870 
it's true, so five hundred
GB drive has only 466 GiB.

164
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.150 
So many operational systems
because all the information is

165
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.000 
binary encoded
calculated in Kibi,

166
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.840 
Mebi, GiBibyte but names
as kilo, mega, giga.

167
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.790 
It's not correct but
it's common practice.

168
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.510 
So in this course we
stick to the definition

169
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.870 
that thousand bytes
is one kilobyte

170
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.790 
in decimal system and ten
thousand twenty four byte

171
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.510 
it's one Kibibyte.

172
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:50.900 
These are some basics of the
coding and size of information

173
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:57.540 
transported within computer
networks. In the next clips we

174
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.340 
will have a closer look how this
communication is organised.

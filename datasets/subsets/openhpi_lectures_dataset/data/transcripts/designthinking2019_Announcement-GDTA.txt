You learned already about the Global
Design-Thinking alliance the GDT ,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.450

event which will be happening

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.680 
on August 8th and 9th in New
York, it's a fabulous place

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.740

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.100 
staying or living in Germany
to attend and it's

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.140 
a two-day conference hosted by HPI and
Global Design-Thinking Alliance.

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.090 
And it's focusing on
lifelong learning

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.790 
in times of digital transformation.
And we would love to see

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.230

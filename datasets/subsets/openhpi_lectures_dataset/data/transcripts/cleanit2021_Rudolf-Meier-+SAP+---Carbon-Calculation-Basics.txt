00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.140 
Hello everyone, welcome back to our Clean-IT Open Exchange meeting.

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.600 
My name is Nils König and I'm as always here today with Sophie

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.350 
and Max from the HPI Student's Sustainability Club and the Clean IT.

4
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.910 
Today's guest is Rudolf Meier. Rudolf Meier is the head

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.570 
of performance and scalability in product engineering at SAP.

6
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.450 
He joined SAP in two thousand and four and has been engaged

7
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.010 
in performance scalability, benchmarking and sustainability

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.360 
topics there ever since.

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.900 
Also he holds an experimental physics postgraduate degree from

10
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.040 
the university of Tübingen.

11
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.970 
In the clean IT initiative, we often talk about the carbon

12
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.380 
footprint of digitalization and software, and especially how

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.410 
it has been rapidly growing over the past decades.

14
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.680 
However in order to fully understand this problem, and also

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.670 
to find and compare different solutions, we first need a way to

16
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.320 
calculate the carbon footprint of, for example operating software.

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.710 
And that is exactly what we're going to talk about in today's

18
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.980 
talk on Carbon Calculation Basics.

19
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.920 
Welcome Rudolf Meier.

20
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.790 
Thanks a lot Nils for the introduction. It's very nice to be with you here

21
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.240 
for this open exchange. I hope you are all doing well

22
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.220 
and I will push it off with a recap of my Clean IT contribution

23
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.410 
on carbon calculation basics. But before I start into that, let me

24
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.480 
give a bit of context. In this time of

25
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.890 
climate action, we all have to look for how to make our life more sustainable

26
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.570 
and a digital technologies that's one way to do it. Our digital

27
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.110 
technologies have already started to contribute and the example

28
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.440 
which is on everybody's mind is just in front of us, that's a communication technologies.

29
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.460 
So during the pandemic,

30
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.330 
work went on in home office and

31
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.140 
communication technologies enabled us to do that, and at the same time

32
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.250 
the commute and travel emissions significantly went down. So

33
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.690 
here we have some contribution. It's maybe not always to our

34
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.670 
liking so it would be also nicer for me maybe to sit in

35
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.600 
together with the hosts in one room, but I think that's a

36
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.160 
common thing that we will see that not everything which

37
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.440 
we have to do to save the planet will be to our liking.

38
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.320 
Ok so now technology teaches technologies can of course do much more

39
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.970 
and me coming from SAP, of course one of the things which we

40
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.100 
can do is optimize processes. Now that's starting from optimizing manufacturing,

41
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.080 


42
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.120 
transportation management or the circular economy.

43
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.660 
There are lots of possibilities. There's also the topic of transparency. So

44
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.410 
software digital technologies can give us transparency on the carbon footprint

45
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.890 
organizations and enterprises, of course in the real world and having

46
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.730 
transparency of course gives an opportunity to compare, to have competition and ultimately

47
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.960 
get optimization in that direction.

48
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.480 
But of course we have to make sure that the underlying software systems

49
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.430 
are designed in a way that we

50
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.660 
do this efficiently, that we use our resources in a way that is

51
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.350 
good for the environment, that we need to use a minimum of resources for that.

52
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.080 
And this in particular of course calls for sustainable programming.

53
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.630 
But before we go there let's first try to get a basic understanding

54
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.260 
how running software connects to energy consumption and carbon

55
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.010 
emission. So let me start. So I should share my screen.

56
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
See I get this right?

57
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.610 
Can you see my screen? Yes.

58
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.010 
Ok perfect. Then let's go into a little bit of

59
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.870 
let me get rid of this, a fun warm up. Now that somewhat

60
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.270 
what I want to do is a Back-of-an-envelope calculation, how

61
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.860 
do we get from compute to energy and co two just to kick it off.

62
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.960 
Now and the question we want to ask and answer is, what is one

63
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
CPU second in electric energy consumption in kilowatt hours,

64
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.840 
and emissions in kilogram of co two. I like these back of an

65
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.480 
envelope calculations as

66
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.250 
originally I'm an experimental physicist, that we do that all the time.

67
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.890 
It's very nice to get the lay of the land, but please be warned

68
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.440 
there will be lots of assumptions or quite some assumptions.

69
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.660 
So don't expect an exact result. It will be more like an order

70
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.290 
of magnitude which we get for that.

71
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.260 
So what do we do. First we get some idea of what one kilowatt

72
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.160 
hour is. That's really easy. These days with all the electric

73
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.760 
cars because this is something which moves your electric car by five kilometers.

74
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.130 
So what's the carbon emission connected with that. That's a

75
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.100 
bit more complicated because of it depends on how you generate your electric energy.

76
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.570 
For simplicity, I here just assume the world energy mix. Of course,

77
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.470 
this can be very different. Either if you catch with the wind

78
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.770 
or if you burn coal will be different but the world energy mix is about

79
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.430 
half a kilogram of co two per kilowatt hour.

80
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.660 
So we have some idea of how to calculate that. Now to get to

81
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.540 
the CPU second, we have to pick a typical our server CPU, so

82
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.480 
I'll stick with server CPU and here I picked an example. This is

83
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.010 
picked the right way so that the numbers come out easy, so we have a

84
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.600 
realistic what we have here for our present day

85
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:30.010 
hardware. We have hundred fifty watts for a CPU with forty two threads

86
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.250 
which would give us three dot six

87
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.470 
watts per thread and then ok to get to the energy, we say

88
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.530 
oh we use this thread for one hour, that would be three dot six watt hours.

89
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.460 
Now and this would be three dot six thousands of a kilowatt hour in energy.

90
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.870 
And then we want to go for the CPU second, so we just have to divide

91
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.930 
this amount of energy for one hour by three thousand six hundred.

92
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.450 
So we end up at the very nice little number of one

93
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.210 
millionth of a kilowatt hour per second.

94
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.020 
And of course with the assumption appear we can translate that

95
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.850 
to the corresponding carbon emission.

96
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.250 
Would be half a millionth of a kilogram, so

97
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.990 
of co two and we are arriving at all rule of thumb CPU second

98
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:31.450 
corresponds to one millionth at our in energy and half a milligram of co two.

99
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.610 
Just to make this a little bit more tangible with the co two

100
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.720 
water half a milligram of co two if you run this thread for

101
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.300 
an hour, we have produced a liter of co two approximately. That's

102
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.730 
what you have for that.

103
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.710 
Now you can play similar games with other resources, for example with memory

104
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.380 
and then you can end up with one gigabyte of memory

105
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.270 
using use one gigabyte of memory for one second corresponds two

106
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.550 
point one miliwatt hours in energy and of course the watts of the equivalent

107
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.500 
amount of co two produced.

108
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.110 
Now of course with numbers like that, one can immediately go

109
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.160 
in the direction of what to do for sustainable programming

110
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.340 
and what jumps into the eye immediately here is that one could

111
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.100 
imagine yeah let's save one thread of CPU

112
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.770 
by just using one gigabyte of memory in addition,

113
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.390 
and that would with these numbers

114
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.700 
have a factor of ten energy saving connected with it, and that's

115
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:42.180 
of course also the metric which is behind caching, buffering, indexing

116
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.870 
which we can have in sustainable programming to support us in

117
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:53.410 
saving resources. But today we are not going to go deeper in

118
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.790 
sustainable programming unless you want to go that direction.

119
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.740 
What I want to do is go from the microscopic here from the

120
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.880 
CPU second what does it mean to operating software in data center.

121
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.050 
That's where I come to

122
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.180 
a recap of the slides which are used for my contribution to the Clean IT

123
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.940 
forum and there we start with just setting

124
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.750 
the stage. Yeah, what are we going to look at, and that's

125
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.160 
what are the contributions to carbon footprint.

126
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.870 
I just mentioned a few on the side it's all symbolic because

127
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.120 
depends a lot on how you produce your energy or generate

128
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.380 
your energy in each case but what you have here as

129
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.870 
you have manufacturing which comes in transportation, comes in

130
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.770 
operation, comes in that's the one which we are going to look at and others.

131
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.190 
If you want to go deep here, this is an own science. Just a

132
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.520 
search for greenhouse gas protocol for this and you will find

133
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.820 
all the possible contributions which come in here. What I want

134
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.480 
to focus on is what we directly see in operation. So this

135
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.920 
operations the slice

136
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.860 
and what is contained in that operations the slice that is the

137
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.470 
consumption of IT equipment in the first place at the direct consumption.

138
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.070 
So we have compute storage service resources, we have CPU memory disk

139
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.540 
network which contributes to spending

140
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.260 
electric energy, and of course there's indirect consumption

141
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.180 
because the data center doesn't just have this inter infrastructure,

142
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.200 
but also cooling, lighting and other things.

143
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.810 
Now in my contribution I had a four-step

144
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.700 
approach here. The first two steps are actually small steps

145
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.430 
because they just introduce important quantities, we'll go over that quickly

146
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.540 
and then the third step that's the one where I was focusing

147
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:16.210 
on most how do we get from business requirements that someone

148
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.270 
knows what to do in in a company, what processes to run to,

149
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.000 
a prediction for the carbon footprint of the hardware which is running

150
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.330 
behind that. And in the fourth step we see how this order evolves into the cloud.

151
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.910 
Ok let me just do these first two steps

152
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.650 
briefly. For the first step, we assume that we have exclusive data center usage

153
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:46.880 
so we know how much data center electric energy we spent for, or software

154
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.030 
that is just measured, or

155
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.390 
we will know that and then how do we get to the

156
00:11:53.870 --> 00:12:00.220 
carbon emissions that's a by the way of the carbon emission intensity,

157
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.450 
carbon emission intensity

158
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.780 
to be multiplied with the total energy which is measured

159
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.510 
and gives us the carbon footprint.

160
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.170 
I already gave a number for that in my warm up but normally

161
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.480 
this is something which you will

162
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.870 
get provided from your electricity provider, and here again the

163
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.710 
global average four hundred seventy five grams per kilowatt hours,

164
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:31.250 
and just a side note in SAP data centres we have

165
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:37.160 
zero grams per kilowatt hour by use of hundred percent renewable electricity.

166
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.400 
Okay so first quantity which is important

167
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:46.580 
CEI and second one now we make it a little bit more realistic

168
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.070 
we don't have the complete data center available for

169
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.680 
our software test, we just have dedicated hardware, and the question

170
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.680 
is how do we get from the electric energy consumption of the

171
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:04.300 
dedicated hardware. Eraw to the carbon footprint and that's

172
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.700 
a two step process now. Our first we have to use a factor which is

173
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.650 
called power usage effectiveness at the

174
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.720 
number which is specific to the data center you're running and

175
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.950 
you multiply your Eraw energy get the total energy and then

176
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.930 
the next step of courses as the same as before

177
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.730 
to get the carbon footprint. This and multiply it by the carbon

178
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.560 
emission intensity of your electricity provider.

179
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.950 
Okay this PUE is a very interesting quantity because it describes

180
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.990 
how efficiently a data center uses energy just

181
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:51.440 
as the ratio of total facility energy over IT equipment energy and

182
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.100 
maybe this is a bit too short. There is a standard on how to calculate it.

183
00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.270 
So in the details of course that's not as easy as I put it

184
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.320 
here. One has to do something but it's well

185
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:08.770 
defined of what we have here. What's a typical number here.

186
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.610 
Typical values are around one dot five I write here. But there

187
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.720 
are better values also. There are big data centres

188
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.150 
which publish numbers down to one dot two or one dot one. Tbere's

189
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.640 
a lot of effort going into getting this

190
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.120 
additional energy down, which is beyond the pure IT

191
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.680 
equipment energy.

192
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.110 
Okay so that was just the preliminary steps

193
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:47.410 
which we do and now we come to the main step and the main step is

194
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.500 
how do we get from business requirements to carbon footprint?

195
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:59.030 
Now for this we use something which we have in place for a long time at SAP

196
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.890 
and that is simply if you know your business requirements, a

197
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.550 
customer comes in the traditional on-premise business, a customer

198
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.140 
comes and asks what's the hardware I have to buy for that. So

199
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.170 
that's the first step- translating business to hardware requirements

200
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:22.720 
and here we have a sizing procedure which is available here so business requirements

201
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:27.900 
can be a lot of things. There you could ask how many sales orders

202
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.870 
do I want to

203
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.640 
process, what do I want to do in logistics, in manufacturing.

204
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.940 
So there are lots of processes which could be involved here and

205
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.950 
if I know what the the sizes are, the throughput which I expect

206
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:50.830 
and if I also can specify a profile, yeah so I will have a peak hour

207
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.540 
of so and so many

208
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.000 
users running in parallel with that kind of

209
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.360 
a business process.

210
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:05.980 
Then I can put this into a questionnaire, which is provided by

211
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.490 
the quick sizer. So the link to the quick sizer I think in the

212
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.580 
original contribution

213
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.910 
and this returns some

214
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:22.250 
numbers for the hardware requirements. So memory and disk we understand immediately.

215
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:27.130 
Saps you might not understand immediately. This is a specific

216
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.170 
compute power

217
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.410 
evaluation number which is provided from

218
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.890 
SAP through the SAP benchmarks. So there's the SAP benchmark which

219
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.470 
is run by hardware partners,

220
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:49.390 
and they have then afterwards a number which specifies for usage with

221
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.750 
SAP software how strong is that

222
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:58.660 
hardware in terms of compute. So there's a lots of benchmarks

223
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:04.070 
being run by all different hardware partners also by by hyper scalers.

224
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.820 
And then one can from this define

225
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:14.270 
the amount of or that the typical hardware which is needed

226
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.710 
for the result which we get from the quick sizer. So the quick size specifies

227
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:22.910 
hundred thousand SAPs then we go here and check what hardware

228
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.790 
has a hundred thousand saps and that's the hardware selection and

229
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.640 
then we are ready with

230
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.100 
the hardware requirements. So I just talked about computer but of course memory

231
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.550 
disk network also are going into the hardware selection.

232
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:45.560 
So if you have the hardware selection ready, then you can also

233
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:50.200 
predict what this or estimate what this should

234
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.740 
be in the

235
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.830 
carbon footprint. So first you go to the hardware partners, you

236
00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.450 
get the power specification for the hardware, from

237
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:05.610 
the power specification will specify what's the load you will

238
00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:12.490 
get, ideal you will get a better at high load or at maximum load and then you

239
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:21.030 
put in the load profile which you will get out also as a sizing result.

240
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.140 
You have some hardware load power relation

241
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.860 
which of course depends on the specific hardware also on the mix of

242
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.480 
cpu and memory which you have to run and then

243
00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.910 
you finally you go here to the

244
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.500 
final calculation where

245
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.280 
with the energy of the raw energy which you get out of this calculation, you go

246
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.590 
and multiply it by the two factors which we mentioned at the beginning,

247
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.310 
and you end up in your carbon footprint.

248
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:56.460 
So now in the contribution of course there is somewhat details

249
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.340 
on how we do the sizing and where to find

250
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:04.600 
or the sizing resources which we have at SAP for business

251
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.630 
there, and then we also had

252
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.700 
an example. I think that was an example where

253
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:19.830 
we just said, okay we get out of the quick sizer, we get a midsized server

254
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.420 
with four socket and three terabyte was

255
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.270 
approximately what we

256
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.260 
got out. So that has a certain capability and running the business

257
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.150 
and then we see what the full power load is. We check what the

258
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.950 
average load is at the

259
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:45.210 
load profile and then we get out a number for the full year

260
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.420 
for the operation here,

261
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.470 
including the PUE and then of course using

262
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:56.420 
a CEI that would be six dot two tons of co two.

263
00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.760 
Now of course this is, you can say this is easy. We own the hardware and we

264
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:07.320 
put it on there, we can also afterwards measure now that's here we predict

265
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.190 
the energy which will be taken and

266
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:19.180 
what we can also in principle measure if he owned this so for on premise

267
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.390 
that's a very simple procedure to do.

268
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.120 
If you look at the details, it's maybe not always

269
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.280 
so simple, but the path is

270
00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:36.040 
is right so it's a question what changes if we go into the cloud.

271
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:41.040 
Actually in terms of the calculation for the

272
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:45.310 
owner of the cloud, is not so much that changes. It's just that

273
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:50.160 
there are some things which improve quite a bit if you go into the cloud,

274
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:55.440 
and that's the two things which I want to mention for the cloud.

275
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.750 
First we have the advantage of scale there.

276
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:03.060 
So not everybody is bringing their own resources, their own hardware

277
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:10.500 
with so we have the possibility of sharing the resources. So

278
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.710 
we can get a much higher, more uniform utilisation are in the systems.

279
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.100 
And that results in a net energy saving for

280
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.860 
the service consumers. And of course if you go into the cloud

281
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.710 
that and you have also the advantage of choice

282
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.910 
with respect to a carbon footprint. So for example in the SAP

283
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:39.790 
cloud to the carbon footprint is zero by use of hundred percent renewable electricity.

284
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.390 
Okay so this I wanted to kick it off, and

285
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.780 
please no take over again

286
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.820 
moderators and then we will go into the Q and A.

287
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.490 
Yeah thank you very much for your presentation.

288
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.540 
We will now proceed as already said with the Q and A session as always. So

289
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.940 
if you have any questions you can either raise your hand and ask your question directly

290
00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.350 
or you can also put it in the chat. I have seen we've already

291
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.590 
had one question in the chat.

292
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.390 
Just as a quick note, we are still recording

293
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.790 
so we can upload the video to the Clean IT forum afterwards.

294
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.810 
So if you don't want to be recognized, you can of course just

295
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.550 
keep your camera off when you ask a question.

296
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.580 
I just want to ask a quick first question for clarification. So

297
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.670 
this PUE score or this index of

298
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.790 
this has to be effectively calculated for each data center

299
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.980 
in the world uniquely, right? So this is not anything that can be

300
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.900 
measured across data centers. It's just for each individually.

301
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:49.820 
Yeah, it's the operation of each data center of course depends or

302
00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.040 
that this influences a lot what the outcome here is. So there are

303
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.680 
better and better techniques to run this. So the best ones in

304
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.940 
the field I think, they run at a high temperature. So they

305
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.160 
have twenty seven degrees or so in their data center. They cool

306
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.160 
with water or with outside air, they place their data centers in areas

307
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:18.160 
which are cold anyway, and if you look at their reporting, you

308
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.290 
see a clear dependence on the seasons for the PUE, because

309
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.790 
cooling is of course a big driver.

310
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.380 
And otherwise but it depends on the data centers and

311
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.480 
it's standardized how to deduct from these numbers, but it will

312
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.730 
be very dependent on how you run it. So there's no way from the outside

313
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.690 
to determine that unless you maybe know I think there's no way.

314
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.550 
Even if you other that the power supplier

315
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.750 
you don't know how much IT equipment is going to be powered by this.

316
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.040 
Thank you. Okay, so the first question of the chat,

317
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.290 
and I think that was asked during your when you mentioned that

318
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.300 
you calculate zero carbon emissions for the SAP clouds was

319
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.530 
because of the renewable energy,

320
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.160 
and the question is do you also include embodied emissions

321
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.440 
into this calculation?

322
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.410 
This is a which, which emissions? So we

323
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.030 
it is I can actually, I can

324
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.510 
ask the question directly. So basically,

325
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:33.090 
what you want to basically do is you calculate operating emissions,

326
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.970 
when you say more or less that the data center uses one hundred percent

327
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.820 
renewable energy, it's zero but in practical terms, it is not

328
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.520 
because you have to manufacturer and the hardware, you have to.

329
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.910 
So if I said renewable energy, then it was wrong. It's renewable electricity.

330
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:56.820 
So it's the electricity. This is a good point, so

331
00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.950 
for electricity we have been

332
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:06.490 
using renewable electricity, of course in part by just having

333
00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.850 
a power generation. Also SAP with

334
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.750 
a PV and with

335
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:23.470 
renewable energies, but of course also by compensating with the appropriate and

336
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.220 
high quality certificates. That's how you would do it if you

337
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:33.120 
buy your electricity from your energy provider and ask for the renewable energy.

338
00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.450 
Ok, so that we have had for since two thousand and fourteen

339
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.060 
and now what you ask is for the complete picture, yeah?

340
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.300 
It's not just electricity but we have manufacturing. We have

341
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.680 
the buildings, we have heating and things like that and here

342
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.980 
we are not at zero yet, but we have committed to have, be

343
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:01.620 
net carbon neutral by twenty twenty three.

344
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:08.130 
In your calculation, this does not show up in your calculation. Is that correct?

345
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:14.550 
Well as the embodied emission when you at the end you also purchase a service

346
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.380 
or you purchase storage arrays and everything and then these

347
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.680 
storage arrays they have to be produced

348
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.310 
and of course also has as it has emission factors,

349
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.860 
and then after the life cycle you basically have to recycle

350
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.350 
it in a certain form and that has a consequence, are you taking

351
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:42.900 
this into calculation or into into consideration when you do your calculations.

352
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.260 
Well I haven't seen it and I was just.

353
00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.340 
I try to say this in the very first slide

354
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:54.010 
that we just look at operation for what I'm doing here.

355
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.790 
Okay then it's clear.

356
00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:00.080 
So this is why, this is why we have this slide to make clear

357
00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.270 
we are looking at operation at electricity use in data centres.

358
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.320 
That's what the focus is here.

359
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.820 
Okay so I think this question has been answered.

360
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.230 
The second question from the chat is from Vincent.

361
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.560 
In the presentation you only focus on what is happening at

362
00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.270 
the server-side, but when you deliver software in the cloud

363
00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.580 
you also need to take the network infrastructure

364
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.070 
and the web into account. And the consumption of the terminals as well, right?

365
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:39.990 
Yes, it's a question on what what is really in

366
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.060 
the scope of your calculation. So what I was focusing is on

367
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.280 
what is happening in the data center, but if you of course go

368
00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:53.850 
downstream, yeah so that would be what is also the consequence

369
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:57.780 
for using the software. Of course then there is also

370
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:02.710 
energy usage on the front ends. It's

371
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.110 
no question that this is something which

372
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.590 
also will come into play in the complete

373
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.630 
picture for carbon usage. So there is of course

374
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.640 
it's a question when do I do a double counting, where were to I

375
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.010 
attribute the different contributions to. So there are

376
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:31.300 
in the moment there are processes being defined how you attribute that

377
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:37.050 
to your supplier, how you attributed to energy used in your own environment,

378
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.830 
and how you attribute it

379
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.560 
further down the supply chain. So that's a

380
00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.590 
very nice reading as the greenhouse gas

381
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.840 
protocol for scope three emissions. So that I think there's

382
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.460 
no question that if you have the complete picture then

383
00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.470 
you also have to look downstream and upstream but you have

384
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.930 
to have clear rules where where are the boundaries, and where

385
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.350 
do we start doing double counting.

386
00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.470 
Yeah I hope that also answers the question.

387
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.700 
I also have a question that kind of relates to this.

388
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.640 
So you've already mentioned a kind of the boundaries of the

389
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.120 
calculation that that you are doing or the methods that you are using.

390
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.210 
So want to ask, do this

391
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.780 
method survey improved so are you currently working on maybe improve

392
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.640 
including the embodied greenhouse gases or maybe including

393
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.260 
also these upstream and downstream carbon emissions?

394
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.260 
As I said SAP has pledged to be

395
00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:47.360 
carbon neutral by twenty twenty three and by then we have to include everything

396
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.270 
that's clear. Okay.

397
00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:55.020 
But do you also have developed like a more sophisticated

398
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:59.010 
method so that other companies could maybe also include.

399
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.170 
So for that I have to say what I did here that's the basic. So it's not

400
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.850 
the most sophisticated ways of how we calculate

401
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.980 
carbon footprint for a company. For that we have

402
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:19.300 
products. We have product from a suite of products in

403
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:24.720 
its called climate twenty one. And there you have, for example

404
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:31.070 
coming up a watch tower for GRI, so that's the Global Reporting Initiative which gives

405
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.590 
an overview over all the

406
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:39.940 
possible angles of sustainability. That not only includes the

407
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:44.840 
climate action but also other things, like a circular economy,

408
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.740 
waste management, also diversity and that

409
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:55.810 
allows companies also due to get an overview over

410
00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.310 
the carbon emissions which come from their supply chain.

411
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:05.810 
So in particular for manufacturing you can look at the carbon impact

412
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.570 
of different goods you are using, you can compare different

413
00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:16.330 
providers, suppliers for for these goods and then optimize your business

414
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.310 
accordingly. So it's

415
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:25.430 
for talking about what can a company do to optimize their we have a lot of

416
00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.170 
work going on and what I would recommend is we just that last

417
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.830 
week we had the Teched- SAP Teched and there is a very

418
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:39.460 
nice talk or a demo also on the possibilities you have there.

419
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.410 
You can find it on Youtube. So we have forty eight hours, I think

420
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:48.560 
of a Teched material on Youtube now and if you look for sustainability

421
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.380 
and SAP and Teched, you should find it.

422
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.660 
Okay thank you. I think we can of course include this link to the Youtube series

423
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:01.160 
maybe in the recording in the Clean IT forum

424
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.290 
so everyone can look that up. I see Maxi raising a hand.

425
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.670 
Yeah I have a question to you. You told that SAP is providing

426
00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.070 
a questionnaire to calculate the hardware requirements.

427
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.960 
When can coming to SAP cloud, are these clients renting the

428
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.680 
dedicated hardware on SAP cloud are is that weight of optimizing it?

429
00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.480 
Yeah so this questionnaire, so what I showed is

430
00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:35.450 
clearly for an on-premise customer who wants to know what hardware to use.

431
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.750 
It's very different in the cloud because the customer doesn't really care.

432
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.950 
In some cases, there are some match points of course. Because

433
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:49.780 
if you go from from a on-premise solution to a cloud solution,

434
00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.500 
then you know some things already how much footprint you have, and

435
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:59.040 
there in principle what you want to know is more

436
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.600 
like what kind of service plan do I have to

437
00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.430 
buy and there

438
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.990 
that the sizing and also the quick sizer has a one possibility

439
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.130 
for the cloud. So you can run the cloud quick sizer and what

440
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:22.260 
you get there is information on what kind of service you want to buy

441
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.430 
for your

442
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:29.640 
profile of business processes which you put into the questionnaire.

443
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.960 
So that will be quite different, right of course. It matches

444
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.430 
at some point. It has to match in resources but that's not on the customer side

445
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:43.120 
of course. There it's a more the question if you have such throughput

446
00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.250 
in a certain business process and selling

447
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:53.710 
and sales order and distribution, then you get

448
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.450 
the result you should buy

449
00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:01.110 
an m-size plan for the service which is connected with that

450
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.680 
for x four hundred cloud, for example.

451
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:09.690 
Ok and on SAP cloud SAP is optimizing like auto scaling.

452
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:13.460 
Exactly this is the one which I mentioned on the last slide.

453
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.380 
There you have really big possibilities to

454
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:25.940 
make sure that you are elastic, that you are scaling, that you share resources.

455
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:29.890 
Of course there are challenges which come with that for for the provider

456
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.660 
but the customer doesn't have to

457
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.280 
care about this. So if you share resources, you also

458
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.020 
have to make sure that the resources are shared according to

459
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.840 
what was bought by the customers, things like that. But that's

460
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.640 
I think it's a no brainer that you have to do that, but

461
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:51.310 
what you can do is of course use old features which you have in

462
00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.900 
virtualized environments, which you have with

463
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.140 
also down and up and downsizing

464
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:05.350 
the resources, which we give for a certain customer depending on their

465
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.760 
profile. So there are also

466
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:15.290 
actually we also have a product which is called a LaMa Cloud

467
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:20.750 
which is offering a service which is not directly a cloud

468
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.390 
service but it offers a service that SAP instances which are

469
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.140 
maintained, or which are run

470
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.510 
at hyper scale as they

471
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.140 
should be run effectively. And the first of course what comes in mind

472
00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:40.370 
is of course always of the cost. How can I run my SAP instances

473
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:44.290 
cost-effective and there you can for example build profiles

474
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:49.160 
to see how you can scale up and down these SAP instances

475
00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.050 
to make the most out of the purchased infrastructure

476
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.210 
at the hyper scaler. So that's

477
00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.750 
possible and of course

478
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.900 
that's maybe one point

479
00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.260 
which is a maybe hidden point, but is itself

480
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:13.580 
pretty clear that very often price and resources go parallel with carbon footprint.

481
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.870 
So and of course I'm the first concern of

482
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.150 
people at least of the financial part of companies

483
00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.720 
is always the price. But that

484
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:31.790 
is a very nice synergy because if you need less resources and

485
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.950 
hence you pay less then you

486
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:41.370 
normally, you get also a better carbon footprint out of this. Thank you.

487
00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.450 
Ok so we have two more questions I think. One short

488
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:48.510 
question in the chat is-

489
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.680 
do we have an idea or maybe do you have an idea if the consumption

490
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.410 
of data centers is a significant part of the overall carbon footprint?

491
00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.840 
And I think the overall carbon footprint of the

492
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.200 
digitalisation as met.

493
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.550 
Yeah I think about that is of course that's a big debate because there is

494
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:12.550 
if you look at their some contributions may be about that the introduction by

495
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.050 
by professor Meinel already mentions this that there is a rising

496
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:24.130 
part of digital technologies in the overall picture. If you have a few

497
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:32.270 
typical examples where there is a lot of energy consumption and

498
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:38.430 
a lot of part of the total energy consumption going into digital technologies and

499
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.800 
maybe the other key words here would be

500
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:49.710 
bitcoin and would be streaming. So that's the ones which are always in

501
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.570 
the headlines for really generating a lot of

502
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.120 
energy consumption and carbon footprint.

503
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:05.470 
But I would say that with digitalisation. We of course also have an overall

504
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:11.010 
increase in energy consumption there. What is always the question is,

505
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.440 
is this going to be

506
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:20.310 
making the situation worse or is it going to make the situation better.

507
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.520 
So with something like bitcoin you can of course argue that

508
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.960 
this is not going to help at all. Also there is there's alternatives

509
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.890 
also. There are also other

510
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.570 
currencies which are doing better in that way. But here you could,

511
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.090 
people have argued that this is really a bad way of wasting energy.

512
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.710 
But then you can also look at other

513
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.820 
applications like zoom.

514
00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.510 
With Zoom, as you can say of course with the big explosion of

515
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.290 
zooming and in the world the last two years

516
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:59.830 
of course Zoom is going to take more energy in data centres. But of course

517
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.190 
it's bit hard but it's

518
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.870 
close to everybody's mind what happened.

519
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:12.950 
What happens if we meet here in Zoom and not all in person at HPI.

520
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:17.030 
Now so I think it's pretty clear that there is some impact

521
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:22.080 
and even for block-chain, one can argue we applaud changes connected with

522
00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:27.480 
bitcoin. Even there one can argue that there are examples where a block chain

523
00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.950 
can save energy by for example you use block chain to make sure

524
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.330 
that a certain product you have bought is really up to the standards

525
00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.390 
in particular to green standards

526
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:47.420 
and you recognise counterfeits or you to prevent people

527
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.410 
from buying counterfeits and essentially

528
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:56.440 
preventing them from buying the CO2 heavy products.

529
00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:01.270 
So there you can argue even with an expensive technology

530
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:06.580 
that can also be on the positive side of energy saving.

531
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.150 
One just has to make sure that the overall is going down.

532
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:17.170 
And so I think, for speaking for what we normally do process

533
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:22.380 
optimization and companies, this is normally always going to have a

534
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.330 
big positive impact, like a standard example transportation management.

535
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:33.870 
If you do transportation management right you just save a lot of kilometers driven

536
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:39.180 
and a lot of planes flown and containers being transported

537
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.690 
by doing it the right way. So

538
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.850 
I think overall, I think it's rising -the data center

539
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.900 
energy consumption. It has different reasons why it rises.

540
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.680 
There are reasons which are good reasons and there are reasons which we should

541
00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.640 
maybe ask if this is really necessary.

542
00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.300 
Yeah I think you have mentioned the very point of the

543
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.550 
entire clean IT initiative. So actually

544
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.260 
clean or digitalization can help at many points, but

545
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.120 
we always have to make sure that the tools we use are efficient

546
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.630 
themselves or efficiently designed.

547
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.490 
There's one last short question to clouds in the chat. So

548
00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:27.560 
assuming for the case of SAP cloud services, there are probably

549
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:31.530 
millions of end users with their devices powered by electricity themselves.

550
00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:35.610 
How or will this even add to the carbon footprint calculation or other

551
00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:37.710 
calculations where this included?

552
00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:44.020 
It will certainly be included in calculations according to

553
00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:49.300 
greenhouse gas protocol scope three. There it will certainly be included.

554
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:56.810 
The question what will be, how will we distribute that between the

555
00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:01.670 
consumer and the supplier and that is something which will

556
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.730 
be something which the future will show because there are lots of

557
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:11.510 
also standardizations and reporting standards being discussed

558
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:14.140 
in the EU and in the UN

559
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.910 
to see how this will be

560
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:23.570 
reported. So what is of course the over arching idea is to reduce

561
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:27.450 
the emissions in total. So it's important to have transparency

562
00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.820 
and I think you're completely right or whoever asked that question

563
00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.610 
completely right that one shouldn't forget that part.

564
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.710 
It's then the question where does it show up in the

565
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.920 
overall footprint and how do we get it down.

566
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:50.700 
Okay then I've just one last quick question from myself again.

567
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.460 
And I want to ask how widespread is the use of these carbon

568
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.480 
calculation methods. So you've mentioned a few products already from SAP which

569
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:03.640 
use these calculations or which offer these calculations,

570
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.530 
but how widespread is this method in other companies may be and

571
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:10.320 
what does it mean that there are being used thereof?

572
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:16.100 
Okay so it maybe I should not talk about other companies too much. So

573
00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.610 
that I can do a general comment. The general comment is that

574
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.260 
it's really rising. So you see

575
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:28.150 
carbon calculators popping up in various areas. So I think it's

576
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.960 
pretty clear that this is something we need and

577
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.640 
with all the actions of climate actions and with

578
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.650 
regulation also, that will be very important.

579
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:46.480 
So and I would suggest just searching for carbon calculation

580
00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.880 
on the web and you will find your answer.

581
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.010 
I could name names now but this is no point there.

582
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.480 
Okay thank you very much. I think I see no more questions

583
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.320 
or raised hands anywhere, so

584
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.810 
I think that's it for today. Thank you very much for presentation

585
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.460 
and for answering all of these questions.

586
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.350 
Just for the end I will quickly share my screen again.

587
00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.250 
So I hope you can see this now.

588
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.790 
The next live talk I just want to quickly mention that I will

589
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.570 
be at the thirteenth of December at twelve.

590
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.670 
The thirteenth of December. So it will be in three weeks and not four because

591
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:27.190 
four weeks would be very close to the Christmas holidays already.

592
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:31.160 
And the next live talk will also be a little bit later so this

593
00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.380 
will be on sixteen o'clock p m after the Central European Standard time.

594
00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:40.470 
So four hours later than usually. And our next guest will be Mathias Renner

595
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.510 
which who will be talking about sustainable software engineering

596
00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:47.390 
which I think you've already mentioned today a quickly

597
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:50.470 
and the opportunities and barriers of these.

598
00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.810 
So for the end just if you haven't already but I think most of

599
00:44:56.570 --> 00:45:00.290 
the people here in the Zoom room have already joined the Clean IT Forum.

600
00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.900 
And as always if you have any questions or any feedback or

601
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.590 
anything else you can always contact us by a Clean-IT@hpi.de.

602
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.700 
So with that being said, thank you again very much. Thank you for your questions

603
00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.480 
and for attending today. Thank you for presentation and for all the

604
00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:20.970 
very kind answers and I hope we can see you next time.

605
00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:23.920 
Thanks a lot.

606
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.220 
Goodbye, everyone. Goodbye.

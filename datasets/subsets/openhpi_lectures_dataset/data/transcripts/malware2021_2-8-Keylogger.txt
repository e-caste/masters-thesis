00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.280 
In our OpenHPI course cyberthreats
by malware

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.330 
now we will speak about
Keylogger. Keylogger

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:15.780 
that is a tool to record or capture
keys pressed on the keyboard.

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.790 
So they measure and
store the keystrokes.

5
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.150 
It is a legal tool that can be used
for legal purposes for example,

6
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.350 
typing behavioral studies or
employee remote working monitoring.

7
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.570 
So this is some software
that's needed in

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.250 
our context and the idea is to
exactly record which key is

9
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.650 
pressed and from these

10
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.560 
keystrokes when of course one can
can recover what the user is doing.

11
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.220 
And this is exactly the idea when we speak
about keylogger what cybercriminals do.

12
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.190 
They use this for illegal activities, they
want to steal personal information,

13
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.530 
they want to spy
out the victim.

14
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
These keyloggers exist in different
forms, they exist as software,

15
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.730 
a software keylogger is
a program that

16
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.120 
listens and records keystrokes on a screen
or other activities in the system.

17
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.700 
It runs in the background typically
if it's part of an cyber

18
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.910 
criminal attack, it is
unnoticed by the user and

19
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.120 
it can run at different levels
as an application, for example,

20
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.170 
smart board keyboard, browser
plugin, it can be

21
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.080 
run at the level of the
operating system or memory.

22
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.030 
Besides the software keylogger, also the
hardware keylogger are available

23
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.690 
that can be connected
in between the

24
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.880 
keyboard and the computer
and in this way all the

25
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.580 
pressed keys
are recorded.

26
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.650 
Such keylogger exist
as a wireless tools,

27
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.720 
wireless key logger captures
the data packets

28
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.490 
between the wireless
keyboard and the computer.

29
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.750 
Here when a

30
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.380 
wireless keyboard is used, then of
course the key strokes and with

31
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.540 
the information, the letters that's
pressed it is

32
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.030 
then transmitted over this wireless
connection to the system and the system

33
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.830 
processes this information and the
attacker with the wireless keylogger

34
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.020 
captures the
packets which are sent.

35
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.820 
Protective
measures here is

36
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.990 
strong encryption technique, if
this informations that is sent

37
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.350 
between the wireless keyboard
and the computer system

38
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.970 
is encrypted, the attacker can use wireless
keyloggers can capture the data packets,

39
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.720 
but cannot understand

40
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.370 
the content, cannot see
which letter was pressed.

41
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.760 
There are even more
possibilities to record

42
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.220 
such keystrokes by means
of acoustic keylogger.

43
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.720 
They reconstruct the keystrokes by
means of the sound that's produced

44
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.730 
when typing on a keyboard,
there are different ways

45
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.360 
for example, by such a small
microphone.

46
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.850 
So this is a way to steal information
by means of such keyloggers,

47
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.790 
which is performed
by the cybercriminals

48
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.200 
in particular to get sensitive data
like login data, passwords,

49
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.530 
which later helps them to get more
easy access to the computer,

50
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.840 
to the system
of the user.

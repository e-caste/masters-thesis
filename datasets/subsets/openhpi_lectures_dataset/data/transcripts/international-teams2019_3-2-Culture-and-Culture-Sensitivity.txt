00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.890 
So Hanadi, we've been
talking in the last

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.830 
weeks about tools to use
for remote teamwork and

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.070 
we've been talking about organizational
issues, and psychological

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.810 
issues, and team
issues, and

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.640 
motivational issues. So this
week we will come to a

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.300 
completely new topic and that's
intercultural competence what

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.620 
what is it.... Yes it's called
intercultural competence it's

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.820 
basically learning how to deal
with people from other cultures

9
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.540 
so this is a very short introduction
why we would like to talk

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.130 
about it because it's really
important and whenever we talk

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.540 
about remote teamwork most of the
people tend to ignore this aspect

12
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
or to forget about it but
it's really important.

13
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.570 
Nowadays, we live in a very
global connected world

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.460 
people tend to travel
more, people work

15
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.770 
with people from other cultures
if your company has a branch

16
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.090 
overseas you might get the opportunity
to go visit your colleagues

17
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.550 
there and most of the time some
misunderstanding situations

18
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.230 
happen because you don't actually
get what they exactly do

19
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.090 
and also they don't get what
you are talking about.

20
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.420 
...This is becoming more and
more important because

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.530 
these actions are happening more
often... Yes, yes so that's why

22
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.610 
intercultural competence helps
us to recognize and overcome

23
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.430 
such obstacles and misunderstanding
situations. To tap into

24
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.800 
the benefits offered by
diversity. So your remote

25
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.470 
team, as we said, could
come from different

26
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.020 
countries, from different
backgrounds, so instead of

27
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.390 
spending your time solving a
conflict you could actually

28
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.890 
benefit out of this diversity. But
before we talk about intercultural

29
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.360 
competence we would like to talk
first about culture itself

30
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.890 
and culture sensitivity. Tom what
is culture for you? How do

31
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.840 
you see culture? How do
you define culture?

32
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.270 
I mean for me it's a
a lot about music

33
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.520 
literature, language,
food, very important

34
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.990 
...I like food... me
too... school system,

35
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.740 
political system,
a lot of things.

36
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.900 
You are absolutely right.
Culture can be defined as the

37
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.850 
sum of a way of life including
expected behavior,

38
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.980 
language, living practices,
values shared by members of

39
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.250 
a society, like one society.
Actually, to understand culture

40
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.720 
more, you need to be a bit sensitive.
So awareness of differences

41
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.350 
between culture, you need to be
aware of these differences, you

42
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.950 
need to develop your awareness
because the more you develop

43
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.610 
this awareness, the more you
become a better communicator. So

44
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.340 
you will actually avoid some
of the conflicts. Also

45
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.250 
you need to view people as
unique individuals, you know.

46
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.520 
What happens here, might happen
there, but it could be interpreted

47
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.330 
in a different way. You
could use a proverb here,

48
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.850 
but it can be used there
differently.... Yeah we have a very

49
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.480 
nice example for the ok
about the proverbs,

50
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.390 
and it's really closely
connected to the topic

51
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.870 
of the course. I came across
that, accidentally, a couple of

52
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.200 
months, years ago,
actually. The acronym for

53
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.850 
TEAM in German, one of them,
there's a couple of them, but one

54
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.350 
of them is "Toll ein anderer machts"
which means in English: "Great, someone

55
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.330 
else will do it". In English
the acronym is "Together

56
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.500 
everyone achieves
more", which is

57
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.330 
pretty much the opposite... And
it's also a kind of this saying

58
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.840 
in meetings in Germany when you
say "WE should do something

59
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.100 
about it", that normally
means in the end nobody

60
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.270 
will do anything about it. So you rather say
"YOU should do this and YOU should do that".

61
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.360 
Yeah, im sure this happens
everywhere and i'm sure

62
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.460 
you have also different examples
which we would like you to

63
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.890 
share with us. But lets bring
another example like food

64
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.160 
in class, for example.Usually in
some western countries or some

65
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.860 
western schools they actually
don't mind students eating

66
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.680 
or drinking in class. They see
this informal action is normal,

67
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.360 
it makes students feel comfortable.
The same action could

68
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.510 
be interpreted differently in
other countries, let's say the

69
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.690 
Arab countries or Persian countries
where there is this hierarchy

70
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.500 
in class. If you allow them to eat
or drink, the students themselves

71
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.180 
won't feel comfortable.
This hierarchical

72
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.940 
status, for example, it
may be perceived as

73
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.590 
arrogant in some cultures, but
it's a sign of respect in the

74
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.360 
other culture. Actually, I
have a pretty nice example

75
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.330 
just came about it yesterday,
when I went home by train.

76
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.350 
It's not only between the
countries it's also

77
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.460 
within the countries.
So, for example,

78
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.940 
it's pretty much acceptable in
Berlin to drink a beer in public

79
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.140 
transport, for more
or less everybody.

80
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.800 
This is not so acceptable in many
other cities... Interesting.

81
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.900 
Yes, actually there
are lots of

82
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.400 
such examples, right.

83
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.950 
We hope you have some of
these examples as well so

84
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.210 
let's share. Maybe
you have ideas

85
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.320 
what are particular proverbs
from your country...

86
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.810 
Something unique from your country
or from your own culture.

87
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.440 
We would like to invite you
to post pictures, proverbs,

88
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.380 
a story, anything that you find
unique and can present your

89
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.680 
culture in one way or another. Or
maybe you disagree with us and

90
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.460 
yes... let's
start arguing:)

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.440 
Looking at the 3 core elements

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.600 
we are focusing on very much
the last weeks, you might consider

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400 
there's nothing new with those.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.920 
And you're right,

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.640 
there's nothing new with
the elements separately,

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.360 
but the combination of the 3
of those is a new one.

7
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.520 
And the intense radical
step we are doing is also a new one.

8
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.960 
So as soon as you start changing your work

9
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.720 
force towards a collaborative one,
as soon as you start changing your work

10
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.680 
environments towards a more flexible,
supporting, agile one,

11
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.840 
and as soon as you start
moving away from linear processes

12
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.160 
to nonlinear processes,
you change the culture of work and you

13
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.680 
change it fundamentally because you
change it towards more agility.

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.320 
And this is what we are needing

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.960 
in the times of digitization,
in the times of Industry 4.0.

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.440 
And with design thinking,
with those 3 core elements,

17
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.240 
we are addressing the cultural part
of that transformation. The tech

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.480 
part, a lot of people are talking about it
and there is new technology introduced.

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.960 
But what we're usually forgetting and not

20
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.040 
taking too much into our
attention is the cultural part.

21
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.040 
And this is what we want to focus on

22
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240 
intensively.

23
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.720 
And this is why we started
calling what we are doing here

24
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.080 
Design thinking 4.0.

25
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.960 
So how did we actually end
up with Design Thinking 4.0?

26
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.000 
Well, I just want to

27
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.560 
walk you back and walk you through
the history and the development

28
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.120 
of design thinking by making use
of the Industrial Revolution model.

29
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.240 
So if you think about Industry 1.0,
that was about steam engines and water

30
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.360 
as a power, as a source, that actually
refers also to design thinking 1.0.

31
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800 
That actually is about creativity

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.480 
and boosting the individual
creativity in persons.

33
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.040 
And Industry 2.0 was about mass
production and also tailorism.

34
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.840 
So actually splitting up a long process

35
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.960 
in smaller tasks and that actually
translates into a version

36
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.840 
of Design Thinking 2.0 that was just
focusing on the process of how to create

37
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.480 
new products and also how
to create new services.

38
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.120 
The third stage of the industrial
development actually was about knowledge

39
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.480 
and IT, how to create
something that's not tangible.

40
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.360 
And that is also related into actually
a design thinking 3.0 version,

41
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.240 
that was focusing a lot on experiences,
for either customers,

42
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.160 
employees, or just everybody as a human
and a citizen of a specific community.

43
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.760 
And finally, Industry 4.0 was actually
about smart and connectivity.

44
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.720 
Everything, every piece, is connected
and Design Thinking

45
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.560 
4.0, therefore, now has a different
momentum compared to the previous stages.

46
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.760 
It's about balancing this technology
development with the cultural dimension

47
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.960 
and making this the key principle and also the
key area of making change happen.

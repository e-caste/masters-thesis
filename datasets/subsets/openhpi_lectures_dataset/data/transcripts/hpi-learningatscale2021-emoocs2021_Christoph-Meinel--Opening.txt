WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.759 
A warm welcome to all of you.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.392 
We are happy, I am happy to open the EMOOCs

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.869 
conference 2021.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.099 
We are happy to have you with us.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.809 
We would be even happierif we would have

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.010 
you here in Potsdam on our campus.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.579 
You all know pandemic problems make traveling

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.409 
difficult, meeting difficult, although in Germany, fortunately, we have

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.642 
reached quite a good situation.

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.519 
But our conference is virtual, this has the advantage that it's

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.339 
easy to combine with other activities.

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.380 
There's a huge disadvantage that we cannot meet, that we cannot

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.249 
talk in person and exchange our ideas,

14
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.489 
inform each other about what's new to

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.149 
work in the world of digital education.

16
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.349 
And personally, we try to do our best.

17
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.430 
We organized a program, Christiane Herzog

18
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.829 
will welcome you afterward and lead you through the program.

19
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.809 
So, I want to start with a few words.

20
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.809 
About what problems we have, what challenges

21
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.571 
we have when we speak about digital education.

22
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.719 
The starting point of all is that we live in a new age,

23
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.058 
in the age of colonization of the digital world.

24
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.419 
Internet is a little bit older than 50 years old.

25
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.039 
The World Wide Web starting in '89 -'90 is 30

26
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.899 
years old and this historical very short time has

27
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.549 
changed our world, has changed our life,

28
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.869 
has changed how we work in a tremendous way.

29
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.539 
There was no technical discovery in the past with

30
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.269 
such far-reachingconsequences.

31
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.929 
So, this new digital world differs from

32
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.429 
our physical world. We are trained to move, to

33
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.929 
live in our digital world, and we as a society have

34
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.759 
to learn how we move into the digital world.

35
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.189 
Some things are already working, we are a pioneer generation,

36
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.659 
we had a chance to develop things, but we are also faced with

37
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.459 
a lot of problems, for example, around how we communicate with each other.

38
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.873 
The problems around social media - hate speeches

39
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.229 
and others. The way how ideas are

40
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.059 
discussed, how political decisions are taken.

41
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.679 
So, it really is, there is a new life, there is a new world - the digital world and

42
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.949 
we have to learn to live with it.

43
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.669 
And here I hope you can see it on your screen.

44
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.279 
This is the digital transformation.

45
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.899 
These are all the changes that are summarized under the notion of

46
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.969 
digital transformation and this digital transformation is not coming

47
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.819 
is not a thing of the future, it is already here and we

48
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.279 
often are not aware of this, when we are aware of this, we

49
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.879 
have to experiment with the right answers.

50
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.979 
So, this is what we are faced with.

51
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.839 
So, the digital transformation is changing all areas of life,

52
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.729 
of society, of our economy, including education.

53
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.319 
And of course, this is the topic of our conference, how we can use

54
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.063 
digital technologies for the purpose of education.

55
00:04:07.064 --> 00:04:11.629 
The interaction, how people

56
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.499 
interchange with each other, how people communicate with each other

57
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.009 
are basically changed.

58
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.199 
We can meet here, everyone is sitting alone in front of his/her desktop

59
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.579 
or his/her mobile device, and we can discuss together.

60
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.229 
We can discuss together not only within

61
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.669 
one city or one country, within the countries, within the

62
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.839 
states of Europe, but we can alsodiscuss and interact worldwide

63
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.300 
with these new technologies.

64
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.329 
So, many things have become much simpler than in the

65
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.859 
past, but also the situation of

66
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.299 
what means to have a relationship is changing

67
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.609 
on a human basis.

68
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.289 
So, you know, on social media platforms

69
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.089 
where it's so easy to make someone a friend, some people have

70
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.899 
thousands of friends. This is, of course, impossible in the physical world.

71
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.419 
The relations between the states, the relation between state and

72
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:26.089 
the citizen, state and economy, all this must be redefined

73
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.709 
to adjust for this new world

74
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.299 
and digital education is needed to understand these changes.

75
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.279 
So, in a narrow sense, digital education

76
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.869 
is necessary to learn how to deal with these new

77
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.819 
technical devices but in a broader sense, in all areas

78
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.290 
of education, we have to see we have to

79
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.869 
improve the way we educate our

80
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.489 
children. We follow such codes like lifelong

81
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.559 
learning and what we do in HPI with our openHPI

82
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.059 
platform and the experience around, we see that there

83
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.240 
is a digital enlightenment necessary.

84
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.379 
If we compare our time with the time after the

85
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.149 
historic feudal societies, then

86
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.609 
modern societies came up, this was a time of

87
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.649 
education, this was the time of enlightenment,

88
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.855 
and philosophers like Immanuel Kant and others

89
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.949 
in that time considered enlightenment as the exit

90
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.279 
of man/woman from his/her self inflicted immaturity.

91
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.709 
So, this is 250 years ago

92
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.279 
in a similar situation, that people start to become self-responsible

93
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.189 
for their life in the physical world, for their professional

94
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:14.109 
life. Before there was a king who says you have to do this

95
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.699 
and that and now the people became the

96
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.259 
masters of their lives. And so what we think is that we need

97
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.999 
something similar now when we start to

98
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.618 
colonize the digital world, when we start to become citizens

99
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.089 
of this new digital world.

100
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.619 
We need to understand how does the basics of

101
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.149 
these IT technologies work, we need to learn how

102
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.489 
we can use this, some people speak of digital hygiene

103
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.469 
and we have to develop an attitude of lifelong learning,

104
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.130 
otherwise, we will not be able to master

105
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.309 
this world which is exploding with knowledge.

106
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.419 
So, digital education provides means, provides

107
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.269 
huge potential, but do we exploitthis potential?

108
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.091 
And exactly this is the topic we want to discuss at our conference.

109
00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:23.969 
Digital Education to empower citizens,

110
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.589 
digital education to empower people, children, to

111
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.585 
be able to master in a self-determined and self-reliant way

112
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.788 
the challenges of the digital transformation and the challenges of life

113
00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:43.229 
in this new world, the physical world and

114
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.230 
digital together.

115
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.919 
Digitaltechnologies offer the means to do this, and they can

116
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.229 
promote learning and teaching, and MOOCs are a wonderful instrument

117
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.729 
to do this. So, what do we have to do if

118
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.839 
we want to realize this potential that digital technologies are providing

119
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.329 
us? Then we need, of course, content, digital

120
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.889 
content, which we can transfer to

121
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.539 
the learners by means of digital technologies.

122
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:24.119 
We need to be able to develop digital educational formats.

123
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.709 
We have to experiment with the right ways to learn on the screen

124
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.779 
and we have lessons learned.

125
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.459 
The typical lecture hall situation within

126
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.929 
a university with lectures of 90 minutes,

127
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.579 
is something that usually does not work with the screen when the

128
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.359 
learners sitting alone in front of his/her screen and want to understand

129
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.939 
what to do. And what we also need to develop is

130
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.119 
our educational infrastructures.

131
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.919 
Infrastructures to provide formats

132
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.659 
with new content, and the massive open

133
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.579 
online courses are a very successful format.

134
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.319 
We started in HPI to develop our

135
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.059 
Global Open Campus in 2012 when the New York

136
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.142 
Times declared the year 2012 as

137
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.710 
a year of MOOC's.

138
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.479 
We have close relations with Stanford

139
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.212 
University and in Stanford University some

140
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:43.769 
first very popular MOOC's run by Sebastian

141
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.029 
Truman with more than 10,000

142
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.329 
participants. And so we asked ourselves, can we do

143
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.849 
something similar? Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) offers study courses

144
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.349 
- bachelor and master study courses in digital technologies:

145
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.999 
I.T. Systems Engineering, Cybersecurity, Data engineering,

146
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.439 
AI, Digital health, and the question was can we share

147
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.099 
this knowledge with the public?

148
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:22.019 
And so we start to think,

149
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.479 
to develop, to offer MOOC's and then we saw that there

150
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.219 
are no technical infrastructures available to offer such

151
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.137 
MOOC's. So, we start to develop our platform, our openHPI

152
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.969 
platform. We could start to do this

153
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.659 
by means of the tele-TASK system, which was developed before

154
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.989 
to record lectures and others.

155
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.441 
And the third

156
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.309 
educational project in HPI was the task from

157
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:04.019 
the German Ministry of Federal Education to design

158
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:11.309 
School-Cloud, which allows pupils and teachers

159
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.809 
to use digital content, digital technologies whenever

160
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.059 
they found this useful.

161
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.018 
So, with the tele-TASK systems, the idea was to share

162
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.939 
as complete as possible, the situation of a lecture hall

163
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.409 
with people that only could take part or the Internet.

164
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:38.359 
So, we use this system also for producing

165
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.919 
the clips for our own HPI courses but in the beginning,

166
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.029 
we developed this to record all the lectures that

167
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.669 
happened and are given in HPI to make students which

168
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.469 
are not able to take part, who are, for example, for an internship in another

169
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:02.029 
university in another country that they could take part in the

170
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.469 
lectures and all that we have recorded, we

171
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:12.139 
shared with the public. So, we introduced our tele-TASK.de

172
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.899 
portal and there are all these lectures, lecture series,

173
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.639 
many, many podcasts, colloquium,

174
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.169 
talks of guests from outside could be seen and

175
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.170 
could be accessed here.

176
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.739 
So, tele-TASK enables you to grade education content to

177
00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.269 
go. This is a tele-TASK system, it is a very compact

178
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:44.599 
bag which contains a computer,

179
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.909 
camera, a microphone.

180
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:51.379 
You can connect to the presentation laptop and then you

181
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.209 
can start and give your talk,

182
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.709 
give your lecture, and immediately it is

183
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:05.149 
recorded and streamed into the Internet by

184
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:09.809 
means of the tele-TASK and the characteristic is the dual-screen because

185
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.459 
the situation is a challenge to

186
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.612 
get the lecture recording as complete as possible.

187
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.149 
It is not enough to record the lecture, it

188
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.829 
is not enough to record the slides or what is presented.

189
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:33.587 
We believe it is important to record

190
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.009 
the lecture as well as the material he or she is presenting.

191
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.289 
You can do this on a smartboard, you can interact.

192
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.729 
Typically it's PowerPoint that's recorded, but what the tele-TASK

193
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.189 
system is doing, it records the screen.

194
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:55.779 
So, if you develop your illustration on

195
00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:01.059 
a smartboardor if you use another system, it is recorded

196
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.679 
and in that way, the participant can

197
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.239 
get an impression from such a recording, from such

198
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.859 
a lecture, like he or she is in the lecture hall.

199
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.419 
So, this was what we had and we had a lot of experience,

200
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.769 
a lot of lectures recorded.

201
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.250 
We also know how the learners

202
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.829 
feel and what they're feeling when they followed

203
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.919 
such learning content under the desk.

204
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.959 
And we realized that although the technical possibilities

205
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.009 
are great, it was no fun for the

206
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.539 
user sitting alone in their offices or at

207
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.459 
home in front of a computer, and many people, because

208
00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:01.039 
any way to interact with others was missing.

209
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.539 
And learning is something very social

210
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.979 
and observing the situation, we immediately when we

211
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:15.019 
saw the first MOOC's, we immediately got to the point

212
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.070 
that the interest for the people to take part in this

213
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.589 
MOOC's was that they had an event together

214
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.590 
with others.

215
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.860 
They were sitting alone in front of their desktop, but by means of

216
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.099 
the discussion forum, by means of marrying such a lecture,

217
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.599 
such a lecture portal with social media gives the possibility

218
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.729 
to interact with other learners.

219
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.289 
So, we start to develop our openHPI.de.

220
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:53.149 
Today, it's Germany's largest lecture hall and we have

221
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.669 
more than 900000 enrollments.

222
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.819 
In a course, the number of participants

223
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.439 
is changing, it depends whether it's a more popular topic or is more

224
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.848 
about a specialized topic, between 5000 and 20000.

225
00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.340 
We have participants from 180

226
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.569 
countries. All is free and inclusive with certificates.

227
00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:26.629 
What we offer are structured courses and

228
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:31.219 
the content is presented in short video lectures,

229
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.749 
video clips. There is also other learning material, for

230
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.879 
example, there are self-tests, which gives the participants

231
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.829 
the possibility to check whether they correctly understood

232
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.358 
what was told in the lecture series.

233
00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:51.439 
There is homework assignment.

234
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.999 
And so meanwhile, there is a lot of content and many, many

235
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.859 
courses, here you see some courses we at the Hasso Plattner institute

236
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.599 
concentrate on teaching

237
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.485 
digital technologies,

238
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.579 
digital techniques. We offer courses for kids

239
00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.179 
to learn, where they can learn programming.

240
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.829 
We introduce into,

241
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:30.769 
for example, mathematic, algorithms, and networking

242
00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:35.629 
in others. So, there is a broad range but the comment is

243
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:40.399 
it is about digital technologies, digital applications.

244
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.885 
And so the idea of these massive open online courses (MOOCs)

245
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:51.139 
was very fruitful for our

246
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.729 
activities in the area of trying

247
00:18:55.730 --> 00:19:00.559 
out new technology, new digital technologies for purposes of education.

248
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:08.629 
We learned from the tele-TASK activities that learning needs

249
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:13.790 
social interactions and I think we shared this experience

250
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:20.089 
from the last few months where many things we were only able

251
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:25.069 
to do via virtual technologies and not in

252
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.169 
person in particular for the learning.

253
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:32.749 
It is so important not to sit alone, there are only a few

254
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.014 
pupils that are gifted with

255
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.169 
didactic properties, the other people need the class,

256
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:47.269 
need the other participants

257
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:52.079 
in the course for interacting, of course, interacting with the teacher, with a professor

258
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.599 
is possible but much more often and much more important

259
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.259 
is the interaction with the other learners.

260
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:05.089 
So, with the goal to attract many learners,

261
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.099 
the idea is to have a very

262
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:16.129 
lively and volunteer interaction forum

263
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.989 
for the learners. If there are only a small number of participants,

264
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.459 
then the probability is that if one of the learners put

265
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.469 
a question that he or she gets an answer within

266
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.450 
a short time, a half minute or a minute is very

267
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:40.429 
slow. But if you have thousands of learners, then you can see

268
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.889 
or we see and you are all active in the MOOC's, we

269
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.280 
all see a large potential of the

270
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.849 
interaction of these learners. To attract many learners, it is important to

271
00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.409 
allow everyone to take part, so no access

272
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.039 
requirements, make it free of charge,

273
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.649 
make it easy to connect, so web-basedand

274
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:15.079 
interactive, and then organize events, courses,

275
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.549 
because otherwise, if the material is available,

276
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:23.989 
but without other learners, which are dealing exactly in

277
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:28.549 
that time with the same content, then it is difficult to interact

278
00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:33.199 
with each other. So, here is our learning experience.

279
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.089 
We organized a typical format, the 6 weeks format.

280
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.459 
For each week there is what you can see are all materials.

281
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.410 
In a line, you see there are lecture videos,

282
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.850 
then self-tests, new lecture videos, new self-tests.

283
00:21:52.851 --> 00:21:57.349 
The learner can determine by him/herself in which

284
00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:02.419 
sequence he or she is looking at the material,

285
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:07.069 
is learning from it, and week by week there

286
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:12.319 
are the courses you can find in the navigation, the week navigation.

287
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.789 
And what we use is a tele-TASK video player so that

288
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.429 
we hear and see a dual-screen.

289
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.899 
We see the lecture and we see what he or she is

290
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.689 
presenting. So, this is a typical format, we have

291
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:34.009 
week 1 to week 6, each week has 10 to 12 videos, self-tests for

292
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.309 
the readings, and at the end of the week, the homework.

293
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.869 
And if the learner is able to

294
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:46.849 
reach a score for each homework higher than 50 percent

295
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.052 
then and it's the same for the final exam,

296
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.659 
and then he or she will get a certificate.

297
00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.829 
Social activities are also important.

298
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:05.569 
So, here in our openHPI.de platform, we have

299
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:10.430 
a discussion forum and collab spaces, so people can start

300
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:16.669 
their own threads in the discussion concerning

301
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:21.199 
what they are doing so that people can evaluate, they

302
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.209 
can ask questions, they can evaluate the answers they are getting from

303
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.789 
other leaners in the web.

304
00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:33.979 
We see here that it's nothing for students

305
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.400 
and young people, they are participants but

306
00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.246 
the main part of our learners

307
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.769 
are professionals, are people that are in life people

308
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:54.169 
with family in the age between 30 and

309
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:59.839 
55, this is the main part of the learners.

310
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.789 
You see learning analytics, it's possible, it's very important

311
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:09.289 
to observe this, to optimize the presentation of

312
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:13.969 
the course, to optimize the content presentation, to see

313
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:19.819 
when it's a good way for interactions, to give only a few numbers.

314
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:24.469 
Our learners mostly come from Europe,

315
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:29.059 
88 percent. The majority have at least five years of preparation

316
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:34.249 
and experience and 50 percent, more than 50 percent

317
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.719 
see career advantages at work through, of course,

318
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.140 
participation and many are

319
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.289 
looking to follow such MOOCs to learn not only

320
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.109 
for professional life but also

321
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.099 
for their our own educational purposes.

322
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.489 
We have partners and learn a lot from these partners.

323
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.102 
We have partners in business, for example, openSAP.com

324
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.419 
is using our platform since the first year, as I remember,

325
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.940 
they started in 2013-2014.

326
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.879 
They use our openHPI platform to present their materials,

327
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.156 
they meanwhile, have more than 5 million enrollments,

328
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.989 
many, many courses also all open, accessible,

329
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.789 
and interesting for people in the area to learn how

330
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.439 
SAP products can be used to learn what's necessary,

331
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:46.549 
to see how such things are developed, to understand

332
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:51.229 
technologies. Another partner in health is

333
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.799 
the World Health Organization (WHO).

334
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.240 
So, we started with the pandemic

335
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.980 
department when the Ebola pandemic started,

336
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:08.319 
6 or 7 years ago, they had the problem

337
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.999 
that the traditional eLearning contact and information they provide

338
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.109 
in the public area for all the people that are confronted with such a pandemic,

339
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:22.779 
and they offered it in a traditional way on servers and when

340
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:27.219 
such a pandemic situation came, the servers

341
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:31.689 
crashed down because then in a very short time, many people need to access

342
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:36.485 
to such information, which is provided by the WHO.

343
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.369 
So, with our

344
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.439 
openWHO platform, they were able

345
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.959 
to disseminate knowledge much faster.

346
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:55.299 
And this was exactly what was needed during the Corona pandemic.

347
00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:00.039 
So, within one year, the number of learners

348
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.259 
that are enrolled on the platform increased from 500,000

349
00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.949 
to more than 5 million enrollments.

350
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:14.199 
So, it was a hard time

351
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.299 
to get the system in shape that people

352
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.889 
with such an increased number of users can learn.

353
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:28.419 
It was at the time of the home office, also in Germany it was

354
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.419 
difficult to access the machines physically.

355
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:36.099 
So, this was a hard time but we are very happy about this

356
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.689 
cooperation with the World Health Organization and later on in the conference, you

357
00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:45.159 
will hear from all these partners, also their experiences.

358
00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.329 
So in the platform, there are also other partners, for example, the AI-campus (KI Campus)

359
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:54.159 
of the German Federal Government where they have

360
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.839 
the mission to provide all learning, electronic learning

361
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.669 
materials in Germany from the different educational providers,

362
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.559 
from the universities, from the high schools,

363
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:13.366 
from Fachshule and others in one place for free.

364
00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.409 
The Charite, the largest European hospital, they

365
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.089 
offer courses on

366
00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.526 
our openHPI platform and Acatech the German

367
00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:35.109 
Academy of Science. Here is the development of enrollments

368
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.970 
that were driven by the covid-19 pandemic situation.

369
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:46.029 
There we could observe a real boost of digital education

370
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:51.289 
and in the conference, there is definitely a time

371
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.579 
and place also to discuss this.

372
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.139 
People learned that there is good

373
00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.729 
teaching content, good education that is available on

374
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:08.319 
the Internet, and also with other platforms here, we could

375
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.959 
see such an increase.

376
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.429 
So, here, this was in

377
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.290 
August, the numbers, meanwhile

378
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:25.749 
in a couple of months later, increased

379
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.489 
by millions. So, really, this was interesting

380
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.849 
to see. What comes next?

381
00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:39.100 
In Germany, there is a mission of a National Education

382
00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.179 
Cloud - Bildungs Cloud (Educational Cloud).

383
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:48.129 
So, this is a project that just started asking

384
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.630 
for ideas, for activities to provide a national

385
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.599 
cloud with very easy access to all kinds

386
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.339 
of educational content.

387
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.789 
So, overarching contact point for learning opportunities

388
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:12.309 
so that it's easier to find things which are today available

389
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:16.869 
but not publicly available or the people do not know how

390
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:22.209 
to find it. The many teaching materials that are available in the universities

391
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:27.499 
and the different faculties in the different study courses,

392
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.869 
there are many outside educational institutions,

393
00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.439 
public ones, private ones.

394
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.659 
So the idea of this platform is to provide an

395
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:45.709 
easy entrance to all the educational

396
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.732 
content. Content with one login so

397
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:55.249 
that it's easier to access relevant learning content with

398
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:59.210 
a personal education cloud profile and the

399
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:05.449 
forecast idea is that later on, very

400
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.919 
personal passes through these educational offers

401
00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.319 
could be shared with others.

402
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.179 
Of course, this also should be an animation for learning in the education cloud

403
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:21.709 
community, the evaluation of learning content by the

404
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:26.419 
user, the improvement of the content, the communication about learning

405
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.889 
content with other users, and the creation

406
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.322 
of interactive learning groups, these all should

407
00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.088 
be pushed forward.

408
00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:43.729 
The idea was first pitched by HPI at the

409
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.130 
National IT Summit in year 2016, as

410
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.617 
this illustration, you can see and

411
00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:58.520 
so we are happy that meanwhile a lot of money

412
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:04.559 
provided by the government, there is the idea to implement

413
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560 
this.

414
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.659 
Why do we need an education cloud?

415
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.399 
Simply to find the overview of digital learning opportunities, and this

416
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.529 
is only a few.

417
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:21.719 
The opportunities, learning opportunities that are provided

418
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.050 
for different topics by different providers

419
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:30.719 
nationally and internationally.

420
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.699 
So, one needs some kind of guidance

421
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.589 
through all this.

422
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:42.359 
In our EMOOCs, in the morning, we already started to discuss

423
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.339 
how we, at least the EMOOCs platforms and the EMOOCs providers

424
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:52.049 
can come a bit closer together so that

425
00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.468 
it's easier for the learner to see this.

426
00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:01.169 
Let me share my introduction to

427
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:05.879 
this topic of digital education by something which

428
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.539 
came out in a discussion in 2012.

429
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:14.079 
We started at that time in HPI and I mentioned this was the development of

430
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.599 
our openHPI platform and Hasso Plattner

431
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.130 
he lives in the US and is a member of the

432
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.759 
Council of the Advisory Board of Stanford University's president

433
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.929 
and there they had a discussion about universities.

434
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:39.299 
2012, this was the year when MOOCs started to become important,

435
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.859 
and then there was a discussion, the University 1.0, you

436
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.859 
know, Americans are every time very plastic

437
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:53.549 
in their visions and their descriptions, University

438
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.550 
1.0.

439
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.989 
these were the ancient universities.

440
00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:03.209 
A professor was typical in that I am a professor, was a philosopher,

441
00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:08.999 
was sitting together with his students around

442
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.468 
a tree, it was not necessarily a tree, but around together

443
00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.229 
and discussed topics.

444
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.939 
Then university 2.0, and this is what most of today's

445
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:26.609 
universities are, they originated in the historical environment

446
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.649 
of book printing.

447
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:33.149 
So, the library became the center of a university,

448
00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.369 
students physically attended classes.

449
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:41.968 
Among university's buildings, in the center, there was

450
00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:46.468 
this library and so a

451
00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:51.178 
university, our universities, universities to all are

452
00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:55.888 
around libraries. And now it's clear what they called universities

453
00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:59.969 
3.0. This was a future Web University.

454
00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.342 
University arranged around the web

455
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.610 
and as a result of the digital transformation it

456
00:35:09.611 --> 00:35:14.339 
provides learning portals on the Internet and the focus

457
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.899 
now, in this new university 3.0, is not only the young people.

458
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:23.330 
The young people, the students of today's universities it's between 20 and 25.

459
00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:27.959 
University 3.0 is focusing

460
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.979 
on all learners of each age.

461
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:37.109 
So, this is one of our learning in HPI that

462
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:42.299 
we really see you with our openHPI, as a contribution

463
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:47.069 
to the development of the University 3.0, because

464
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:51.509 
knowledge is exploding in our times, the people became older,

465
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.729 
they have to work longer.

466
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:58.229 
So, it's no longer enough to educate young people and to hope it

467
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:02.729 
works and it's enough for their full professional life, for

468
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:07.409 
them, for life. So, universities should change

469
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:12.029 
also to become responsible for providing educational

470
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:16.979 
content to interested persons of all ages

471
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:21.099 
in a way that fits our world, that fits their

472
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.209 
world. That means very easily accessible by

473
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.389 
digital technologies.

474
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.799 
And in this sense, I wish our conference all the best.

475
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.419 
I wish you to learn new, interesting things

476
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:45.149 
from the papers, from the panels, and from the interactions.

477
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:50.429 
I hope you also contribute with your experience

478
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:55.109 
in the discussion, in the coffee breaks,

479
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.789 
and so on. And we hope to come

480
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:04.379 
in closer contact to improve our

481
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.830 
efforts for digital education worldwide.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.230 
This is knowledge graphs lecture number
five knowledge graph applications

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.110 
and we start this first part of the
lecture with the last chapter

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.340 
on ontologies and now we are
going for ontologies in action.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.870 
What does that mean? So usually when
we are talking about ontologies

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.200 
we can distinguish different types
and categories of ontologies.

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.480 
There are on one hand the so
called top level ontologies that

7
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.980 
try to explain the entire world and put the
entire world into top-level categories.

8
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.880 
For that reason they are also
referred to as upper ontology or

9
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.180 
foundation ontology. Then we have
domain ontologies if it comes

10
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.470 
only lets say to describing the
knowledge of a specific domain,

11
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.810 
we have task ontologies for task, and
then we have application ontologies.

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.860 
Let's have a closer
look into each one.

13
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.580 
Again so we start with
the upper ontology.

14
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.740 
These kind of ontologies usually
are rather general. They are

15
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.000 
cross domain ontologies trying
to describe the entire world

16
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.690 
and they represent very general
concepts, for example time, space

17
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.350 
or what is an event. And as you
might remember and this also

18
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.150 
reflects the example that you
see here on the picture, this

19
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.290 
by the way is the so called
Porphyrian tree of knowledge which

20
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
is based on the ten Aristotlian
categories. You remember

21
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.320 
aristotle when he was dealing
with metaphysics he tried to

22
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.420 
create a system of categories in which
each single thing in the world

23
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.210 
could be sorted into. And exactly
this tree of knowledge here

24
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.490 
is kind of a let's say decision
algorithm that was connected

25
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.570 
to that kind of ontology. But if
I want to describe you know

26
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.260 
the world in ten categories of
course these categories have to be

27
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.460 
rather general. So all of the ontologies
that try to model the entire world

28
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.060 
they are top-level ontologies and
they are rather generic, which

29
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.340 
means they are independent of a specific
domain or of a specific problem

30
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.820 
that should be solved.

31
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.870 
If I want to solve a specific
problem in a specific domain

32
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.270 
then I come closer to so
called domain ontologies.

33
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.800 
And they are usually fundamental
concepts according to a generic domain

34
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.070 
are explained and are modeled.
So if you connect this to the

35
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.480 
upper ontology what you do there
is you specialize the terms

36
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.340 
that have been introduced in the
top level ontology. And here

37
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.960 
you have also a smart example
for example ice cream might be

38
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.980 
an interesting domain and of course
everything which is related

39
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.980 
to ice cream and can be subsumed
under ice cream then will

40
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.800 
be modelled in your
ice cream ontology.

41
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.610 
Besides the domain ontology we have the
so called task ontologies and there

42
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.450 
fundamental concepts according to a
general activity or task are modeled

43
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.310 
independent from a specific domain
and again like for the domain

44
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.820 
ontology also for the task ontology
what you do there is you

45
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.470 
specialized against some terms that previously
have been introduced within your upper

46
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.210 
ontology or your top
level ontology.

47
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.570 
And now if you are going to
combine both which means you are

48
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.950 
looking at a specific domain and you
want to solve a specific problem there

49
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.370 
you combine task and type ontology and you come
up with a so called application ontology.

50
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.700 
This means you you have a
specialized ontology focused on a

51
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.740 
specific task in a specific domain
and this is often a specialization

52
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.700 
of both task and domain ontology
and often it specifies roles

53
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.640 
played by domain entities
for specific activities.

54
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.150 
An example could be you know how
to bake a cheesecake which

55
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.210 
means you have on the one cake on the
one hand the cheesecake domain or

56
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.440 
let's say cooking domain and a
special task there baking and

57
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.770 
you bake a cheesecake. This then
will be an application ontology.

58
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.030 
So this is only for the distinction
on which level we deal with

59
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.380 
if we are talking about ontologies and
applying ontologies within knowledge graphs

60
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.360 
for specific problems.

61
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.100 
Another way to distinguish or to
differentiate different ontologies

62
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.470 
would be their level of generality
and their level of expressivity.

63
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.520 
Expressivity first means ok that
can range from rather informal

64
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.290 
which is more natural language related
to rather formal which is then more

65
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.090 
mathematical logic related. And you
deal on the one hand informally

66
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.990 
with rather lightweight ontologies
and if you go to full fledged

67
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
first order logic you deal with so
called heavyweight ontologies because

68
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.620 
there reasoning also the more
complex the ontology becomes

69
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.020 
becomes also much more difficult
complex time consuming.

70
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.470 
That's the problem. So you start usually
if you try to formalize ontologies

71
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.630 
according to that schema you
start with something like

72
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.380 
a controlled vocabulary. This
is nothing else but a list of

73
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.670 
terms that have been agreed upon
and you use these kind of

74
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.580 
terms to describe knowledge.
But it's only terms.

75
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.160 
As soon as you endorse these terms let's
say with a description and an explanation

76
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.750 
you end up in a so called glossary.
This is a list of terms

77
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.560 
where each of these terms is
explained but the explanation

78
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.400 
again is here given in
natural language.

79
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.790 
If on the other hand you start
to describe the relation

80
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.310 
between the single words you are using
then you have a so called Thesaurus.

81
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.840 
And if you are going to make some
of these relations more formal

82
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.060 
like for example you
define a hierarchy

83
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.010 
then you have this a huge sorry then
you have this taxonomy you see here

84
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.610 
which is in our timeline here
referred to as an informal is a

85
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.090 
or a formal is a

86
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.350 
representation. Informal in that sense
means you have a hierarchy where

87
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.900 
each subclass is allowed to have
several super classes and

88
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.570 
formal means there you have a strict
separation which means each subclass only

89
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.210 
is derived from a specific super
class and not more. So you avoid

90
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.960 
ambiguity and become more unique
more formal. So this is exactly

91
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.150 
the way you go. And then you
introduce more concept by concept

92
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.380 
which is again more formal and you
end up in the end with value

93
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.630 
restrictions logical constraints
and then let's say things like

94
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.180 
disjunctiveness, inversiveness,
part-of-ness. So you have

95
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.690 
then specific relations with a
specific semantic that can only

96
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.280 
be described in description
logics of first order logic and

97
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.790 
then of course we are in the
field of the so called really

98
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.970 
really heavyweight
ontology. So most times

99
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.600 
ontologies are not described in
first order logic because this

100
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.540 
is way too complicated and
the point is also then the

101
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.810 
complexity behavior
is rather bad.

102
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.450 
So we are in that are in the realm
of description logics usually

103
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.310 
for describing the stuff and
you have seen that OWL or the

104
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:45.230 
OWL dialect that we are using
here that's OWL2DL is closely

105
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.770 
connected to a specific description
logic that we are using.

106
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.280 
But beware there
are dragons.

107
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.380 
And to quote famous J R R Tolkien,
"it does not do to leave

108
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.870 
a live dragon out of your
calculations if you live near him."

109
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.470 
So what does that mean?

110
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.440 
This means don't mistake your ontology that
you have designed defined for reality.

111
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.930 
And I will give you a rather prominent
example, you know what should be

112
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.540 
avoided what kind of
pitfalls there are.

113
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.880 
Probably you know Jorge Luis Borges, this
is a rather famous author and he was

114
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.180 
librarian of the National Library
of Argentina in Buenos Aires.

115
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.280 
So a rather famous guy he wrote
lots of interesting philosophical

116
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.330 
texts and also science fiction
novels. So this guy wrote in

117
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.740 
nineteen forty two in his essay the
analytical language of John Wilkins

118
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.920 
the following. So he
introduced an ontology as

119
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.530 
various categories of animals
from "a certain Chinese

120
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.100 
encyclopedia" to show that of
course animals can be categorized

121
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.060 
also in a complete different
way, he said for example.

122
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.770 
According to that certain Chinese
encyclopedia we distinguish

123
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.270 
animals in the
following way -

124
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.770 
first class: those that belong to the
emperor, second class: embalmed ones,

125
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.690 
then those that are trained, suckling
pigs, then mermaids or sirens,

126
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.220 
fabulous ones, stray dogs, those that
are included in this classification,

127
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.080 
those that tremble as if they
were mad, honorable ones,

128
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.230 
those drawn with a very fine camel
hair brush, et cetera, and those

129
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.550 
that have just broken the flower vase, and
those that at a distance resemble flies,

130
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.380 
which of course completely
captures reality, doesn't it?

131
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:45.940 
Yeah you see if you compare this of course to
let's say taxonomies from modern biology

132
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.630 
of course that looks
completely different.

133
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.630 
Message that you have
to take home -

134
00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.270 
ontologies are not the reality.
However if we want to make use

135
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.430 
of ontologies and populate
ontologies with instances.

136
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.980 
Then we are dealing with
knowledge graphs and so far

137
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.020 
you might remember that in that
lecture we haven't given you

138
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.240 
any definition of knowledge graphs
and this will happen in the

139
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.610 
next part of
the lecture.

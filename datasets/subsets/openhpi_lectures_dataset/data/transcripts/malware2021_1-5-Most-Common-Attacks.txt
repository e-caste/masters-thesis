00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.820 
In our openHPI course about
Cyberthreats by Malware,

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.230 
we now look at some very popular
and most common attacks.

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.330 
Let's start with the so-called Denial-
of-Service (DoS) or Distributed-

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.790 
Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
attacks.

5
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.820 
DoS - this is an attack aimed to
disrupt the availability of a service

6
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.540 
on the internet. So it's
a very simple scheme

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.570 
and the availability of a service
is attacked. So

8
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.620 
for example in case
of a medical

9
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.760 
emergency service, the service can
be more used or in case of a

10
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.920 
school cloud or
other systems.

11
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.360 
This also typically is done, this attack is
performed in a distributed way. So

12
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.070 
some times also one speaks for DDoS,
Distributed Denial of Service.

13
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.160 
Here this attack is carried out from many
many different stations in the internet,

14
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.770 
typically executed by a botnet. So
it could be millions of

15
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.280 
stations that send in the same
moment and a request to a service,

16
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.980 
the service is no more able to deal with
his huge amount of request and then

17
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.420 
he becomes delayed or he even crashes.
So this is a very common attack

18
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.410 
scenario. To give an example
here the operation Avenge Assange.

19
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.300 
This was a Denial of Service
attack, a Distributed Denial of

20
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.120 
Service Attack on mastercard,
visa and other websites.

21
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.160 
And the motivation of this attack was that
it was against the political decision

22
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.650 
to stop processing
WikiLeaks donations.

23
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.760 
This was done because of some political
problems and then the attacker

24
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.480 
they attacked now the

25
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.310 
visa cards, mastercard and
websites that are involved

26
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.520 
before in that donation and because
they refused to continue they were

27
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.520 
punished. Another very serious
attack was an attack against GitHub.

28
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.370 
GitHub - that it's the worldwide
largest development platform

29
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.360 
for open source problem

30
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.110 
for open source

31
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.950 
projects and others. It is in the internet. It
provides the developers the possibility

32
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.640 
to store their documents to
work on their document there

33
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.850 
and it provides source code. The source
code of all the systems it

34
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.750 
provides and is hosting and version
control for developers. It's

35
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.900 
important if many people work
on that system and nowadays

36
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.200 
GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft.
Microsoft takes care of it

37
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.210 
and these denial of
service attacks was

38
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.550 
to disturb the work
of all these people.

39
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.870 
So there was with a maximum load
of request from 1.3 TB

40
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.860 
per second. It's
an unimaginable high

41
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.570 
amount of requests that were
sent to access the platform

42
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.400 
and the platform was no more able
to deal with that huge amount of

43
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.140 
request and load.

44
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.030 
Another very important

45
00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.560 
attack method is our attack
methods by means of malware. You

46
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.750 
all have heard about
viruses, worms, trojans.

47
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.830 
The attacks by malware is the center
of our discussion in this course.

48
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.610 
So malware - malicious software is
software that's intentionally designed

49
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.820 
to cause a damage. A damage to a computer, to a
network, to an application, to a service.

50
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.010 
I'll give a few examples. During
the course we will give more and

51
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.580 
discuss in more details.

52
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.990 
For example viruses. Viruses are
destructive mini programs

53
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.060 
that are carried by
infected application

54
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.670 
or data. Like in the real world, the
virus itself cannot run but it

55
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040 
can effect an
application

56
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.420 
or it can affect data and then
if this application is used,

57
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.790 
when this data are used then this
destructive program starts to work

58
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:09.870 
and does its worst activities. Another malware
are worms. Worms are malicious software

59
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.630 
that automatically is spread over
open network connection and the

60
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.100 
the internet. So
worms are very dangerous.

61
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.350 
Another type of malware are
trojans. Trojans are malware

62
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.690 
unintentionally installed on
computer system by a naive user.

63
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.900 
We will discuss this in more detail
and the problem with trojan is that

64
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.720 
their functionality

65
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.450 
is not what it looks like. So
the functionality differs

66
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.280 
from what the user
expects. For example

67
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.470 
it installs a backdoor or it records
a password entry in the background.

68
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.100 
When the user has
the feeling he

69
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.950 
gives in his credentials to get
access to a service, in reality

70
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.570 
he gives the credentials to the
software that looks like the

71
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.730 
real application
but is a trojan.

72
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.310 
So "Emotet" is one of an
example of such a trojan

73
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:21.160 
that's used in recent major attacks to
capture financial account details.

74
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.980 
Another very popular

75
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.490 
type of attack in the internet is
spoofing and phishing attacks.

76
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:37.440 
So spoofing is an attack that
when an attacker sends a message

77
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:44.130 
with a fake sender address. For example,
a fake IP address or an email address

78
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.810 
for example is so called CEO fraud.
CEO fraud is a fake

79
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.760 
instruction of the CEO, for example
to the accounting department

80
00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.160 
and saying there is a payment
which needs to be done to a

81
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:08.050 
banking account. And then the accounting
co-worker does this but in reality it is

82
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.390 
a spoofing mail which was used for that
CEO fraud was not sent from the CEO,

83
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.570 
it was sent with
his fake address.

84
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.420 
The spoofing is often used in connection
with phishing. And phishing, that

85
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:33.240 
method which belongs to the
social engineering methods.

86
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.870 
And with this phishing

87
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.670 
(for example) phishing mail,
a user is asked to reveal

88
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.390 
some sensitive information, for
example such a password. So

89
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.320 
in the phishing mail,
for example the

90
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.660 
sender tells, I will install some
new functionality for you

91
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.550 
to do this and I need your
password. And if the

92
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.300 
addressee is not careful

93
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.750 
and sends the password
then the password is not

94
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.800 
sent to the

95
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:16.450 
team which installs something and is responsible
for the system as system administrator,

96
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.220 
it is sent to
the attackers.

97
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:28.420 
Then the attacker use fake emails, they
use fake websites, use fake calls

98
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.610 
for their phishing
attacks.

99
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.900 
To give an example here

100
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.660 
I point to a
spoof email

101
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:46.340 
with a false sender address which
invites the user to access fake

102
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.370 
online banking or
Facebook website.

103
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.910 
And that bears a strong resemblance
to the real one, it looks like

104
00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:03.350 
the website of the bank of the user, it
looks like as a Facebook website but

105
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.490 
in reality it is not.

106
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:12.450 
It is a website that is faked by the
attacker, it looks very similar and

107
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.570 
the user is forced to do
something, for example to

108
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:25.250 
get in the password to access
his Facebook account but in reality

109
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.530 
the password is not sent to
Facebook, it is sent to the

110
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:38.060 
attacker. So the users in such
spoofing and phishing attacks

111
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:44.940 
are prompted to enter personal data, user
name, password also credit card numbers

112
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.010 
for certain reasons.
So the attackers

113
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:56.410 
try to gain the trust of the
users and then they ask for such

114
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.850 
for such credentials, for
such secret information

115
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.170 
another popular attack is
so called defacement attack.

116
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.700 
Defacement that is an attack on
a website or on a web server

117
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:16.310 
or a web service with the
intention to change its content.

118
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.570 
De-face = changing
the face.

119
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.230 
So, for example it is used for self
promotion of hacking groups,

120
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.710 
embarrassment of serious services.
So for example a couple of

121
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:35.050 
years ago there was an attack against
the website of the labour party

122
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:39.270 
which provides shortly
before an election and

123
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.220 
on the website there was a
promise that when a user

124
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:50.330 
votes for a labour, then he can
get drugs and free sex and others.

125
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.720 
This is used for attack
on service availability

126
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.070 
and phishing
for user data.

127
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.260 
So the users don't realise that the
website is unauthorised, fake.

128
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.730 
So they give in, they interact directly
with this website in the same way

129
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:16.280 
like they interact with their online
bank or with Facebook or others.

130
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:22.070 
In this way the attacker can
obtain sensitive personal data

131
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.840 
such as passwords, such as credit
card numbers and later on misuse this.

132
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.850 
Here is an example for
such a defacement.

133
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.710 
It was a defacement
of WikiLeaks,

134
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.000 
a website from 2017,
it was done by a hacker group

135
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.320 
that'S called OurMine and if in
the moment you connected to the

136
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:55.100 
WikiLeaks page,
you were on a page that looked

137
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.530 
very similar to WikiLeaks

138
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.880 
but you were
on the page

139
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.510 
by this group and all kind of
interaction was not with WikiLeaks,

140
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.780 
it was with this
OurMine group.

141
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.810 
There are more popular attack methods,
for example sniffing and eavesdropping.

142
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.130 
Sniffing is a method

143
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.650 
developed for network
diagnostics

144
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:30.480 
to give administrators a possibility
by listening to all the complete

145
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.870 
network traffic, to see and understand
whether it works error-free

146
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.690 
or whether there
is some problem.

147
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:45.450 
So the administrators can use to detect
errors, can use such snipping applications

148
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.870 
to detect errors in the network
traffic and there are

149
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:56.080 
famous sniffing software available.
For example, Wireshark is such a

150
00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.550 
sniffing software.

151
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.460 
But this software in the
hands of the attackers

152
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.390 
gives them the possibility to get in
complete insight in all the traffic

153
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:13.590 
that is communicated over the
internet. And in this way they can

154
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.700 
eavesdrop all this information.
So eavesdropping refers

155
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:26.280 
to an unauthorised sniffing,
listening to data packets on

156
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.120 
their way through
the network.

157
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.290 
Here the attacker connects to the
victim's network while collecting

158
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.390 
and analysing
IP packets

159
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.930 
with typically the
goal to capture personal data

160
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.120 
or other confidential private data,
for example they filter all

161
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.730 
the traffic for
password or other

162
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.720 
keywords to get access
to the data the users

163
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.370 
have put in
and transmitted.

164
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.920 
This is possible in the case
if data are unencrypted.

165
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.740 
If the data are encrypted which
are transported over the internet

166
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.930 
then the attacker can eavesdrop
all the communication but they

167
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.860 
cannot understand and cannot see
what is the information about.

168
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.120 
So encrypted traffic
can be recorded

169
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.020 
and if the encryption is not
strong enough, then the attacker

170
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.460 
also have the possibility later
on the recorded data to

171
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.890 
decrypt the recorded
data but in any case

172
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.850 
to only send
encrypted data

173
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:47.220 
is a very important protection
against such eavesdropping attacks.

174
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.790 
There are further attacks on computer systems
for example can unauthorized

175
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:59.860 
physical access to a computer system,
to the theft of laptops,

176
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:05.540 
by means of the theft of a smartphone,
by breaking into a server room

177
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:11.830 
of a company or others. Then, social engineering
attacks are very important.

178
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.800 
And not only to steal passwords
like in the example

179
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.320 
of phishing, but also to install
malware and other things.

180
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:29.170 
Then attacks to decrypt personal data,
password cracking, password guessing

181
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:35.200 
are very popular attacks. There are many
more but only to give you an idea

182
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:41.480 
there are very different
ways how cybercriminals

183
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.790 
try to get the data
of the users,

184
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.610 
how they try to break
into the systems,

185
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:57.050 
how to disturb the work of the
systems and malware of course

186
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.590 
is a very important

187
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.690 
attack method which we
discuss in more detail

188
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.070 
in this course.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.790 
hi my name is Benjamin Xie.
and i'm a phd candidate at the

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.020 
university of washington seattle, a university which acknowledges

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.360 
the coast salish peoples of this land.
the land which such touches

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.930 
the shared waters of all tribes and bands within the duwamish prelim

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.010 
suquamish tulalip and muckle shute nations.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.050 
and i'm here to present work on behalf of my colleagues
at the university of washington information school,

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.150 
college of education and co dot org.

8
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.090 
so we use tests for a lot of things university,  use scores for

9
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.500 
tests such as the bcs exam to determine if a student should

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.390 
be accepted into university or major.
teachers use test for some purposes such as grading.

11
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.630 
and students use test to self assess what they know.

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.990 
and the results can affect their self-efficacy.

13
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
but how do we know how good our tests are.

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.130 
and how different people interpret and use tests is important.

15
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.930 
but tests are very imperfect measures of knowledge.

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.100 
so to understand how good a test is, we have to make a few assumptions.

17
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.560 
so following item response theory or ayer t. we can assume that

18
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.950 
student knowledge and question difficulty are on the same continuous dimension.

19
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.100 
so say we have questions a, b and c where a is the least difficult

20
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.020 
question c is the most difficult question.

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.420 
say two students michelle and jorge answer these questions.

22
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.590 
so based on their responses to these questions
we can estimate their knowledge levels.

23
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.930 
so michelle's knowledge level somewhere between b and c,

24
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
because she got question b correct and question c incorrect and by

25
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.270 
similar logic jorge his knowledge is between a and b.

26
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.610 
so now say we want to look at a group of students who reported

27
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.460 
as male in a group who reported as female.

28
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.380 
all students got questions a and c correct.

29
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.370 
and we would expect them to get question b correct as well.

30
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.730 
and say all students who reported as male do get the question b correct.

31
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.560 
but say we observe that most students reported
as female got question b wrong.

32
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.240 
so the toy example that demonstrates differential item functioning are dif,

33
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.880 
where students have similar knowledge levels.

34
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.140 
but different groups genders in this case perform
differently on an item,

35
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.820 
question b in this example.

36
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.090 
so dif is a technique to identify potential bias in test questions.

37
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.210 
but rather what if we could use dif to improve how equitably we teach,

38
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.470 
so data on dif can help identify or substantiate nuance patterns
related to disparities or bias.

39
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.820 
but we need the domain expertise

40
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.020 
of stakeholders such as students teachers
and curriculum designers to interpret,

41
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.640 
and use these findings to take equitable action.

42
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.920 
so this paper explores how domain experts curriculum designers.

43
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.990 
and in this case might be able to interpret
and use gender and race based

44
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.200 
diff for equity related goals.

45
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.920 
for the study partnered with code org a nonprofit dedicated to

46
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.350 
inclusive computing education,
and we analyzed responses from

47
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.680 
about two twenty thousand students
who used the middle school computer science,

48
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.640 
discoveries or cst curriculum.

49
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.210 
the seventeen questions i analyzed rather matching questions,

50
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.590 
or multiple choice questions,
so matching questions required students to place

51
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.580 
options in their correct locations,
and multiple choice questions

52
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.540 
required students to choose one or two options.

53
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.920 
so our quantitative analysis focused on checking for potential

54
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.750 
test bias by gender and race.

55
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.300 
so we say that a question is bias,
if on average a student from

56
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.620 
a disadvantage group is at least five percent less likely to

57
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.450 
get that question correct compared to a student of similar

58
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.660 
knowledge from the other group.

59
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.350 
this is the equivalent of checking for both statistical significance,

60
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.520 
as well as a medium- or large effect size.

61
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.270 
we found two questions disadvantage students reported as female

62
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.880 
compared to students reported as male.

63
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.450 
and actually most questions thirteen of our seventeen disadvantaged

64
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.930 
h and p students who include african slash black hispanic slash latin x,

65
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.550 
native slash alaskan native and pacific islander students,

66
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.210 
when compared to wh students who include white nation students.

67
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.510 
so put together we can say that students have equivalent knowledge,

68
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.350 
but different genders or and races would score differently on the csd
assessment.

69
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.370 
so as a whole the test disadvantages age and p and

70
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.310 
reported female students the most and advantages wh students the most.

71
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.680 
but dif does not tell us the cause of this bias or what to do about it.

72
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.290 
so understand that we conducted a remote workshop
with seven coder curriculum designers.

73
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.390 
and had them interpret the dif findings.

74
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.610 
so all this was an effort to understand a new use for def improving

75
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.110 
the equity in learning by informing domain experts of potential issues.

76
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.730 
so here are a few high level takeaways by encourage you to

77
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.850 
read the paper through to dive deeper into these findings.

78
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.560 
so first was that curriculum designers considered how test design

79
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.020 
may have introduced bias with some in identifying how matching question type questions

80
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.350 
disadvantaged students report is female.

81
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.990 
curriculum designers also considered how the curriculum may

82
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.760 
or may not have prepared students for test questions.

83
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.310 
so in one case designers acknowledged that comment in code was a
skill worth learning.

84
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.550 
but may not have but they may students

85
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.850 
may not have been well prepared for a question like this
from the curriculum.

86
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.740 
so considering how specific aspects of testing curriculum design

87
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.180 
may contribute to bias is a potential first step to making changes

88
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.630 
that support more equitable learning experiences.

89
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.670 
iterating towards more equitable learning experiences requires

90
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.630 
measuring factors we cannot easily into it.
and using domain expertise

91
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.160 
to contextualize these findings with understanding we cannot

92
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.880 
easily measure.

93
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.010 
as a lot of potential future work
which include engaging additional stakeholders,

94
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.370 
using human-centered ai techniques to enrich data with domain expertise.

95
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.920 
and monitoring the effects of interventions
by continuously monitor measuring diff.

96
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.040 
i encourage you to read the paper to learn more about validity

97
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.690 
evidence why our analysis of non-binary students' responses
related if required

98
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
additional contextualization to really interpret and challenges that

99
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.860 
designers had interpreting death.

100
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.880 
but the main take-away is this.

101
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.250 
data can help us identify the  existence and extent of biases,
but it really tells us nothing about the causes.

102
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.810 
so we need to main expert

103
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.160 
help us identify the causes and to take equitable action.

104
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.920

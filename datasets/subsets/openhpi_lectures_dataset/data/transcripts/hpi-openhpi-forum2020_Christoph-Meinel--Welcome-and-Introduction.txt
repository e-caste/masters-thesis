1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.061 
I would like to welcome you very warmly
to our openHPI Forum 2020.

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:11.666 
And this comes in a completely different form,
than we had the last few years.

3
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:23.799 
There we could meet, had impulses from the different speakers,
then discussed it, sat together, did workshops,
were able to talk to each other during the breaks, exchange ideas.

4
00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:27.408 
Corona makes this impossible this year.

5
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:38.492 
This will also determine a part of my presentation,
but maybe it's also interesting to see the openHPI forum in this form,
to experience how we want to do this this year.

6
00:00:38.492 --> 00:00:47.877 
We want to organize this ourselves as a small MOOC event,
we want to give the different impulses spread over two weeks.

7
00:00:47.877 --> 00:00:55.236 
We will also have workshops, live workshops,
but everything virtually, without the chance to talk to each other.

8
00:00:55.236 --> 00:01:05.666 
Welcome to the HPI
and more precisely at the Open Campus of HPI.

9
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:14.509 
Open Campus, openHPI, what you know is of course a very important building block,
perhaps also the most important component of this Open Campus.

10
00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:27.336 
But as an institute, Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering
with a very small and fine group of students
- we currently have about 700 students here at HPI -

11
00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:37.534 
is the importance of the Open Campus
far beyond this small number of students and staff.

12
00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:48.158 
We have big conferences, we record it,
We also record the teaching process,
this is here with our tele-task system, this is this case.

13
00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:56.032 
So then any event that takes place can,
whether this is a lecture or a conference, can simply be recorded.

14
00:01:56.032 --> 00:02:09.651 
We have a tele-task portal, www.tele-task.de, where the recordings are then available,
you can also follow the past years of our openHPI forum there.

15
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:22.713 
And then of course we have our big MOOC platform, openHPI, with the courses,
- I will come back to numbers later -
with the large crowd of learners,

16
00:02:22.713 --> 00:02:31.778 
where we offer courses mainly on the subject of digitization,
but also design thinking, entrepreneurship plays a role.

17
00:02:31.778 --> 00:02:41.504 
And then, when we talk about digital education,
then the HPI School Cloud Project is a very important one,

18
00:02:41.504 --> 00:02:54.631 
where it is about creating a platform, creating an integrating platform
for the schools in Germany, so that finally also
can start using digital materials in class.

19
00:02:54.631 --> 00:03:07.248 
This is not only due to the missing devices,
and the lack of WLAN equipment as well,
that the learners can then access the individual learning contents in compliance with data protection regulations.

20
00:03:07.248 --> 00:03:16.805 
These are located in the HPI School Cloud in our Learning Store,
but there is also the workplace, the digital workplace with an office system,

21
00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:28.604 
with video conferencing system for the virtual classroom,
Messenger and other things you need if you really want to work digitally.

22
00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:35.392 
But our openHPI forum is about MOOCs,
the Massive Open Online Courses.

23
00:03:35.392 --> 00:03:47.808 
And the idea that has always guided us in this topic is:
E-learning, digital learning must not and must not be lonely.

24
00:03:47.808 --> 00:03:58.080 
And the idea of then simply not saying how we do it in our tele-task archive,
here are the records, you are welcome to follow them, but to say

25
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:07.116 
no, we invite you, next week we start with a course on the topic
Learn programming languages, on the subject of how the Internet works,

26
00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:13.434 
on the subject of cyber security or - just walked-
on the topic of Digital Health.

27
00:04:13.434 --> 00:04:21.059 
So the Massive Open Online courses, which means to invite a lot of learners,
to participate in such a kiss.

28
00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:35.565 
The platform that then offers these learners the opportunity
to interact with each other in the discussion forums,
this is the secret of the success of this way of presenting knowledge.

29
00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:49.462 
And so openHPI is as the European MOOC pioneer - we started in 2012,
to offer such MOOCs, have always developed our platform further,

30
00:04:49.462 --> 00:05:01.428 
that they can then also work with the courses
between 5 between 20,000 enrollments per week,
that this is true in terms of performance, that there is a lot of functionality.

31
00:05:01.428 --> 00:05:14.775 
So with openHPI.de we have now become Germany's largest lecture hall,
as we like to speak with a smile to the outside world.

32
00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:24.906 
This knowledge can be used free of charge,
you can make certificates, even qualified certificates,
then you have to switch on the camera in the exam situations.

33
00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:33.509 
The knowledge is presented in the form of these short clips,
which then address individual topics,

34
00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:41.407 
which are then followed by self-testsehr, where you can check immediately,
I understood what the course was about.

35
00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:53.671 
At the end of the week there will be
- in one week, ten to twelve video clips are collected -
at the end of the week there is the opportunity to do homework.

36
00:05:53.671 --> 00:06:03.842 
This homework is important, this is always one hour, where you can ask
to these contents presented last week must answer correctly.

37
00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:08.332 
These are important if you want to obtain a certificate at the end of the process.

38
00:06:08.332 --> 00:06:20.281 
That a Hasso Plattner Institute would make such an offer,
this is not primarily aimed at students.

39
00:06:20.281 --> 00:06:26.332 
We also use this for training here internally at HPI,
but here you can see an age distribution,

40
00:06:26.332 --> 00:06:37.497 
that it is mainly about these groups, the 30 to 60 year olds,
this is the main clientele that wants to learn something,

41
00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:49.835 
who wants to keep up with what she has learned in her studies,
to the topics in computer science, to programming,
on IT architectures, on digitization projects.

42
00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:58.971 
And we are always very pleased,
to have also very senior participants,
and of course the boys are also very welcome.

43
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:04.179 
Here the learner activity is distributed over the week.

44
00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:11.040 
Since the system was developed by us,
we can see very precisely when it is concentrated.

45
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:26.991 
This can sometimes be seen across time zones,
whereby already clearly the concentration is here on a listenership in Europe,
88 percent of users come from Europe.

46
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:40.673 
We ask our listeners to tell us a little bit about themselves, and we find out,
that this is typically not at all the layman in the field of digitization,

47
00:07:40.673 --> 00:08:00.351 
but because often more than five years of professional experience are already there,
that are learners who are at work, family, who want to stay on,
because things change very quickly in IT and in the IT sector.

48
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:11.970 
And there is also a clear majority who take part in these courses,
not only out of private interest, but in the imagination,
to promote your career as well.

49
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:20.944 
The interesting thing, and I will give you such a small parade
of MOOC platforms from the HPI,

50
00:08:20.944 --> 00:08:29.017 
that we have partners in business, in society, who have said
Man, that's not just for a university

51
00:08:29.017 --> 00:08:36.962 
a great form of knowledge transfer into society,
but that is also in our field.

52
00:08:36.962 --> 00:08:53.165 
SAP, as the first enterprise platform, or the World Health Organization
who say that we can benefit from the fact that we have the opportunity
to get in contact with interested people.

53
00:08:53.165 --> 00:09:02.959 
So openHPI, this is the platform, the openHPI platform,
which is supported and equipped by HPI.

54
00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:09.160 
This is the oldest, this is the mother of these different platforms,
2012 as already mentioned.

55
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:20.181 
We currently have just over 800,000 course registrations,
we have about a quarter of a million registered learners

56
00:09:20.181 --> 00:09:35.218 
We have already issued 85,000 certificates, the certificates of participation,
it is easier to obtain, you have to do this homework
and final exams do not require a corresponding number of points,

57
00:09:35.218 --> 00:09:41.014 
but there one must essentially deal with the topic,
there are more than 170,000.

58
00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:50.473 
And the range of topics is internet, web, cyber security, AI
to topics such as Digital Health or Design Thinking.

59
00:09:50.473 --> 00:09:58.096 
So we see that we are here with our program,
of course this must fit into the HPI's processes,

60
00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:05.977 
so we don't have a big team here now to provide content,
but that is what the professors from their departments do,

61
00:10:05.977 --> 00:10:15.469 
also students participate, successfully offer courses
who then, I would say, prepare and carry it out alongside their usual duties.

62
00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:26.006 
So how can you learn a programming language,
these are then beyond these quizzes, which are essentially multiple choice.

63
00:10:26.006 --> 00:10:37.985 
Then the possibility with our CodeOcean, that is what we call the system,
where the learners also use fragments of programs as exercises,
can submit program constructions,

64
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:44.044 
which are then automatically checked
on correctness and functionality.

65
00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:52.951 
But there are also topics addressed here, I see just this one course
"Trolls, hate and fake news how we can save the Internet",

66
00:10:52.951 --> 00:11:01.123 
so we have learned more and more over the years
in this occupation with the offer of digital contents,

67
00:11:01.123 --> 00:11:09.341 
that there might be an order to the HPI,
to make contributions to digital education.

68
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:20.642 
How enlightenment played a big role 250 years ago after absolutism,
when bourgeois society began to build universities out of the ground,

69
00:11:20.642 --> 00:11:27.283 
because it was about preparing people
to a self-responsible, self-determined life.

70
00:11:27.283 --> 00:11:32.344 
The king no longer told us how to live,
but the citizens have taken this into their own hands.

71
00:11:32.344 --> 00:11:42.050 
And for this you need knowledge, and if we are self-determined
and want to move independently in the new digital world,
Here too, education is needed.

72
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:55.906 
SAP, yes, he has a family connection to HPI through its founder Hasso Plattner,
that was the first Enterprise MOOC platform worldwide.

73
00:11:55.906 --> 00:12:06.334 
They saw the potential very early on, and they started in 2013,
we said, can we use your platform

74
00:12:06.334 --> 00:12:14.948 
Of course it has to be SAP-branded, we were very happy to do that,
they have supported us in the further development of the platform.

75
00:12:14.948 --> 00:12:30.160 
So openSAP with 4.6 million course registrations,
1 million registered learners, i.e. almost 500,000, almost half a million certificates,

76
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:42.825 
1 million participation certificates, and the range of topics
On the one hand, internal training for SAP employees is offered,
but much more also offers for the public.

77
00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:57.021 
They explain the SAP products in detail how to use them,
how to get it going, what different offers are available,

78
00:12:57.021 --> 00:13:09.647 
but also to the point that charity themes are specified,
that further training is also given in topics that are not even SAP-related,
the issues that affect digitization, such as security.

79
00:13:09.647 --> 00:13:21.422 
That was now the mooc.house in the platform, our white label platform,
where partners have come and said we want to try this first.

80
00:13:21.422 --> 00:13:33.743 
Before we want to operate our own platform there,
let's first see what kind of access it has,
how can we integrate this into the internal processes?

81
00:13:33.743 --> 00:13:45.301 
So there are courses from the Charité, there are courses from companies,
HPI start-up SIGNAVIO, the acatech has run several courses here,

82
00:13:45.301 --> 00:13:58.754 
and we started with the School Cloud,
To offer information material, instructions for use in the form of MOOCs on this platform.

83
00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:12.894 
This is currently the largest platform in this sense with over 2 million registered learners,
the biggest openHPI platform, namely me openWHO.org.

84
00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:33.987 
And this explosion, it is corona-induced, at that time the world health
- back then - that was 2016 - has come into conversation with us, he said,
yes, if, there was just Ebola again very problematic in the African states,

85
00:14:33.987 --> 00:14:44.159 
they said,
"Yes, when that starts, such an epidemic, our traditional servers,
when people download information, very quickly it is no longer available,

86
00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:48.922 
can't we use your system to deliver a little more systematic knowledge?"

87
00:14:48.922 --> 00:15:11.418 
That was before Corona, yes, I don't know, so 50,000, 100,000 course enrollments,
and then, during the lockdown, during corona, that's skyrocketed,
50,000 new registrations every day for weeks.

88
00:15:11.418 --> 00:15:28.891 
Well, we were mostly in home office,
that smoked quite a lot here, that we could make sure
that these many, many learners worldwide could then be served in a performant way.

89
00:15:28.891 --> 00:15:46.762 
The parade is not over yet, I want to mention lernen.cloud again here
this is a further education platform for teachers,
provided by HPI in the context of this school cloud development.

90
00:15:46.762 --> 00:15:56.116 
For what we have seen, of course, in this preoccupation with this topic,
the schools, especially during the school closures, they were not trained

91
00:15:56.116 --> 00:16:08.562 
how to now use the digital channel to teach,
in order to set and work on certain topics in student working groups.

92
00:16:08.562 --> 00:16:14.764 
So mostly they were not even technically equipped
with the corresponding necessities.

93
00:16:14.764 --> 00:16:26.684 
But as soon as this has succeeded in creating an Internet connection,
then it was of course a matter of now this Internet connection
and to use this connection to the students, also for learning opportunities.

94
00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:34.302 
And since we have tried to learn on this platform.cloud
- you are welcome to have a look at it - because materials are available,

95
00:16:34.302 --> 00:16:46.196 
helping teachers and helping female teachers to take the first steps
in the use of these digital teaching materials,
to deal with it a bit more confidently

96
00:16:46.196 --> 00:16:52.898 
and then to use them in the classroom,
now in the questions, where it is not yet so clear, as how it continues.

97
00:16:52.898 --> 00:17:06.127 
We have established new platforms, for example the AI Campus Germany,
this is to become a learning platform for artificial intelligence in Germany,

98
00:17:06.127 --> 00:17:22.363 
where the different learning offers are provided on one platform,
in order to promote a quick start, quick learning;
the Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding this project.

99
00:17:22.363 --> 00:17:33.991 
And another platform that is already in the works, which will soon be launched,
is eGov, the eGov Campus, which is an education and training platform for e-government,

100
00:17:33.991 --> 00:17:44.106 
driven from the Hessian State Chancellery, but of course for all German states
and administrative, training courses are accessible.

101
00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:55.206 
And then Humboldts17, which is a project of the Humboldt University of Berlin,
where a sustainability platform is provided.

102
00:17:55.206 --> 00:18:01.276 
So different planning stages,
we are happy about new partners in this area.

103
00:18:01.276 --> 00:18:20.162 
Now the topic of our openHPI forum is a bit of a piece,
what has Corona done in the field of digital education,
what influence has Corona-19 had on the MOOC landscape?

104
00:18:20.162 --> 00:18:28.197 
And of course, during the lockdown
was an enormous increase to be seen in online teaching.

105
00:18:28.197 --> 00:18:37.513 
People had time, people were interested, they were not distracted,
have looked where I can get further education,

106
00:18:37.513 --> 00:18:44.038 
how can I make myself fit in my professional life
how can I possibly further educate myself on a new topic?

107
00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:51.304 
And so the user numbers are actually
in all the above mentioned platforms.

108
00:18:51.304 --> 00:19:02.849 
That that now with the platform openWHO.org,
i.e. the World Health Organization, is a matter of course.

109
00:19:02.849 --> 00:19:11.859 
But we have also seen in the other topics, openSAP or openHPI,
that there is an increased use.

110
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:21.172 
Here are a few numbers from the decisive month
times compared to the annual figures from 2019.

111
00:19:21.172 --> 00:19:41.202 
That means in 30 days, March 15 to April 15, there will be more traffic,
more content has been used, a higher number of visits
on the platforms than in the entire year 2019.

112
00:19:41.202 --> 00:19:57.006 
Here are now times so own characteristics, thus these Unique Learner, that is thus,
how many registrations on the platform there are, times now the numbers up to August.

113
00:19:57.006 --> 00:20:05.278 
Here you can see, of course all rising, but of course especially dramatic, blue,
this is the openWHO platform.

114
00:20:05.278 --> 00:20:20.645 
We have measured the enrollments, that is what we observe,
that many participants, i.e. at openHPI that is on average more than two courses,
that registered participants make,

115
00:20:20.645 --> 00:20:32.324 
where you see, slight increase, rapid increase, here from the 500.000 range
into the 4 million range, so, this already proves

116
00:20:32.324 --> 00:20:47.183 
that when you see what creates such a crisis, namely to develop awareness,
that we have to stick to the fact that there are digital channels,
which can be used to learn.

117
00:20:47.183 --> 00:20:53.597 
Here again the user numbers and registrations
compared to the entire previous year.

118
00:20:53.597 --> 00:21:00.505 
So you see,
Corona has already had a dramatic impact on the crisis.

119
00:21:00.505 --> 00:21:10.656 
What were we thinking at openHPI,
how can we satisfy this demand with special offers?

120
00:21:10.656 --> 00:21:19.775 
And that's what happens when a course is over,
then you can no longer participate, you can no longer take the exam.

121
00:21:19.775 --> 00:21:26.305 
Then you can still access the material,
but you cannot make a certificate.

122
00:21:26.305 --> 00:21:38.531 
Now we have thought, man, this is no longer ideal,
because ideally, when the course is up and running, there is this large group of learners,
who then also interact and talk to each other in the discussion forum.

123
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:49.355 
But if someone wants to go through this course material alone,
then he should also have the chance to take the exams, the homework, the weekly

124
00:21:49.355 --> 00:21:59.805 
and to take the course exam at the end and should do so,
as if he had attended the course normally,
have the chance to obtain a certificate.

125
00:21:59.805 --> 00:22:10.749 
So we checked which courses have expired, not the content,
but which courses, which were already finished, make sense to be reactivated.

126
00:22:10.749 --> 00:22:18.323 
So we chose eight courses,
that was a piece like that a try out, is there a demand,

127
00:22:18.323 --> 00:22:28.029 
and you see what there is a demand for it,
5,400 new registrations in these eight re-opened courses.

128
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:40.324 
Well, that is also an idea, the material that is already there,
even if it is not in the ideal form,
that you can also learn and interact with others.

129
00:22:40.324 --> 00:22:50.628 
And a second topic was of course school, school, where it was suddenly clear,
there is missing content, there is missing digital content.

130
00:22:50.628 --> 00:23:00.528 
Not so much that the students ended up with equipment,
there were many, many people with devices, even the domestic computers,
that are used there and laptops.

131
00:23:00.528 --> 00:23:13.672 
So we have the courses offered under openHPI-Junior anyway
now again in interaction with teachers,

132
00:23:13.672 --> 00:23:19.810 
you can somehow organize it that way, the course,
that it fits into the school curriculum.

133
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:30.739 
And there came such ideas that we started these programming courses,
that we offer to Python, to Java, that we have stretched those,

134
00:23:30.739 --> 00:23:40.877 
so that the weekly dose was reduced and corresponded exactly to that,
what is done during the week at school,

135
00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:48.348 
and have thus offered this offer of courses once stretched
as well as that we offer these courses, which are

136
00:23:48.348 --> 00:23:52.183 
and are aimed specifically at schoolchildren,
repeated there.

137
00:23:52.183 --> 00:24:00.985 
So Corona has greatly increased the demand for digital learning services.

138
00:24:00.985 --> 00:24:09.119 
We have tried to react to this, in this difficult time,
as far as this was possible.

139
00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:18.316 
We have seen that our partners in the partner platforms have done this
and will do so now - it is not yet so far -

140
00:24:18.316 --> 00:24:25.712 
but when there is a post-Corona period
will certainly continue to nurture many of the ideas and approaches.

141
00:24:25.712 --> 00:24:34.660 
I wish you many more insights and good interactions
as part of our openHPI Forum 2020.

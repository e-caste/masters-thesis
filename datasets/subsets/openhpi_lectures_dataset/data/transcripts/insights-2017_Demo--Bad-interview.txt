00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.840 
- Thanks Basta that you came for the interview.

2
00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:16.080 
I would right start into the interview.

3
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:17.110 
- What did you do?

4
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:20.800 
- Oh, that is just a recording. - For what?

5
00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:25.100 
Well, I usually record all the interviews that I do.

6
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.840 
- Why? - Just for me to listen to it again,

7
00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:29.960 
when I go back.

8
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:30.810 
- So you don't publish?

9
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.190 
- No, no it's not going to be published.

10
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:34.710 
It’s for my personal use.

11
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:36.250 
- OK.

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.790 
- So my first question is,

13
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.730 
how long do you work at your job?

14
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:43.000 
- I’m working there since two years.

15
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:49.120 
- And what do you do in your job?

16
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.180 
- I work for money. [laughs]

17
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:55.200 
OK, but I…

18
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.670 
- No, I mean like what do you do?

19
00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:57.340 
Like not

20
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.950 
what you work for but

21
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.210 
what do you do? What are your tasks?

22
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:06.340 
- My task is to test business ideas,

23
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:08.220 
if they could work out or not.

24
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.920 
So basically, I have a process, I start with one sentence.

25
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.680 
I do a semantic analysis, break down

26
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:16.600 
what's in there. Then I have a look

27
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:19.240 
which branches are in there.

28
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:22.070 
How big is the market? How

29
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:25.020 
big could be our market share? Then I look at the product…

30
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:25.730 
- OK, so you would say

31
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.880 
it's rather straight forward what you do,

32
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:28.990 
it's always the same

33
00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:31.520 
what you do? - Well, it’s straight forward.

34
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:32.430 
In a few months

35
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:34.650 
we want to see if something works out or not.

36
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:37.940 
And… it's straight forward.

37
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.910 
- OK, straight forward.

38
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:43.590 
And… you're happy with your job?

39
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:47.470 
- With the job… with my colleague yes,

40
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:48.600 
but with the job, it’s…

41
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:49.780 
- No, I mean

42
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:51.670 
with the job not your colleagues.

43
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:55.250 
- Well, it became boring.

44
00:01:56.181 --> 00:02:00.530 
- Became boring, OK.

45
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:03.990 
But before you had the job,

46
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:06.990 
can you tell me how you found the job?

47
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:09.740 
- The job I had before?

48
00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:12.630 
- No, no the job that you're working in, so still

49
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.600 
your current job. - At the beginning

50
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:17.760 
nice, after one year

51
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.640 
even nicer, then my learning curve was going down.

52
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:22.970 
And now it's boring.

53
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:26.400 
- But I asked how you found the job and not

54
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:29.110 
how happy you are with the job.

55
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:29.980 
- The channel how I found the job?

56
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:31.320 
- Yeah.

57
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:31.700 
- OK.

58
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:35.480 
I put a job alert.

59
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:40.800 
- Job alert. - Yeah, and in the job alert… - That's stressful, no?

60
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:45.480 
Like to use job alert? - Yeah, it’s annoying. Having

61
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:46.630 
every time every day,

62
00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:48.840 
the emails in your inbox.

63
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:52.020 
And going through, it's annoying.

64
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:55.340 
And also, I don't like the color of their website.

65
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.300 
It’s just horrible.

66
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.960 
- Are you looking for a new job at the moment?

67
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:10.640 
- Yeah, I'm looking for a new job.

68
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.640 
- So if you go to job alert,

69
00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:18.390 
how many… alerts are you looking at?

70
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:20.960 
- Well, I receive…

71
00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:26.830 
- Just a number. - 3 to 80 per day. - OK, 3 to 80.

72
00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:29.060 
- Jobs, not alerts. - Yeah, OK, jobs.

73
00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:33.990 
These are all my questions.

74
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:36.690 
I think I got answers to each of them.

75
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:41.640 
So, thank you for the interview. - You're welcome.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.460 
For this week we want to focus on
the Iterative process, which is

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.040 
one of the three core elements of
Design Thinking and we want to

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.100 
focus quite a bit on the details
of the process. Yes, there's

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.890 
a big discussing what is the right
way, is it a six-step process,

6
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
five-step process is it a four-step
process, is it circles,

7
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.880 
rectangles, hexagons, or whatever.
And if you look at the

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.630 
internet you get a little bit
confused because Design Thinking

9
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.910 
is very much focused just on the
process. But as you learned, there

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
are two other very core
elements of Design Thinking.

11
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.700 
Zooming into the process will lead
us to different steps. Exactly,

12
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.110 
and it actually starts with
finding the right starting point

13
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.100 
for the process, so that
means how to frame

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.880 
a challenge and also how
to find the question you

15
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.290 
want to find answers to. Then
also, how to set up the whole

16
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.620 
project, how to frame it right in terms
of time, what is the right timing,

17
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.520 
how can I scale the timing, can I
do a fast forward or run through

18
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.670 
in a very short amount of time, and
also how to scale at the end?

19
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.710 
And this is what we want to show to
you, so also that iteration is just

20
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.440 
not only going back and forth from
a process but really taking

21
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.510 
it through iterative loops to
the next level, that then also

22
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.110 
can lead you to really scale and
scope your Design Thinking

23
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.230 
projects in the future.

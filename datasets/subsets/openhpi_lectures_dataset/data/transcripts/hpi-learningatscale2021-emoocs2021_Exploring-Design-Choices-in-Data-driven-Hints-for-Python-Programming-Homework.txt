00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.950 
hello i'm thomas price. and i'm excited to talk with you today

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.640 
about design choices for data driven programming.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.500 
a work i did with my students marwan and my colleague
joseph jay williams.

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.960 
today i'll be talking about data driven algorithms
for generating code heads

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.930 
that tell a student what to do next when they're programming.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.930 
for example, it might tell the student to replace true with false

7
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.650 
at a certain point in their code.

8
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.310 
now there are a number of these systems that have been developed.

9
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.640 
and they've all made slightly different choices about how to display

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.250 
the hints that are generated by the algorithm. for example, how

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.250 
should a hint be chosen? where should it be displayed and how

12
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.100 
much detail should the hint include?

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.500 
to explore these questions we deployed a system called code checker.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.220 
that makes specific decisions about how to display hence.

15
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.560 
we deployed this system with over a thousand students in a cs.

16
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
one course and collected survey responses student interviews

17
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.560 
and an instructor interview in order to understand the student

18
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.140 
perceptions of our design choices.

19
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.220 
a fundamental choice that a system must make is where to display their hand.

20
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.750 
we chose to annotate the students' code with symbols indicating

21
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.120 
different types of hands, like a red strike through for deletion,

22
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.620 
a plus to indicate code that should be added.

23
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.260 
and a plus with a strike through to indicate code that
should be replaced.

24
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.900 
by hovering over any of these symbols or strike throughs the

25
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.810 
student would get a pop-up message explaining the hint further.

26
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.740 
this allows us to put the hint where it's most relevant.
but there are alternatives.

27
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.350 
for example, some hint systems simply give a line and a column number

28
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.610 
and then explain the hint. this decouples the hint from the

29
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.940 
code and may make it easier to maintain these systems.

30
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.620 
when we asked students about this design decision.

31
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.820 
they told us that the hint annotations helped direct their attention

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.320 
to where there were errors were in the code.

33
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.630 
and together they gave a sort of overview of potential problems.

34
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.530 
as one student said what's helpful is. it's highlighted in a

35
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.250 
way that gets pretty apparent. it's a lot more visual.

36
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.520 
however there's also a drawback. because we're embedding hints

37
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.440 
in students code we have to use symbols and some students
had difficulty interpreting them.

38
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.270 
for example, what's the difference between a red strike through?

39
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
and a purple strike through? and what exactly does this plus icon mean?

40
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.240 
this was explained in the hint interface but not all students

41
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.520 
seem to notice or understand the explanations.

42
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.390 
a data driven algorithm may generate multiple hands.

43
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.660 
and a system has to choose which one or ones to show to the student.

44
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.720 
in code checker we decided to let the student browse all hands.

45
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.850 
and then select the hint that's most relevant to them.

46
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.590 
this is because a system selected hint may not always address

47
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.050 
the student's key concern.
and seeing multiple hands gives an

48
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.610 
overview of things that may be wrong with one's code.

49
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.340 
however, they're all alternatives the system could select the

50
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.950 
hint for the student. this is simpler and it helps students

51
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.460 
who don't know what's wrong with their code find a hint immediately.

52
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.300 
when we asked the students about this design choice,

53
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.740 
they told us that multiple hints could be overwhelming.

54
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.920 
this was especially the case when there are many hints on screen

55
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.670 
at the same time. as one student said with so many options you get lost.

56
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.130 
it becomes overwhelming that i don't actually know what i'm doing wrong.

57
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.890 
to address this students suggested that we add more structure to the hand

58
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.640 
for example presenting hints one at a time in a sequence.

59
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.300 
the instructor suggested a compromise between these approaches.

60
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.010 
to present a single best hand that the system thinks is most relevant.

61
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.860 
but to still allow the student to see and browse alternatives.

62
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.080 
those are all the results i have time to share, but if you have

63
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.070 
questions or comments please get in touch and read the rest

64
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.210 
of the paper for more. thanks for your time.

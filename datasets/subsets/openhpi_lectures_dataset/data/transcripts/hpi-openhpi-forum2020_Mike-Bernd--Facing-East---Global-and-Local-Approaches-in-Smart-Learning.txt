00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.660 
hello my name's Mike Bernd from
the KI campus project and

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.650 
the topic of today's presentation
is facing east global and

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.330 
local approaches in smart learning.
why facing east? because

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.910 
we are going to have a use case from
china and why local approaches?

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.560 
we are going to see to small local
approaches from german smart

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
learning environments or soon to
be smart learning environments.

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.400 
and yeah let's get
into the topic

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.890 
smart learning or smart learning
environments. what is this?

9
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.840 
this is a quite complex approach,
and most people think when

10
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.720 
they think about smart learning. because
it's smart. it's entirely digital.

11
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.240 
but that's basically not the
case. the case is that a smart

12
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
learning environment considered
to be an environment where

13
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.020 
offline learning and online
learning is being merged

14
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.770 
in a directly meaningful
way. now let's

15
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.540 
at first have a look at some key
principles we have identified

16
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.050 
when it comes to smart learning
environments. so the first key

17
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.400 
feature really is like the
learning devices. it means that

18
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.070 
more or less all all devices and objects
we are using in classroom settings or

19
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.970 
in digital learnings are incorporated
in a smart learning environment.

20
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.430 
this starts for example with a
projector, it goes over smart

21
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.450 
boards smartphones, tablets and
it ends with your desktop pc.

22
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.630 
what's the second point? the second
point is basically all applications

23
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.150 
and tools and features
which are being used

24
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.280 
in the context of a smart learning
environment. these are really

25
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.070 
like digital or digital apps or
or tools which can be attached

26
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.370 
to the center digital interface
which usually is. and now we

27
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.420 
are coming to point three is a
learning management system

28
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.220 
which acts in most scenarios
as early intelligent central

29
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.730 
interface where all the data is coming
together, where the learning happens

30
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.690 
and where the users' other learners
can participate in learning.

31
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.820 
point four is closely connected to
point one. it's about mobility

32
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.820 
that all tools and features are
really embedded in a way that

33
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.570 
they can be used wherever users
want to use it in the sense

34
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.390 
of a BYOD printer on device
that they can take

35
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.200 
their own a learning devices with a used
to, where they like to learn with.

36
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.510 
and at the same time but that
they can also switch, if they

37
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.560 
want to to desktop device or
whatever. point five it's really

38
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.860 
important that the interoperability
of all systems. so it's

39
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.850 
absolutely necessary that all the
tools features that the lms

40
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.650 
is working on mobile devices as
well as on desktop devices.

41
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.440 
and for example when it
comes to accessibility

42
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.780 
as well that most materials are
being downloadable that can

43
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.470 
be transferred maybe to other
lms as well. so that's

44
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.440 
a key feature really key
feature of smart learning

45
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.920 
in environment. point six this
focus on really more the offline

46
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.030 
setting. it means that even if
digital learning is happening.

47
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.260 
it should happen in offline settings
as well. and in this case

48
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.300 
it is really necessary that these
new classroom settings they

49
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.250 
really have like a digital
devices which can be used and

50
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.850 
which give the possibility as
well to work collaboratively

51
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:12.210 
as well as alone and which
can be supervised or

52
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.030 
and supervised. and last but not
least of course when it comes

53
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.010 
to a smart learning device environment.
it really tries to do the shift

54
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.090 
from teaching to learning, which means
that the student is really in the center

55
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.820 
of all learning processes he can
choose and pick what formats

56
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.440 
or digital formats. he likes he
can bring the learning together,

57
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.580 
he can share it with other students
and create by this his or her own

58
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.370 
individual student journey, to
make this a bit more transparent

59
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.170 
and clarify. let's have a closer look
on two the smart learning environment

60
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.620 
model. we developed i don't want
to discuss the entire the entire

61
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.270 
thing. because this would go too far
in the context of this presentation.

62
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.710 
let's just focus on like
especially the social learning

63
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.360 
aspect and this read a square you
see, the planet learning setting.

64
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.410 
because these are the settings
where our use cases are based on.

65
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.260 
so what's really interesting,
if we're having a look

66
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.770 
at the planet learning setting,
you see it is connected

67
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.390 
directly to the digital interface.
because that's where it is

68
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.120 
where all the digital formats are
basically stored, and these formats

69
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
it can be a variety of formats
starting with entertainment

70
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.660 
formats like podcasts or videos.
it can go further with lab

71
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.220 
experiments for natural science
for example. or programming

72
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.670 
exercises in computer science and
these are basically learning

73
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.430 
digital learning artifacts which
can be incorporated into the

74
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.740 
planet learning. and then of course
the other part of the planet

75
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.060 
learning. we have the classroom
setting. we have the lecture

76
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.310 
hall. we have the course room.
and then we have the new room.

77
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.130 
i was already talked about
when as it came to the

78
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.070 
to the key features that is
basically the offline learning

79
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.620 
a digital learning or learning lab which
is called in lots of school settings.

80
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.070 
this is where the students the
learners can meet can work together

81
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.840 
with a the devices they like and which
are being provided in this way

82
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.650 
in this classroom
setting.

83
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.350 
and this is all being brought
together in blended learning.

84
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.440 
but what's really important is in a
smart learning environment that

85
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.320 
blended learning doesn't mean
we have some digital content

86
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.830 
and then we have the the offline
setting. it really means that

87
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.290 
online and offline is being merged
in a meaningful way, which

88
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.590 
means we need to have a clear
instructional and learning

89
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.220 
design when it comes to this.
and this is his one core piece

90
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.390 
were we looking at when we are thinking
about what's happening after

91
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.210 
after the covir-19
stage for example.

92
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.470 
is it really like that people are
coming back to the universities

93
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.330 
and doing the offline learning
no that's not how it should

94
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.490 
be. there is now so many digital content
which has already been created.

95
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.410 
this needs to be merged in a
meaningful way that we have like

96
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.890 
a real blended learning setting in
the sense of a smart learning

97
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.210 
environment. and what's important
as well that we have we see

98
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:49.240 
the social learning. and in there we have
the virtual classroom that's basically

99
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.880 
more or less the same thing we
have an offline learning that

100
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.740 
there is the learning lab and then
we have a completely digital

101
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.090 
virtual learning classroom. and
this can happen in the context

102
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:05.490 
of social learning where students can interact.
they can work collaboratively. they can

103
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.860 
can ask question to the
instructors or professors or

104
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.790 
wherever. this is where all the social
exchange happens in the virtual context.

105
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:22.250 
so now let's come to our
first use case. that's

106
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:28.150 
our let's face east so to say, I
want to start with XuetangX.

107
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:35.450 
XuetangX basically is an msc acting as
mainly as mooc provided platform.

108
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.170 
it was developed in 2013 by
the qinghua university

109
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:45.510 
in china. that's maybe the most
important university in china

110
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.840 
and probably asia at the moment.
and they developed this platform.

111
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.310 
at first it was a local project.
they started to develop their own

112
00:08:54.550 --> 00:09:01.200 
content, but in a real short
period of time within one year,

113
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.240 
it became a centralized platform
for more than four hundred

114
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:12.220 
higher education institutions basically
producing content for Xuetang x

115
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.330 
mainly moocs, but also videos
and podcasts and short

116
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:24.150 
experiments as well. and they
produce the content at the same

117
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.040 
time. they started using this
content for Xuetang x. but over

118
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.420 
here you have to say what's important
in the beginning is really

119
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.350 
comparable to what or cassava
is doing. but it's much

120
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:41.410 
much more centralized. and but
at the same time it's as

121
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:46.730 
formal. it mostly addresses
a formal learning.

122
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.920 
so but they didn't stop with Xuetang
x basically. the designers

123
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.130 
of Xuetang x and Qinghua university,
they iteratively further

124
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.980 
developed the platform at first,
to may to individualize

125
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.540 
learning in a better way to
have like the first step of

126
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:11.150 
social learning as well. and to provide
students for example the possibility

127
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:17.210 
to do twenty four seven digital exams
as well. but that wasn't enough,

128
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.560 
they really wanted to create
something something smart something

129
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.150 
without reach, something basically
all students are using.

130
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.990 
and this is why they created they
develop the rain classroom in

131
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.720 
2016 and basically the
rain classroom is

132
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.700 
another lms. so if we think of our
smart learning model. and we have

133
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.330 
now XuetangX as the main
digital learning interface,

134
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.290 
but now with the rain classroom
they created another lms

135
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.510 
which is basically a second brain in
this smart learning environment.

136
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:59.050 
and what super interesting in
this approach is. they used

137
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.090 
with wechat which
is basically

138
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:08.820 
a mobile app which is mainly being
used for messaging and for chatting.

139
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:17.070 
they created this lms and
implemented embedded

140
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.160 
it into wechat. so maybe at first
one step back for all the

141
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.850 
people who don't know what
wechat is. basically wechat is

142
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.910 
what we call a multi purpose mobile app
or in china it's also called super app.

143
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.930 
because it brings together lots
of functions, lots of features

144
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.780 
we in the west using quite some
different solutions for. so

145
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.460 
the first thing is that's how
wechat started. it's a messaging

146
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:50.670 
service it's really to check to
interact virtually with friends

147
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.820 
and people. the second point is
what they added is a timeline.

148
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.220 
it's comparable to what facebook
is doing. I can share

149
00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.580 
pictures moments what i'm doing at
the moment and stuff like that.

150
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.390 
it also has a mobile payment
function. so for example when you

151
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.750 
are in shanghai nowadays you hardly
use cash anymore. you just

152
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.540 
using wechat to pay in the
restaurant on the market as well.

153
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:20.020 
so it's possible like in all big
cities in China. and now already

154
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:25.430 
another thing which comes step by
step now in more Chinese cities

155
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:30.270 
you receive your violation
tickets for example over wechat

156
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:36.570 
as well. so I'm crossing a red light an image
recognition cameras, recognizing me and

157
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.720 
instantly get my ticket I can
pay with the mobile function

158
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.690 
on wechat. I don't even have to
leave the application for this.

159
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.600 
and it also has a basic
dating app. so people can

160
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.540 
find their future husbands and
wives as well in there. and last

161
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.010 
but not least that is what we
are talking about they really

162
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.060 
embedded that would basically XuetangX
that Qinghua university was doing.

163
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:10.320 
they embedded a whole basic but
really powerful lms into wechat.

164
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.970 
and now what we have you suddenly
have it's not that the

165
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:19.020 
learners have to come to the
classroom to the lms, basically

166
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:24.590 
the lms is coming to the people to
the learners. and that's where

167
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.140 
the rain classroom is and now we
are going to have a look at how

168
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.400 
it feels and it looks like. so
if you see I would call it the

169
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.230 
landing page that the screenshot
on the left. you instantly

170
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.770 
see and feel that you are in some
sort of chat program, chat

171
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.130 
app, messaging app. because
it starts with a chat board

172
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:50.900 
greeting you and you can instantly
start interacting socializing

173
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.730 
with the chat board first, or I
can immediately switch into

174
00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:00.730 
my classrooms or into my
collaborative learning,

175
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.030 
virtual learning spaces i'm
enrolled in. but then you

176
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:10.110 
see you can all also switch to
your courses immediately. or

177
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.250 
and that's the screen chat next to it
to the dashboard. and the dashboard

178
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.960 
is basically quite familiar to
what we know from our lms

179
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.800 
as you have, all the courses you
are enrolled in. you have new

180
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.180 
tasks which are coming up. and
then, of course, you have like

181
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:34.060 
and number way see what or how many
activities are going on in your social

182
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:41.050 
rooms, in your virtual classroom,
or in your collaborative

183
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.130 
learning space. and then because
and that's where it differs

184
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.940 
already again compared to an lms
you see. because you are very

185
00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.040 
active usually when you are in
range classroom interacting

186
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.440 
with so many different people with other
learners with instructors with professors

187
00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:03.060 
that you have a dashboard as well.
you see your entire history

188
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.200 
of your entire activities and
that's basically the perspective

189
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.070 
of more of the student or the
learner and on the right the

190
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.530 
last screenshot on the right.
you see that's the perspective

191
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.920 
from the instructors as an
instructor. I have the

192
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:25.840 
possibility to develop to open a
course, to create a course. I can

193
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:31.060 
import and that's where the
point of interoperability

194
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.560 
starts. i have the possibility
to import all sorts of formats

195
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.900 
into my course into the videos. i don't
have to create a new myself and

196
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.400 
that's a function which is
built in as well. I can

197
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.240 
develop of course like
quizzes, a discussion forums

198
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.230 
and stuff like that. and then
I can see of course when we

199
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.900 
see the students. I can see how
many students are enrolled in

200
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:02.340 
my course and i can also see how
they perform and how active

201
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.690 
they are. and if they are not that
active, i can even give them

202
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:13.600 
a push that they start to be more
social and to be more active

203
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.610 
when it comes to the collaborative
learning. so that's a really interesting

204
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.100 
thing. now let's have a look at
closer look at how I can create

205
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:28.600 
as an instructor. I can create my
own things, so that's basically

206
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.240 
the interface I have when I'm working
on my desktop. on the right

207
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.970 
up you see that's the import
function that's what i already

208
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.590 
mentioned that you can
import basically all

209
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:47.790 
sorts of features and datas and an
informative. the interesting thing there is

210
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.650 
you have the direct connection
to Xuetang x. so I can use the

211
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.240 
books for example there the open
learning what they have on

212
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.840 
on Xuetangx quizzes

213
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.510 
or programming exercises. and
I can simply import into a

214
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:07.480 
rain classroom and then i can
structure the course how i like

215
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.120 
it. so basically i can take, if
I want to do something about

216
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.800 
much machine learning, I can take four
or three, three or four courses

217
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.240 
from XuetangX and bring the
content i like together in there

218
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.330 
and added with my own things like
quizzes for example. you see

219
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:29.050 
there's a multiple variety of different
quiz types from multiple choice

220
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.500 
to fill in the blanks. and
even to open questions,

221
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.460 
I can ask, I can even select how
I want the answers to be. so

222
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.600 
it can be text, but it also
can be a voice messages.

223
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.990 
it can be video clips. it can be
a powerpoint presentation. so

224
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:52.010 
this is everything i can design
over here in this interface

225
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.840 
on my computer. and then afterwards
by saving it, I can immediately

226
00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.890 
synchronize it to a wechat and students
can immediately start learning

227
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:11.640 
or start using it maybe in the context
of a planted learning setting.

228
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.610 
because that is one main reason why a
rain classroom has been created to

229
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.850 
basically really interconnect these
things with your offline learning.

230
00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:30.060 
yeah and last but not least, what
makes a rain classroom real lms?

231
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.820 
it has of course like a learning
analytics what's interesting here is

232
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.240 
that the learning analytics are
quite transparent. so we know

233
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.650 
it from our lms that lots
of data we are having

234
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:49.190 
from the developer perspective.
we collect lots of data

235
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.370 
basically the student doesn't
know about. and over here it's

236
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.940 
quite transparent, because all
the data about the student's

237
00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.400 
performance the progression and
everything can be seen by the

238
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.530 
instructor as well as
by the the learner.

239
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:12.070 
yeah so to wrap it up. what's
happening in this special

240
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.880 
approach, or what this approach
makes it so special that you

241
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.490 
really have an lms as being completely
embedded in a social learning

242
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:26.430 
setting. so and the other
point is that with XuetangX

243
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.590 
you have a second brain, so you have
to digital interfaces which can

244
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.270 
interact but which can be used
quite independently as well.

245
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:42.000 
so now let's come to our other
the use cases. let's come back

246
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:48.290 
to germany and quite different
approach. so let's start with

247
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:54.280 
with a stronger focus on a
blended learning setting. and

248
00:19:54.310 --> 00:20:00.930 
and over here we can see, so again
we had the lms embedded in

249
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.780 
the social learning system
over here really the core

250
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.190 
the center piece of the smart
learning environment is the lms

251
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:15.650 
like we have it in our in our model.
and then you have like basically

252
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.400 
there are needs from students or
you want to create a learning

253
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.070 
based on learning design. and
then based on this needs of the

254
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.600 
learning, we think about which
tools and features can we use

255
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.570 
to provide this learning. and
then we step by step at

256
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.540 
tools and features to the lms. and
by this make it smarter, but again

257
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.050 
the lms is the centre thing where
everything basically is happening

258
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.330 
and what bringing things like
over what we see over here the

259
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:53.390 
blended learning together. or what even
makes the blended learning possible?

260
00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.490 
yeah and let's focus now on
blended learning and let's focus

261
00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.240 
now on the AI campus have to
say that the pilot project we

262
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.330 
see compared to china at
2013 first stage, 2016

263
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.170 
already like becoming really
smart. we are having a

264
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.740 
pilot project with a
planted learning setting.

265
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.540 
this is going to start in january
next year. we are already

266
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.010 
a life with AI campus, but I
would say that we need to

267
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.890 
attach more and more tools and
features to really make this

268
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.850 
a display of learning setting
in this case smart.

269
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:37.610 
and we want to really create
to have a use case we can

270
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:42.360 
use and we can see what tools and
features we need. and this is

271
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.340 
an approach by three universities
in the bundesland hessen.

272
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.520 
it's the good
university

273
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.620 
phillips university Marburg
and the TU Darmstadt. they

274
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.050 
are really working together and
creating courses blended learning

275
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.790 
settings where they are using
multiple formats. and they want

276
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.950 
to bring it together in as I said
a meaningful way, like a really

277
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:12.330 
directly sized planted learning setting.
and they want to use online lectures,

278
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:18.910 
so of course some kind of
tool like button or zoom

279
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:23.660 
need to be attached need to be embedded to
the AI campus that has not happened yet.

280
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.580 
we have a web-based tutorials
are planned of course videos

281
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:33.280 
we can already embed. they need
a collaborative learning

282
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.660 
spaces as well. and this is
something we need to completely

283
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.240 
implement as we know. like most
lms as we now have like moodle

284
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.790 
blackboard the main discussion
forums which are not up to date

285
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.060 
anymore. we have to become more
flexible. we have to have the

286
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.580 
possibility that students are
creating their own learning space

287
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:58.000 
where they can learn in a virtual
environment collaboratively. and for this

288
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:03.300 
we need to have something like meta most
or something like some slack maybe.

289
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.950 
this needs to be discussed to be
attached or embedded to the

290
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.690 
learning environment and of
course when it comes to we are

291
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.640 
with the AI campus focused on
AI. we need to have some sort

292
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.020 
of programming environment attached
or embedded, like jupiter notebooks

293
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.680 
which can create a far outreach.
because this is something which

294
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:29.530 
is broadly used, in use already
at our different universities

295
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.330 
in germany. so we need to bring
all this together to create

296
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.130 
some outreach and to make the i
campus as the digital interface

297
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.170 
in this context
really smart.

298
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:46.010 
but as i said this
is something

299
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.380 
we we are working on and it's for
the future. and what makes this

300
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.040 
approach so entirely different,
so the first point really was

301
00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.290 
we have the lms and we attach things
on it and the other thing is

302
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.520 
how do we pick or select the
tools and features we want to

303
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.590 
attach or embed to the lms?
and this is basically

304
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.720 
the first question is always
what's the need of the users of

305
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:21.090 
course, what the need of the instructors
and what's possible for example in

306
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.280 
context of gdp R compliance.
so we have to see,

307
00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:32.950 
we have to look at lots of factors
until we at least a picking

308
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.560 
some sort of tool we want to attach
to the learning environment

309
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.720 
which is our center our brain of
the whole learning setting.

310
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.620 
yeah that's so far from blended
learning, i already said

311
00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:54.070 
like matter most slack these are
possibilities. these are tools

312
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:59.950 
and features which can be could
be connected to an lms which

313
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:04.470 
makes the learning a smarter and
which makes the students smarter.

314
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.890 
because they can interact, they
can share things, they can start

315
00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:13.430 
project they can work collaborative
collaboratively its more problems based

316
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:20.540 
it's more social of course.
and Kiren already has

317
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:26.450 
created this use case. that's
basically brand new.

318
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:31.480 
they embedded metal most this
check this messaging tool they

319
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.540 
embedded in the last weeks. and it's
now available for the student

320
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:42.040 
on the lms level, on the overarching
level where people can

321
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.820 
discuss all about the entire
cost catalogue and things like

322
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:52.520 
that. and it's also embedded
in each course context.

323
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.310 
so what is does this mean? students
can collaborate as I am,

324
00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.970 
an instructor can create a
collaborative working spaces.

325
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.390 
but the students themselves they
can also create their own

326
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:12.060 
learning spaces where they invite
people and share content.

327
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.050 
and discuss problems and topics
maybe even evaluate the course

328
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:21.140 
and then get back in discussion
with the instructor as well.

329
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.690 
so it can happen basically more
or less as a chat. the chat

330
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:32.550 
function of which it can be used in
the context of a rain classroom.

331
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:37.560 
so it's really it's really nice
it's really cool to see a that

332
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.720 
that current is doing these first
steps going away from this kind of

333
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.270 
i would say a bit old fashioned discussion
forums which are really really hard

334
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.080 
when you need lots of pushes
that the students really keep

335
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:54.440 
on writing using these discussion
forums. but now we have to see

336
00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:59.580 
how these chat function in the
cause section is working

337
00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.460 
in german context.
because

338
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.210 
this chat function
this social learning

339
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:12.330 
spaces and wechet
are working in

340
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.160 
in such a good way, also out of
my perspective has to do with

341
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.660 
the cult cultural
implications. because

342
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:28.980 
a Chinese in china it's a
highly social community.

343
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.600 
and they really like to interact.
we have to see if these

344
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.200 
discussion of these chat forms in
the courses are really working

345
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:42.620 
it in itself or if it really
needs to be diet exercised. if

346
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:48.040 
it really needs to have an instructional
design even in these a chat functions.

347
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:54.410 
yeah that is so far from our
use cases maybe as a general

348
00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:59.020 
wrap up. what's the key what are
the key differences between

349
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:04.430 
the approach in china and the approach we
are facing we are having in Germany.

350
00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.850 
so the chinese approach really is
that you have like a mobile lms.

351
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:15.010 
a tool which everyone is using
in everyday life and they are

352
00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:20.700 
bringing the lms in to this mobile
app and they bring it all

353
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.030 
together. you don't have to leave
it when you do the learning,

354
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.330 
if you have a course which way way you
need to pay for or you need to pay,

355
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.430 
if you want to do like a verified
certificate you can even

356
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.030 
do this in which as well. so it's
really like a multi-purpose thing.

357
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:38.060 
it's i would say it's
a holistic learning

358
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:44.310 
experience and this is basically
what we need to where we need

359
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:50.430 
to go with our approach as well.
but we are facing it from a

360
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:54.990 
different perspective. i would say we really
see the lms as the center interface.

361
00:28:55.190 --> 00:29:00.020 
and we are attaching the things
we would like to have based

362
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.780 
on the needs of our learners to do the
shift from teaching to learning.

363
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:10.450 
yeah that's basically so far from
my side and i thank you for

364
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:15.540 
listening to me and if you want
to know more about this topic,

365
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.880 
we are going to have a so called
QA manual where we have a way

366
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.150 
we tackle the topic of smart learning
environments, but so much

367
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.230 
more when it comes to instructional
and learning design. and

368
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.070 
it will be published by the end of
October. and it's a collaboration

369
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:33.890 
between the AI campus and
current thank you very much!

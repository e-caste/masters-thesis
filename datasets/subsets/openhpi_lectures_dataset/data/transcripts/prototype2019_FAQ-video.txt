Hi there! This video shall help you
to navigate through the openHPI

2
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.080 
platform. I'll give you some
technical and helpful tips

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.950 
what you need
for this MOOC.

4
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.020 
So let's start on the general
course page where you can find

5
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.800 
the general course
structure on the left.

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.450 
Each week you can see a row of
icons right next to the general

7
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.130 
course structure indicating
the weekly structure.

8
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.660 
The icons illustrate the
process line of your learning

9
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.240 
and stand for the corresponding
learning material.

10
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.380 
Here is a list
explaining all items.

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.060 
You might also want to adjust the
emails you get from the course

12
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.730 
according to your personal needs.
Let me show you how you can

13
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.100 
change your email
notification settings.

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.740 
You can do this by
clicking on this button.

15
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.140 
For example, openHPI’s
automatic setting is

16
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.560 
to send you an email
notification each time

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
someone posted a discussion forum.
You can turn of this function here.

18
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.020 
Throughout the course we’ll
provide you with templates

19
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.820 
exercises and assignments. Please
consider these as optional

20
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.160 
and feel free to design your own
ones. You should only make

21
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.630 
sure that the categories are the
same ones to help your pears

22
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.530 
review your work.

23
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.710 
All videos have a subtitle function
which you can find below

24
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.690 
the video frame. You can either
display subtitles within the

25
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.630 
video by clicking on the
closed captions button

26
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.460 
or you can read the video script
by clicking on the list icon

27
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.720 
next to it. To switch off the
subtitle function just click

28
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.600 
the icons again.

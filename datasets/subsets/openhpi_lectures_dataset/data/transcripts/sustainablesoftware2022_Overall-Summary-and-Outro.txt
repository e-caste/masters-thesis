00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.840 
Hi, and almost goodbye because this is the end of this course.

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.840 
We hope you learned a ton along the way

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.770 
and we hope you also had some fun following all the topics we covered.

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.120 
In this very last video, we'll do a quick recap and give you

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.510 
some recommendations where we can go next with everything you

6
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.040 
have learned.

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.360 
What did we discuss in the first part of this course?

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.390 
We discussed the still growing importance of digitalisation and ICT

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.030 
in our everyone's life causing an ever increasing resource consumption.

10
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.270 
That resource consumption very often correlates with CO2 emissions,

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.780 
so the rule of thumb is the more resource

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.750 
consumption we have, the more resources we consume, the higher

13
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.770 
is our CO2 footprint.

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.470 
The good message was that much CO2 can be saved by ICT

15
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.110 
as well in several sectors of our society

16
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.490 
and that when we focus on software and software engineering,

17
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.300 
there's quite much potential to improve.

18
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.250 
At this point we also learn that software often comes somehow combined with hardware.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.460 
The footprint of hardware is an interesting one, but

20
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
it was out of scope for our course.

21
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.470 
Then we identified all relevant roles in the process of software

22
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.580 
engineering and discussed that each role has its own perspective on things,

23
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.790 
with its own issues, its own conflict of goals and optimization problems.

24
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.880 
We looked at each role using the example of software update service.

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.040 
A part of the developers' perspective,

26
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.760 
we for instance looked at the operators, the architects,

27
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
the roles of the users themselves. We discussed that the role of

28
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.170 
the leaders and showed that decision makers can adjust the structure

29
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.750 
and flows in organization to increase incentives for a more sustainable software engineering.

30
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.880 
We even discussed how regulations on a European and even a global level

31
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.480 
have influence on the software engineering.

32
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.930 
And finally we discussed that there is a very effective trap for us humans

33
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.060 
that hinders us from applying more ecological practices.

34
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.540 
It is the rebound effect.

35
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.070 
And we discussed that we should follow three strategies altogether

36
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.260 
to overcome the traps and barriers to eventually act in a more ecological way.

37
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.280 
The efficiency, consistency and sufficiency strategy.

38
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.930 
And in the second part, we showed how to do sustainable software engineering in practice.

39
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.820 
We discussed that efficiency offers potential to save CO2,

40
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.780 
but when implementing actions, we should have the specific use

41
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.390 
case of our application in mind and its non-functional requirements

42
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.580 
as well as team skills of the team that is involved.

43
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.430 
And then we discussed the different architectural patterns

44
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.210 
of modern applications and their impact of CO2.

45
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.820 
For instance we covered monolith versus microservices or blocking

46
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.090 
and non blocking IOs.

47
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.700 
Further details we covered

48
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.620 
the important concept of computational complexity that allows

49
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.130 
us to estimate the resource consumption of algorithm.

50
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.250 
We discussed the efficiency of data structures and that choosing

51
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.580 
the most efficient one for your software has a significant positive impact

52
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.930 
on the energy efficiency of your software.

53
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.270 
And then we took a step a bit outside of algorithms and looked at

54
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
the overall size of applications and their communication between each other.

55
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.040 
And what you can save

56
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.440 
with doing the right thing there.

57
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.220 
Last but not least, we had a quick look into how to measure

58
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.180 
power consumption on software.

59
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.550 
Because once a wise man said I cannot improve it when I cannot measure it.

60
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.250 
I think you have sensed during the course that

61
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760 
acting responsibly and ethically is important for us. Now,

62
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.660 
we'll talk a very last time about this. Why?

63
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.120 
Because with knowledge responsibility comes as well. I'm sorry for that

64
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.790 
that's how it is.

65
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.640 
With all the new knowledge you have now, we kindly ask you to literally

66
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.130 
go out and utilize this knowledge for the good.

67
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.230 
Engage yourself in discussions on sustainability and digitalisation. Find

68
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.260 
existing projects or even start new ones.

69
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.210 
We stress this message at this point because there's an increasing number of people

70
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.870 
who learn about the things we've covered in the course. Hhowever, unfortunately,

71
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.500 
many have a hard time acting upon it. Why is that?

72
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.180 
We've talked about something similar earlier in the course

73
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.240 
when discussing the rebound effect. As we are humans we are

74
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.620 
sensitive to do things that are sometimes irrational. That's

75
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.920 
just how it is. The good message is, we can do something about

76
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.560 
it. When we are more aware of our irrational behavior

77
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.510 
and know some concepts about it we act less in irrational ways.

78
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.650 
Therefore, as the last concept in this course, and I promise

79
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.540 
it's a very last one,

80
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.860 
we'd like to present the so called value action gap.

81
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
It describes exactly this phenomenon. It literally

82
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.390 
describes the distance between what we know in our mind

83
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.280 
and what we do with our hands.

84
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.810 
As humans, we just tend to not really act upon what we know sometimes.

85
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.810 
And that happens more often as we, myself included, would think or even admit.

86
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.350 
So we hope you set a good example there. You take responsibility

87
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.880 
and apply what you've learned and engage yourself in some way

88
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.630 
in the context of digitalisation and climate change.

89
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.820 
Talking about engagement, what can you do?

90
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.080 
Well, there's so many organizations, NGOs, political parties and even

91
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.170 
companies with rising awareness about this topic.

92
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.810 
Even the four of us, the instructors, we are happy to work in

93
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.530 
environments where we can shape

94
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.320 
in a way that it is more sustainable.

95
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.050 
Sometimes you don't have to go very far when looking for something

96
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.920 
that you can start to act. Just have a look around in your closer area, maybe it's

97
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.420 
easier to find something

98
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.670 
easier than you would have thought.

99
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.440 
Talking about what is close - well the cleanIT forum of the HPI here is close.

100
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.690 
So just explore it. There's much content and much more to come.

101
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.340 
So just stay tuned.

102
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.150 
Just to name another starting point to discuss about digitalisation

103
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.500 
and sustainability with others, there's a meanwhile well established civic movement

104
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.320 
called Bits und Bäume.

105
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.590 
You'll find here IT, the bits and non IT people the bäume.

106
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.420 
It's a german word for trees representing our natural ecosystem or

107
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.790 
ecology and these both parties exchange ideas and discuss

108
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.900 
about what everyone of us can do. So, if you don't know where to start

109
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.270 
maybe give it a try there.

110
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.360 
So, that's really it. From all of us - Johannes, Robin,

111
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.330 
Ferdinand and myself. Thank you very much for your attention

112
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.390 
and let's keep in touch. Maybe we see each other soon again.

113
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.850 
For now goodbye, take care.

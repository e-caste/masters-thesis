00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.940 
Hello and welcome everybody
to the clean IT initiative.

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.240 
Digital transformation and
technology, a part of our everyday

4
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.570 
lives and according to Accenture's
SMARTer2030 study,

5
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.660 
they also have the potential to reduce
global carbon emissions by twenty percent

6
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.270 
by 2030. However, digital technology
itself is not yet ecologically sustainable

7
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.710 
and IT sector has an immense carbon
footprint due to its devices,

8
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.360 
data centres, applications
and global networks.

9
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.480 
This clearly shows that we require
structural change and new

10
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.500 
ways of addressing this issue together.
Consequently, SAP has teamed up

11
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.580 
with the Hasso Plattner Institute
for a clean IT initiative

12
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.820 
to jointly foster and accelerate
sustainable digital innovation

13
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.840 
and show how technology can be used to
mitigate the effects of climate change.

14
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.870 
At SAP we aim to both act as an enabler
for sustainability for more than

15
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.340 
four hundred thousand customers as
well as an exemplar by adhering

16
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.900 
to ethical and sustainable
business principles.

17
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.730 
We are already powering
all our data centers

18
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.580 
and facilities with one hundred percent
renewable energy and have set ourselves

19
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.540 
the goal to become carbon neutral
by 2023 as well

20
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.820 
as phase out single use plastics.
But our greatest lever for

21
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.960 
sustainability is our profound
understanding of business processes.

22
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.940 
With this understanding,

23
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.580 
we cannot only help businesses
to run at their best,

24
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.540 
but we are also in a prime position to
support them in tracking CO2 emissions

25
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.740 
and in better managing the environmental
impact along the entire value chains.

26
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
The clean IT initiative is
a great opportunity to share

27
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.210 
this knowledge and I'm very excited
for SAP to take an active part.

28
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.190 
As sustainability requires a holistic
approach, clean IT is launching

29
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.450 
different research and training
activities to make sure the

30
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.940 
topic is being addressed
from various angles.

31
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.720 
I will now give you a short
overview of the first topics

32
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.240 
SAP experts will cover for
the clean IT platform.

33
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.680 
Our biggest challenge of the twenty
first century is climate change.

34
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.140 
We started a climate 21
initiative that is featured in

35
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.580 
one of these videos. Due to the
increased urgency of climate change

36
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.930 
customers are demanding insights into the
impact that business processes have

37
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.560 
on the environment. Climate 21
enables them to reduce

38
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.100 
their carbon footprint along the
entire value chain and helps them

39
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.590 
make more sustainable production
and delivery choices.

40
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.370 
Basics on carbon calculation will
be covered in an additional video

41
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.330 
as well. In the video on
sustainable programming,

42
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.440 
you will learn that clean IT
starts in the code itself.

43
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.660 
The execution of complex software algorithms
can consume huge amounts of energy.

44
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.580 
One striking example of
high energy consumption

45
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.380 
in data processing is bitcoin which
consumes the same amount of energy

46
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.980 
in a year as the
country of Norway.

47
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.610 
Consequently when we aim for more
efficient algorithms, we can

48
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.390 
achieve the same output
while saving energy.

49
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.090 
You will also learn more about the
principle of sustainability by design

50
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.840 
as the new foundation of
sustainable software development.

51
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.040 
Furthermore we will explore sustainability
from the perspective of circular economy.

52
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.250 
Currently most production processes
are designed as cradle to grave

53
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.840 
using more natural resources
than the planet can regenerate.

54
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.300 
For companies to
be sustainable,

55
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.890 
supply and value chains need
to be redesigned from linear

56
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.140 
to circular models. Software
applications can help identify

57
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.310 
opportunities for reuse and
recycling of limited resources

58
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.460 
along the entire
product life cycle.

59
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.130 
Creating a sustainable future needs
all of us and I firmly believe

60
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.620 
that developing more climate-friendly
technology and improving

61
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.740 
the environmental impact of businesses leads
to a win win win situation for companies,

62
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.280 
the people and
our planet.

63
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.330 
I'm excited for everyone who will join
us on the journey towards clean IT.

64
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.090 
Together we can make
sustainable IT a reality.

65
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.580 
Enjoy the videos and stay tuned
for more topics to be added

66
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.290 
to the clean IT platform.
Until then, stay well.

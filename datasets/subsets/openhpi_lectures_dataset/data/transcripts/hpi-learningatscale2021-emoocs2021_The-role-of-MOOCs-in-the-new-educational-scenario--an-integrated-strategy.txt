a the future is already here.
it's just not very evenly distributed.

5
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.730 
not only are our daily lives being turned upside down.

6
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.410 
but deep down we know that we are on the edge of a discontinuity
that will mark history.

7
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.300 
in such a historical moments the role of education is not simply

8
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.420 
to reproduce the existing social system.

9
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.060 
but to create the conditions for imagining new words.

10
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.060 
now we have to develop our design culture

11
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.330 
in education and to invest them in an integrated designing
of smart learning where digital physical,

12
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.690 
individual and collaborative dimensions

13
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.760 
will contribute to the creation of new visions

14
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.920 
of learning and teaching.

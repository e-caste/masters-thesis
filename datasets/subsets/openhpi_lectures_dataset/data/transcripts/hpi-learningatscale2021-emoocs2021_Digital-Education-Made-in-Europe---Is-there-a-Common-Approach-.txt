So with this four great panelists from different countries

52
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.620 
in Europe: Germany,Italy,France and Austria we're going in the coming

53
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.750 
one and a half hours almost to

54
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.810 
explore how Europe can cooperate, what is the specialty of Europe

55
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.850 
differences in relation to other

56
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.010 
North American area and to

57
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.120 
present or to introduce the topics, I would like to pose a few questions

58
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.060 
where the panelists will talk about. One is, for obvious

59
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.390 
is about cooperation in this fragmented

60
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.310 
european market with different countries with different languages,

61
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.580 
how to gain market share within the european market and how to cooperate

62
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.530 
with other european providers. The cooperation is important

63
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.150 
for this relatively small countries

64
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.590 
to have a bigger impact in the world,

65
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.590 
taken into account second topic: European diversity,

66
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.190 
the Lingua Franca affect: using a second language to learn something

67
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.250 
else makes things more difficult, also their cultural differences in learning.

68
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.610 
Third point: the european values which should be

69
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.830 
taken into account such as: privacy,

70
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.140 
culture, the variety of languages. How can these values be best included

71
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.050 
in the MOOCS offerings

72
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.350 
and how do european offers  differ from those big flagship MOOC

73
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.610 
providers like edX, Coursera, Udacity etc. What is the

74
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.180 
unique selling point to customers, what are the differences,

75
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.730 
similarities in the greater education good,

76
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.760 
what is the role of the state, what should education cost, which

77
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.610 
is also a differentiated with respect to other areas of the world.

78
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.220 
Ok, this are some questions that are

79
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.590 
sent out and now we would like to invite the four speakers

80
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.710 
to present their view so each of the presented have ten fifteen minutes

81
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.240 
in other than at the end to open it up to a broader discussion.

82
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.790 
So, professor Meinel, the floor is yours. Thank you very much.

83
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.000 
Digital Education made in Europe. I want to give a little bit as the background

84
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.140 
of what we are doing and from that

85
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.650 
it explains what we are doing and what we see.

86
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.180 
So HPI (Hasso Plattner Institute) is institute for digital engineering, education, research projects.

87
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.370 
So we are very close

88
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.920 
connected to what usually is called digital transformation,

89
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.190 
which is changing all parts of our lives: private lives, economy,

90
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:15.290 
the way how people work, how people communicate and of course

91
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.460 
also education.

92
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.220 
It becomes that many things become very easy to interact with other

93
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.790 
people, to interact over long distances, to be very fast in the communication,

94
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.500 
to let machines connect to each other.

95
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.830 
There is a lot of possibilities and what we have to learn is

96
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.220 
how to deal with it and we'll see huge potential to master the

97
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:50.300 
challenges of our human kind. So I will not go into the aspects that also digitalisation

98
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.880 
cause a lot of problems. I want to concentrate on the people

99
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.160 
and what we see also from other projects,

100
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.680 
there is what we call a digital

101
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.910 
enlightenment  necessary to empower the citizens to master

102
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.050 
all the challenges of the digital transformation and also in the new

103
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.960 
digital world they should be able to live and move self determined

104
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:26.760 
and to be responsible for what they are doing like: in a citizen society,

105
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.390 
in the physical world, and to this end we need to reveal the

106
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.750 
potential of digital education. We have to develop digital educational

107
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.690 
contents, we have to develop experiment and try it out for months

108
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.890 
and we have to provide digital educational infrastructures

109
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:53.970 
in that area. So what we are doing at HPI, we came from

110
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:59.990 
Tele Task systems is to record lectures, conferences and other things

111
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:08.490 
and then we were inspired by the MOOC idea also to give this e-learning

112
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:14.690 
the missing social link back, and then it will play a role here.

113
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.670 
We had also the task from the national government to develop

114
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.330 
an digital infrastructure for schools which

115
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.760 
is very political in Germany because the federal level is not

116
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.870 
allowed to say anything to the state level, and schools

117
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.020 
are regulated on the state level.

118
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.530 
So it's starting with this recording machine. It's a very

119
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.220 
user friendly,

120
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:48.810 
small package, there is a computer in there with all the arrows

121
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.500 
you can connect to the presentation laptops, a camera and microphone,

122
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.890 
and then you can record and stream things into the internet.

123
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.570 
We do this with a dual screen to give the largest possible

124
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.960 
reflection of what is going in the lecture hall.

125
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.100 
We started in the year of MOOCS,

126
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.100 
at least this was a headline in

127
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.780 
the New York Times two thousand and twelve, we start with developing such a platform

128
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.640 
because with this Tele Task we have a large Tele Task portal

129
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.490 
where the people could access all of the conferences, all the lectures

130
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:33.210 
happening in HPI but there was no much fun. It was good to have access

131
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:39.280 
but we get a lot of "thank you's that you provide this" but

132
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.760 
none of this made us " there was really no such a fun to follow

133
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.440 
such a lecture, ninety minutes sitting in front of my computer".

134
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.980 
So for that reason, the

135
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.810 
first MOOCS, in the sense from being massive online courses,

136
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.750 
Sebastian Droon in Stanford, they give us the idea exactly

137
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.360 
what is missing is the social aspect and for the most of the people

138
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:13.050 
the social effect is very important for learning.

139
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:19.930 
To only given a short idea. Been said: "This is not a university project".

140
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.780 
We are an university institute, we offer bachelor master courses but

141
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.560 
we developed this platform not for teaching our students.

142
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.460 
The students are in campus. We have enough stuff to educate them,

143
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.810 
to give them a very good education. What our idea was, to open

144
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.990 
our knowledge to the

145
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:43.980 
interested people.

146
00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.060 
And this was one motivation, another motivation was

147
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.330 
that we feel that universities need to become more responsible

148
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.620 
also for lifelong learning and providing material for lifelong

149
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.170 
learning. In Germany we have a very strongly regulated

150
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.980 
university system. Almost all universities are

151
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.780 
state universities, very strongly regulated.

152
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.230 
And lifelong learning is not part of their task,

153
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.250 
opening their knowledge to people which are not enrolled in

154
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.060 
a university is not their task, and for that reason we think

155
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:28.260 
with such offers, with such MOOCS., in our case it's MOOCS about digital technology,

156
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.620 
projects and knowledge

157
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:37.410 
we could do something for the Digital Enlightenment, they are for the people,

158
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.730 
for the citizens to manage the digital transformation.

159
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.790 
What is interesting for us our platform is used also by partners

160
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:52.780 
for example openSAP is  platform which is run by SAP

161
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.860 
with a huge number of enrollments, more than five million

162
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.020 
and here

163
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.310 
SAP offers to the people: explanations of their products,

164
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.380 
the background of the product, how to use best practices and other things,

165
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:15.300 
also how the technology works behind. It is a huge amount

166
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.980 
of people which are interested in such information.

167
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:24.430 
Another platform user is the World Health Organization.

168
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:31.170 
They work with our openHPI platform and offer information in pandemic

169
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.200 
situations, so we developed this

170
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:40.820 
when the last Ebola pandemic was around and the experience

171
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.610 
there was, they were not able to distribute the

172
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.630 
information and knowledge that's needed for the public, for

173
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:52.710 
the nurses, for the physicians in the countries, fast enough and efficient enough,

174
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.980 
and those together and now Corona was a proof of concept.

175
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.490 
Before of Corona it was five hundred thousand enrollments and now it's

176
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.550 
more than five million three hundred thousand. They provide

177
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.260 
courses in ninety four

178
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.310 
languages. Yesterday Gaia Gambiae gave an introduction

179
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:19.220 
to very good activity and there are also other partners.

180
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.290 
Perhaps, let me finish with this slide I also showed

181
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.940 
by the opening of the EMOOCS conference

182
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:33.750 
The development of the universities. 1.0,

183
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.680 
greek philosopher with his students discussing

184
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:45.970 
around Western. University. 2.0 at our usual university educating young people,

185
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:51.220 
driven by the invention of book printing and in the age of enlightenment and

186
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:56.360 
they are organized around libraries and students are physically attend

187
00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:04.030 
the classes. And I see a future of the university with a much more important part

188
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:10.240 
played by the digital offers and University. 3.0  is

189
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.190 
and we try to go as HPI in that direction. They

190
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.850 
should feel also responsible for life long educational

191
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.910 
companion.

192
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:29.350 
Of course, it's driven also here by technology, by the digital transformation,

193
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:35.110 
and it is organised around learning portals in the internet and

194
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:41.070 
students of all age learn together across the world and with EMOOCS and

195
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.020 
with such platforms we have a great mean in hand

196
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.740 
to reach this. Thank you.

197
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.470 
Thank you very much Professor Meinel. Professor Calise Mauro, its your turn.

198
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.510 
Thank you very much and

199
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.840 
I liked very much what Christopher Meinel just told us,

200
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.040 
especially the lessons laying them in its vision,

201
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.390 
and hopefully we all

202
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.290 
would love to get into that direction and then, as a social scientist,

203
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.660 
my task is to say what is happening

204
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.100 
in the medium and let's say

205
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.870 
longer term because that's what we are dealing with now and

206
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.670 
I'll try to answer to

207
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.090 
Carlos question. Basically the last one, I think is the one

208
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.390 
that I, will pick which concerns.

209
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:48.550 
What is the difference with our providers and how is Europe

210
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.290 
different with respect to what is happening,

211
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.660 
has already happened in the United States because clearly

212
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.490 
we are late comers. As we could see in this conference

213
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.360 
there are a lot of things, you know, developing around. I mean,

214
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.500 
with respect, to four years ago the landscape has become a much

215
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.900 
richer landscape, with respect to

216
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.740 
universities are doing more things most of these things

217
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.220 
they call MOOCS. You know what there is no

218
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.710 
definition of MOOC except for the fact that should be massive

219
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.850 
and what is really massive: Open? -Ok, Course? -Ok, Well, is it a university

220
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.900 
course?, Is it just a short course?. Everything is a MOOC

221
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.660 
and online course but so there is a problem about what is

222
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.160 
really MOOC? What's the quality in a MOOC? And of course when

223
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.190 
we look at the American pic.

224
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.130 
Guys, I mean Coursera, edX, and Udacity and FutureLearn for

225
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.960 
that matter, I mean we know there is a business model there

226
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.110 
and the business model is very simple and the simplicity accounts for its

227
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.350 
success. Universities have been producing,

228
00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.510 
not many MOOCS, I mean if you if you have a chart in front of you and asking:

229
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.440 
What's the concentration of MOOC production?

230
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.610 
Its relatively low. There are only about twenty

231
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:18.750 
universities which still nowadays produce about sixty percent of the overall

232
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:25.790 
production. That's the same in the US and Europe, maybe thirty universities

233
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.380 
but I mean it's still very concentrated which makes it very

234
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.470 
interesting with respect to the control of the quality of

235
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:37.470 
them. If we sit all together and I produce one MOOC and you produce

236
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.670 
one hundred MOOCS then we are entitled to the same share of

237
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.790 
the game but the American model: everyone produces.

238
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.250 
A few universities produce more

239
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.000 
and only three to five providers distribute

240
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.470 
MOOCS all around the world and this has been very easy, effective and successful.

241
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.940 
So one question is: "are we moving into that direction?".

242
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.770 
Four years ago we tried something as this as the EMOOC group,

243
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.430 
basically as scholars may recall, we all met

244
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.200 
in an Anacapri and we wrote

245
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.960 
an Anacapri manifesto.

246
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.250 
It was much more fortunate that event of any manifesto for that matter

247
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.790 
but at that time we still thought we could have an unified provider

248
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.840 
and we thought the european research council could play that

249
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.360 
role. Was not very visionary project, it was very simple.

250
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.700 
We didn't get much of an answer from the European Research

251
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.670 
Council meanwhile things have changed.

252
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.190 
It's only to say that probably we won't have

253
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.090 
big players on the European side

254
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.840 
able to compete with the American giants and the Indian and

255
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.780 
Chinese giant, because we all know at least at this table, that

256
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.990 
India and and China have been growing tremendously in this past year

257
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.520 
and much of the growth has been due to the contribution by the national governments.

258
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.990 
So what are we now probably going to do?

259
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.730 
And that's a good question, because for the first time there

260
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.930 
is attention on the EU side.

261
00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.100 
We all listen to Georgy Dimitro,

262
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.860 
it's been a very forceful speech and there is even, I want to say,

263
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.190 
a practical debation, at the end of the speech.

264
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.230 
It's still just the beginning of doing something but this is already something with

265
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:43.610 
respect to European Union and we all are afraid of the time frame.

266
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.720 
We are all afraid that we are going into more calls for projects

267
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.500 
which will involve a plurality of players

268
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:58.200 
and meanwhile we'll make one more inch one more step and

269
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.050 
in five years from now, I mean, the penetration

270
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:06.610 
of the Chinese, the Indian and the American is going to be

271
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:13.140 
incredible and you heard the type of speech by M.

272
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.270 
I like him. I like usually americans because they tell

273
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.930 
you in ten minutes what they're going to do

274
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.390 
and they are already very aggressively

275
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.980 
moving into the so-called lifelong learning market because

276
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.440 
that's the big market of course.

277
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.030 
Now, what is going to happen in the next

278
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.750 
two years. For the first time, we are going to see

279
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.490 
probably hundreds of millions poured into this digital education

280
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.150 
and it's not only going to be universities. I like very much

281
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.050 
what Christoph said to the point because

282
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:54.030 
clearly it's the whole lifelong by starting with kids

283
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.840 
because that's what really it begins, and that's where actually the american

284
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.500 
big players are not really doing much, they're doing nothing

285
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.890 
with that respect. So let's look also at where are the competitors.

286
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.100 
I see them as competitive. They're friends in many respect, the

287
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.060 
Federica with the courses, with edX, with Coursera so nothing

288
00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:18.230 
wrong with that but if the question is the question that Carlo's raised:

289
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.620 
What is Europe going to be able to do?, let's look into a longer,

290
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.320 
not only lifelong learning afterwards but also before because

291
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.590 
there we have a great chance to do and that's in our own European tradition.

292
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.100 
So that's the point. But if you look at the PNRAR, that's

293
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:42.020 
the funny name we call it in Italy and in various countries, I mean, the

294
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.850 
amount of money which is going into digital education is several hundreds

295
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.780 
millions.

296
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.810 
And I don't know yet the exact amount but to give you an idea

297
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:59.440 
the way that this is with respect what we are discussing now, strick to censor,

298
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.840 
that the proposal among other things which will concern in

299
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.230 
all high schools, which concern kindergarten, the whole thing

300
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.640 
with that the Christoph

301
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.740 
talked about. Well only with respect to universities

302
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.510 
there's going to be a call

303
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.870 
for three digital education hubs. I'm happy that we are using the same..

304
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.740 
I don't know whether you know..

305
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.580 
George picked up from the Italian document or vice versa that's still.

306
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.330 
Three digital education hubs and three learning and teaching centres.

307
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.730 
And we don't know yet the exact amount of money but there is big

308
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.300 
money at stakes and the idea in that case is to have three

309
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.060 
centres, probably one for the south, one for the

310
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.230 
central region, and one for the north, which in a way become

311
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:57.030 
the hub for production, studying, research and dissemination.

312
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.970 
So if this is going to be something that in a way or another is also happening

313
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.550 
all over other countries and from what George himself told

314
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:11.840 
us yesterday it's very likely to be so, then we are expecting

315
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.210 
something not in the

316
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.850 
terms so probably billion

317
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.930 
poured into the digital education,

318
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.190 
which is going to be very important money

319
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:29.820 
if it is spent within a coherent strategy, because we are short on time

320
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.890 
but also the recovery plan is going to ask us to spend this money

321
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.710 
into maximum three, probably four years.

322
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.530 
So again this is a time for real coordination

323
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.250 
and it's a time where we should know

324
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.270 
where the strength of the competitors are

325
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.420 
try to do things. I like very much the presentation which has been

326
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.780 
done yesterday about credentials and into the whole.

327
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.210 
But that's something which is going on

328
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.260 
but we know it's going to take a lot of time.

329
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.650 
Meanwhile, are we going to produce top-quality

330
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:13.570 
MOOCS? The whole MOOC thing would not be there if

331
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:18.190 
they'd not been for Stanford, Harvard, Yale and the top universities playing this game.

332
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.980 
So are we going to compete with top quality MOOCS,

333
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.530 
which have a clear public backing,

334
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:31.340 
which look into lifelong learning, not only after but also before,

335
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.720 
and which do have a production and distribution and research

336
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.360 
focus, which cannot be one in Europe

337
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.340 
but cannot be one hundred,

338
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.530 
because we are dispersed but we cannot be too dispersed.

339
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.420 
So I can see that the stake is to find a pluralistic

340
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.830 
policy-making where still we are banking on what we have already

341
00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:01.420 
developed. I love what they've been doing at HPI and again

342
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.060 
those who have been the translator need to be the translator

343
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.020 
but in a public vision which must be distinctively european

344
00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.290 
and the time is really now of the essence,

345
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.060 
because competition has become tough and we risk to lose a

346
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.610 
game which is going to be a geo-cultural game

347
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.310 
for the next twenty years. Thank you very much for your attention.

348
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.580 
Thank you very much Mauro. Professor Mongenet Catherine, the floor is yours.

349
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.040 
Okay, thank you very much.

350
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.470 
I'm sharing my screen.

351
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.320 
There.

352
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:53.100 
I suppose you see it. Yes. Ok, well I'm very happy to be in this great panel

353
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.760 
with my colleague of course and what I would like to tell you

354
00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.390 
in the next couple of minutes is what we have been doing in Europe

355
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.670 
with respect to the MOOC platform, to the MOOC providers.

356
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:09.860 
So, I don't know if you are completely aware of this but

357
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.300 
we have created in two thousand and eighteen

358
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:19.220 
what we call the European MOOC Consortium. This European MOOC Consortium

359
00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:25.310 
was founded by our british colleague from Future Learn, our spanish

360
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:29.150 
colleague from Miriada.X, our colleague from Italy EduOpen,

361
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:36.990 
with EADTU is running a MOOC portal which is called OpenupEd

362
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.820 
and a couple of weeks ago

363
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.110 
EMOOCS to the Austrian platform joined an EMOOC Consortium.

364
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.740 
So as you can see this consortium is quite,

365
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.030 
I don't say, powerful but it means something because we have more than

366
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.680 
three thousand MOOCS, more than four hundred

367
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.170 
higher education institutions and we are running in different

368
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.640 
languages, of course, the languages of these different countries.

369
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:09.080 
When we decided to create this EMOOC consortium

370
00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.300 
what we were really willing to do..

371
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:18.420 
Can you still see my screen? Yes. Okay, sorry I think I made a mistake.

372
00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.520 
Can you see it now? Yes. Ok.

373
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.650 
So what we want you to do was really to

374
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.970 
be more powerful at the european level together, to be a voice that would

375
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.260 
count in discussion with the European Commission.

376
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:40.350 
We wanted to really try to have an impact on the

377
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:46.040 
education in Europe, the new policies, new strategy that Europe was

378
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:52.070 
willing to put in this domain and of course

379
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.800 
in most of our platform

380
00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:01.390 
the learners are not mainly students, I mean, eighteen to twenty five year olds.

381
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.570 
Our learners are mainly

382
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:09.620 
people who are working in a company, were working in different

383
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.880 
or seeking for a job or willing to change jobs. So people

384
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.640 
who come on our platform

385
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.860 
with the idea of lifelong learning and continuous education, so

386
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.500 
we decided that together we wanted to

387
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:29.310 
try to be a voice that could be heard: That MOOCS are a good

388
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.460 
mean for continuous education, for continuous professional development,

389
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:38.620 
and of course we know very well that in Europe there is a huge need for

390
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.540 
upskilling, reskilling,

391
00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:46.270 
jobs are going to disappear, new jobs are going to happen, the covid crisis is even

392
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.370 
stressing this problem, so we think that

393
00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.650 
MOOCS are naturally and in both,

394
00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.920 
Christoph and Mauro set in their presentation,

395
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:01.580 
MOOCS is a powerful tool for continuous

396
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.810 
education. So

397
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:11.630 
two or three years ago we decided to join our forces

398
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.270 
in an Erasmus project called:

399
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.710 
"European MOOC Consortium for labour market".

400
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:22.240 
And in this project we are not only around MOOC

401
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:27.290 
providers we also have employment services from different countries in Europe,

402
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.610 
we also have sectors of activities who work with us in this project

403
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.410 
and of course what we have in mind in this

404
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.320 
project which is really focusing on continuous education,

405
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.880 
training people from the labour market, is that the need is

406
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.130 
very strong for continuous education, it is even stronger since the Covid

407
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:53.760 
crisis and all this really needs and Mauro's said  it very clearly in his presentation

408
00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.570 
development of good digital courses.

409
00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:04.310 
And we also understood as everyone else, by the way, that there is

410
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:10.910 
a demand which is growing very fast for shorter programs. On the

411
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.660 
right side of the screen I am showing you

412
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.510 
a survey that has been done two years ago

413
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.760 
which represent the different types of microcredential

414
00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.390 
specialization initiative and as you can see or maybe you don't

415
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.540 
see very well because it's too small but anyway what it basically says that

416
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.840 
everywhere on the different platform there is a lot of quite

417
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:46.310 
credential that has been created, provided and it's very diverse.

418
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.760 
There is no consistency in these

419
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:53.850 
different type of qualification and of course this leads to confusion

420
00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.860 
and this lack of clarity is really

421
00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:04.210 
a big problem for universities, for companies and for the learners.

422
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.970 
So what we wanted to do in in this consortium, in this European project,

423
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.410 
was to try to define altogether a common standard

424
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.930 
of microcredential to support lifelong learning.

425
00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:26.160 
And so that's what we did and we define what we call a common microcredential framework.

426
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.770 
The idea was really for us to

427
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.840 
lay the foundation of a new qualification, to address the

428
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.560 
need of continuous education both for employees and employers, learners

429
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:44.250 
who are looking for smaller units of study

430
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:50.220 
because when you are working in a company in your life and you have

431
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.020 
lots of activities you are willing to go to continuous education,

432
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.510 
you are willing to take new courses and get a new credential

433
00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:04.800 
but this has to be created in a shorter way than a whole curriculum or the whole

434
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.050 
bachelor master degree.

435
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.800 
Of course, we absolutely

436
00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:13.460 
want those courses and the credential that will be provided

437
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.950 
to be recognized toward a formal qualification.

438
00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.450 
Moreover, we think that it's important that these microcredential are stackable.

439
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:27.010 
You are working in a company in two thousand and twenty one,

440
00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.370 
you take a microcredential on the topic, next year you will

441
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:34.440 
take a microcredential on the topic. These microcredential can be stackable

442
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.360 
they can be transferable and they can help you to go back to

443
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.990 
university and take a degree if that's what you want to do

444
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.350 
if that's what you need to do.

445
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.240 
And last but not least, of course, we have to make sure that

446
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.510 
quality assurance is a strong topic and

447
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.630 
that the quality of the courses and the quality of the assessment is really

448
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:02.660 
taken into account by both the MOOC providers and the MOOC producers, of course.

449
00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:09.990 
So, here is shortly summarized what we end up as a common micro financial framework.

450
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:14.040 
We decided that a common micro financial framework should be

451
00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:20.960 
a set of study that goes from one hundred to one hundred and fifty hours of

452
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:27.930 
study time. Of course, we are talking about microcredentials provided by universities so

453
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.990 
these microcredential correspond from level 5 to level eight

454
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.140 
of the european microcredential framework. There has to be

455
00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.210 
a very strong summative assessment and because they are provided

456
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.620 
by universities they can provide academic credit for that four to six

457
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:51.300 
ECTS, by the way, and of course we want to make sure that we provide those

458
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:59.880 
microcredential to people who earn them so we have to have an ID

459
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:05.860 
method to verify who is a person whose taken a microcredential.

460
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.590 
We have to make sure that the exams that are taken are correctly

461
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.830 
supervised to make sure that there is no cheating and that the person really

462
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.710 
deserves the microcredential and of course

463
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.210 
the last point is to provide a transcript so

464
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.320 
all the learning outcomes of the course or

465
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:30.640 
all the details of the microcredential are provided to the learners

466
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.270 
so we can benefit from this.

467
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.670 
So on several of our platform we have decided

468
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.190 
to call these microcredential - Gradeo because microcredential

469
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.900 
in french or in spanish doesn't translate so well.

470
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.930 
So now this was really something to give you an idea that

471
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:57.610 
cooperation in Europe on MOOC and MOOC platform is not something that

472
00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:01.610 
is for the future it's something that's already happening and then in Carlo's

473
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:06.700 
question there was also a question about cooperation with companies

474
00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:11.350 
and what I'm showing you are a few example of microcredential

475
00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:12.440 
that are provided by one of our partners

476
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.210 
which is Future Lane and as you can see on the different example

477
00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.960 
the microcredential are created by university but in partnership

478
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:28.290 
with a company, Cisco for one, Amazon for another one

479
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:35.100 
etc., and this is also something that we see which is happening in

480
00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:38.540 
this movement of the MOOC platform around microcredential.

481
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:44.930 
On our FUN-MOOC platform that we have launched last week we had microcredential

482
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.500 
a couple of months ago but we are relaunching some of them

483
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.020 
and create a new one with

484
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.590 
an engineer school which is called ESTIA

485
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.480 
which is based in south of France and what is interesting with these microcredential

486
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.580 
is that they are created in partnership with Oracle. In order

487
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.400 
as you can see those microcredential

488
00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:11.580 
technical microcredential on issues about programming,

489
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.500 
big data, artificial intelligence

490
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:22.730 
and so there is a strong partnership between engineer school

491
00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:26.580 
and Oracle to provide both the knowledge

492
00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.940 
and from the academic people, from the engineer school

493
00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.580 
and then the practical

494
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.780 
information and the practical access to

495
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.610 
testing and things like that from Oracle, and in this case

496
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.910 
the students, the learners that will get

497
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.650 
through this program will get both a certificate from the school

498
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.110 
and a certificate from Oracle.

499
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.830 
And this initiative of microcredential that we launched three years ago

500
00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:10.420 
is really ringing with what Europe is doing because if you have been

501
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:13.670 
following the new skill agenda that has been

502
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.050 
promoted by the new commission

503
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:21.770 
among the twelve action of this new skill agenda there is

504
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:26.850 
one action - action ten, which is based on the european approach to microcredential.

505
00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.280 
And last year in two thousand and twenty there was a working

506
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.010 
group and i've been lucky to be involved in this working group with

507
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.810 
George B. which is a colleague of EADTU who is also partner

508
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:43.470 
of the Open MOOC Consortium and there was a very deep discussion

509
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:47.130 
about what should be in Europe a common approach for microcredential

510
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:52.980 
and I'm showing you here the definition that came up from

511
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:56.940 
from the working group and that is going to be used in the

512
00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.010 
next weeks, next months for the different steps that the European

513
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.710 
Commission is going to set up around this common approach for microcredential.

514
00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:10.660 
I am not going to go in detail, except Karlos if you tell me that I should,

515
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:14.890 
the slides are going to be shared among the

516
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:21.060 
participants, I believe, so I'm going just to stop there

517
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.750 
and I hope that this gives you

518
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.210 
an insight on what is already going on in Europe. I'm not saying that

519
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.610 
everything is perfect but we are moving and we are

520
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:45.570 
trying to make sure that we cooperate to be

521
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:51.650 
efficient at the european level to share our expertise and to

522
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.030 
share our vision. Thank you very much for your attention.

523
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.190 
Thank you very much Catherine. And last but not least

524
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.070 
Martin Ebner, please. Thank you very much as I thank you also for

525
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.690 
all this wisely words from my pre-speakers.

526
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.490 
It's very interesting and I would like to just add some few

527
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:14.250 
words because as I think we should also have a little bit time for

528
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.650 
discussions.

529
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:21.210 
Interesting for me so that I would like to add to Christoph and also Mauro

530
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:26.010 
that we have also done that kind of future study a couple of years ago.

531
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.920 
That this was an

532
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:34.480 
Horizon Scanning report where we thought about what is the future role of universities

533
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.310 
and i completely agree as

534
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.900 
we also summarized there that there must be a kind of educational

535
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:47.540 
hubs as we are talking about universities who are maybe doing for example content

536
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:52.430 
MOOCS, online courses and other universities will just more

537
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:56.730 
or less use that for the education and we have these

538
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:59.880 
two different roles so we have universities who play a major

539
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.300 
role on the worldwide market, on the european market, on the

540
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.610 
national market and then we have also universities who are

541
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.380 
doing the regional education and

542
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:14.810 
we expected already that before Corona was happening, for example,

543
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:18.380 
before this future education hype was happening and now we

544
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.390 
just see there is a kind of boost, of course, and

545
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:26.040 
my role as a, because, I'm a MOOC provider, MOOC platform provider.

546
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.940 
I would say we should differ between two different things so I can

547
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.560 
be a MOOC provider, a MOOC platform provider, say: Ok, I'm part

548
00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.940 
of the whole world education as i will compete for example

549
00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:44.790 
with Coursera and Udacity" or have for example: "I've been a MOOC platform provider

550
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.260 
who is just thinking about MOOCS for education, in the sense,

551
00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.970 
for our society, for our labour market", because, you know, as an

552
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.480 
Europe and that was also a question from Carlos

553
00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:01.410 
is very diverse, we have different languages and we have also a

554
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:07.240 
responsibility for our society, we are just talking, in my case, German.

555
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.970 
And that was the reason why we started as a MOOC platform provider,

556
00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:16.330 
with german MOOCS, because our goal was that we have to provide

557
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:19.840 
for our nation and for a country and for a german speaking area

558
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.740 
also content where we reach the whole society, the whole labour

559
00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.490 
market and not just a few percent of that and our goal was

560
00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.280 
not to reach the world and now we are going in a little bit

561
00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.350 
different direction, of course, we are connecting

562
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:39.110 
during the so called MOOC hub, for example, we have standardised the format:

563
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:44.240 
old german MOOC provider with the idea that this all who can

564
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.540 
speak this kind of language, also use other these different kind of

565
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:54.160 
MOOCS and in their language and that is, I think, a very important

566
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.850 
step and the important step is , also, that we have

567
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.720 
educational material educational content

568
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.720 
for our society because we need it for our education and in

569
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.150 
our ideas always that we also make this free available as so

570
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.230 
called open educational resources because then you are able

571
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:15.490 
to translate it, for example, easily as we have also examples

572
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:22.120 
in this conference but first try to make automatically translations to different languages

573
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:26.860 
and so we can handle completely different all these troubles

574
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.780 
we have that's not an english language MOOC, for example, and

575
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.110 
i think this is for an european level also very important to

576
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:38.190 
state that we have also responsibility to our society and I

577
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.780 
would like to end up here because I think there are a lot of

578
00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.990 
questions and we should discuss on that. Thank you.

579
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:46.810 
Thank you very much Martin. Thank you very much to all of you.

580
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.500 
Let me start with one question and maybe then others will come up.

581
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:56.510 
When Google started to be a giant, now it's already clear paradigm

582
00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.880 
but when it started and there were other

583
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.860 
search engines around, Yahoo and others.

584
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.990 
Europe said: "Ok, we have to have a european

585
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.240 
search engine", and I think there was a

586
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.970 
French-German initiative publicly driven to

587
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.990 
have a european search engine. This has failed.

588
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:27.620 
Is the environment, the whole setting in Europe, I mean that

589
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:34.350 
in the United States it's private start-ups that rule the world: edX, Coursera,

590
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.460 
Udacity, etc.

591
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:43.610 
Has to be the response in Europe always public

592
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:49.680 
initiatives versus bright ones in the US, I mean HPI is in a very

593
00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.750 
interesting duality because it's private and public at the same time.

594
00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.560 
FUN is driven by the ministry so it's totally public. I mean

595
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.390 
they are, of course, private examples like MedianaX in Spain

596
00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:10.880 
but most of them, even Future Learn has been driven by the open university and the

597
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:16.650 
government behind it. I mean most of the answers to the private initiatives of US

598
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.750 
are public. Is this the only way

599
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.870 
because the structures are this way in the there can be no

600
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:29.620 
initiatives from the private sector? Ivercity, for instance, from Germany

601
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:33.410 
which was a private but has failed, I mean, I think it's been bought by a

602
00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.710 
Nature but you don't see the route.

603
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:42.680 
Is this a main obstacle towards more innovation in Europe?

604
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:45.460 
In the era of MOOCS.

605
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:53.280 
I start with my thoughts without being able to give an answer.

606
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:58.700 
There are different things. First, we are divided by the different languages

607
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:05.380 
and each language also provides most. From the european countries

608
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:06.900 
if something is offered

609
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.780 
it's very likely that's also offered in english.

610
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:17.510 
So we have a smaller audience by this language fraction.

611
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.540 
This is one thing. The other thing, many things are

612
00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:28.550 
state funded and the state, at least, in Germany but also in other european

613
00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.440 
states pays a lot for universities.

614
00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:37.720 
So, I often see what is in my eyes a misunderstanding.

615
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:43.940 
See, the idea that MOOCS are have to be good for universities,

616
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:49.470 
have to explain or expand the offer for the students

617
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:57.300 
and I every time say that we are not focusing our offers to the students.

618
00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.880 
The students, they have time, they can come to the university,

619
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:06.830 
of course, but the big amount of the people, so we see it from

620
00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.490 
thirty five to fifty five/sixty,

621
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.250 
this is the main users of our offers

622
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.790 
and because the state is

623
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.550 
funding the state looks for synergies and there's all the universities,

624
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.790 
all the teachers you could offer such coursers

625
00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.840 
and then you can take it for your students.

626
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.810 
I think that's a misunderstanding which scared us down

627
00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:38.810 
because we have each the big universities have not so much students

628
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.620 
to make it useful to run MOOCS

629
00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:44.500 
as the other form of courses

630
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:50.710 
but not massive. This is about one thing. The other thing is when you look to the

631
00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.820 
development of Coursera and others.

632
00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:59.290 
They start with an idea a small startup and they were able to

633
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.550 
attract a huge amount of

634
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:08.080 
capital to develop a business and those could

635
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:13.950 
scale they could get a large audience and now in the last years

636
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.930 
we saw that they are asked for a business model

637
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.820 
and to offer our education for free it costs a lot

638
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:24.260 
and someone has to pay for it.

639
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:30.350 
And so receive as an American platforms that they now find a business model with

640
00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.920 
education for companies

641
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:41.180 
so that they design courses and offer courses to develop

642
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:43.230 
co-workers for industries.

643
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:51.420 
They have a big industry, a big market though also this

644
00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.160 
continued education programs for companies.

645
00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.520 
This corporate

646
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:04.590 
education has a bigger market then in Europe with again with

647
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:06.440 
a fraction of languages.

648
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:10.710 
Thank you Christoph.

649
00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:19.580 
I see many similarities between

650
00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:23.680 
edX, Coursera, on one side and what we've been doing in Europe.

651
00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:31.540 
edX and Coursera have been created by university professors.

652
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:33.920 
They have been created,

653
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:40.160 
for edX, for instance, they've been created with the money from MIT

654
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.450 
and Harvard.

655
00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.410 
And the American system is such that

656
00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:50.440 
universities are

657
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:55.910 
privately funded so ,of course, when they decided to go with

658
00:49:55.910 --> 00:50:01.680 
this initiative of creating both with a Daphney Koller and an Andrew Ng

659
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.430 
in Coursera and

660
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:08.180 
colleagues from MIT and Harvard have created an edX,

661
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:13.370 
they went to the people who can support the initiative and they got

662
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:17.610 
private money. When we decided to have initiative in Europe

663
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.720 
because our universities are more publicly funded at least

664
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.370 
in many countries in Europe then we had the same will

665
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:28.740 
to do something but instead of going to private companies we

666
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:33.160 
went to whoever is funding our university which are

667
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:35.250 
our respective states. So,

668
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.830 
I think this should be taken into account when we analyze the situation

669
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:44.190 
and I would like to answer the question:

670
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.830 
"Why start rebuilding everything from scratch?"

671
00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:50.470 
I don't believe we are

672
00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.890 
rebuilding everything from scratch.

673
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.700 
We have been using technologies that were available and we

674
00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.920 
didn't start from scratch.

675
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.570 
Just very shortly when the french

676
00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:07.380 
community and I am not talking about the french government

677
00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:11.910 
I'm talking about the french higher education community including our ministry

678
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.070 
but the teachers, the professors, the president of university

679
00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:20.480 
wanted in two thousand and thirteen to create a platform for french speaking MOOCS

680
00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:26.120 
in order to provide because remember that in two thousand and thirteen

681
00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.570 
this great american platform if you didn't speak english then

682
00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.660 
you had an interface in english in english or in english so

683
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.980 
if we wanted in Europe to show things with different languages

684
00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.370 
we had to do something. Of course, now they have understood that the world

685
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.450 
is not only an english speaking world and then they have course,

686
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.750 
and they have interfaces in many languages but in two thousand and thirteen

687
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:51.780 
it wasn't the case. When we decided in France that it should

688
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:57.000 
be a good idea to have a platform hosted in France for GDPR and

689
00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:02.230 
other reason but also to have a french interface and to promote french speaking courses,

690
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:06.640 
we didn't start from scratch. We were very lucky to be able

691
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.880 
to use open edX, which by the way should be mentioned here because edX,

692
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.040 
founded by MIT/Harvard, they decided to put their code in open source and if

693
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.960 
they wouldn't have done that we would have been so far away

694
00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:24.790 
very quickly. So, just to answer the question in the chat:

695
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:28.460 
We didn't start rebuilding everything from scratch. We were

696
00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.950 
lucky to use technology that was available in open source

697
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:35.570 
and I know other colleagues that use MOODLE which is another technology

698
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:40.410 
available in open source to create their own platform. So, we were not

699
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:46.510 
starting from scratch. We were focusing on providing a platform

700
00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:51.080 
as quickly and efficiently as possible and helping the teachers

701
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.810 
to create content because as Mauro said: "the key is to produce

702
00:52:55.820 --> 00:53:00.190 
good content and create good content", and we know that we talk about digital content

703
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.600 
it takes time and energy and money to create.

704
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.740 
That's what i wanted to tell you.

705
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:09.230 
Thank you Catherine. Mauro.

706
00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:16.010 
Yes. That's a tough question but it's probably the easiest

707
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:17.440 
one to answer because

708
00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:23.080 
as I said before I mean there's going to be a lot of public

709
00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.760 
money in the next two years whether you like it or not.

710
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.340 
So I agree with Catherine, I mean there is no way that we could

711
00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:33.570 
go after any.. I mean we've been doing Federica thanks to the

712
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.350 
generous funding by European Union structural funds for fifteen

713
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:42.480 
years in a row. Nothing like that couldve happened. We have now

714
00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:47.670 
what we call a digital factory with seventy five people working there,

715
00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:51.320 
carrying research, organizing meeting. I mean, all these thanks

716
00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.840 
to EU funding for fifteen years.

717
00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:01.370 
And now there is so much more money coming first through the national governments

718
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:05.350 
and I think the language point is very important.

719
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.550 
If we produce something in English at Federica it can be very

720
00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:14.290 
successful I mean we have courses with fifty seventy thousand

721
00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:16.040 
through edX or Coursera

722
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:21.040 
but I mean if we produce something in Italian

723
00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:23.250 
we're monopolist almost

724
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:26.450 
and there is still such a great

725
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.110 
road to go so it is true that we shall still have to

726
00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:38.390 
consolidate language. I mean territory and it's necessary to

727
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:43.160 
do so because there's so much to do and a thing the public government for once

728
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:46.990 
is starting to understand and I like

729
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.300 
what was in the question, it's not a matter of starting from

730
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.620 
scratch because I think that you know several of the people

731
00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.100 
around this table under another circumstances

732
00:54:56.510 --> 00:55:00.210 
and now experience in all possible directions

733
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:07.290 
but it is true that if you talk about more mobile first elementary middle high schools

734
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:10.060 
or for instance if you talk about interface,

735
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:14.590 
which I think is what has been completely neglected in the last

736
00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:19.730 
seven to ten years. The MOOCS we see on Coursera, on edX and

737
00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:24.740 
even on Future Learn which is usually a little bit much more, I mean..

738
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:29.050 
It was his mark with respect to this they are very obsolete.

739
00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:35.310 
They are very obsolete, a little bit of content video bits, exam, test,

740
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:40.210 
test, shorter, smaller, I mean this is not very

741
00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:44.160 
much in the sense of what has been happening on the web.

742
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:51.930 
I tend to say it's like Motorola not even Nokia before the Iphone would arrive

743
00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.290 
and so to answer your question i will tell you there is

744
00:55:56.290 --> 00:56:00.330 
a lot of public money and we must be very smart in using it

745
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:03.980 
properly both at the centre and in the periphery because there

746
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:08.550 
is a great danger of dispersion. You put money everywhere you dont put money anywhere.

747
00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:12.800 
But then there is another danger. When we met in Naples someone

748
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.440 
may remember in analysing the larger scenario I said: "we're lucky

749
00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.180 
that we are talking about corporate start-ups.

750
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.100 
The big five are not yet in the game". This is no more true.

751
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.770 
Now the big five come back with a vengeance.

752
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:35.060 
I mean seventy five universities ran on microsoft teams.

753
00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:40.080 
I'm not making public comments on how efficient that software platform is

754
00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:45.410 
but I mean it's become.. I think they were about nineteen nineteen

755
00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:48.890 
by the end of the year before the pandemic.

756
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:53.760 
Now I think they are over eighty to ninety million people

757
00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.500 
and the same applies as far as we are concerned

758
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.190 
with Google. I mean a google suite has been

759
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:08.290 
dumping in the italian high school system.

760
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:14.410 
So, the answer to your question is: "I do not know".

761
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:19.950 
But if a private answer is going to come, look for Amazon, look for Microsoft,

762
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:25.330 
look for the new big player. They didn't even know about digital education before.

763
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.270 
Now they are very much into his game.

764
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:33.310 
So that's why I think it's important to be on the market

765
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.380 
and by market I mean

766
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:41.520 
producing things which are good, which are appealing, which are innovative

767
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:47.350 
and much as I believe that the signing the right policy for

768
00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:52.530 
exchanging microcredential is a useful something to do and to push,

769
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:57.090 
I see a risk there, I see that the best energies that we have

770
00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:58.820 
in play like the ones that

771
00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:01.730 
Catherine's be pulling together in a way

772
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.700 
maybe a bit too distracted in finding the way in which this can be really,

773
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:10.780 
I would say, the proper bureaucratic

774
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:14.410 
slot, that of course is necessary in a way

775
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:17.190 
but we need all the energies

776
00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:20.010 
to do fantastic MOOCS

777
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.180 
which have that european

778
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:29.070 
openness to society all through from the very beginning to the very end,

779
00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:33.150 
innovative in terms of.. I mean we can be fantastically

780
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:36.190 
innovative that was why the original idea of the Anacapri

781
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:39.340 
manifesto was: "why don't we get the guys to DRC

782
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:45.770 
to promote MOOCS?". The best european research, I mean, what are

783
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:49.220 
they doing? I mean they don't have nothing in terms of communication.

784
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:53.020 
Was a simple idea it didn't turn out to be successful with

785
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:57.620 
the guys who were there but I'm saying there is space for innovation,

786
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:01.390 
a lot of space for innovation and there is going to be

787
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:04.340 
a lot of public money. I don't think Catherine is going to need to do

788
00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:08.320 
as I also have been doing - go around with the

789
00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:13.040 
hat, as we say in Italy. I mean it's going to be poured

790
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:17.390 
but it may be poured into the wrong direction so again there

791
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:19.620 
is a cultural watershed here.

792
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:25.260 
If our government understands what is the real stakes then

793
00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:28.220 
Europe can come back. Can come back real strong.

794
00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.280 
Thank you Mauro. Martin, do you want to comment?

795
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.550 
Just some few words because I totally agree with Mauro.

796
00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:43.420 
For me as a digital education and the online courses are just once flexible

797
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:48.510 
and these flexibilities are for me a chance and the possibility to

798
00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:54.670 
to spread it out to the world. It means flexibility in the sense of

799
00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:56.850 
translations of different languages.

800
00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:02.360 
You can learn from any place or something like that and this also helps

801
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.320 
more or less Europe to come a little bit more together and

802
01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.280 
to bring education there where we need. The education, you know

803
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.620 
even for us, as MOOCS are not only for the US, American

804
01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:19.260 
country it's also for just the man and the women beside

805
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:22.860 
us because they have now the internet connections and now they can learn

806
01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:26.810 
and that's a very interesting thing that we have a very broad market

807
01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.650 
which is not realized right now because they have since one

808
01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:34.920 
and have one half year real internet connection and have to

809
01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.620 
learn to work with the internet and that's the real chances where

810
01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:43.140 
MOOCS and online courses also can help us with the whole country

811
01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.890 
as well as Europe. That's my short statement too that.

812
01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:53.330 
Carlos, If you allow.. Yes, please. This what we see in the discussion we had with MOOCS

813
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:57.720 
is very very similar to other areas of digitalisation.

814
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:02.170 
In Europe we believe we have lost the competition,

815
01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:06.670 
we have to follow and to accept the situations that the

816
01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.340 
digital world is dominated by a few

817
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.720 
US, American companies.

818
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:19.990 
This is also a misunderstanding. The first is when I have that discussion

819
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:24.050 
I feel that people think digitalisation is something for the

820
01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:25.490 
next ten or twenty years.

821
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:30.690 
No, the digitalisation is something that the human kind will never

822
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:32.030 
leave, so it's forever.

823
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:39.380 
Second question is: in Europe we have not clarified are we a common

824
01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.220 
economic zone together with America,

825
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.870 
with US or are we an own player?

826
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:54.700 
You can see this on one side we have the feeling to be an own

827
01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.790 
player we have own data protection rules.

828
01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:01.330 
On the other side the

829
01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.720 
institutions, the politics say: "Oh, we need to have

830
01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.690 
our own regulations for data protection".

831
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.210 
That does nothing to take care that we have infrastructures in Europe

832
01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:17.930 
that are built and created on the basis of this rules.

833
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:27.120 
Though the discussion privacy and safe hubs show that the two

834
01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:29.270 
regulation systems are not compatible.

835
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:35.240 
So we need to design it. When we want to have data protection laws

836
01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:40.090 
and thinking and feelings then we need also to provide in Europe infrastructures.

837
01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.990 
You can say we are a common space then it's

838
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:48.810 
not useful to have separate regulations.

839
01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.780 
We have this experience made in the schools with this national school.

840
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:57.850 
Because in the school we have following the european protection

841
01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.240 
law a very specific situation - if a teacher

842
01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:07.150 
goes with his class, with his kids to an interactive

843
01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.510 
learning system over the internet,

844
01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:17.520 
he is punishable if he has not got all the agreement of the

845
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:21.270 
parents of the children, because the children's cannot

846
01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:26.060 
decide for themselves whether they are willing to let the other person to have the data

847
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:30.010 
when on this website and interactive learning websites,

848
01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:35.240 
of course, it needs the users data to play its role.

849
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:41.380 
So what the recognition of this project we had is we need

850
01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.130 
to provide an infrastructure

851
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:49.040 
with a land store where we take care by anonymisation techniques and others

852
01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:55.040 
that the pupil which are once in the SchulCloud can use all

853
01:03:55.050 --> 01:04:00.730 
tools and all the programs running and which are available by this schule.

854
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.930 
For adults it's not a problem because adults can decide by

855
01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:07.510 
themselves if they go to a website to net their data

856
01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.380 
so what is my

857
01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:12.360 
discussion with government was,

858
01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:19.940 
they need German states, European states, European as another,

859
01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:25.830 
needs own infrastructures at least for the interaction of the state with the

860
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:30.490 
citizen, the companies, the people they are free to do what they want

861
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:35.630 
but it is our data, it's our activity and I think it's not allowed

862
01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.390 
that the German state to interact with the German state, my data

863
01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:42.510 
shifted to American platforms.

864
01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.590 
Thank you Christoph, although there are interesting developments in Europe,

865
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:50.700 
Northern Sovereign Identity, I think, this is a very good

866
01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:55.050 
initiative and I think although.. We are involved in that for that reason..

867
01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.110 
Its also low, its good, right direction but it goes slowly.

868
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:06.140 
I think there are a few more questions and

869
01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.640 
I think Catherine wants to answer that in relation to

870
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:15.170 
or have you answered that.. I made a mistake, I eraised

871
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:19.430 
the question instead of answering it. I wanted to post two links

872
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:23.210 
to answer the question for the european level about the market

873
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:26.160 
and about the number of jobs that will be..

874
01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.620 
Yea, there was a question..  Yeah, I'm really sorry.. I made an unfortunate..

875
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.170 
Has there been any research done on how many mechanics

876
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:39.300 
are needed to cope up with the skills gap for

877
01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.130 
each country, for the EU, for the world?

878
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:46.340 
I'm going to put two links in the chat

879
01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:49.240 
to answer this question.

880
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.700 
Here.

881
01:05:55.430 --> 01:06:01.570 
Yeah, I think it's useful to

882
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:03.530 
look at these data..

883
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:11.780 
Links only for us not for the participants so you have

884
01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.550 
though I can see I cannot see my two cannot see my two links?

885
01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:23.940 
You have to choose discussion participants and audience,

886
01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:27.230 
where you send it. I'll do that.

887
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:32.060 
Well, I did it for all the participants and all the panelysts.

888
01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.530 
I think you have seen it.

889
01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.710 
Ok. Because he answered in the way that you have seen it. I've done it now.

890
01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.010 
Can you comment on that?

891
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:48.360 
Well, no. I've been looking at the figures

892
01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.080 
for the last couple of months because of the

893
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:56.930 
of the Covid crisis and there are lots of information

894
01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.510 
that can answer this question about

895
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.160 
figures, the number of jobs

896
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.860 
and this is in Europe and the second thing, you

897
01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:10.610 
see it by countries in Europe, so you can really have answers

898
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:14.980 
to your questions. Of course, it doesn't say that this number

899
01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.550 
of job requires this number of microcredentials but at least

900
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.480 
it gives to everyone the opportunity to understand that we

901
01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:26.460 
should focus on these topics because there is a huge need for continuous education

902
01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:28.430 
and that some of the topics are not

903
01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.380 
so valuable if you want to develop..

904
01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.760 
And someone is putting another.. Right. Ok. Very good.

905
01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.580 
I add also another link to ESCO..

906
01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.430 
Very useful as well. I agree.

907
01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:46.710 
Which is a classification a categorization of all jobs and

908
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:52.490 
competencies for work which I think is also relevant. We discussed

909
01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:57.490 
examples, in one of the speeches missing

910
01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:04.500 
commutative, they missing.. it's difficult to see a

911
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.550 
european offers because there is a much smaller providers than

912
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.050 
the world wide acting provider

913
01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:18.040 
and at that sense I like the initiative of Martin and his iMooX

914
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:23.550 
starting in Germany to develop something like a common catalogue

915
01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:32.330 
so that it's much easier to compare things and make them more visible

916
01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:37.350 
and I think this is something we should do together

917
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:42.820 
to organize more publicity for this common

918
01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:48.530 
offers we have, because every time in this very successful

919
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.220 
American companies communication and visibility is

920
01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:57.240 
a very big part of their activities.

921
01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:05.110 
Indeed. I am not seeing more questions..

922
01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.130 


923
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:13.870 
Let me go back to the issue of credentials. Now with the European MOOC credentials presented by

924
01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.930 
Catherine, there are many initiatives about credentials.

925
01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:23.190 
A private providers like Digitary is providing credentials

926
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:27.120 
to , I think, Australia, New Zealand and also a lot of Ireland,

927
01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:28.910 
so they are private

928
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:34.550 
companies coming to the field but there are also european ones.

929
01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:40.090 
The Europe has digital credentiality so now the field is very

930
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.570 
vibrating. Now it's a lot because there will be money behind.

931
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:48.810 
It no there will be I think and I don't know, I mean the European MOOC Consotrium,

932
01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:52.330 
I think is a great initiative because

933
01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:56.180 
it covers many countries and it only covers MOOCS, which is important,

934
01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:00.190 
I mean this is what we are here for but is only one aspect

935
01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.010 
of lifelong learning. It is

936
01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.770 
much bigger, for instance

937
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:09.970 
in Germany you have the false schulen or the

938
01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:13.170 
false schulen in doing anything because they are for lifelong learning..

939
01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:16.150 
Can I just say something before..

940
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.760 
The microcredential following the common microcredential

941
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:25.460 
is not a MOOC. It's bigger than a MOOC. It's a set of MOOCS that

942
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:27.450 
correspond to a pathway to get

943
01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:33.420 
skills in a specific area and if you look at the examples that

944
01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.560 
i've shown you on FUN and on

945
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:42.040 
Future Learn then you will see that these microcredential are composed of different courses

946
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.870 
and so we are.. But its MOOC courses, its MOOC area..

947
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:53.120 
Several. Yes, ok. But it's MOOCS which are combined, stackable, etcetera. Its MOOCS.

948
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:56.900 
Well, it's online courses whether you call them MOOCS or not.

949
01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:01.490 
Well, we don't expect to have thousand of people taking a microcredential

950
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:06.050 
on our platform because that's probably not going to be the case

951
01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:11.300 
and these microcredential are not for free either so its..

952
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:17.430 
You know the word MOOC is now some sort of..

953
01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:22.270 
where everyone.. as Mauro said in his presentation so many

954
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:25.430 
people use the word MOOC and it doesn't have the same meaning

955
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:29.360 
but I would say that a microcredential is an online course,

956
01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:34.780 
it's an online training more than course, it's composed of smaller courses

957
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.210 
and but it is really professionally oriented, it is really skill

958
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:42.510 
oriented and

959
01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:46.170 
it happens to have been

960
01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.670 
created on MOOC platform.. Well.

961
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:56.040 
Excellent, so..

962
01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:02.150 
As i would like to agree to Catherine

963
01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.910 
because as a microcredential means that we have any kind of

964
01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:11.190 
courses of online materials and online courses and in combinations with

965
01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:16.080 
the local institutions and of course we are thinking currently MOOCS because it's

966
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.860 
I think the most easiest way currently how we can combine that and

967
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.930 
make it visible but in the long run, of course,

968
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:30.320 
microcredential needs a kind of certificate and just a possibility

969
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.300 
to show which kind of education, what's happening here, and for

970
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.720 
sure maybe in ten years we have just online courses and we

971
01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.260 
are not discussing anymore about MOOCS, it's just an online

972
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.380 
course from my perspective.

973
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:47.610 
Let me say that I do not fully agree on this point in the sense that

974
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:50.710 
if you lose the open

975
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:57.750 
of the massive open online courses and if you also lose the massive,

976
01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.570 
then you are simply going back to what has been part of the, you know,

977
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:06.420 
professional education for the past thirty years. I mean online

978
01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.810 
courses have been there for decades.

979
01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.720 
What has changed with the MOOCS is the quality

980
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:16.600 
and the quality of the MOOCS

981
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:20.310 
is strictly linked to the fact that it is open.

982
01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:25.990 
You know it's just like for research and we are all, you know, university professors.

983
01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:31.790 
If we made a career by keeping our publication in a drawer,

984
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:35.140 
I mean, it would be still very nice but would be a little bit, you know..

985
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:38.750 
What's really is worth what you write.

986
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:45.090 
So the massive change has been that this online courses which

987
01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:48.300 
have been there for the past thirty years before the MOOCS..

988
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:52.430 
Electronically there is not a big change, the big change has

989
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:56.910 
been the social networks which has made it possible to cut the costs

990
01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:58.770 
and to multiply the users,

991
01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:01.090 
so it's become massive

992
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:03.880 
but it's become Stanford,

993
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.860 
it's become Harvard, Yale, Princeton,

994
01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.730 
the university of Metric Callister Sierra. I mean

995
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:17.850 
has become quality for free

996
01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:25.110 
and be sure that the Coursera model that M. Kalda introduced to us

997
01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:30.210 
yesterday was still crafted in a very careful way when it comes

998
01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:33.490 
to this aspect they say accesses for free,

999
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:37.260 
then if you want to have

1000
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:40.370 
some kind of a certification

1001
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:44.890 
then we need to make it sustainable so there is going to be

1002
01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:47.890 
a fee. The fee is still going to be much smaller

1003
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:53.470 
but that's my pre-occupation whenever we produce something..

1004
01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.840 
At Federica we have something like you Coursera.

1005
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.460 
I mean we have like this kind of specialization programs. We

1006
01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:02.360 
call it another way and they are free.

1007
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:04.950 
They are quality and they're free

1008
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:09.390 
and we can pay for it thanks to EU funding

1009
01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.060 
so this does not mean that EU do not have to come up with

1010
01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.870 
some kind of sustainability model which is not only public

1011
01:15:17.150 --> 01:15:20.450 
but you need to be open if you want to be

1012
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.730 
faithful to the MOOC vision.

1013
01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.660 
When I say there are MOOCS and MOOCS I say because some of

1014
01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.290 
these things are open..

1015
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:35.660 
So-so, the interface is very disputable,

1016
01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:39.660 
so I say, I mean, I put my faith on the MOOCS

1017
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.740 
and if you don't put your faith on the MOOCS we're simply going backwards

1018
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.940 
and at that point is going to be the larger market of lifelong

1019
01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.790 
learning with a lot of these private companies, that me and Carlos

1020
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:56.180 
talked about there are millions of so these guys out for business.

1021
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:58.770 
They even sell credentials,

1022
01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.290 
always doing that. In Italy a lot of this, you know, fake,

1023
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.990 
usually local level, sometimes no longer local level,

1024
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:12.380 
fake online courses, which give you a certificate

1025
01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:17.480 
that has nothing to do with MOOC revolution as we have been thinking of

1026
01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:21.070 
up to now so I think it needs to be public,

1027
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.450 
in the sense it needs to be open.

1028
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:27.340 
Then of course there is a sustainability model

1029
01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.500 
but the reason why I say this.. if it is not open

1030
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:35.690 
always responsible for the quality

1031
01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:42.030 
and I tell you M. is even more careful about this

1032
01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:45.620 
because there is a lot of criticism in the whole

1033
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:49.850 
environment more than borrowing by saying " aha you lost the original

1034
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:52.360 
spirit you are only doing things for money "

1035
01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.870 
and I wouldn't like to be

1036
01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:58.700 
a target of that kind of criticism because I do believe as

1037
01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.150 
I think we all believe that

1038
01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:06.040 
going open is the first point of going public.

1039
01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:12.830 
Let me challenge you. When we were saying everything is a MOOC. Maybe,

1040
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:17.880 
provoke you and let me be the advocate's devil.

1041
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:21.870 
Maybe, we are discussing on something which is already obsolete.

1042
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:28.990 
Maybe, the US and others are already more advanced, looking at the next

1043
01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:32.380 
wave of teaching and let me mention just a couple of apps and

1044
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:40.620 
initiatives: Quantic and altMBA one 's have set go down

1045
01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:45.590 
so that was a famous a figure in the US.. Now he has

1046
01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:50.670 
to make a company who does MBAs but they have not

1047
01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:52.910 
made any own content.

1048
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:58.640 
The content of MBAs is there in the books, so read the books they provide events,

1049
01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:02.410 
tutoring, social interaction, interaction with companies.

1050
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:07.520 
Online and well.. They provide

1051
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:11.740 
added value. I mean, the books are there, the good books. They are just a selection

1052
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.420 
of works, you have to read them. You have to do

1053
01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.190 
projects, etc. The thing is, thirteen projects every week

1054
01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:21.480 
a new project with others, a lot of interaction with companies.

1055
01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.040 
Or Quanty, which is mobile first,

1056
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:28.720 
which is also specialised on MBAs.

1057
01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:34.960 
Mobile first.. I mean, was not so much the MOOC interface, etc.,

1058
01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:38.490 
the MOOC platform that we know of but totally different,

1059
01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:42.480 
so more focusing on the interaction of the social aspects and events.

1060
01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.020 
We have one, also in Spain, which is quite..

1061
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:51.160 
The PowerMBA which is quite successful. No accreditation, nothing, there no public

1062
01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:57.630 
accreditation, but every month they make I think a million euros of

1063
01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:03.620 
benefit. Every month. They have provided what they call a MBA,

1064
01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:08.600 
which is not real MBA, much shorter, but it costs five hundred euros.

1065
01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.910 
Cheap, a lot of interactions, lot of events, etc.

1066
01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.160 
Its another way of seeing it.

1067
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:20.040 
Is this maybe the next wave? More mobile, more smartphone, more

1068
01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:27.440 
interactive. Is this what should be the next and we are still discussing..

1069
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.230 
Ok, is the videos, the

1070
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:33.100 
quizzes, etc. Just to provoke it.

1071
01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.460 
Carlos, very shortly.

1072
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.700 
And what you talked about, it's very important, it's innovative,

1073
01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:42.600 
it's a very incredibly small.

1074
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:47.340 
Coursera went public and we'll see what's going to happen.

1075
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:53.950 
My answer is yes. This may be the future, if any larg giant

1076
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:58.920 
as Amazon or Microsoft or Apple steps into this game and if

1077
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.440 
they do produce the innovative interactive interface

1078
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:07.790 
then I think the game is going to be a new game in town, up to now.

1079
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:13.900 
Where we stand now the situation is - Coursera still is incredibly jill's and

1080
01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.900 
edX also on their public mission.

1081
01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.290 
There is a lot of public money.

1082
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:23.350 
For the first time now being put into the game in Europe,

1083
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:28.370 
so I will say let's play this game let's play with an eye to

1084
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:31.130 
what you are seeing as you know we are both experimenting

1085
01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:35.230 
engagedly and about our innovative platform so there's a lot

1086
01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:36.780 
to do in terms of innovation

1087
01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:40.000 
but now there is for the first time in Europe

1088
01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.880 
important public funding and also do not forget the students.

1089
01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:50.680 
I mean, we made an nation wide, you know, survey..

1090
01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:56.120 
Only, i mean, just a few months ago students take each other education for granted

1091
01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.920 
and in Europe they take public education for fact.

1092
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:03.780 
So in a way there is a high waiving

1093
01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:08.980 
then if Amazon, if Apple, if Microsoft then I say

1094
01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:13.390 
I don't know because at as Christoph was saying when we come to digital

1095
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:17.390 
we're still dwarfs in the old continent so that's a real danger.

1096
01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:20.960 
So there's no way out for Europe. We have to wait for the giants,

1097
01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.720 
the American giants to take over.

1098
01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:27.430 
There's a lot of money there but will it be fragmented and lost?

1099
01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:30.050 
Yeah, that's the question.

1100
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:36.050 
Does anybody want to answer my provocation?

1101
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:44.550 
Where are the startups that look for new ways of teaching and learning in

1102
01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:48.950 
Europe or the new public money which is investing on other

1103
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:49.630 
ways of doing?

1104
01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:56.650 
Yes, for sure. The question is:

1105
01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.410 
What is the place of universities and what is the place of

1106
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:02.120 
academic people in this game?

1107
01:22:03.230 --> 01:22:06.790 
If we think that Amazon and all these big

1108
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:12.660 
players are going to be the winners, the real question is:

1109
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:17.640 
Is there a place in this game for universities, can they create

1110
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.020 
all these courses, all these contents by themselves,

1111
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:24.790 
do we think that academic people have a role to play, they have a knowledge that

1112
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:29.850 
those people don't have, do we imagine that all these courses

1113
01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:34.780 
are going to be created by non-academic people, do we believe that

1114
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:38.920 
on the other side these giants are going to go and see each

1115
01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.590 
one of us and say I'm going to give you money to create the

1116
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:44.530 
course that I'm going to sell later on?

1117
01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:52.250 
I think the real question for european universities and european academic people is:

1118
01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:58.730 
Do we.. When I listen to Mauro, I have the feeling that the worst case scenario is:

1119
01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.520 
the companies do everything, let's close our university and

1120
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.630 
let's go to the beach or whatever.

1121
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.630 
So, I don't believe this is what's going to happen

1122
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:14.640 
and the question is: how our universities, our academic people

1123
01:23:15.810 --> 01:23:18.420 
play the role that they have to play because

1124
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:23.780 
they are the experts who can provide the contents and create those courses.

1125
01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:28.310 
I think this is a very tricky question.

1126
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.060 
Sorry Catherine, I didn't mean that at all if I've got misunderstood,

1127
01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:38.220 
I was only answering Carlos's question. I think now is the moment

1128
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:41.910 
for the public the government and the universities in Europe

1129
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:45.430 
to play the role, then if you ask me what is going to be the

1130
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:50.090 
future then I say if we do not do this and if we do not do

1131
01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.060 
it in a centralised and coordinated way

1132
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:57.970 
then at that point what Carlos has been in a way hitting may happen

1133
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:02.030 
and its not so much the start-ups but its going to be the big player,

1134
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:07.070 
the big player have been at the window up to a year ago now

1135
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:08.560 
are very much into this game

1136
01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.870 
and everything which has been changing in the

1137
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:17.020 
web environment has been big guys driven, so that's my preoccupation

1138
01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.990 
I won't go to the beach because i've you know invested in my

1139
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:23.900 
last fifteen years and try not to make this happen so I may

1140
01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:25.540 
retired but no really

1141
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:31.080 
with a relaxed spirit so no, I think now it's the moment for action

1142
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:36.490 
and for action from Europe but the danger that Carlos was in a way

1143
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:40.780 
you know provoking and putting on the floor I think

1144
01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:45.570 
the danger is there because this is now a very much bigger

1145
01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:50.050 
game than it was with Coursera and edX and the bigger guys are in the

1146
01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.040 
game so let's see what's going to happen.

1147
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:56.170 
Thank you Mauro. Maybe we have a round of last

1148
01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:00.500 
message each of you want to send. We have five minutes more.

1149
01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.050 
Christoph, want to have statement

1150
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:10.140 
to: is there for Europe any future

1151
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:15.450 
in terms of online education together or is it fragmented or

1152
01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:19.420 
how do you see it? There is a future and it is fragmented

1153
01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.500 
and this is all for reasons like language reasons so

1154
01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:29.410 
we often offer our causes in german and in english and people

1155
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:33.750 
say: Ok, do this in german only, and I believe that something

1156
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:38.580 
similar in France and in the Europe.. in Italy and the another EU

1157
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:40.340 
states and it is a chance

1158
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:48.370 
to get it. We should also provide english as available because this opens

1159
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.540 
to other states and..

1160
01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:56.180 
There is with education enough space for..

1161
01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:02.710 
And the advantage to offer a course in a language that is a

1162
01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:04.080 
major language of the people

1163
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.110 
is an advantage compared to the big players and the people

1164
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:12.300 
can follow the big players and they can same time follow us.

1165
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:18.140 
I would not see that they should stick to one platform. They

1166
01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:24.110 
will find what they look for and we have to challenge to offer interesting content

1167
01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:30.350 
that attracts people so in that case the market principle is important for me.

1168
01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:35.190 
We should not do something because there is a requirement for

1169
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:39.810 
any university list. We should count is really accepted

1170
01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.650 
by the users, do they like it, do they come, do they get certificates in this.

1171
01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:51.500 
So, I think, we have a future. We should

1172
01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:54.710 
come closer together and, of course, the

1173
01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:02.230 
EMOOCS conference has a goal and is a place to come closer together.

1174
01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:06.150 
We are very pity that you could not be here then we could

1175
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:10.740 
come even more closely and we had a good programme we have a

1176
01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:12.950 
nice environment but the

1177
01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:15.880 
perhaps some years later.

1178
01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.220 
Thank you very much Christoph, Mauro, one minute short sentence, statement.

1179
01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.760 
First of all. Thank you very much Carlos for putting us together

1180
01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.050 
and for having been here for so many years with the right spirit, ambition.

1181
01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:31.290 
And, I think, this is what we have

1182
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:36.410 
and the good news is that now this is no more a bunch of

1183
01:27:37.390 --> 01:27:41.890 
stakeholders but has become the initial and a european concern

1184
01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.230 
so I am very optimistic in this respect also because the student

1185
01:27:46.230 --> 01:27:47.750 
population for the first time

1186
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:53.270 
is scatted it's voice and it's speaking and it's speaking digital education.

1187
01:27:53.850 --> 01:27:57.320 
Not only digital education, you know, if you're lucky enough

1188
01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.450 
that you go to EPF or the fantastic whatever that

1189
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:04.700 
was described yesterday but

1190
01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:09.500 
there are millions of students who can take great advantage

1191
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:10.890 
for a top quality digital

1192
01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:16.530 
education and then there is also the whole lifelong environment so

1193
01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:19.830 
I want to say that Europe is discovering America

1194
01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:25.070 
and we can make the best of it. Thank you Mauro.

1195
01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:28.020 
Catherine.. Small..

1196
01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:33.240 
Well, I think that Europe has a role to play, I mean..

1197
01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:38.850 
We, in Europe, share a money that is almost twenty years old

1198
01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:42.950 
which is ICTS. Yes, I mean we through the Bologna process we

1199
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:47.940 
have been able to create some coherence in Europe in degrees

1200
01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.720 
in the way we present education

1201
01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.310 
and it's a huge help for the mobility between universities,

1202
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:57.220 
for the mobility between countries, for the mobility of students

1203
01:28:57.590 --> 01:29:02.020 
and I believe that with digital education, with this upcoming microcredentials

1204
01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:07.420 
if we can still work at the european level to give these guidelines

1205
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:12.060 
that will be shared by the european universities, by the european communities,

1206
01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:14.110 
by the european learners

1207
01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:18.400 
and companies then it will provide

1208
01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:25.010 
an efficient answer to the question of digital education, specially

1209
01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:28.920 
in the context of continuous and lifelong learning education and I believe

1210
01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:32.140 
on that respect that Europe has a huge

1211
01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:36.560 
role to play. Thank you Catherine, Martin.

1212
01:29:37.610 --> 01:29:42.530 
I would also like to thank Carlos and all the other participants for

1213
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:44.660 
exciting discussion here.

1214
01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:50.080 
From my point of view as we are now in the area that we are able to cooperate

1215
01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.580 
means that we have a lot of experiences in each country and now

1216
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:57.180 
we should bring together and I will happy to do so in the future.

1217
01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:00.700 
Thank you very much. Thank you to the four panelists. Excellent

1218
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:06.280 
discussion, also to the participants and in particular I would like to add

1219
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:09.310 
this person.. I don't know.. who is very active

1220
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:12.560 
in asking questions. Thanks very much. Thank you very much to all,

1221
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:15.850 
and all of us. Thank you. Bye.

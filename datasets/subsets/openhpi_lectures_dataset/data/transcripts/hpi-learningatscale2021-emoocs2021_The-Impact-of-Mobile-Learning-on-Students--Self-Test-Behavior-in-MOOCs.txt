00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.820 
i am Max, a phd student at the hasso plattner institute
in potsdam germany.

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
and i am going to present our work on the impact of mobile

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.770 
learning on students' self test behavior moocs.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.490 
next to regular desktop computers students can passive participate

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.560 
in moves with a mobile devices. for this move platforms accessible

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.830 
via the mobile browser and a responsive user interface to further

7
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.510 
improve the learning experience platform providers have a dedicated mobile applications

8
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.590 
which take advantage of more device capabilities.

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.220 
the content is the same on all devices, but learning activities differ

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.970 
on desktop computers and mobile devices.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.560 
while computers are commonly deployed for longer learning sessions mobile

12
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.760 
devices are used for shorter spontaneous activities.

13
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.840 
set as questions that are included in the learning material

14
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.190 
can be re-visited at any time. revising those self-tests would

15
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.040 
in theory be a good match for into space learning activities
on mobile devices.

16
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.230 
but first we want to investigate the differences in learning

17
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.530 
behavior that students currently show when utilizing
different device groups

18
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.420 
for answering served as questions.

19
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.100 
for this categorize the learning activities based on the utilized

20
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.670 
device and access method into desktop web,

21
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.870 
mobile web, and mobile applications.

22
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.600 
then we evaluated the behavior shown and two german moocs.

23
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.090 
that most students only participate once in a self test,

24
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.930 
and that the desktop environment is the most used one across all attempts

25
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
followed by the mobile applications.

26
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.930 
and there's only as ever so slightly increased
and the mobile apps you'll such

27
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.860 
for subsequent attempts which leads to no practical
practical differences.

28
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.640 
letting on that being as we investigated the transitions
between device groups.

29
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.170 
students tend to stick to a single device group. the only exception

30
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.350 
to this is that seven to ten percent of the learners switch

31
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.130 
to the desktop environment after using the mobile applications.

32
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.420 
we also examined the time

33
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.860 
learners spent on answering self-test. here we compared the

34
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.460 
recorded time for submission to our time estimation.

35
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.180 
the time effort estimation is based on the number of
questions and answer options

36
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.270 
each served as item.

37
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.230 
students on the mobile application use significantly more time

38
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.420 
when submitting self tests. this could be a reason for the transition

39
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.810 
to desktop computers we observed earlier.

40
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.520 
a two way anova showed significant influences of
the attempt and devise factor

41
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.240 
was significant differences in all but one poster test.

42
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.040 
based on these findings we conclude that mobile devices are

43
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.820 
currently not used for interspace self test activities.

44
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.300 
this can also be due to that self test quizzes are only accessible

45
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.870 
from the list of all learning items. therefore we are currently

46
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.430 
exploring alternative formats for self test devices
such as an separate wiki

47
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.730 
tool that can trigger spontaneous learning sessions and support

48
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.880 
offline activities. thank you!

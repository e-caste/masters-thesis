00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.500 
Now let's see how the HTML document and the cascading stylefile

2
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.990 
interact to each other.

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.050 
So here is an example of an HTML data structure. You see it's a simple

4
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.650 
document series and, head there is a body. As the body starts within first

5
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.010 
paragraph which only is characterized by the text. This is a header.

6
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.550 
Then there is another

7
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.020 
part.

8
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.630 
Then there is a footer part. Then there is in the second part a title

9
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.660 
of a certain heirarchy type, and if the browser gets this document

10
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.650 
without any cascading stylesheet information, then the browser

11
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.980 
displays this in this way.

12
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.480 
And the reason that the browser is able to display this in

13
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.140 
this way that the browser

14
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.000 
itself has cascading stylesheets, has a way if the browser does

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.310 
not get from the author information, how to display the document

16
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.380 
then the browser

17
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.250 
designer decides how to do this. This is a header 'Title 1',

18
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.090 
this is a content text, this is the footer.

19
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.070 
Now let's take influence on the layout of the document by using a cascading stylesheet.

20
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.010 
And to this end,

21
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
we link the HTML document with an external cascading style

22
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.420 
feed. Here is the link to the stylesheet

23
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.480 
which is used to give information to the different structural

24
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.010 
elements of the HTML document. So if we see how this cascading

25
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.200 
style sheet document looks like, then we see in the different

26
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.720 
parts there is a description of the different content type.

27
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.370 
Here for example there is an information about the size of the header line,

28
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.660 
of the color, of the footer, of the color of the header.

29
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.240 
Here for example yellow. As the footer is red and there are given the

30
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.410 
text alignment. It should be standrad. Size is given

31
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
how it is to display. So for every structural element in the

32
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.410 
HTML document, a format description is given and if we display

33
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.900 
when the html document

34
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.520 
is combined with this

35
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.620 
cascading stylesheet, then we have this occurrence.

36
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.530 
You see the header line in yellow, is a footer line in red,

37
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.580 
title text is red. It's the

38
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.950 
same content but differently

39
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.500 
designed, differently displayed like in the very first version. Now let's see

40
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.780 
what to do if we want to have this footer immediately below of this header.

41
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.290 
Then what's necessary is to manipulate the

42
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.770 
cascading stylesheet and to manipulate the footer position

43
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.390 
inside the cascading stylesheet. So here is

44
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.690 
another example given and if we combine this cascade, this manipulated cascading stylesheet

45
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.730 
with our XML document, then we see that now the red footer is immediately

46
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.770 
displayed below of the yellow header line, and this way you

47
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.570 
can see how one can influence the display of a documents, how

48
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.530 
easy it is to influence the display of a document by means

49
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.450 
of a cascading stylesheet, and the only thing what you have to do is

50
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.410 
beside of the HTML document, you have to design a cascading stylesheet

51
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.690 
and then you have to link the HTML document to the cascading stylesheet.

52
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.620 
And then you can have a good influence on the layout of your document.

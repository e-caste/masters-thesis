WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.290 
so they welcome to the session

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.210 
four of learning at scale.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.060 
it's called perspectives from europe and us.

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.420 
so you've got two papers

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.050 
that come from europe and two from us and we are still missing

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.160 
one presenter from us exactly precisely.

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.890 
so i am materials from the university biology in spain.

8
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
and i will be the chair of the session.

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.050 
so the session will

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.180 
last for a hour and a half at four thirty central

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.180 
european time.

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.730 
and we are going to dedicate

13
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.710 
twenty minutes for paper twenty two minutes for paper ten minutes for

14
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.610 
representation or less if it is a video, and then the rest of these a slot

15
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.460 
for discussion.
so i encourage you all to participate in the lively discussion

16
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.440 
and you can use either the raise hand so that i can have the

17
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.320 
order of the people who want to

18
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.270 
make a question, or you can use the chat. and then i can read

19
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.620 
the chat, and then probably ask you to

20
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.570 
explain it already to

21
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.900 
sew in this session. we've got these four papers and we

22
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.790 
are still missing the first one.

23
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.130 
so the first one is say that comes from authors from georgia tech

24
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.870 
deals with feature extraction approaches and mainly deals with

25
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.220 
comparative analysis between traditional books in micromasters and credentials

26
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.720 
and with credentials, while the second

27
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.380 
paper from cornell university i got a d young

28
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.050 
who is going to present it that discusses the

29
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.010 
social norms that can be applied

30
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.350 
to a in order to enhance actions outside the

31
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.690 
online course. so the third one i

32
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.330 
have with offers from the technical university of munich

33
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.610 
and will be presented by jan philipp news. ok.

34
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.820 
deal suite how i feedback can be

35
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.850 
automated with respect to textual exercise and access assessments
in large courses.

36
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.860 
as a machine learning an approach

37
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.370 
in the last one that is also co-authored by me, but it will be

38
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.880 
presented by sacchi dumas i they are all from.

39
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.940 
the three first have first come from the university of patras in greece,

40
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.300 
so in this last case,

41
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.730 
the focus of the paper is on the discussions on of in forums in book forms,

42
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.040 
and how an incremental approach can help

43
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.210 
classification. ok, so if we and i guess that we still

44
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.290 
do not have the presenters of the first a paper.

45
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.230 
i think that it's true, no ok. so

46
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.990 
if this is the case we can

47
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.900 
start with the second paper. o hoping that the

48
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.410 
presenters of the first paper will

49
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.190 
show up soon enough, and if we see that we just

50
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.190 
have three out of four papers，
then we can dedicate a little bit more time

51
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:29.970 
for the discussion of all three papers. ok so i began to a

52
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.110 
say that she prefers to show the video,

53
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.210 
and then take questions. my name is young tru a phd student at cornell university.

54
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.760 
i will present on online field experiment study titled

55
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.190 
using social norms to promote actions beyond the course.

56
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.380 
courses for a cause aim at contributing to public goods

57
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.910 
course takers are expected to conduct rearward actions applying

58
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.070 
what they've learned from the course, such as

59
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.080 
conducting sustainability practices and spreading knowledge

60
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.830 
in their local communities

61
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.170 
in other academic oriented courses.

62
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.090 
making rearward applications is also important to master skills.

63
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.820 
the centre question here is how on online course can encourage

64
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.660 
course takers to do. so one way is to utilize suiter comparison.

65
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.930 
there are multiple interventions in online education that implicitly leveraged social comparison

66
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.710 
to increase course participation

67
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.360 
that include a learning analytic bashford to design

68
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.900 
a better system a reputation system an emailing peer students performance.

69
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.490 
as an extension of social comparison,

70
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.740 
we can also use social norms

71
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:08.720 
research in social psychology shows that social norm messages can effectively promote

72
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.070 
pro-environmental behaviors.

73
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.690 
for example after receiving more messages

74
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.270 
hotel guests reused more towels, fewer people store petrified wood

75
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.680 
from a national park and students ate less meat in a school cafeteria.

76
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.850 
there are three types of norm messages and they are effective under different situations

77
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.190 
descriptive norms which communicate the majority of people

78
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.880 
conduct the target behavior as effective, when the target behavior is already prevalent

79
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:53.720 
in contrast injunctive norms communicating people r to conduct the target behavior

80
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.320 
is effective when the target behavior is not prevalent yet.

81
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.790 
dynamic norms which typically state more and more people have

82
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.110 
conducted the target behavior is effective when the target

83
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.810 
behavior is not prevalent but increasing.

84
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.500 
there are challenges of crafting norm messages for online courses

85
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.460 
first behaviors outside of the course is hard to observe.

86
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.920 
thus it is hard to know if the target behavior is prevalent or not

87
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.990 
second applying knowledge to reward the situations may not be readily done.

88
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.410 
unlike actions that can be taken immediately after receiving

89
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.180 
a norm message on site.

90
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.820 
in this paper we wanted to answer a question

91
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.360 
how do different types of social norm messages
influence learners to take actions.

92
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.900 
outside of the course and learners perceived the norms about

93
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.060 
taking actions outside of the course

94
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.510 
to get a sense of how much course takers engaged in rearward actions.

95
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.360 
we used a survey to ask the progress and crafted norm messages

96
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.240 
based on their responses.

97
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:18.470 
we sent out a survey and updated norm messages
every week throughout the course.

98
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:25.140 
we ran a randomized the contrast study to compare the different types of

99
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:32.360 
norms. we also had a control condition where participants received surveys,

100
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.450 
but not any norm messages

101
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.240 
the city was conducted, and three online courses these courses

102
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.820 
were open to anyone from anywhere,
but they were not massive open online courses.

103
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.680 
they usually have high completion rates around a
twenty to thirty percentage.

104
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.410 
we only included participants from the us in our analysis to

105
00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.460 
avoid any cultural differences based on countries.

106
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.680 
the first course promoted relatively simple behavior which was

107
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.510 
taking climate change actions, such as recycling saving water

108
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.240 
choosing a lunch box with less meat.

109
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.050 
on the other hand the other two promoted relatively complex

110
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.020 
behavior which was conducting educational activities such as

111
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:32.010 
leading a small event or teaching a class,
therefore we analyzed them separately.

112
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.610 
these are the messages we used in our study between the conditions.

113
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.820 
we manipulated messages and the graphics

114
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.090 
the percentage numbers were updated every week

115
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.930 
according to the survey responses.

116
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.830 
between courses we tried to keep the messages
in the same format as possible.

117
00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.750 
over none of the norm conditions outperformed the contour condition,

118
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:09.240 
however in promoting complex behavior sending
injunctive or descriptive nor messages

119
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:14.570 
were significantly less effective than sending no message at all.

120
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.300 
between room conditions the novel norms

121
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.870 
were most effective in promoting complex behaviors
outside of the course.

122
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.890 
we also found naur messages did not significantly
affect how course takers received

123
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.260 
norms about taking actions outside of the course.

124
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.490 
here take always four instructors were recommend encouraging

125
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:46.620 
students with a nav ignore messages they will be more effective in increasing desired

126
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.170 
complex learning behaviors than descriptive or injunctive norm messages.

127
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.520 
we don't recommend using you should do something or many others

128
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.670 
are doing something message framing's
they may be worse than saying nothing.

129
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.710 
for researchers we want to highlight that types of norm messages

130
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.740 
do not affect the perception of how important

131
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.390 
conducting target behavior is,

132
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.140 
or so rome messages have varying effect

133
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.280 
depending on the complexity of target behaviors.

134
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.380 
this is the end of the presentation.

135
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:32.580 
thank you. okay thank you very much. yeah,
i mean the presentation

136
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.830 
i was clear enough i think.

137
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.240 
so i guess we still do not have the presenter of the

138
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.110 
first paper. so

139
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.570 
we will have a little bit more time

140
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.130 
for discussion. ok, so.

141
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.260 
i have the video of the first paper already.
so i can also share that

142
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.100 
okay all right, okay probably we can leave it for the last

143
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:09.240 
part of the session, just in case the author appears i'm

144
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:16.130 
ok. so we've got one question by the right takkula

145
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:23.330 
that is in the chat.
i'll just post a course actions only applicable to books

146
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.680 
are there similar efforts in normal courses. and i don't know

147
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.830 
if that i wants to add more to her question, or are you

148
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.830 
ok, if not young if you want to answer. yeah, i

149
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.450 
first of all thank you very much for wonderful presentation.

150
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.250 
it's so very really precise and reasonably simple to understand.

151
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.150 
the question is that

152
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.290 
is it because there are shortness of the courses.

153
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.450 
and a simplicity of messages the norms will be effective, or you

154
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:08.720 
know because we also take really long courses which you know are there

155
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.840 
in that case.  do you propose these

156
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.180 
messages as kind of interventions or intermediary intermediate points

157
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.430 
during the presentation of the course,

158
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.700 
or is the basic question

159
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.570 
i answered the question.

160
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.420 
we have to similar concern,

161
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:46.100 
because even though our micro says relatively short
there was four or five weeks.

162
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.710 
so we wanted to make them effective more messages

163
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.850 
last longer. that's why we ended up having weekly

164
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.150 
norm interventions.

165
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.020 
so we updated the message

166
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.030 
the percentage of the people who conducted

167
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.420 
more than g illustrée actions.

168
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.430 
did it because we want to have the effect of

169
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:23.580 
last longer or longer courses? so i think it can be applied

170
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.530 
to any courses that could

171
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.830 
be possibly longer than four weeks.

172
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.120 
that's where the first question and another question
you asked in the church was

173
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.820 
if they if these actions are applicable also to normal courses?

174
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.540 
o yeah so i really wanted to

175
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.740 
know what before we a conduct ?

176
00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.120 
we conducted this experiment on fortunately

177
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.120 
not that i know of. so it is quite

178
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.580 
interesting that we started this intervention from the only setting.

179
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.950 
first but i would love to try out this norm interventions in the

180
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.370 
offline education.

181
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.160 
i thought they would be applicable could be useful the

182
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.510 
learning management system and we can also.

183
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.820 
and this messages easily

184
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.520 
yeah i guess the difference will be the type of people

185
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.420 
who participate in the course. and of course the if you have a

186
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.570 
blended environment how much people are going to

187
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.820 
interact through the these messages or through the live

188
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.030 
real interactions ok.

189
00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.550 
so we've got another question, but i got two more

190
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.890 
questions. okay, one more but a sare gurson as is do you have a

191
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:10.490 
hypothesis about why there is such a huge difference in the

192
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.170 
effect of the interventions.

193
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.830 
and i don't know if sarr wants to add something
to the suite in question.

194
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.290 
no it's perfectly fine the

195
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.920 
questions are different.

196
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.040 
so did you analyze the like what in the intervals in  the interventions

197
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.310 
makes the kind of difference in the effect ?

198
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.470 
first of all we couldn't

199
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.590 
like get them based on nationalities or countries,

200
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.810 
because we only focused on the us participants.

201
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.350 
but we did have their

202
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.080 
student characteristics gender.

203
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.920 
how many years

204
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.450 
they work in the education

205
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.280 
field and what types of work they're doing and what the education

206
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.060 
of the old date are coming with,

207
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.470 
but i don't think we have found any significant

208
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:30.440 
differences between these student characteristics.

209
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.320 
and also we thought that it would be great to have a qualitative

210
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.630 
research to better understand why these

211
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.530 
messages if they affect differently.

212
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:51.620 
one is because it is a light course
and people are coming from everywhere.

213
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.540 
so we certainly don't have into

214
00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.370 
information about what these people we're targeting.

215
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:07.780 
so to answer your question we simply,
but we don't know

216
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.170 
and we need more research on this.

217
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:21.210 
yes i do agree that you need to collect more data.
i mean probably

218
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.190 
use the data from the discussion forums also

219
00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.210 
besides you know some interviews.
but at least in discussion forums you may

220
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.350 
have some kind of hints of

221
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.200 
probably who, how and why you got this effect.
but who knows

222
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.810 
there is another question by a amy ogan.

223
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.240 
he's thinks you young i wanted to understand more about the mechanism.

224
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.290 
so you don't believe it affected their perception of value

225
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.930 
what else has changed.

226
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.970 
so i guess this is similar to the last question.

227
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.780 
but if you did measure perception of value it sounds like,

228
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.900 
as you said that was not what had changed. yes,

229
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:21.930 
i think this is one thing we need to improve in our next study.

230
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.100 
so when we measured the perception of value,

231
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.910 
maybe it was like two

232
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:38.040 
to bake. so i believe it fact the procession of beliefs. but

233
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.890 
the types of enormous images do not matter that much,

234
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:47.410 
because the perception of value they

235
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:54.060 
put in the off side of practices was really high. they made it

236
00:19:54.770 --> 00:20:00.500 
very high on every questions. so maybe like it was high from

237
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.620 
the very beginning.

238
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.460 
but we can also think that enormous images can affect their perceptions,

239
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.650 
but here i wanted to highlight

240
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.390 
that the types like destroy

241
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.560 
the script terrible injunctive and the

242
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.570 
norms that tied the matter.
but certainly we need more research on this,

243
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:28.630 
and you're optimising the question that can better capture how

244
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:34.880 
how norms can be used to motivate people and how they perceive

245
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.350 
the importance of applying the knowledge they learned to the

246
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.590 
clear where the cases is.

247
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:49.840 
there are so in all conditions including the culture condition

248
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:56.360 
we send out the surveyed asking, how many actions they took last week.

249
00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.260 
and also how important do you think

250
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:06.350 
taking actions. so maybe that questions itself the

251
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.910 
descending after the weekly surveys itself may like

252
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.450 
construct the norms around taking actions.

253
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:22.320 
that's like another possibility we need to explore more.

254
00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.980 
oh that's very interesting. yeah so you might be actually increasing

255
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.730 
the value by asking those questions.

256
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.530 
yeah and that but then you still end up. i assume the questions

257
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.020 
are identical across the conditions, and then you still end

258
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.130 
up with this difference.
so there's something else happening very interesting.

259
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.570 
yeah thank you yeah, we are very curious

260
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.850 
ha like this types of enormous is just like will be useful

261
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.880 
in an education complex.

262
00:21:54.730 --> 00:22:02.420 
ok, we've got a few more a questions i also got mine that i'm

263
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.180 
writing in the chat.

264
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:13.550 
so i buy a mark okay. i think that goes no

265
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.930 
thank you for the great presentation i wonder about the impact

266
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:24.650 
of the per sentence what are your thoughts using inflated or

267
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.250 
flat fake numbers as a nudge.

268
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.150 
yeah actually i proposed to do this

269
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.280 
research too,

270
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.530 
but one i got like so many

271
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.920 
one, it might not be ethical to do that and second

272
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.170 
the reason why i couldn't do that

273
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.630 
was these courses value like community.

274
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.140 
and they these like instructors

275
00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:03.520 
really value like trust between instructors and course participants.

276
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.310 
so we wanted to be transferred as possible,

277
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.490 
so this is a kind of

278
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.790 
cool idea i personally thing.

279
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:24.860 
but it may not be applicable to courses where instructors
and course participants are actually interact.

280
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:32.480 
and it's a kind of like net work

281
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.170 
instead of just like a course you just

282
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.750 
take waze and then like leap forever.

283
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.920 
so yeah i think it would be a bit

284
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:49.960 
curt to use fake or inflated numbers, but we can definitely

285
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:56.550 
change the framing. so in our messages we said

286
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.100 
ninety percent of people

287
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:04.290 
took at least three actions.
but we can change it to like

288
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.740 
maybe sixty percent of people took five actions.

289
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:14.250 
so maybe that number of actions we put in the message

290
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.200 
could have some positive effect.

291
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.240 
so there are whole ways to

292
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:27.160 
utilize what we actually have instead of making up something.

293
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:37.590 
we've got since we still do not have the presenter of the first paper

294
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.310 
as far as i know, we have

295
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.080 
like four five more minutes in case and we have got

296
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.940 
several messages in the chat.

297
00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.860 
that's great if any of the questions cannot be answered life.

298
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.900 
i greatly suggest that you answer

299
00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:02.370 
by in the chat during the session and probably later okay.

300
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:07.680 
so a question by my paris san agustin i thank you very much

301
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:13.210 
wonderful presentation.
i would like to better understand when the message

302
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:18.080 
the participants received the messages via e-mail or as a constant

303
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.820 
methods in the course for the week. and did you observe

304
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.270 
that the changes were produced more at the end of the course

305
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.530 
or along the course

306
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.970 
to answered the first question we did put.

307
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.270 
so this was a pre-paradigmatic plant,

308
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.540 
but we had soon some issues

309
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:49.860 
with the platform so there are some people
who can not access the course.

310
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.930 
so we have to email all the all the learning content.

311
00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:01.750 
so we email the course for invitation to the weekly survey

312
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.700 
at the end of the week then a week after we send thought the

313
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.500 
the normal message that is for those who

314
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.680 
have the email option then for

315
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.370 
where on the platform

316
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.220 
we added the social message.

317
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.750 
as they are  like learning content.

318
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:34.700 
so i'm not sure you're familiar

319
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.100 
with the ethics such a platform that you can have.

320
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:45.550 
you can organize the learning content quite weak, so we have our

321
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:51.410 
social message as an item under each week

322
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.270 
on the each week learning content and the search

323
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.840 
and we have the with the link to the survey

324
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:07.480 
embedded at the end of the course i believe. so we try to make this

325
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:12.040 
intervention as part of the course

326
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.750 
mixes we want one more minute okay. sorry.

327
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:24.540 
last question with we haven't analyzed thought yet,

328
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.770 
because we don't have enough samples, i believe and then there

329
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.160 
is actuation over time. so we still try to find

330
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.770 
an analysis plan and to look at this question.

331
00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:53.140 
ok yeah we've got i may even my three questions, and one more question.

332
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:59.850 
but since we don't have time. i thinks a lot i mean a very nice discussion.

333
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:05.810 
i encourage you again the all sorts i can see that those are an a-z

334
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:11.240 
among the audience. so probably you can answer publicly in the

335
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.760 
chat during the session, and if not just take notes of the people

336
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.740 
who made the questions and answer by e-mail or whatever okay.

337
00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.900 
so thank you very much ok.

338
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.140 
so we can move now to the third paper.

339
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.930 
the second session with a second paper of these.

340
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:41.080 
i position that these a paper is called

341
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.480 
a machine learning approach for suggesting feedback in textual

342
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:51.530 
exercise in large courses.
and it will be presented by jan philipp news from

343
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:56.940 
the humanities. ok so phillip when whenever you can.

344
00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.910 
yeah thanks for the nice introduction.

345
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:07.270 
so yeah this paper actually is a big part of my dissertation project.
i very

346
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:13.300 
generally try to provide automated feedback to technical exercises.

347
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.810 
and this summarizes a the approach and also a evaluation that

348
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:23.680 
we've performed as one of our courses.
so i'm generally speaking

349
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.240 
the problem that we have here in munich is that over the last

350
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.380 
ten years our student population scaled by the factor of five.

351
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.100 
so this summer we currently have close to two thousand two hundred

352
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:37.720 
students registered for our lecture

353
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.720 
which is a second semester bachelor of engineering

354
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.670 
course. and even with this large number we still try to focus

355
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.550 
on face to face teaching. and we do this by including interactive

356
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.620 
in-class exercises as part of the lecture.

357
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.510 
also we have tutor groups and then we ask the students to

358
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.910 
hand in homework exercises as well.

359
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.790 
and we think that feedback is very important, and this is

360
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:08.920 
why we want to give individual feedback
to every exercise the students perform,

361
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.240 
however this leads to what we call a creating nightmare.

362
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.880 
so over the course of the semester discourse requires roughly

363
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.100 
two hundred thousand assessments if every student
participates in every exercise

364
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:26.070 
which will break down to fourteen thousand assessments every week.

365
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.010 
in this example in three in-class exercises and four homework

366
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.130 
exercises over the semester

367
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.150 
even with our seventy student tutors

368
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.390 
that we hired to help us with the course.

369
00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.050 
this would come out with two hundred assessments per tutor and

370
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:49.110 
they just cannot deal with this large number.

371
00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.770 
so the goal of yeah our research group and especially

372
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.870 
also of this paper is to reduce the efforts with assessments

373
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.310 
by using automation, and also extending computer-aided feedback

374
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.120 
to more exercise types and improving the consistency.

375
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.210 
we can already deal with part of these assessments with automation,

376
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:14.680 
so for example programming exercises we can assess with test cases

377
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:18.550 
multiple-choice questions we can obviously assess.
but then we still have

378
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:23.940 
actual exercises and human modeling exercises that meet assessments

379
00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.700 
from humans and with this research we propose a computer aided assessments

380
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.940 
on those actual exercises.

381
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.320 
so the first step is actually our second based assessment concept.

382
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.660 
so  the  answers that we are students is typically like a comparison

383
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:50.130 
between concepts or they ask them to give
elaborate on some concepts with examples.

384
00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:55.480 
so for example, they should give an example
how to apply the strategy design pattern,

385
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.670 
and what we want to do here is not just give a feedback on

386
00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.430 
this entire exercise, but rather

387
00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.060 
give feedback on individual segments that

388
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:11.800 
their text exercise consists of and the main advantage of this is that this

389
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.610 
results in a structured form of feedback that we receive that

390
00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.960 
we can then hopefully reuse. so in the end

391
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.480 
the aim is that our system can do the following

392
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.940 
a teacher will open a the assessment screen.
and he will already receive

393
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:35.420 
a yeah a pre-filled assessment that is already created and then

394
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.920 
ideally he will just say ok.
this is completely created i agree

395
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.110 
with this grading and i can just save and continue.

396
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.610 
so yeah next i want to introduce you to this concept

397
00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:48.800 
that should enable just

398
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.620 
this grading experience.

399
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.350 
so our approach is called cafi which is short for computer-aided feedback

400
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:02.960 
protection exercises and the idea is that
after all the student submitted the answers

401
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:07.310 
on the coffee first, and then analyzed similarity

402
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.110 
between the different student answers which as a result will give us

403
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:17.010 
what we call a set of text clusters,
so this is basically a group of those

404
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.170 
segments that we defined earlier.

405
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.770 
and those segments will all have a similar meaning they pretty

406
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:29.150 
much share the same content and therefore we assume that

407
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:34.090 
these segments can be can receive the same feedback and the equated before,

408
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:38.900 
and then basically after we've identified those clusters.

409
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.170 
the system will generate a feedback suggestion based on

410
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.930 
feedback that humans created before.

411
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:50.460 
and we then show this to a teacher who manually reviews the feedback,

412
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.520 
and the teacher's role is then either to confirm the feedback

413
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.360 
suggestion that was made or to adapt the suggestion, if needed or

414
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:03.820 
extended with to fill gaps that the system was not yet able to

415
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.130 
two get feedback on.

416
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.490 
so thereby also create new knowledge

417
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:15.310 
which is then the next step here that after the menu review is done.

418
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.660 
the system will learn from the review, so it will say ok we have the structured

419
00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.860 
information in the text. and we have a feedback on this.

420
00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:27.280 
and distill this the segment that we can identify the group.

421
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.430 
and then we store this as our assessment knowledge.

422
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:32.110 
and then also obviously the student will

423
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.940 
get the feedback and can review and improve the answer.

424
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.230 
i'm in our visionary scenario, and we want to get this approach.

425
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:47.500 
so far that the coffee is confident enough to say, ok i can completely

426
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.660 
review the assessment automatically and provide feedback to

427
00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:55.170 
the student right away also based on the knowledge
that we've captured before

428
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.650 
from teachers doing their work.

429
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.020 
and this would give us the opportunity to give very

430
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.210 
have a very short feedback cycles,
or pretty much give instant feedback.

431
00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.210 
and then also reduce the effort to the point where we can allow

432
00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.440 
the students to submit multiple times and still receive feedback.

433
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.730 
we've implemented a

434
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.720 
approach in a reference implementation

435
00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.210 
that pretty much does the segmentation i talked about and we used

436
00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.810 
language embeddings with the system from google

437
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:29.930 
to capture the meaning of

438
00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.020 
text. and then use the hts clustering algorithm to define those

439
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.310 
clusters. and we then offered this similarity analysis service

440
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:43.240 
to a learning management system. in our case we use the atmos

441
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.140 
system that we developed at our group.

442
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:52.080 
we've used this system in two courses in the last semester

443
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.960 
that was two thousand and twenty and in two courses

444
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.660 
in our course at

445
00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.030 
i say only one thousand eight hundred students. we had a total

446
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:04.140 
of ten homework exercises very could use the system.

447
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.020 
and six exam exercises that was online due to kovac.

448
00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:10.990 
and then we also had a second course from the university front from

449
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.310 
another chairs were with where we could use it in one exercise.

450
00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.990 
and our evaluation was aimed at answering three research questions.

451
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.190 
first the coverage so what part of the assessments can already be

452
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:28.180 
completed with the system?  how accurate and second how accurate

453
00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.390 
are the feedback suggestions ? and then lastly a house's quality

454
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.680 
of the feedback suggestions

455
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:38.500 
to sum up the findings.
first the coverage so on average we can see that.

456
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:43.740 
we can cover twenty six percent of submissions
for feedback using this approach.

457
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.900 
however there is a quite a huge spread.

458
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.730 
so in the best case scenario for example,

459
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.690 
this exam access we could cover up to seventy percent,

460
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.740 
and yet there are different aspects that might affect

461
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.910 
on the widest is the case.

462
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.090 
the second in terms of accuracy we've analyzed how teachers

463
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.660 
worked with the feedback suggestions for a subset of these exercises.

464
00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.830 
and what we can happily report is that on average

465
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.270 
eighty five percent of those feedback suggestions are accurate.

466
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.840 
and we measure that in a way that the teachers' desire to publish

467
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.490 
those feedback suggestions unchanged the students in some other cases.

468
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.920 
there were extended additional comments and then

469
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.770 
around ten percent were discarded.

470
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.640 
and yeah the last

471
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:37.290 
finding is in terms of quality. so we've with our students to

472
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.070 
give us feedback on a five scottsdale scale on how use how

473
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.650 
they how useful for data receive our feedback.

474
00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.520 
and what we can notice here is that students who received feedback

475
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.330 
from our approach to computer aided feedback were more a bit

476
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:56.700 
more likely to give a five star rating compared to

477
00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.680 
ones that received a pure manual feedback.

478
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.070 
however this is only anecdotal evidence is only

479
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:08.270 
as we only received ratings for around five percent of the assessments.

480
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.550 
so take this with a grain of salt,

481
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.450 
but still we have a positive

482
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:20.500 
feedback. and can conclude that the quality is at least

483
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.340 
the same as for our purely manual feedback.

484
00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.470 
also a fun observation is that students who gave a five star

485
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.870 
review were also more likely to have a very good score on the exercise.

486
00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.170 
and students that were unhappy with the feedback typically had a

487
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.010 
worse score than the a five star ratings.

488
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.640 
if you look at future work

489
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:47.360 
for this yeah, for the system, or for approach of the area general.

490
00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.870 
you want to train a coffee or the fin system with existing

491
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:56.460 
feedback from previous years.
so far we only extract feedback during the assessment.

492
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.880 
but if we repeat a course and repeat an exercise we've already captured

493
00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.670 
knowledge in the system. and we want to transfer this to the

494
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.660 
next edition of the course to improve their

495
00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.720 
and the coverage

496
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.420 
knowledge from the previous year.

497
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.650 
and next we also  want to use this structured

498
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.700 
information that we have to check.

499
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.380 
check with the consistencies of the seventy graders keeping a consistent

500
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.650 
and yet keeping consistent feedback, giving consistent feedback,

501
00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:32.420 
and keeping it fair for students is hard such as using this

502
00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:36.460 
structured information to make everything more consistent as

503
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:40.550 
one goal here. then lastly so far we have used

504
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:44.120 
our system in the domain of software engineering

505
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.300 
maybe in the domain of informatics or computer science. but

506
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:51.240 
it would also be good to evaluate the system in a different

507
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.830 
domain, so this is implemented in the domain

508
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:58.550 
independent base of analyzing this in for example biology

509
00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.790 
would be an interesting evaluation as well

510
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:06.230 
to some of my contributions. we've developed a

511
00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:10.470 
machine supervised machine learning approach that creates knowledge

512
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.900 
during the assessment process from teachers. second with

513
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:19.210 
implemented error referencing limitation for this approach.

514
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.690 
the afin system  and lastly we've evaluated the system
in two university courses

515
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.660 
with up to one hundred one thousand eight hundred participating students

516
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:32.720 
and evaluated the quality of the feedback suggestions.

517
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:37.430 
thanks to everyone for listening to this presentation,

518
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.770 
and i'm looking forward to an interesting discussion.

519
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.210 
okay thank you very much, okay so you've got say

520
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.540 
seventeen minutes for the discussion.

521
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:55.710 
this time i will start with my question. okay that's

522
00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:56.800 
the first in the list.

523
00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.730 
so did you also study

524
00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:05.770 
the first how much do the findings the results

525
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:10.760 
depend on the assessment type. the type of the question

526
00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.560 
the answer length in the vocabulary. i mean you answered partially it

527
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:21.330 
depends on the on the domain that you still need to study. but at least

528
00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.610 
between the two courses that you have a studied.

529
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.960 
yeah so generally speaking in the exercises.

530
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.190 
we always try to keep the answer length fairly consistent at

531
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.780 
around like so we try to

532
00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.900 
we ask the students to answer in around two hundred and fifty words.

533
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:42.570 
so that's the roughly the length in terms of.

534
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.960 
second thing was the types

535
00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:52.100 
like different uses of different types. so there's like a fairly

536
00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:56.340 
answer fairly trivial to assess right. so we had that was a

537
00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:01.210 
part of the evaluation. but we had one exercise where the question was

538
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.340 
name four cryptocurrencies, and then you had

539
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.770 
like a pool of single words a ready answer. so for this one

540
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.850 
this was working great, but this is also fairly trivial

541
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.710 
work yet, and otherwise

542
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:20.510 
i think an important factor is the kind of the variability

543
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:23.760 
in the answer space. so if you if your answer is

544
00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.750 
this head has a fairly fixed solution, so you say what is the

545
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:30.410 
difference between concepts a and b. and this is fairly fixed,

546
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:35.920 
then this typically works very well. i'm also if for our we

547
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.920 
had an exercise where students had to extract

548
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.150 
requirements for a software system from a problem statement.

549
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.750 
so they would extract information from a text
that would also work very well,

550
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:49.410 
but then as soon as we start

551
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:54.700 
explain this concept with any example from that you can imagine,

552
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:58.680 
then you see to how the answer space just gets wider,
and then therefore

553
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.950 
the overlap between student answers decreases and therefore

554
00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:05.690 
the system gets less efficient. yeah.

555
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:11.260 
i guess that's this will make things more complex with

556
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.720 
respect to computer science.
i think then we i mean we all know that in

557
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.190 
arts and social sciences

558
00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:24.370 
things are not are much more narrative and much more dispersed lucky.

559
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.660 
we've got say one question by anjali sinc.

560
00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:34.420 
do you have to train the model for each individual assessment item.

561
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.610 
how long does it take to train the model?

562
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:42.290 
starting from the nlp processing steps to clustering.

563
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:49.380 
so what we do is we use a pre trained model for uml.

564
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:53.830 
that's publicly available that was trained on wikipedia and

565
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.210 
only works for english answers,

566
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.170 
but now so this doesn't need to be trained. we're working on

567
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.890 
training this specifically for a specific exercise or courses.

568
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:10.820 
but in the way we currently use it. this is just a generic model

569
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:15.990 
in terms of time.

570
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:19.330 
so this depends on what kind of hardware you use.

571
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:23.970 
and we're currently using just a free virtual service

572
00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:31.010 
bit powerful, but not super powerful and the entire process with the

573
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.490 
nlp vector predictions and the clustering

574
00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.980 
takes three and a half minutes, or

575
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.140 
so this is i would say this is reasonable on three

576
00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.790 
machines. and if you have a big gpu machine,
this can even be improved.

577
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:49.530 
it's not even real time so i guess it's a sufficient.

578
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:55.390 
yeah ok yeah another sort questioned by me.

579
00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:59.810 
did you also study the effects of the teachers that participated

580
00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:02.670 
in the study for example defining discrepancies between

581
00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.150 
different teachers of the same group? ok

582
00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:12.970 
i'm so we did not look too much into the teachers yet.

583
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.370 
we're currently planning this to do with

584
00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:20.610 
the current semester to also talk more to the teachers. just

585
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:24.660 
some  anecdotal evidence that the teachers report that

586
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.880 
the system is never working and is always inaccurate.

587
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.220 
but then if you look at the data we see that

588
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.800 
over ninety percent in the end are accurate. so they as soon

589
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.330 
as you have like one false positive you immediately immediately

590
00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:39.630 
get a bad reaction from them.

591
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.410 
and on the other hand we experienced with

592
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.570 
this conflict detection. we also have seen that.

593
00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.410 
there are fairly quite a few conflicts in this

594
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:55.960 
with different greatest so.

595
00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:01.370 
i don't really have an haven't understanding
if they really prefer the system.

596
00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.230 
i only know that they do complain, but in the end

597
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:10.880 
in terms of numbers.
it doesn't seem to be as bad a state as they report.

598
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.730 
i say that as you know humans are much more complex than machines in

599
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.470 
ok what one question by nick

600
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:34.520 
says is was the out auto feedback given sooner
than the human feedback. if not

601
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.740 
could it and and why not ?

602
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:44.850 
so in terms of the process that we have is our teachers get one week

603
00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.960 
to give feedback and then we release it
to the students at the same time.

604
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.670 
so it was all released at the same time

605
00:46:55.770 --> 00:47:00.280 
other than that as it were.
now is not a fully automatic process

606
00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:04.510 
a process but rather a like a support system or like a semi automatic

607
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:09.960 
waiting process. we don't have a time benefit yet in terms of

608
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:15.150 
getting it out to the students quicker. however, we have some

609
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:21.140 
inaccurate measures. but that gives also anecdotal evidence that

610
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.800 
the teachers are a bit quicker quicker in their work when they

611
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.590 
give feedback with the pre-filled pre-filled creating

612
00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.650 
another question by wonderful presentation.

613
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:42.540 
any plans to do blind evaluation with evaluations with peers.

614
00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:52.120 
so we don't have concrete plans on blind evaluation the only thing

615
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:57.160 
that i can say in that sense is that we don't tell our students if the

616
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:58.990 
feedback they receive is

617
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.900 
machine generated, or

618
00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.390 
manual from humans. so in that sense the quality

619
00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.330 
evaluation in that sense.

620
00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:16.010 
you could argue is kind of a blind evaluation in terms of

621
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:20.060 
they create a feedback nevertheless, and then we just see

622
00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.950 
we can differentiate if the data was automatic feedback

623
00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:27.610 
in that review.

624
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:33.480 
i hope that answer somewhat answers the question,

625
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:40.620 
if we have time in the end. i mean we can go on but since we've

626
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:45.310 
got so many questions. i will go through reading the questions and

627
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.160 
waiting for some short answers.

628
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.330 
so by manuel i get dorry

629
00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:58.610 
thinks. very good work why did you go with elmo and not t five

630
00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:01.770 
or something else and what happens when answers.

631
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:06.390 
i semantically seem very similar, but i say the opposite thing.

632
00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:13.310 
i'm so to be completely honest, i'm not aware of t five we competed with

633
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.720 
different options. for example virtual mac which i think was

634
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.550 
kind of the previous generation intended as a bird which is kind of

635
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.090 
the next generation than going from language files to transformers

636
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:30.970 
four an at the time when i went i've chosen this and that was

637
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.790 
some time ago already.

638
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:38.160 
the kind of the emo was way more

639
00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.290 
accurate than the rhetoric implementation that we've seen.

640
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.170 
and then the bird which was the transformers was more

641
00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:49.230 
compute intense and b in our tests we did not get

642
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:54.860 
a lot more accurate results out of it compared to the tradeoff

643
00:49:54.880 --> 00:50:00.160 
in the needed compute power as this is how we ended up with with emo.

644
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:05.050 
i'm i will look into t five because i got her out of this

645
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.060 
after the stop

646
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:12.330 
in terms of what had an answer semantically c medicine.

647
00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:19.460 
so i don't have an example to kind of answer this specifically.

648
00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.230 
so right now this.

649
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.410 
i mean this right now relies on that emo can kind of

650
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:30.740 
like all our language. and things relies on how accurate émile

651
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:36.540 
can determine the differences
and if émile can conquest that is actually.

652
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.680 
seemed similar and is actually the opposite, so far we've made

653
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.620 
fairly good observations that it

654
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.470 
does not so that the in the end the difference in vectors is

655
00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:53.190 
big enough that the clustering algorithm does not trust it as the same
thing.

656
00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.500 
however if

657
00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:00.030 
also in terms of the like entire big picture of

658
00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:04.520 
elements that are clustered would be wrong and mean in the

659
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.160 
end it would receive the wrong incorrect feedback.

660
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.820 
so that would be the worst case scenario, but then this is why

661
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.700 
we still have the humans that would then

662
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.030 
be able to still change the suggestions.

663
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.010 
one question by pancholi

664
00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.880 
is it possible that the higher star rating for the computer-aided

665
00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.270 
feedback may be due to something external

666
00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.250 
like the novelty of the system not necessarily the quality

667
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.560 
of the feedback itself.

668
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.230 
so here we asked so this the students were not directly aware that we've

669
00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:46.580 
actually run this experiment on them. so they just received

670
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:50.440 
their feedback and just rated how useful their feedback is

671
00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:54.210 
for their understanding of the exercise and their mistakes.

672
00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.110 
so in that sense i would say

673
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:01.330 
i don't think the integrity of a system plays a role here

674
00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:06.240 
for this result.

675
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.690 
bisaar thank you for sharing your work.

676
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.580 
how sensitive is the process to the initial starting training set,

677
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.980 
if they start drinks or the order of the presented dancers?

678
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:28.440 
so what we do is

679
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.950 
the system where a suggest in order for the

680
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.340 
humans how they should wait

681
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:42.970 
for great submissions?
and the idea here is that we try to measure

682
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.210 
how big is the effect of one submission.

683
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:50.030 
so we see okay for every segment in one submission

684
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.010 
we try to see how many other segments can we wait?

685
00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:56.790 
if we have knowledge of the submission and then therefore we try to

686
00:52:57.050 --> 00:53:00.310 
expand our knowledge in the beginning as quickly as possible.

687
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:03.680 
we could

688
00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:08.240 
experiment experiencing an indifferent with different orders.

689
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.720 
but we don't have any knowledge yet on,

690
00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:14.760 
if this has an effect so far.

691
00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:17.450 
this is  what we're going with

692
00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.840 
questions are still coming in

693
00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:27.690 
probably the queue is going to get

694
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:32.570 
totally you know full.

695
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:39.660 
so we are going to have two more minutes only,
and then you can go answering

696
00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.150 
the question seeing the chat and in privately later.

697
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:47.050 
so last question is have you checked by hansen again.

698
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.870 
have you checked how much more accuracy can this system achieve

699
00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:57.080 
compared to more simple rule base approach like keyword matching.

700
00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:00.650 
and we did not do this check now.

701
00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:05.810 
hmm i think it could be quite relevant. ok.

702
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:13.500 
good i thank you very much say. i made a great a discussion

703
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.110 
probably one of the best that i have seen in my you know experience

704
00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:23.310 
in conferences, you know like twenty or more interventions in

705
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:24.860 
you know after one

706
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.530 
presentation, you know ,

707
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.420 
about each one of these presentations. this means that

708
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:39.100 
at least the papers are interesting enough. ok. so thank you very much

709
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:43.160 
everyone for the feedback yeah .

710
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:52.670 
and you can keep on discussing in the o'kay. so b last paper

711
00:54:54.340 --> 00:55:00.640 
is called classification of discussions
in moot forums an incremental modeling approach

712
00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.620 
could be presented by anastasios dermis

713
00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:05.530 
from university of patras.

714
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:09.090 
and i'm also one of the co-authors.

715
00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:14.690 
so psyche say you can start when you can

716
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:19.350 
okay can you see the presentation is everything
okay with the voice. yes

717
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:24.390 
ok great hello everybody my name is norma,

718
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.950 
a phd candidate from the university of patras.

719
00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:30.480 
and this work was performed via the collaboration of university

720
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.420 
of patras with university of violet and with the greek platform.

721
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:40.470 
ok massive open online courses or books for self.

722
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:45.040 
and one of the most crucial problems that is referred to the literature

723
00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.920 
as instructors bandwith problem.

724
00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:50.910 
and this is mostly related with the diverse backgrounds of

725
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:55.250 
exist in the forum. and also with the large scale of participation

726
00:55:55.730 --> 00:56:01.320 
of learners all these elements result in information overload

727
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:06.180 
for the facility, for the instructors and the learner facilitators

728
00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:10.580 
in the form from the staff perspective.
and this can cause a lot of difficulties

729
00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.330 
to them in keeping track of the formed discussions and to provide

730
00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:16.270 
firm support to learners in the form.

731
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:21.640 
one of the solutions that has been proposed and followed in the literature

732
00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:26.250 
is to classify the discussions of the forum into meaningful categories

733
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.090 
for the learner facilitators in order to better support their decision making,

734
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.950 
and help them organize their interventions in the forum.

735
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:40.980 
this solution could possibly reduce the time and effort needed in order to

736
00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:44.230 
perform the decision making and interventions,

737
00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:48.110 
and also could provide them a bird's-eye view of all the forum

738
00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:49.130 
activities in the forum,

739
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:51.560 
in this context

740
00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.480 
towards the classification of discussions.

741
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.480 
this requires the training and development of models classification models.

742
00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.380 
their most common approach are supervised techniques

743
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:06.930 
which uses  a training data set which is labelled

744
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:08.650 
manually by human coders.

745
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.850 
but this process is expensive and time consuming for the human factor.

746
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:17.460 
some solutions that have been followed in the literature to

747
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:21.950 
address its problem are semi-supervised techniques
like deep learning approaches.

748
00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:26.380 
and supervised modeling techniques like topic modeling see variations of it,

749
00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.090 
and many other

750
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.520 
and one interesting approach that has been followed.

751
00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:35.190 
a lot at drop of prediction problems

752
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:39.860 
is temporal modelling of the literature or which is incremental

753
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:43.170 
training of models with more and more data as the course progresses

754
00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.390 
all these problems

755
00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:50.910 
pose a challenge which is the one addressed in this study is the need for

756
00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:56.470 
new methods that will help the human to reduce the human effort

757
00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:59.720 
required for the preparation of such training datasets in this study.

758
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:04.150 
we address this problem and we propose

759
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:08.970 
an enhanced feature extraction approach specifically
for supervised modeling

760
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:12.380 
what we do in this study. we create a model

761
00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:15.160 
and we incrementally strain it.

762
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:18.460 
its week at the start of its week for three courses presented later,

763
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:24.360 
and we want to explore how the performance

764
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:27.920 
evolves of the model from the start till the end of the course.

765
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:31.380 
and see whether the picks the downsides etcetera

766
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:36.510 
what fixes were created in order to develop this model. first of all

767
00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:39.840 
the best features are the different features of

768
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.010 
the linguistic content of the discussions.

769
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.400 
the four the problem in just employing this features is that

770
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.180 
they're limited especially the first weeks.

771
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:54.730 
because you have a little data from the first
two or three weeks for example

772
00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:59.670 
and went some more features to enhance the performance our model

773
00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:02.660 
for that purpose we combined.

774
00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:07.070 
we used a topic modeling approach an unsupervised approach

775
00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:10.270 
in order to gain some additional supported features.

776
00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:16.280 
specifically support the features from
the city topic model our prediction probabilities

777
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:20.040 
that the city topic model provides. and we used a terminology

778
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:26.650 
that was extracted from the topics,
and we calculated the semantic similarities

779
00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:32.180 
with the query document that we wanted to classify
and extracted some similarities

780
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.220 
with the linguistic content these two were the two additional

781
00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.020 
features that were employed to enhance

782
00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.790 
their performance, therefore the classification problem that

783
00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:43.230 
we attempt to solve in this study is the following.

784
00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.170 
first of all we want to classify the discussions

785
00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:49.990 
in the form that are related with the course with the course material.

786
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.730 
secondly those that are related with the logistics of the course.

787
00:59:55.540 --> 01:00:00.040 
and third the discussions there is no action required
by any learner facilitator.

788
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:07.440 
so the main problem is  directed towards the proper facilitator

789
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.180 
for the type of problem, for the relevant type of problem.

790
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.970 
for this study the training and evaluation was performed on three months

791
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:16.810 
of different subject matters that

792
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.110 
took place on the greek platform.

793
01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:23.260 
the first course was introduction to python.

794
01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:27.900 
the second was internet fixing accident.
the third world history of religion.

795
01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:32.360 
this one of the most that were used for the evaluation and

796
01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.680 
for the training of the models for the two supported features

797
01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:39.610 
that i stated before for the building of the models.

798
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:43.570 
we needed some lexical seats in order to bias
the topic extraction towards

799
01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.640 
the three desired categories that we used here

800
01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:52.240 
in a coding scheme. so for that purpose we employed

801
01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:56.220 
the data derived from the book environment specifically for

802
01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.750 
the content related category all the transcription and every

803
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.860 
text document that was found was tracked downloaded and used

804
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:05.780 
in order to form a lexical proper for the course material.

805
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.460 
but due to the lack of documents for the other two categories

806
01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.900 
we used two additional labels.

807
01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.180 
this data sets were only used for the lexical and nothing more

808
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:20.320 
for the evaluation process. this consists where different questions

809
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:23.680 
and applications have different questions using mathematics.

810
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:27.210 
so we used the logistics related and naar

811
01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:31.370 
labelled documents from this data sets for the lexical seats.

812
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.210 
the main research questions that we addressed in this study

813
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:40.590 
is firstly,
if we can if it is possible to build a supervised classifier

814
01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:44.960 
with using only features available  at the start of the course

815
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.470 
to effectively classify the posts to their proper categories.

816
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.250 
and secondly we perform a comparison comparison
between our proposed approach

817
01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:58.610 
with a baseline approach in order to compare and see the difference

818
01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:59.860 
in terms of performance.

819
01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.680 
the main methodology that we followed is presented here.

820
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.630 
first of all regarding the main data the three marks to coders

821
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.200 
perform the marginal coding in order to label the discussion manually.

822
01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:18.760 
and this documents were further processed in terms of natural language

823
01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.310 
we used the data sources from the environment,
and the supportive books

824
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:28.550 
in order to create documents which were further processed at

825
01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:31.310 
the same way like all the books.

826
01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:36.910 
then we employed an on-court correlation
explanation city topic modeling approach

827
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.770 
due to several advantages overall.

828
01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.010 
in order to create the topic models that are
the topic model and the topics

829
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:46.940 
and extract the probabilities and the supportive

830
01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.460 
features, then we built a

831
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:55.870 
decision tree classifier in order to perform the evaluation,

832
01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:59.280 
in order to better understand evaluation how we performed it.

833
01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:02.380 
it was an iterative process for each of the frameworks

834
01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.340 
specifically at the start of which at the start of its, sorry,

835
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:09.810 
at the start of its week we trained the model with all the

836
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:14.350 
data, till this week from the previous weeks and evaluated at

837
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:17.720 
the rest of the course for example like the model which would

838
01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:21.490 
be established this week. and later it would be
it would perform predictions.

839
01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.150 
and this was performed iteratively till the end of the course.

840
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:27.270 
now let's move on to the results section.

841
01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:31.040 
first of all here we present the overall

842
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:35.940 
performance of each of the models for each course.

843
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:39.420 
its color represents a different course
and we can see that the model

844
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.540 
starts from a low performance,
and it keeps increasing over time and specifically

845
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:47.840 
at week three. we observe that there is a pic of the performance

846
01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:52.010 
of the three courses. it's not perfect, but we may say that

847
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:55.780 
it could described as substantial. it's over zero point six

848
01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:59.910 
the main issue was at the first week. there were too limited data

849
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:04.130 
and this was the main factor to do this problem was
the fact that there were

850
01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:08.080 
a few data in some courses in order to train the model.

851
01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:13.230 
and we performed the content analysis on a

852
01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.250 
misclassified document and found out
the most misclassification occurred

853
01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.440 
between the logistics and the content related

854
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.270 
documents. and one reason the most important reason for these

855
01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.210 
classifications was the fact that several terms that were existing

856
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.960 
at the content related were also found at the logistics.

857
01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.810 
a good example is the middle one of the python course

858
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.510 
in which we found terms like platform button submission which

859
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.810 
were also found in both categories, and this was one of the

860
01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.590 
main reasons for the classifications.

861
01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.730 
ok, moving on to the comparison with a business idea.

862
01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:57.940 
the results showed that our supported features

863
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:01.910 
boosted the performance of the model in the first weeks,

864
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:07.850 
and later it was found that by employing data from
the content of the course.

865
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:11.970 
there was a boost of the performance and in general
outperformed the regular

866
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:16.740 
for the three courses. here we see the ot and here the python

867
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.300 
and world history course you can see the plus

868
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.040 
in terms of performance that exists in its wik.

869
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:29.250 
ok moving on to the conclusions of the study we found out that

870
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.100 
the correct features which are the supportive features could

871
01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.490 
support the building of a substantial
classifier in terms of overall accuracy

872
01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:42.780 
at over zero point six performance the evaluation
metrics provided evidence about

873
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:46.850 
in which week in real life scenario
the model could be possibly employed.

874
01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:51.790 
and the general conclusion regarding the first question is

875
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.920 
that by narrowing down the labelling process at the first two

876
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.120 
to three weeks. it depends on the course of course.

877
01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.760 
it could alleviate the human effort

878
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.020 
needed for the training of a reliable supervised model.

879
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:07.820 
and furthermore regarding our second research question

880
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:12.470 
we found that the supporting features
and in general our approach

881
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:14.690 
outperform the best and effective approach.

882
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.080 
the our features were boosting the defective feature stores

883
01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.970 
more precise predictions quite early which was

884
01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:24.120 
the main goal of the study.

885
01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:28.170 
and we also provided evidence about the benefits that exist

886
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.590 
in employing data that already existed.

887
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:33.990 
and are included in the material of the course

888
01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:38.550 
transcriptions and the text documents which are important to be used

889
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:43.330 
and extract some meaningful features for our classification problems

890
01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:47.400 
for our future directions. because this was the first study in this

891
01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:52.900 
line of research we want to further investigate the reasons of

892
01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.070 
these classifications. and how we can address them further in

893
01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:59.220 
our future research between the logistics and the content related ones.

894
01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:04.770 
we want to validate our methodology in new courses
with higher participation because

895
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:07.250 
we found that the concepts were not.

896
01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.960 
so we're not having as much participation as we wanted.

897
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:16.430 
so it's good to explore whether higher participation early

898
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.490 
in the course could provide better performance results.

899
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:23.490 
and in new courses of different subject matter because here

900
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:26.670 
we had a humanities course and two technology oriented ones.

901
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:33.810 
and lastly we want to explore further
additional supporting features such as

902
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.950 
the sentiment scores of

903
01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.590 
documents and many others that

904
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.030 
are goals for our future research.

905
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:43.940 
that's all thank you very much.

906
01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:48.030 
uh waiting for some questions thank you very much.

907
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:50.010 
okay thank you.

908
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:58.500 
we've got up to now two messages from the right ok.

909
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:01.200 
so the first one is

910
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:09.890 
this is a fascinating initiative can you kindly elaborate on seeded

911
01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.440 
topic modeling. this is the first question

912
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.490 
okay. so the main idea was

913
01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:22.030 
that we took advantage of the benefits that such a process.

914
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:26.130 
and the negatives we took them into account, because in

915
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.520 
seeded topic modeling the benefits are that you can bias a

916
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.490 
topic extraction towards something
for some categories some meaningful categories.

917
01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.180 
so but the problem with a this one is that it makes a lot of effort

918
01:08:39.190 --> 01:08:41.210 
to interpret this categories.

919
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:49.260 
so correct was first of all during the research process we

920
01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.570 
performed a lot of different

921
01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.830 
models like they would one of the most popular among researchers method,

922
01:08:57.150 --> 01:08:58.170 
but look for some good

923
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.480 
more interpretable results and we used them because they contained

924
01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:04.990 
a lot of terming terms

925
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:11.290 
that were reasonable and would belong in the respective categories.

926
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.190 
so we took advantage of this that
we have some meaningful keywords that could help

927
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:20.570 
and adjusted them in our model.

928
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:26.410 
and we used the semantic comparisons of
the query documents that wanted to classify

929
01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:32.410 
them and seemed to be high. so it was this was the main reason

930
01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:33.790 
that we wanted to explore it more

931
01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:39.940 
by combining an unsupervised approach.

932
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:44.760 
so this is in terms of unsupervised modeling.

933
01:09:46.190 --> 01:09:48.570 
i don't know, okay i think that

934
01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.580 
you can answer probably the second question
and then see whether we've got

935
01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:55.770 
more or a question.

936
01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:01.460 
so during incremental modeling did you find new categories?

937
01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:08.330 
of course, if you want to divide the problem into more subcategories

938
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:12.660 
for example the content related ones you can divide them in subcategories.

939
01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:19.330 
like a sections of the course for example it will this was a first attempt.

940
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:25.930 
but the results were very negative,
so we took it at a more abstract level

941
01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:30.190 
the main direction of this research was to direct.

942
01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.820 
the learner facilitators into the categories that are

943
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:40.280 
more appropriate for them.
for example the content related ones are in general

944
01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.050 
considered the discussions that
the learner facilitator selected to consistence

945
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:50.720 
would possibly intervene the logistics. one were those that the

946
01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:54.390 
technical staff of the platform could intervene.

947
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.230 
so this was the first level.

948
01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.920 
we went to a more abstract level, but in our future

949
01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:04.990 
we will expand this methodology into sub-categories.

950
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:06.500 
so this was out of the scope of this

951
01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.590 
specific paper.

952
01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:18.410 
you can jumping in more questions orally, because i cannot see

953
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:20.420 
more questions in the chat right now.

954
01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.150 
i don't know if somebody wants to jump in,

955
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.960 
and ask any questions.

956
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:35.420 
i yeah ok. so you think

957
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:40.570 
this model can be used to categorize like

958
01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:47.480 
what topics in the content like here, like you catalyzing content

959
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:53.190 
to stick and no action needed,
but give me what i need use it on the content

960
01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.390 
documents and then divide

961
01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:02.620 
what subject they need to be helped like. what topic of

962
01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:08.130 
the course yes assisted,

963
01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:12.030 
before a this direction is the ultimate direction

964
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:14.740 
that we want to achieve.

965
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:19.500 
but until we reach there we divide the problem
we want to go at a higher level.

966
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:26.500 
so by classifying into these three categories you have some subsets

967
01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:30.110 
that you could further classify. so if i have

968
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.710 
a better performance, for example over zero point eight.

969
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:39.380 
you know you have the related ones there. so you can further apply

970
01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.390 
an additional classification to this.

971
01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.640 
this is a in general we think, it is a two level classification

972
01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:52.170 
first of all let's divide them into these
three categories that i presented,

973
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:58.420 
and then perform the one that you said into this one for example related

974
01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:03.740 
to, for example locate the week that the discussion could be related

975
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.670 
to the content of a respective week.

976
01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.680 
ok so yes, we've got two more questions by the right

977
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:18.530 
quite interesting on the topic.
do you find a good enough we

978
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:22.480 
were not very happy with our experiments.
so this is the first question

979
01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:26.700 
yes a a l l it was the first

980
01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:33.040 
variation of all day was our first attempt towards this problem.

981
01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.730 
and we found that the results were could not be interpreted easily,

982
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:40.910 
and in addition that our data were in greek.

983
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.940 
we found out a very poor support in doing so.

984
01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:52.210 
so we after a lot of search we found out a correlation explanation method

985
01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:56.710 
which is quite new to the field and it provides

986
01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.590 
much more promising results and interpretable

987
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:01.190 
which is most important.

988
01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:07.390 
so and you see here, i'm helping a

989
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:13.100 
there were a lot of problems in here and here here do you mean

990
01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:14.720 
here article cross clustering.

991
01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.380 
sorry, i'm right.

992
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:25.020 
yes yeah yeah yeah we found we found there are some problems where

993
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:28.970 
a simple flat level clustering is not good enough.

994
01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:32.530 
we're doing it not in education settings, but in

995
01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.880 
other kinds of things support calls which are very similar

996
01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.940 
support messages for products like games.

997
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:44.410 
and one flat model was not good enough, so we thought we should

998
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:46.060 
go deeper into certain things.

999
01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:56.600 
after performing a hierarchical clustering we found that

1000
01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:01.990 
specifically we valued this the validation of this problem

1001
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:04.470 
was the fact that there was overlapping between the content

1002
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:06.790 
related and logistics related discussions.

1003
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:10.350 
here article clustering for example provided

1004
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:15.800 
together logistics related content, and it was confusing to understand

1005
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:23.450 
to how to find out the terminology specific for a given category,

1006
01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:27.510 
so this solution was rejected early a

1007
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:32.300 
and i will say it again and the quick language

1008
01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:37.780 
was another factor for these problems, because in greek there

1009
01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:42.080 
are many words that have the same meaning in different situations.

1010
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.500 
and this was representative.

1011
01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:52.140 
there are many documents a representative example of what i'm saying so.

1012
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:59.050 
yeah just a if we've got a few more minutes

1013
01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.160 
while we were waiting for other people jumping

1014
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:09.500 
can you elaborate more on the differences or the insights that

1015
01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:15.750 
come depend on which domain that is whether you know you if

1016
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:19.720 
you have a course in mathematics and another in religion or whatever

1017
01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:25.660 
do you see that there are any special differences or things that

1018
01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.100 
a good can get

1019
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:35.330 
derived a findings that you can get from no specific domain or

1020
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:41.620 
domain independent. okay so in this study,

1021
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:45.720 
because one of the main tools that we used was two

1022
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:51.750 
directions was that we employed the data derived from the platform itself

1023
01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:55.100 
these models were not transferred to other domain.

1024
01:16:55.510 --> 01:17:00.600 
so we want to explore the transferability spécial of these models,

1025
01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:04.080 
but if the documents derived from the environment

1026
01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.100 
can provide better supportive features.

1027
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.490 
because supportive features as i said before

1028
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:15.730 
derive from a city topic model approach
which is biased from these documents.

1029
01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:19.320 
so we want to explore if in other domains,

1030
01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:26.180 
the linguistic content of the environment
can alter or provide better supportive features

1031
01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:31.560 
and to find and to better calibrate such features to boost

1032
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:33.270 
the performance earlier-

1033
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:42.240 
a in our case scenario a the technology the world history, for example

1034
01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.210 
had if you can if you see if you saw

1035
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:48.420 
again to answer your question

1036
01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:51.830 
with a minute to show you the diagram.

1037
01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.990 
as you can see

1038
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:05.580 
the performance is much better at the world history course.

1039
01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.490 
it's the date at the start, and the boost is

1040
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:12.650 
a bigger especially from the other courses.

1041
01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:19.390 
and an appear at the early weeks because it seems that the documents

1042
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:21.520 
derived from the environment had more

1043
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:26.000 
content specific terms. for example, in what religion

1044
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:27.830 
there were terms like

1045
01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:33.890 
related to religion for christian islamic church, and other which were highly

1046
01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:39.250 
bound to the domain of the week.
on the other hand in the technology courses,

1047
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:43.580 
the terminology was more general. for example problem error

1048
01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:49.880 
related to either coding or general problem solving

1049
01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:54.790 
a scenario. so we want to explore, for example in a humanities course

1050
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.590 
this phenomenon keeps up with it.

1051
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:05.880 
ok yeah we've got like five more minutes at the most so

1052
01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.770 
that you have some time to i before the next session. but we've got

1053
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:15.620 
so we can start the questions for all

1054
01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.270 
participants. so the right

1055
01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:24.540 
ask based on your research. can you to all panelists? can you

1056
01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:29.350 
comment on the use of natural language processing to help support books better ?

1057
01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:35.780 
also some observations on birth gpt would be useful. ok so if

1058
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:41.370 
all three presenters can provide their view on the

1059
01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:48.020 
i use effectiveness of nlp and the observations on the other two topics

1060
01:19:55.210 --> 01:20:04.040 
was a mean. i can try to say something.
so i haven't really applied my research in

1061
01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:10.530 
books. however i with books with typically higher participant

1062
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:14.360 
numbers than typical on-campus courses.

1063
01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:18.990 
i see the need to apply automation in india

1064
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:21.190 
more than everywhere else.

1065
01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:27.720 
so every every use of nlp i would see positive even
if it's like grouping

1066
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:32.820 
questions forms to make it easier for instructors to keep up

1067
01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:37.330 
with answering questions timely and for applying it on feedback

1068
01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:38.710 
and so on and so forth.

1069
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:43.300 
so yeah i really see it as an

1070
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:46.490 
important technology in terms of

1071
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.540 
transformers i don't have

1072
01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:56.340 
experience, but some yeah visionary ideas that

1073
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.920 
i have include. for example,

1074
01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:03.520 
using this to have a language-independent representation and make it even

1075
01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.390 
maybe even make it possible to share knowledge across languages.

1076
01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:12.500 
so in my work i see this idea that it might be possible to

1077
01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.740 
use the same knowledge to give the feedback on both answers

1078
01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:21.590 
in english and german and in chinese, and then maybe even the system

1079
01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:27.310 
can give a chinese or greek or whatever speaking student feedback,

1080
01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.970 
even though he doesn't understand the language themselves. i

1081
01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:33.490 
mean there is some this is quite dangerous. but maybe it's better

1082
01:21:33.490 --> 01:21:34.450 
than no feedback at all.

1083
01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:41.090 
i can tell but there's some visionary work in this area yeah. i

1084
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:47.330 
think that depends on dependence on language. i mean the language features

1085
01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.330 
and then all on

1086
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:56.530 
natural language processing software. how much of a his advancing this certain language

1087
01:21:56.970 --> 01:22:01.320 
makes a lot of difference. ok so i don't know if young or others

1088
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:05.050 
want to say something on it, on this topic

1089
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:09.990 
in psyches or on the capabilities of

1090
01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.460 
dependence of nlp and languages ok.

1091
01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:21.970 
ok can i agree with philip. i would say that

1092
01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:29.550 
of course natural language process can help
support most back much better,

1093
01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:35.080 
because a especially from the form data because all the interaction

1094
01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:40.850 
and all the support, the second support can be performed in the form

1095
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:46.380 
mostly a special course with a lot of participation. so being able to

1096
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:49.790 
process all this information, because it is a challenge

1097
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.930 
for many research communities.

1098
01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:56.760 
will provide meaningful results not only to the instructional stuff,

1099
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.030 
but also to learners

1100
01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:03.510 
so it is an ongoing a lot of research research in this field.

1101
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:08.410 
it is a hot topic, so for me

1102
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:16.410 
okay so where my think that we are more almost over any.

1103
01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:17.360 
i don't know if there is any

1104
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:23.560 
last intervention that somebody wants to add something before

1105
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.520 
we close the session.

1106
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:32.240 
a k so i think that

1107
01:23:33.330 --> 01:23:38.310 
we are on time to finish these very lively session. okay thank

1108
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:40.600 
you all very much for the

1109
01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:47.160 
speakers in the audience and always very interesting.

1110
01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:56.610 
i interactions in the chat in life i normally, i would suggest

1111
01:23:56.610 --> 01:24:00.240 
you know to go for the coffee and keep on talking

1112
01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:04.130 
after the session well

1113
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:09.050 
probably some virtual coffee right now or later.

1114
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:16.450 
as hopefully we can continue face to face if we meets again

1115
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:22.200 
next year. ok in a face to face setting, ok.

1116
01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.810 
also there is the room for coffee break,

1117
01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:32.060 
as sebastian suggests okay thank you very much

1118
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:34.350 
all of you very nice .

1119
01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:38.470 
indeed lucky thank you thank you.

1120
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.470 
thank you.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.630 
In the previous video, you
mentioned that each worker might

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.870 
have their own personality, their
own cognitive style, what

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.260 
do you mean by cognitive style? OK,
this is a very relevant point

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.820 
it gets ignore a lot of
time when people working

5
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.560 
in the team works, because
cognitive styles

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.360 
are some preferences. It
means the way how you

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.480 
mind or your brain works but
it is doesn't need to be

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.490 
good or bad. People all of them
have different cognitive

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.780 
preferences, probably, If I
want to make an analogy,

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.790 
when you were at school,
you like to play

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.410 
football, some other friends
liked to play basketball and

12
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.330 
all like to swim. It is
exactly the same thing

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.300 
when we think, it is not that,
it is good or bad to play

14
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.630 
basketball or football. It
is just simply different.

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.310 
But if we ignore these cognitive
preferences, we may lead

16
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.310 
teamwork to a problem.
Why? There are some

17
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.510 
biological computational elements
that you need to consider.

18
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.560 
The vision, attention, emotions,
and memory. Probably,

19
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.600 
you will learn by
far better if you

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.830 
watch a video, probably you prefer
to read, probably prefer to

21
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.010 
listen to something. These are
some conditions that definitely,

22
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.810 
are impacting the
remote teamwork,

23
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.980 
because not everyone
interacts in the same way.

24
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.300 
I have seen in the past,
people just say, we would

25
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.450 
like to interact but I
would not put my video.

26
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.190 
They don't feel comfortable with
that, there are some conditions,

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.010 
and is not good or is
bad but it's just

28
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.930 
not to ignore. They are preferences
and you cannot ignore them

29
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.820 
because you will start
making stress in the team.

30
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.320 
The people that
they have some

31
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.790 
preference, that they don't want
to share some information.

32
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.670 
OK. don't do it, but then make
sure, you're making at least a

33
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.650 
bit of this analysis before
you're taking this approach.

34
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.270 
There are also some individual
competences for learning,

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.090 
you learn in a different
way as I learn.

36
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.920 
This is something relevant
because whenever you give a

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.870 
task to someone, some people they
need to have the tesk completely

38
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.470 
defined, structure, point one, point
two, point three, point four...

39
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.440 
point five. To other people
you say, I need this,

40
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.630 
and you get it. Just
you give an idea.

41
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.640 
Then when you give this kind
of task, you need to make

42
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.770 
sure, OK. I'm giving the task in
the proper way, to the proper

43
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.280 
individuals, it is important. I
just mention here, IBM Watson

44
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.560 
I have nothing to do with
IBM, but they are some

45
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.420 
of the most experienced companies,
dealing with this kind

46
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.260 
of differentiating people
when they give a task.

47
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.810 
They focus also at the moment,
in the educational field,

48
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.150 
because they know that, not all
the kids are the same, and not

49
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.170 
all the kids need to
learn in the same way.

50
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.470 
IBM Watson just for you to know,
give a try to this, read

51
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.620 
about that. The cognitive
system that IBM Watson is

52
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.190 
managing is pretty promising.
Now, if we want to

53
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.560 
just to make a summary of
what we just talk about in

54
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.350 
cognitive preference, there
are two elements, and

55
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.060 
we are the HPI, have
been discussing the

56
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.260 
the self-governance and the
learning-styles. The self-governance

57
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.770 
is in order to see, if you
are committed to telework

58
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.040 
and if you are ready to
work in a virtual team.

59
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.620 
For that, we have been using the
thinking style inventory from

60
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.120 
the Sternberg. You will find
at the bottom of this video,

61
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.150 
some links, that are linking
it to this kind of

62
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.660 
formats and formulars, where you
can make your own self-test.

63
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.380 
So, I can Know my learning style
for example, If I take this test?

64
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.910 
You will learn exactly which is yours...
OK, good because I'm very curious.

65
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.760 
But remember, it is not
that you are bad or good,

66
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.470 
it is just your style. I'm just curious
to know, how I learn? I mean,

67
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.020 
I know but it's nice
to take that test.

68
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.550 
For the learnings style, we
have, the Felder and Silverman

69
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.920 
learning style model. Also, it
identifies your learning preferences.

70
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.890 
Both of them you will find
them here, in the bottom,

71
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.840 
are interesting for you,
before you start in this

72
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.790 
new culture and a new rhythm
of a working environment.

73
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.530 
That you start thinking about,
there are people that are not

74
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.980 
confident enough to do some things,
or to do it in a different

75
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.880 
way. Something very relevant
to mention is that

76
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.830 
if you don't have a particular
style, it doesn't mean that you

77
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.020 
will never have it. For
instance, you were

78
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.380 
very bad at football, if you
train, you can become better.

79
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.810 
It is exactly the same thing
in the cognitive style.

80
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.490 
you can train, you can
arrange, probably

81
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.000 
with your management, that
you want to become better

82
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.100 
in this management style,
that you would like to have

83
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.400 
a kind of way, to structure
better your task. All this kind

84
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.330 
of element and aspects,

85
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.330 
can potentially be learned,
therefore, don't feel frustrated

86
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.010 
if you don't have this. Is just
like that, it's just as easy

87
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.460 
as that. Just we wanted to mention
the cognitive preference

88
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.370 
because these are somethings
that we have already

89
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.340 
find out in the
researches at HPI. That

90
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.010 
they definitely have some relevance
and this relevance is something

91
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.470 
that we wanted to share with
the community because

92
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.540 
it may lead to success or failure
of projects in remote teamwork.

93
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.290 
Thank you very much for mentioning
this topic, extremely interesting.

94
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.520 
I'm also curious, I'm sure
you too are curious,

95
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.650 
to learn more about
your learning style.

96
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.960 
Please, take the test, share with
us, share in the group, and if

97
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.430 
you know any other cognitive related
tests or models, also feel

98
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.080 
free to share with us, so
we can all a practice.

99
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.840 
Thank you. Thank
you Hanadi

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.579 
Yeah, hello again and welcome back to

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.909 
our mainframe MOOC, and in the next video clips,

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.969 
we want to show you some information

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.739 
concerning databases.

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.469 
And when we talk about databases, especially when we talk

6
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.769 
about databases in the IBM mainframe

7
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.949 
environment under z/OS, we

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.189 
have to talk about IMS and we have to talk about

9
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.279 
Db2. So the next video clips, we will

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.199 
give you some information.

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.139 
First of all, a few general aspects concerning

12
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.259 
databases. Then we have to

13
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.109 
look into the history, how the databases came

14
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.899 
up, especially in the mainframe environment.

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.079 
We talk about the logical data models

16
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.849 
that are available.

17
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.849 
And afterwards,we use two of these

18
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.969 
data models to get into a little more detail

19
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.819 
concerning the hierarchical data model, which

20
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.999 
is implemented with IMS in

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.459 
IBM z/OS environments.

22
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.268 
And we deal with relational

23
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.389 
data model, which is implemented with Db2.

24
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.379 
And in this case, we also have to talk about

25
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.239 
SQL (Structured Query Language) and how Db2

26
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.149 
objects are defined, especially in a

27
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.709 
z/OS environment.

28
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.039 
When we talk about databases, data explosion

29
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.549 
and the data growth is a very important aspect

30
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.459 
and of this Folge (episode), you see how data

31
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.449 
explosion took place, especially in the last

32
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.550 
few years, and to see how

33
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.019 
thing will go further on in the future.

34
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.079 
So we are really at the starting point

35
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.579 
of a really, really big data environment.

36
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.639 
We will talk mainly now about

37
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.759 
the structured data. It's the part below

38
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.699 
in this light

39
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.370 
and the other, the upper part

40
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.459 
has more to do with big data.

41
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.369 
We also will talk about big data but this is quite

42
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.519 
another aspect when we talk about database

43
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520 
environments.

44
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.439 
Though, data growth data are

45
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.289 
to this century what oil was to the

46
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.379 
last one driver of growth and change.

47
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.469 
This quote is from The

48
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.769 
Economist, and I think it reflects

49
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.099 
the kind of data growth I just mentioned and

50
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.979 
the half-life period today is about two

51
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.919 
years, 10 years ago as example, it

52
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.449 
was around five years.

53
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.989 
So a lot of things changed in the last few years.

54
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.959 
And in far more days before

55
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.959 
we had computers, data was stored on paper,

56
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.899 
on the picture, on the right side, you see an original

57
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.019 
letter from a big bank in

58
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.259 
Switzerland from 1917.

59
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.499 
Well, the data was stored on paper, of course,

60
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.439 
in between, we don't store data

61
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.189 
on paper anymore, especially when it comes to

62
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.289 
financial transactions.

63
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.199 
Data are stored on

64
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.139 
computers today and data

65
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.049 
are the most important assets, especially

66
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.679 
when it comes to financial organizations.

67
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.709 
And in many cases in

68
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.769 
especially for financial organizations,

69
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.799 
high availability is crucial, especially

70
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.749 
for business-critical data.

71
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.029 
And we also will talk about

72
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.889 
Sysplex and parallel Sysplex

73
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.929 
concerning this availability stuff, because this is

74
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.989 
the basics that are built

75
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.529 
on, in this case, on the

76
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.529 
mainframes to get

77
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.000 
these high availability.

78
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.769 
The database definition from Wikipedia

79
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.979 
means a database is a set of related

80
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.369 
data and the way it is organized.

81
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.249 
And we need a set of software

82
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.339 
to manage this data and

83
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.369 
also to have access to this data.

84
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.349 
This is mentioned in this database definition,

85
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.860 
a very general definition from Wikipedia.

86
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.539 
When it comes to the logical data

87
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.139 
environments, we have four different

88
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.669 
data models.

89
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.029 
It started in the 1960s with

90
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.829 
the hierarchical model,

91
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.879 
got further on with the network model in the

92
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.239 
70s and in the 90s,

93
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.179 
80s and 90s, we got the relational model.

94
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.620 
And in between we also have object oriented

95
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.679 
databases. But these play, especially

96
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.769 
when we talk about mainframe environments, not the

97
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.569 
most important role.

98
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.719 
So in fact, we have three

99
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.869 
different models that are important.

100
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.789 
When you talk about mainframe data, it's

101
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.199 
a hierarchical model implemented with

102
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.049 
I.M.S. It is a network model

103
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.189 
also known as the CODASYL Data Model.

104
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.695 
It's a network

105
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.569 
term network model states the

106
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.919 
elements, data elements are

107
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.189 
network connected compared to the

108
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.039 
hierarchical model where each and every data

109
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.099 
element has just one parent element and

110
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.639 
the most flexible and in-between in many

111
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.639 
environments implemented model is relational

112
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.029 
model and this is implemented in an IBM environment

113
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.949 
with Db2.

114
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.039 
And in the next video clips we

115
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.069 
talk especially more about the hierarchical model

116
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.579 
and IMS and the relational model and

117
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.579 
Db2. These are the most important

118
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.350 
implementations in

119
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.050 
z/OS mainframe environments.

120
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.179 
I wish you much fun with the next

121
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.749 
video clips concerning databases and

122
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.809 
how databases work in a mainstream

123
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.099 
z/OS environment.

124
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.959 
Thank you very much. Up to the next time.

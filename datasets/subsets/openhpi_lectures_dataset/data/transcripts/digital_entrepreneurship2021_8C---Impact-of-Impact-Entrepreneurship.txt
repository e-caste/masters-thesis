00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860 
Welcome to this video on
impact entrepreneurship.

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.330 
Thus far we have defined the research
landscape of impact entrepreneurship

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
and explored the motivation and
opportunities for impact entrepreneurs.

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.850 
We have also discussed the particular challenges
and tensions of impact entrepreneurship

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.720 
which often occur due to conflicting or
competing interests between social

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.160 
environmental and
economic goals.

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.380 
In this video, you will learn about the possible
achievements of impact entrepreneurship.

8
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
Further, we will discuss the role of policy for
this particular kind of entrepreneurship.

9
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.720 
And finally, we will give a brief outlook
on the role of digital technologies.

10
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.960 
So, what about the impact
of impact entrepreneurs?

11
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.830 
Do they achieve what they aim to achieve- that
is, a contribution to sustainable development?

12
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.560 
Let's take a look at some
studies to find out.

13
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.860 
In order to understand whether
the goal of a specific social

14
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
or ecological impact is actually achieved
through the organization's actions,

15
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.040 
it is helpful to formulate impact
goals and then analyze the impact.

16
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.620 
The German Social Entrepreneurship
Monitor found out in 2019 that,

17
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
overall, more than 90% of
the surveyed entrepreneurs

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.090 
have set impact goals for the
organization or they plan to do so.

19
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.290 
This study also found out that
more than 80% of social

20
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.980 
entrepreneurs indicate a higher value for
social orientation than for financial return.

21
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.990 
At the same time, financial
return is still significant for

22
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.200 
many, as it also serves
as a means to an end.

23
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.520 
So, do the impact entrepreneurs
succeed- that is, do they reach

24
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.100 
the positive impact that they
want to have? In 2018,

25
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.790 
the 'GlobeScan SustainAbility
Leaders Survey' posed this

26
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.620 
question to more than 700
qualified sustainability

27
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.340 
experts across the globe. The
result? According to them, impact

28
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.450 
entrepreneurs have contributed
second most to the progress

29
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.080 
of the 17 UN's Sustainable
Development Goals.

30
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.900 
They are just behind the NGOs
that contribute the most to the

31
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.990 
progress of the sustainable
development goals.

32
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.180 
Also, within this ranking, there
have been only subtle shifts

33
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.500 
of perceptions of the
contribution since 2012.

34
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.420 
Over the last decade, NGOs and
social entrepreneurs have been

35
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.050 
consistently seen as leaders in contributing
to Sustainable Development Goals.

36
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.000 
While national governments and
the private sector have been

37
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.300 
perceived as
performing poorly.

38
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.530 
We'll come back to that
notion in a second.

39
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.780 
So, now, we know that impact entrepreneurs
successfully contribute to sustainable development.

40
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.740 
The next question could be then
what are actually the fields

41
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.560 
to which impact entrepreneurs
contribute? Let's take another look

42
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.090 
at a previously mentioned study, the
German Social Entrepreneurship Monitor.

43
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.090 
While there are other possible
classifications, they also classified

44
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.360 
the areas in which the social entrepreneurs
want to have a positive impact

45
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.090 
based on the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals.

46
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.730 
The most frequently mentioned
goals in the 2019 survey

47
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.820 
are Quality Education,

48
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.440 
Sustainable Consumption and Production,
Health and Well-being, and

49
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.270 
Decent Work&amp; Economic Growth. An
interesting side note- compared

50
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.260 
to the 2018 figures, the
ranking of the four

51
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.210 
most frequently mentioned Sustainable
Development Goals did not change.

52
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.910 
Often, social entrepreneurs pursue more
than one sustainable development goal.

53
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.510 
Let's take Buckle and Seam as an
example. This Berlin-based startup

54
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.300 
sells individualized leather bags that
have been produced in Pakistan.

55
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.320 
With the profits, the founders are
building and paying for schools

56
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.510 
for girls in Pakistan.

57
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.270 
And by doing so, they contribute to the
sustainable development goal, Quality Education,

58
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.020 
and at the same time
to, Gender Equality.

59
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.540 
Further, the Buckle and Seam ensures that
their production workers in Pakistan

60
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.230 
work in conditions that allow them and their
families a higher standard of living.

61
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.110 
This contributes to the sustainable
development goals No Poverty,

62
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.530 
and Decent Work&amp;
Economic Growth.

63
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.650 
So, we just mentioned that national governments
have been perceived as performing poorly

64
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
in contributing to the
sustainable development goals.

65
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.440 
Let's discuss this a bit more
in-depth and pose the question-

66
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.350 
What is the role of Government and
Policy in Impact Entrepreneurship?

67
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.630 
Actually, the role is two-fold-
On the one hand, the government

68
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.340 
as an actor engages to address the
grand societal challenges by itself.

69
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.670 
This includes, for example,
fighting poverty or pollution.

70
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.480 
When working towards the achievement of
the sustainable development goals,

71
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.020 
government's engagement has played and
will continue to play a crucial role.

72
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.270 
Yet, impact entrepreneurship is
a complementary way to address

73
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.640 
and jointly solve
these challenges.

74
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.300 
And on the other hand, we have
the government's engagement to

75
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.240 
solve sustainable development issues
as a promoter and critical supporter

76
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.730 
of impact
entrepreneurship.

77
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.850 
These concerns, for example, legal
and regulatory frameworks. First,

78
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.170 
regulatory frameworks should not be too
obstructing for entrepreneurs. Second,

79
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.780 
regulation should enable ventures
to simultaneously focus on

80
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.920 
sustainable and economic
activities. And third,

81
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.610 
the creation of regulatory pressures
could lead, for example,

82
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.050 
to more sustainable ventures through
the establishment of penalties

83
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.160 
for not being green or
incentives to become greener.

84
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:05.710 
Another vital aspect of governmental support for impact
entrepreneurship refers to public procurement.

85
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.960 
Impact entrepreneurs must be able to
reach their market. However, public

86
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.530 
procurement policies often discourage
impact entrepreneurs because the startups

87
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.250 
tend to be small and therefore have
difficulties competing in public procurement.

88
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.300 
Instead, public procurement policies could
encourage social or ecological ventures

89
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.360 
and support their
activities.

90
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.890 
This last aspect, an active government
to support sustainable businesses,

91
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.530 
has a prominent advocate: Mariana
Mazzucato. She is an internationally

92
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.840 
renowned Professor of
Economics&amp; Innovation.

93
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.040 
And she argues that many innovations
are hard to achieve without

94
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.790 
the active support
of the state

95
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.860 
and makes a case for a very active
role of the government in

96
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.380 
the economy and
the markets.

97
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.190 
Further, she shares her vision
for capitalism that works for

98
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.110 
social and
environmental goals.

99
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.320 
She criticises that the current
economic mainstream sees political

100
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.030 
action mainly as a corrective
to market failure.

101
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.810 
That is, waiting for something to go wrong
and then putting an advantage on it.

102
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.160 
Instead, Mazzucato calls for more
ambitious green transformation

103
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.720 
and for the creation and common use of markets
to work towards sustainable development.

104
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.070 
In this case, the government would
steer public investment to

105
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.320 
stimulate social and
ecological innovation,

106
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.990 
which is made not only but also
by impact entrepreneurs.

107
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.700 
The government's role would be to
provide the direction and the freedom

108
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.810 
to experiment and research
innovative solutions.

109
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.270 
This also includes the provision of monetary
resources to enable innovative research.

110
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.970 
Finally, let's look at another exciting
aspect of impact entrepreneurship-

111
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.460 
the role of digital
technologies.

112
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:04.210 
Digital sustainability is currently a very
hot topic in research and practice.

113
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.990 
Depending on a very context the term
"digital sustainability" can apply

114
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.940 
a vast range of topics that
you can see on the slide.

115
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.930 
For example, Green IT, which refers to the
sustainable production of digital technologies

116
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.430 
and the use of
scarce resources.

117
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.870 
A related concept would be Clean IT, which
refers to the efficiency of search algorithms.

118
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.070 
Take as an example the energy consumption
of the Google search engine

119
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.610 
or, as another example, the energy
consumption for mining Bitcoins.

120
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.610 
This list is not exhaustive and
each of these topics would

121
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.350 
be worth its own course, unfortunately,
we cannot go more in-depth

122
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.670 
into those topics in this course but
if you want to learn more about it

123
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.530 
make sure to check
out other openHPI

124
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.020 
courses. For example, the course on
Clean IT, by professor Meinel.

125
00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.850 
We'll put a link in the
supporting material.

126
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.740 
For us, as digital
entrepreneurship researchers,

127
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.510 
our area of expertise is mostly within one
specific aspect of digital sustainability-

128
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.910 
the question how digital technologies
can help address sustainable

129
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.080 
development challenges
through entrepreneurship?

130
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.530 
In 2020, our colleague Gerry George defined
the term Digital sustainability as

131
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.840 
the organizational activities that seek to
advance the sustainable development goals

132
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.420 
through the creative deployment
of technologies that create,

133
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.100 
use, transmit or source
electronic data.

134
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.240 
Gerry and his team further argue
that the digital transformation

135
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.610 
and the transformation towards a
sustainable society currently converge.

136
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.300 
That is, on the one hand digital
counties are rapidly gaining traction

137
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.190 
and their economy is increasingly
digitalised. On the other hand, businesses

138
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.130 
are increasingly committed to
social and environmental goals.

139
00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.780 
Taking both transformations
together, empirical research shows

140
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.360 
that entrepreneurs increasingly employ
digital technologies to tackle

141
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:14.780 
sustainability issues. This is then often
accompanied by technological innovation,

142
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.770 
product or service innovation as
well as business model innovation.

143
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:26.300 
In summary, researchers see great potential in
the nature of digital sustainable activities

144
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.340 
because they are less bounded
by geographic constraints and

145
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.940 
consequently more
easily scalable.

146
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.310 
Let's take the app
TooGoodToGo as an example.

147
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.280 
This digital platform offers gastronomic
businesses the opportunity to give away

148
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.870 
overproduced food to customers
at a discounted price.

149
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.190 
For example, restaurants or
bakeries can use the platform to

150
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.610 
offer food that has already been
produced and that would otherwise

151
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:59.160 
end up in the trash. Users of
the app can look up the offers

152
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.750 
in a surrounding area or
at a selected location

153
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.980 
and have the option
to pick them up.

154
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.510 
Of course, an exhaustive evaluation of
the sustainable impact of this app

155
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.650 
needs to include process aspects,
such as, the energy consumption

156
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.880 
of the digital
platform.

157
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.340 
However, it is clear that food waste-
a substantial global challenge

158
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.700 
can be reduced with
this digital offer.

159
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.300 
That was it for our last session
on impact entrepreneurship. We

160
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.830 
hope that you enjoyed it and learned
something that you can apply-

161
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.270 
be it for your own entrepreneurial

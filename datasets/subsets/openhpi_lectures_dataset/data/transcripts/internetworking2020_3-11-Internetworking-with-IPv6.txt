00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760 
In our OpenHPI course, a
half-century of internet

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.440 
we up to now considered
IP version four.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.960 
In this clip, we want to have a
closer look to inter-networking

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.280 
with IPv6. Let's start

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.650 
IPv4, it was and is
very successful.

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.210 
The internet is increasing, it is exploding,
and it works fine, and nobody is claiming.

7
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.810 
But why we need a new internet protocol,
why there is a need for change

8
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.600 
already for a
couple of years?

9
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.740 
So IPv4 currently a is the most popular
and the most used IP version.

10
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.200 
It's extremely successful
due to its basic design,

11
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.610 
the possibility to use IPv4 even with
completely new network technologies

12
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.440 
with completely new hard work
technologies, it works fine. So

13
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.060 
when it was designed
a 50 years ago, the

14
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.270 
kind of computers
and networks

15
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.410 
which are in place today
were not even imaginable.

16
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.750 
So IP version 4 was developed before
the spread of the LAN technology.

17
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:29.110 
It worked also for networks that
are much faster than the one

18
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.100 
it was originally
designed for.

19
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.560 
It has coped with the enormous growth
in the global heterogeneous internet,

20
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.330 
from a small couple of computers
connected in the internet, nowadays

21
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.700 
to millions of systems
which are connected.

22
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.230 
But besides all this
success story,

23
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.850 
there is an urgent need for a change
and there is not only one reason,

24
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.320 
there is a number of basic
problems that cannot

25
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.660 
be solved with IPv4. The
biggest challenge and the

26
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.480 
biggest problem of IPv4
is the address space.

27
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.110 
The internet address
space is too small.

28
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.730 
Why it is too small? It was
exactly described, an internet

29
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.710 
address has a length
of thirty bits,

30
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.580 
this cannot be changed. If you
change this then the internet

31
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.100 
protocol needs to be changed.
So the 2 bits, it's limited

32
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.200 
to about 4 billion
different addresses.

33
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.590 
So only four billion different devices
can be connected to the internet.

34
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.110 
Then we run into
problems because

35
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.340 
the system needs to be
a unique address,

36
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.110 
then also systems can send
information to here.

37
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.000 
Here you see 2 curves over the
years from the IANA, which

38
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.550 
is responsible for the internet
protocol, which shows that already

39
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.360 
2012-2014 the number of

40
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.260 
IP addresses was going
down a two zero

41
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.470 
so here you see it more drastically
about years where the different

42
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.360 
a record three s each in each continent
of the world has an internet registry

43
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.010 
so called career a which what happens
with the number of available

44
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.440 
uh uh uh uh ip addresses the
real plays a role if you want

45
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.890 
to connect to the internet you asked
an internet service provider

46
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.860 
to connect you and the internet service
providers they need three ip addresses

47
00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.080 
to do this and this free ip addresses
they can get from the rise

48
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.950 
but you see they there were no
more free ip addresses available

49
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.830 
so the last three ip four four address
block where allocated by yada

50
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.000 
two the five regional internet
registries already in the year two

51
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.620 
thousand eleven so the remaining ip
addresses are still currently distributed

52
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.490 
so there exists some companies
are buying other companies only

53
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.300 
to get a access to
their IP addresses

54
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.100 
but more changes are
required for IP before

55
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.630 
the increasing number of internet hosts
make routing more and more problematic

56
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.720 
societies of the routing tables
the complexity of the protocol

57
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.200 
he becomes a two
a difficult

58
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.120 
then also a service type for
multimedia data is missing

59
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.730 
a it cannot be a specified in
ip version four and this is a

60
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.120 
problem because there is no possibility
to define quality of service

61
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.870 
a a parameters for transmission of
multimedia data for transmission

62
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.260 
of synchronous live transmission
and other things which are

63
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.910 
needed for the right
presentation

64
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.670 
there is a lack of support for
distributed group work ok cscw

65
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.380 
computer supported cooperative
work a system he provided

66
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:45.040 
for that reason a successor for ip
before he was needed and indeed

67
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.180 
already already nineteen ninety five
see internet engineering task force

68
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.060 
this is a responsible for the
development of the internet technology

69
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.470 
started to develop a new ip version
which nowadays is called ip six

70
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:12.590 
f six adopts working basic concepts of ip v
four such as connection less packet service

71
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.420 
each data gramme of a message
is transmitted independently

72
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:24.290 
a limited number of a possible hops
is this all it was very well

73
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.990 
he approved with ip four but there were
new ideas and new ideas of course

74
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.810 
c address eyes
was poor longer

75
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.030 
with ip six there are one
hundred twenty eight bits

76
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.250 
a away leper to describe
an internet address

77
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.960 
one hundred twenty eight bits are
subdivided in eight a bit groups

78
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.140 
it's a bit groups are presented
in hexadecimal notation with

79
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.670 
colon as separate and
zero compression

80
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.810 
a p six one of the innovation
is a new head of format

81
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.830 
a new head of ahmed and the
usage of multiple head us

82
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.770 
so there is a mandatory base
header but there are optionally

83
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.310 
one or more additional headers for
authentication encryption fragmentation

84
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.550 
and the idea behind is to give some
such information only in case

85
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.370 
a if for example packages fragmented
remember with ip before

86
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.110 
there was in each header a fragment
fields for fragmentation information

87
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.860 
here the information that's needed
in case of fragmentation it's

88
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.920 
collected in an additional header
and this additional header

89
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.420 
is optionally and is only sent
and append to the data packet

90
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.310 
when the fragmentation is done and then
there are different address types

91
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.990 
for unicast multicast
and clusters

92
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.800 
another area is the support for
video and audio transmission

93
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.090 
so for real time transmission
that uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

94
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.170 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh uh uh uh uh using mechanisms

95
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:15.330 
for determining pre-determined transmission
passes to guarantee high quality

96
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.510 
a transmission of such
a continuously data

97
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.290 
they are more improvements
of ip six over ip four

98
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:32.540 
the protocol is extendable so new
functionalities through additional protocols

99
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.380 
a for example the mobile ip six
now is part of the he is part

100
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.290 
of the ip six protocol the
neighbor discovery protocol

101
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:50.560 
based on icmp we six which is
replacing the arp protocol a only

102
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.670 
to give an example there is a host
outer configuration mechanisms status

103
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.060 
dhcp support for mighty
homing and renumeration

104
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:09.230 
uh it's not so important to understand
all this new functionality in

105
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.760 
he is in the detail if you are
interested you can i get a lot

106
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.700 
more information in our
book which is available

107
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:24.830 
but a two get in general a impression
how what are the difference

108
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:29.000 
of ip six to ip four i
think this is an app

109
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.550 
what's important is to have a look
to this new addressing scheme

110
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:40.080 
because this is the most important
design requirement and this

111
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.380 
was a most important design requirement
for the new internet protocol

112
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.350 
it drastically increase the number
of available addresses and

113
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:56.280 
this was done to meet the demand
particularly in the development

114
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.660 
of the mobile communication
people have

115
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.210 
almost all people in the world
have and a have an a a mobile

116
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.880 
phone or a smartphone many people
have several such devices

117
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.080 
the other area is the internet
of things when although you're

118
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:21.330 
smart homes smart traffic smart city then also
things can communicate via the internet

119
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.280 
they need addresses so this was the
most important design requirement

120
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:32.600 
and the decision was made to have
an address length for ip six

121
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.190 
of one hundred
twenty eight bits

122
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.750 
comparable to ip four there
was a thirty two pits

123
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:47.640 
so is a space the address space
increased from two to thirty two

124
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.390 
that's about four billion to two
to the one hundred twenty eight

125
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:59.210 
different addresses which is an
unimaginable large a huge number

126
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.280 
each additional bit from the thirty
twos is one hundred and twenty eight

127
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.030 
doubles the number of
possible addresses

128
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.710 
does not multiplying its doubling
its is exponential crows

129
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.770 
so only to give you an feeling about
this number ten hundred twenty three

130
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:25.690 
ip addresses could be assigned for each
square meter of the earth surface

131
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:32.060 
and this is a number that is
larger than the age of our world

132
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.510 
what is the notation for this
huge ip addresses for humans

133
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.080 
is almost impossible to have says
a one hundred twenty eight

134
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.510 
a sequences of a bit

135
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.380 
so too a to deal with this ip
addresses the one hundred twenty

136
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.540 
eight bits are separated in eight
blocks with sixteen bits each

137
00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.610 
and the separate these blocks
are separated by columns not

138
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.570 
by dots like in the
case of ip before

139
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.720 
sixteen blocks are written
in hexadecimal notion

140
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.680 
so as the basic number is not
ten like in our decimal system

141
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:19.200 
or two like in the burn binary
system say he base is sixteen

142
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:26.540 
so we have a c c a numbers a one
two three four five nine these

143
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:33.290 
are ten and then we need six more numbers
to describe by one single character

144
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:41.830 
so these are the letters a b c d f
so the a s c addresses can rewrite

145
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:48.970 
right compactly in this exodus l
notation with columns system

146
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:56.150 
there is another idea to shorten see
address and this is ok zero compression

147
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.920 
and the idea is the following first
suppression of all the leading series

148
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.530 
so if it's a the number ten in
the sixteen block there are

149
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.000 
many series before
they can be done

150
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:17.110 
then summary of a block sequence
of cyrus as empty character

151
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.510 
so if there is a block
consisting only of zeros

152
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:28.090 
then it is omitted completely we
can recognises in the situation

153
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.880 
that there are two colons
close to each other

154
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.940 
let's consider an example this
is such an ip six address here

155
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.780 
you see there also let us
up to f a inside says

156
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.600 
and they are our leading zeros
the first step is to omit the

157
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:55.520 
leading cirrus so here we can a a
takes a three series away here one

158
00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:02.650 
uh uh uh uh here one and here too
and then we have the situation

159
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.780 
that we have zero a that we have three
candidates consisting only from service

160
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:14.030 
these are three office is equal says
and then there is the next step

161
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:20.290 
said we comprises and we can recognise
here that we can do this one times

162
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.870 
you can recognises that there
are two columns aside

163
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:29.340 
and reconstructing the original
ip six address is easy

164
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.060 
because it's exactly clear
we have eight blocks

165
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.710 
and here are only one two three four
five blocks three blocks are missing

166
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.040 
and the missing blocks are
consequently if zero a blocks

167
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:49.090 
so in this way one can manage
to a notate the ip addresses

168
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.190 
in a quite compact form

169
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.760 
yeah when i introduced ip six i already
mentioned that there are different

170
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.630 
ip address components

171
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.520 
so the ip six address architecture
consists of three components

172
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:11.260 
there is a prefix the subnet
idea and the interface idea

173
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:17.160 
these are the three components of c
a of c ip six address the prefix

174
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.350 
it's also called a side idea
describes the type of ip address

175
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.130 
or indicates the location for
example is the sp or the company

176
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.420 
to which the address
is belonging

177
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.700 
then in the middle we
have a subnet idea

178
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:39.440 
subnet id describes the private topology
for example within a private network

179
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.370 
and then we have the interface idea
set standards for the internet

180
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:50.430 
for the network interface and can be
calculated from the mac address

181
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:56.670 
as an example the mac address this wall's
address of a computer inside a network

182
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.120 
inside the network technology for
example inside is on it and

183
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.340 
from that the ip address at
least a part of the ip address

184
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:10.090 
can be a computed this is
the idea here of ip six

185
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.840 
if we look to the data packet also the
data packet a differs from a that

186
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:23.140 
of ip we from as a problem with
a packet in a with the data

187
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:29.800 
a with a data packet format in
ip four wars that many ip

188
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:37.330 
b four header fields are left empty or are
not relevant for a concrete transmission

189
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:43.060 
so it's a waste of space it increase
route allowed its increased

190
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.760 
traffic inside
the network

191
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:52.050 
so the improvement for a pv six wars
that one is not working with one hara

192
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:58.560 
there is an optional use of several small
headers adopted to the respective

193
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:05.990 
uh situation so here we have a a
mandatory a mandatory header

194
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:13.460 
the base had a you remember it's
double in size of a ip v four header

195
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:20.790 
although the ip addresses which is an
important information inside the header

196
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:29.080 
is he much larger it's a four times
a larger send the addresses in IP

197
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.850 
before and then there could be a
sequence of additional headers.

198
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:39.510 
For example header style something about
the fragmentation and another header

199
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:45.600 
that it held something about the
encryption and then we have the payload

200
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:53.650 
and in a data IPv6 data package
inside of 8 bytes 264Kb.

201
00:17:54.190 --> 00:18:00.400 
This gives you an impression of
this new internet protocol design

202
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:07.800 
it has needed a long time that IPv6
to come into practice. Many people

203
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.710 
were thinking oh my system
works with IPv4, do not touch

204
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:17.150 
it otherwise we get problems.
Meanwhile, we have to do and so today

205
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:21.520 
it's about 15 to 20 percent
of the internet traffic

206
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.590 
which is realized
with IPv6.

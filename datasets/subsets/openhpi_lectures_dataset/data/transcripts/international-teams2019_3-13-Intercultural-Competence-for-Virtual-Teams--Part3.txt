00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.550 
Welcome to the third video of the
series regarding intercultural

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.630 
competence for virtual teams.
In this last video I like to

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.870 
talk about meetings and give some
information about the thirty

4
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.900 
eight fifty-five
ninety-three formula math.

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.220 
As well as, body language
and guidelines.

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.490 
How to begin a meeting according
to Lewis, it's very important

7
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.030 
to give a way for the team members
to start a meeting and come

8
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.840 
to the point. For example, in
Germany it's normal to have

9
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.310 
just a formal introduction,
to sit down and to begin

10
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.520 
the meeting. In contrast
to Spain and Italy,

11
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.470 
in these cultures the introduction
of formal interactaction,

12
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.370 
is much longer, containing
small talk for example, about

13
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.980 
family or sports and
so on, in order to

14
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.530 
get familiar with the
other parts of the

15
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.510 
team and to come
later to the point

16
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.300 
and the focus of the agenda. This is
very important to have in mind.

17
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.450 
There are also questions before
the first meeting you have

18
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.390 
to answer in order to cover several
cultures, different cultures

19
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.130 
and those team members from different
cultures in virtual teams.

20
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.870 
For example, It has been it's
very important to think about

21
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.260 
the intended purpose of
the meeting in order to

22
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.730 
invite the right
members for the team,

23
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.750 
and for the meeting. For example,
technicians or managers

24
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.100 
and so on. This is because
the sitting order is

25
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.290 
different in different
cultures and you have to

26
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.480 
arrange the sitting order
before you do the meeting,

27
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.040 
to avoid any
mistakes and then

28
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.260 
cancel the
meeting before

29
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.220 
decisions have been made.
Also, physical arrangements

30
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.960 
have to be done before for
example, room size according

31
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.410 
to the number of the
meeting members, heating

32
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.980 
temperature, but also
accommodation or entertainment.

33
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.960 
Things you can
arrange for example

34
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.680 
like excursions or a
visiting theatres.

35
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.170 
And one very important
point is the agenda

36
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.290 
as I said before, with the
beginning of the meeting

37
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.620 
according to German people
for example, you have to

38
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.100 
have strict agendas
and stick to the

39
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.550 
points in the agenda
very strictly.

40
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.000 
There are more questions you
can take into consideration,

41
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.300 
for example,
what are the

42
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.030 
priorities of the
other sides

43
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.780 
of other cultures, of team members,
for example, striving that

44
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.960 
to the strive for harmony, or are
they long term oriented, or

45
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.860 
order task-oriented and
so on. You can also

46
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.240 
think about the decision-maker,
it is one person?

47
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.370 
are there

48
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.800 
more persons who

49
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.090 
are making decisions? So,
they have to address

50
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.950 
these decisions make decisions-
makers accordingly.

51
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.310 
And finally, you can also take
into account for example

52
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.900 
the cultural gap between the two
sides regarding the logic,

53
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.830 
logical structure of the team
meeting and how to proceed during

54
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.100 
the meeting. You can also
take into account religion

55
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.820 
differences or political
or emotional

56
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.950 
differences. Think about a Lewis
communication model for example

57
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.840 
multi-active members are
rather emotional and

58
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.280 
for example linear
active or rather

59
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.530 
fact-oriented.

60
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.420 
There is a directive a
type of cultures or

61
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.320 
very a harmony
striving.

62
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.340 
The myth of the formula thirty-eight
fifty-five ninety-three

63
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.250 
means that ninety-three
percent of communication is

64
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.900 
non-verbal, from that fifty-five
percent of what you convey comes

65
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.650 
from body language and thirty-eight
percent from the tone of

66
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.030 
your voice, just only seven percent
comes from the words you say.

67
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.880 
This formula was
never postulated by

68
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.320 
Mehrabian and
colleagues.

69
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.160 
It was just postulated
that if body language

70
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.470 
tone and contents do not agree,
then the content-wise message

71
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.400 
is lost to a large extent. There
were no numbers in these studies

72
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.180 
and this was just
because of

73
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.080 
were numbers in the study
but not in this sense

74
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.230 
that nonverbal part, it is the
biggest part of communication

75
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.370 
and it's just seven
percent on that verbal

76
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.280 
communication content.

77
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.390 
This myth was destroyed by
Trimboli and Walker in 1987

78
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:55.410 
and they found out that
numbers, the percentages

79
00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.300 
off conveying information in
communication resulting from

80
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.680 
body language, voice, or
utterances and verbal sayings

81
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.830 
depend on situational
context.

82
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.380 
Nevertheless, it should be
very important to take body

83
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.670 
language and voice into account
in purely verbal communication

84
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.540 
situations, such as using via
email, written documentation

85
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:33.680 
or phone. Thereby thinking how
the communication partner

86
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:39.530 
would react in this situation
in order to take account also

87
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:49.190 
nonverbal, fine nonverbal
aspects in verbal

88
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.280 
communication.

89
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.570 
Here you can we have some examples
regarding this confluence

90
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:04.410 
agreement which means
that it is important,

91
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.970 
that the non-verbal
expressions, body language,

92
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:16.800 
and the tone in your voice has to
fit to the content you utter

93
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:26.550 
otherwise, the verbal utterances are not serious
and won't be taking serious by your counterpart

94
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.710 
in communication. How to
improve body language?

95
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.070 
Smiling is one of the most
important methods to do this

96
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.590 
to improve body language.
However, smiling is working

97
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.560 
only if you're
honestly smiling,

98
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.560 
not if you hide for example
your uncertainty or

99
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:59.800 
you use it to agree
or hide some

100
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.190 
propositional attitudes
for example.

101
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:09.020 
Smiling is cultural dependent,
but if your smiling honestly

102
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:14.480 
then it works globally. There
are many more aspects you can

103
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.610 
improve in body language for
example having eye-contact

104
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.420 
to establish a connection
or minimize movement,

105
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:31.720 
that distracts and
also slow down,

106
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.850 
you pay for fast talkers, move
slowly if you have to adjust

107
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.240 
your position. These advice,
for example, to improve the

108
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.130 
body language but be open
with your emotions

109
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.360 
and if you are sad, happy or
surprised show that on your face.

110
00:09:54.530 --> 00:10:00.040 
Here are finally some tips four
intercultural virtual teams

111
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:06.530 
but the most important aspect is
doing a face to face kick-off

112
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.870 
meeting to use all communication
channels we have as human

113
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:16.450 
beings, in order not to, or in
order to avoid misunderstanding.

114
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.520 
Second, define document and
communicate the overall goal within

115
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.290 
the team very important, that
team is knowing what to do and

116
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.520 
works on the same
objective.

117
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.950 
Furthermore, you can establish
confidence by personal relationship

118
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:49.420 
and use the faces of teamwork
as specified before.

119
00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.800 
Focus on the virtual
teams by using

120
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.960 
communication means you
need, in order to

121
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:10.140 
bridge the distances
and to cope with

122
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.320 
a leak of non-verbal
communication.

123
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.700 
Intercultural training
are most welcome

124
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.840 
to the team members especially
if you have determined

125
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.560 
need using IT.

126
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.520 
In collectivist societies may
take time before initial

127
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.470 
successes in cooperation are
achieved since trust can only

128
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:48.110 
be achieved through a personal
relationship that must be

129
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.170 
established.

130
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.010 
In this case, you can also
have body language in mind,

131
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.310 
for example, If you have a phone
call or you read emails,

132
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:06.070 
you can imagine how the person
on the other side would react

133
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.750 
and you can read this body
language, virtually so to speak.

134
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.790 
Very important is also to do
intermediate milestones,

135
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.940 
to refresh the forming

136
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.340 
Face, via teleconference
teleconferences or chat meetings

137
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.180 
with web cameras.

138
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.880 
Necessary is also to build up
the technology infrastructure

139
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:38.300 
and you can enhance the
relationship orientation within

140
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.320 
teams using profiles with
interests and hobbies,

141
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.450 
on the internet to
prevent anonymity

142
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.610 
within teams.

143
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.350 
Thank you very much for watching
this video series on intercultural

144
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.680 
virtual teams and I
wish you much success

145
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:09.510 
in such intercultural virtual teams,
you join in the future. Thank you.

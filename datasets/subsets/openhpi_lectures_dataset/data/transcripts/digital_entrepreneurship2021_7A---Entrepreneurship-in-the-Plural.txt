00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090 
The journey of entrepreneurs is
shaped by many different supporters -

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.460 
investors, early customers,
mentors, or other startups.

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.600 
Relationships with the right
actors at the right moment at

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.050 
the right place, locally or virtually, in
sum determine entrepreneurial success.

5
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.410 
Over the last two decades, this
has become an apparent regional

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.990 
phenomenon at several entrepreneurial
hotspots, such as in Berlin,

7
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.970 
Silicon Valley or Haifa.

8
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.870 
But how should we call and make
sense of these configurations

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.620 
of entrepreneurs and
their environment?

10
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.390 
Welcome. My name is Valeska Maul
and today Katharina HÃ¶lzle and I

11
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
want to discuss entrepreneur
ecosystems with you.

12
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.370 
In the previous sessions, we have
talked about different aspects

13
00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.080 
of entrepreneurship on an individual level,
including, for example, female entrepreneurs.

14
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.150 
Naturally, when thinking of
entrepreneurs, we think of

15
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.130 
people, individuals or individual companies
that discover or create opportunities, and

16
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.410 
then exploit them in
order to create value.

17
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.790 
However, in entrepreneurship
research, we can observe a shift

18
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
from individual-driven research to a
broader perspective on entrepreneurship:

19
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.580 
the ecosystem construct.

20
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.430 
So, first, what is an
entrepreneurial ecosystem?

21
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.180 
Two leading entrepreneurship researchers,
Erik Stam and Ben Spiegel,

22
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.650 
define entrepreneur ecosystems as "a set
of inter-dependent actors and factors

23
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.790 
coordinated in such a way that they
enable productive entrepreneurship

24
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.030 
within a particular
territory".

25
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.750 
In the next video, we will come back to what
exactly an entrepreneur ecosystem is,

26
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.230 
who its actors are, and what
activities are being conducted.

27
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.080 
But, before that, we want to
understand why ecosystems play an

28
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.370 
increasingly important role in
both entrepreneurship research

29
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.300 
and practice.

30
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.660 
Several researchers have argued that the
perception of how we see entrepreneurship

31
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.610 
should shift away from the
'entrepreneurship superman' or 'superwoman'

32
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.960 
towards a rather
ecosystem perspective.

33
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.850 
And why is this? Well, first of all,
entrepreneurship is a social process that is

34
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.750 
embedded in its larger environment
and context. In other words:

35
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.220 
an entrepreneur is not just an
isolated economic actor who's

36
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.080 
emerged in a lonely journey, but
is interdependent with

37
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.650 
socioeconomic systems, for example,
support structures. In this

38
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.470 
sense, the geographical location,
for example, is an essential

39
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.610 
factor in the
entrepreneurial ecosystem.

40
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.900 
The location can have a major impact on
the entrepreneurial processes or success

41
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.840 
in the region, because it may actually
affect the entrepreneurial

42
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.810 
mindset of all other people in
that area. Or, at one location,

43
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.250 
there might be more possibilities
to secure venture capital

44
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.420 
funding than in other locations. Yes,
several organizations investigate

45
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.580 
and rank different entrepreneurial
ecosystems around the world.

46
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.760 
On the left hand side of the
slide, you can see a graphical

47
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.630 
presentation of the Berlin ecosystem and the
players that evolve around the entrepreneurs.

48
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.100 
This map has been designed by
the Institute for Innovation

49
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.290 
and Technology
in Berlin.

50
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.890 
Light blue triangles indicate co-working
spaces, red arrows indicate accelerators,

51
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.770 
orange triangles indicates startup hubs,
and dark blue arrows indicate incubators.

52
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.470 
In case you want to learn more about the
supporting structures in the Berlin

53
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.930 
ecosystem, we will provide a link to the
original source in the further material.

54
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.890 
More global insights can be gained
from the Startup Heatmap Europe.

55
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.570 
On their website, they map startup
ecosystem based on how founders feel,

56
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.290 
and provide data on startup ecosystem
dynamics for eighty nine cities in Europe.

57
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.750 
We will also provide a link to their
website below this video.

58
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.320 
Interestingly, according to the
latest survey, Berlin was named

59
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.190 
Europe's most attractive technological
ecosystem by European founders.

60
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.210 
London ranks second and Amsterdam
and Barcelona both rank third.

61
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.340 
Other studies come to the different
rankings, so always keep

62
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.210 
in mind to critically reflect the criteria
on which such rankings are based on.

63
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.190 
So, we have stated that entrepreneurs should
be seen within this broader context.

64
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.720 
Now, you might be asking yourself,
why do we speak about ecosystems

65
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.450 
at all? Entrepreneurs -
just like organizations in

66
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.420 
general - are, of course, embedded
in markets and networks. What

67
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.900 
is the difference in perspective, between
an ecosystem, the market, or a network?

68
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.480 
In a recent article published
in the Academy of Management

69
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.790 
Annals, the two researchers Andrew
Shipilov and Annabelle Gawer aim to integrate

70
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.780 
these perspectives. Let's first think of
where the word ecosystem stems from.

71
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.050 


72
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.190 
The analogy to the original meaning
from the field of biology

73
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.070 
is actually helpful to understand
the differences. In biology,

74
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.610 
an ecosystem is where certain
plants or animals share a habitat.

75
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.490 
There, they build
interdependent communities.

76
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.290 
Because they enter into an
interrelationship, the living beings

77
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.740 
and their habitat should
be considered together -

78
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.870 
this is what biologists
call an ecosystem.

79
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.990 
So, in management research, we would rather
speak about organizations that are

80
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.150 
related to each other and
how they actually interact.

81
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.420 
The value of the output of one company
depends on the value of another company.

82
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.870 
A popular example would be
software and hardware - the value

83
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.580 
of an iPhone application, developed
by independent developers,

84
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.450 
depends on the value of the iPhone -
and the other way around. So,

85
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.470 
in ecosystems this complementarity
is however non-generic.

86
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.930 
This means the producers on both sides have
to specifically coordinate their outputs

87
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.910 
to enable value
creation.

88
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.770 
Coming back to the previous
example, the independent software

89
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.950 
developer optimizes an app for
the iPhone even though there

90
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.190 
is no hierarchical control instance
which would force them to do so.

91
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.300 
But if they wouldn't, they
wouldn't sell the app, right?

92
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.470 
Let's take a look at what this
mechanism of coordination means

93
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.970 
for the differentiation of ecosystems
from markets and networks.

94
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.310 
In markets, transactions are usually
coordinated through price.

95
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.580 
Whether a customer buys from a
particular supplier is up to

96
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.740 
the market price of the
product or service.

97
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.940 
Networks are typically coordinated
through formal contracts,

98
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.560 
and supplemented by informal
coordinating mechanisms, such as trust

99
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.100 
or information transfer.

100
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.270 
An example would be that software
firms and hardware firms

101
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.500 
jointly engage in research and
development, such as the formal

102
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.700 
alliance between Cisco, Apple and
further network members to

103
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.540 
develop cyber security
solutions for Apple products.

104
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.550 
In short, the focus of an ecosystem lies
on a system of interdependent actors

105
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.420 
while the market perspective captures
transactional relationships,

106
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.970 
and the network perspective
rather focuses on contractual

107
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.970 
and formal ties, such as
joint ventures or alliances.

108
00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:02.040 
To conclude, in addition to the
market and the network view

109
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:08.090 
the ecosystem perspective is a valuable
complement on the topic of entrepreneurship.

110
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.260 
The ecosystem construct allows for a
holistic view of inter dependencies

111
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.670 
among various actors
in entrepreneurship.

112
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.470 
So, if you're interested in reading more
on ecosystems in the digital economy,

113
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.090 
we recommend reading the article
"The Digital Entrepreneurial

114
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.270 
Ecosystem" by Fiona Sussan and Zoltan Acs
published in 2017.

115
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:38.330 
They propose a framework that integrates digital
ecosystems with entrepreneurial ecosystems.

116
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:44.330 
They develop a rather abstract and theoretical
model for researching digital ecosystems.

117
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.690 
If you're interested in deepening
your knowledge in this topic,

118
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.090 
this might be an
interesting read for you.

119
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.500 
There are articles freely available
as a preprint on SSRN and

120
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.660 
you can find the link to the
preprint below this video.

121
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.010 
So much for this video in today's
sessions on ecosystems. We

122
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.550 
hope you have understood that it's
not only a biological ecosystem

123
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.890 
that counts, but entrepreneurial
ecosystems are also quite important

124
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.150 
if you look at how entrepreneurs
can actually succeed and why

125
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.780 
all entrepreneurs want to come to Berlin
and not to Paderborn, for example.

126
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:29.500 
So, we're looking forward to the
next videos on actors, activities,

127
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.330 
and the architecture of
entrepreneurial ecosystems. Bye.

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.220 
Let's start our openhpi course
"A Half Century of Internet:

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.950 
How it Works Today" with some remarks
about the internet and how the internet

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.240 
is changing our world.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.550 
The internet is
fifty years old

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.960 
and already it has completely
changed our world.

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.440 
So I already showed this image to visualize
this effect. This network of networks,

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.120 
a worldwide accessible which
completely is changing our world.

8
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.770 
Sixty nine, nineteen sixty nine - so
then was the birth of the internet.

9
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.610 
This was nineteen sixty nine
was an interesting year.

10
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.620 
It is not only the internet which was
born also it's a first moon landing

11
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.080 
was in sixty nine, last century. Or
the famous Woodstock festival.

12
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.320 
And also here in Germany in Berlin
the Berlin TV Tower was created

13
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.320 
in nineteen sixty
nine. And of course

14
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.860 
you have also a rememberings what
happened in this important year

15
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.990 
beside of the birth of the
internet. Please discuss about

16
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.680 
such things and remind such
events in the discussion forum.

17
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.170 
When the internet was born in nineteen
sixty nine it was exactly four computers.

18
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.020 
Four computers that were connected,
it was the ARPANET project in US

19
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.180 
and it was on the University
of California in Los Angeles

20
00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.620 
in the Stanford Research
Institute in Utah and the idea

21
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.400 
was that display the servers
in different computers.

22
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.820 
Different computers and the
question was is it possible

23
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.910 
to exchange messages and information and
documents between these computers?

24
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.680 
Each computer was running with
a different Operating System

25
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.420 
so the question
was can we

26
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.280 
let such computers such
different computers

27
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.650 
with different operating system,
can we let them cooperate?

28
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.480 
So it was a scientific question. It was
a question, a what kind of concepts

29
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
would be necessary
to enable such an

30
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.570 
collaboration of
different computers.

31
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.950 
So could we communicate across
platform and network boundaries?

32
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.340 
Computers from the same with the same
operating system from the same vendor,

33
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.760 
they could exchange data. But
computers is from different

34
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.540 
windows with different operator it was
different in network technology.

35
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
This was the challenge which should be
solved by such kind of development.

36
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.860 
So one of the first usage of
this ARPANET, of this inter

37
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.220 
connection of computers was
Telnet. And Telnet this was

38
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.890 
a service which allowed scientists to log
on a computer from a remote location.

39
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.480 
So from far away for example from
Los Angeles Los Angeles a user

40
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.840 
could log in to a machine that
was physically run in Utah.

41
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.340 
Today it's very trivial and clear
as it's possible but this

42
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.700 
was a very big question and
challenge when researchers start

43
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.020 
to think about it.

44
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.840 
If you look what happened after
fifty years and look who are

45
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.400 
the internet
users today,

46
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:20.900 
then you see there are more than four billion
active internet users. Four billion.

47
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.430 
There are more than four billion
unique mobile internet users,

48
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.450 
users that use internet with
smartphone and such device.

49
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.170 
There are three point eight billion
active users of social media

50
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.870 
or there are almost three point
eight billion active and mobile

51
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.100 
mobile social media users. So today
internet is a part of our life,

52
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.980 
many things will not
work without internet.

53
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.470 
Here is the view what
happened. In one minute

54
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.490 
on the internet. These are numbers
from two thousand nineteen

55
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
and from very different applications. So
for example one million in one minute

56
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.080 
in sixty seconds. One million
logins are done in facebook,

57
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.140 
or four point five million
videos are watched

58
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.370 
in one minute, or two point one
million snaps are taken. So here

59
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.000 
are the different for example
forty six thousand new posts.

60
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.970 
For the different services
you see such number for

61
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.200 
example eighty seven thousand
people sent a message on twitter

62
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.240 
or three point eight million
requests on google search.

63
00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:02.140 
So it is unimaginable in what extent the
internet applications are used today.

64
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.290 
Here is the number of online
gamers on the internet which is

65
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.390 
also increasing
in meanwhile

66
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.060 
uh

67
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.660 
almost one billion people around
the world that use internet

68
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.830 
for gaming activities.

69
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.030 
If we count the smartphones and
the smart home devices and

70
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.940 
which are said in the US in the
years two thousand sixteen

71
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.130 
to two thousand nineteen. Here smart home
devices are smart devices which help

72
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.970 
to organize your life in your flat to
automatically switch on light or

73
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:53.730 
start heating or other things. Then
you see the strong increase in that.

74
00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:00.220 
In two thousand and nineteen four
point five million, sorry,

75
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:07.280 
billion US dollar are paid for
such, are spent to buy such

76
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.930 
devices. And here it shows the
internet is omnipresent.

77
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.040 
There is internet whether you are
going shopping internet is used

78
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:27.140 
whether in the entertainment,
internet is used whether in the

79
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:32.530 
communication social media, internet
is a central part in gaming,

80
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.880 
we already mentioned this. So
there is really the internet

81
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:45.790 
in this fifty years since it was
invented nineteen sixty nine to today

82
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.010 
it really has
changed our world.

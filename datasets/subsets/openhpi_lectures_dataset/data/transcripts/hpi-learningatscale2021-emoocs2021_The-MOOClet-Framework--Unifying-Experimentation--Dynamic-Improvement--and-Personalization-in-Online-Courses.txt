00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.540 
platform developers experimental researchers and data mining

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.470 
or machine learning researchers in education often wonder.

3
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.090 
how can we keep improving an online course even after it is deployed to students?

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.050 
how can we develop identify and deliver better versions of

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.390 
course content over time ?

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.780 
how can we personalize the learning experience of students

7
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.090 
based on their characteristics ?

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.550 
when new ideas for improvement arise how can we systematically

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.810 
test these ideas out and incorporate them into real world online

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.320 
courses quickly and efficiently ?

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.820 
our answer is the booklet framework.

12
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
a novel software architecture that enables experimentation

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.420 
machine learning and human driven improvement and personalization

14
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.430 
by augmenting front-end components of real world educational interfaces

15
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.580 
with back-end api and databases.

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.990 
we design these api and databases such that course content

17
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.230 
can be flexibly adapted by instructors and researchers, as they

18
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.430 
explore new ideas data analysis techniques and algorithms.

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.290 
we refer to any interface component augmented with this back-end

20
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.270 
architecture. as

21
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.560 
the overarching goal of the nuclear framework is to make educational

22
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.220 
interfaces future-proof for a broad range of not yet specified research

23
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.410 
involving manual. and automated methods for experimentation

24
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.230 
data driven improvement and personalisation

25
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.890 
to operationalize this overarching goal. we define eight design requirements

26
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.470 
derived nuclear framework architecture and web service implementation

27
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.300 
that addresses these requirements

28
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.530 
and describe four use cases that exemplify how and where the

29
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.610 
framework is most useful.

30
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.410 
the design requirements focus on enabling iterative experimentation through a-b comparisons

31
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.530 
resource improvement using data from past learners and personalization

32
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.670 
using data on specific individuals or subgroups of learners.

33
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.380 
they also emphasize the importance of easy modification of

34
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.480 
course content data and algorithms at any point in time.

35
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.390 
to allow flexibility with the range of future iterative research

36
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.240 
even before it is known exactly which ideas will be tested.

37
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.890 
what data available are useful and which algorithms are most

38
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.210 
effective in the real world.

39
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.150 
the muckluck framework architecture consists of three key software abstractions.

40
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.050 
the version set for flexible edition of versions of coarse content.

41
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.300 
the policy set for many ways to choose which versions to present.

42
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.610 
and the learner data store for curating student characteristics for personalization.

43
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.390 
the front-end learner interface in the back-end admin panel

44
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.130 
draw on these abstractions and communicate with each other via api calls.

45
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.580 
the key conceptual insight is an equivalence in implementing

46
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.900 
software for three different functions a randomized experiment.

47
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.020 
presents two or more alternative versions with equal probability.

48
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.270 
enhancement or improvement is achieved by using data to modify that probability

49
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.110 
based on human analysis or machine learning algorithms.

50
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.220 
and personalization is achieved by delivering resources conditional

51
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.630 
on a feature of a learner. for example their prior knowledge

52
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.130 
or their performance on past problems.

53
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.190 
the use cases not only illustrate how the framework functions,

54
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.530 
but also demonstrate how the framework enables real world research.

55
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.730 
for example and use case three we describe how the functionalities of access

56
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.040 
which is an existing system for generating and experimenting

57
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.070 
with learner source explanations can be re-implemented and

58
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.590 
extended using our framework to understand what can be achieved

59
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.230 
with the framework. let's consider the following usage scenario,

60
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.170 
if an online method structure on x wishes to identify the best

61
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.980 
way to explain the concept of standard deviation to students.

62
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.460 
she can have a euclid implemented which delivers an explanation

63
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.490 
of standard deviation on a particular lesson page.

64
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.190 
the motivation for the instructor to use the mcla

65
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.690 
is that she anticipates that future research could be conducted

66
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.050 
to improve the explanation although there is not yet a formulated

67
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.610 
plan for what ideas to test and in its current form the euclid

68
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.110 
simply delivers. the single original explanation

69
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.250 
the framework leaves the door open for future improvement

70
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.850 
steen's questions and comments on the discussion forum later

71
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.360 
suggest an alternative explanation for standard deviation.

72
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.870 
this is added to the euclid version set and the probability

73
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.710 
of assigning the two explanations is manually set to ninety

74
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.370 
percent original and ten percent new at first perhaps out of caution.

75
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.970 
but with no red flags raised it is later changed to fifty percent

76
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.410 
original and fifty percent new.

77
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.970 
the instructor collaborates with the researcher to evaluate the two explanations

78
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.890 
using quantitative metrics such as ratings of explanations

79
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.450 
and accuracy in solving related quiz questions as well as qualitative

80
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.470 
feedback, such as students' comments and questions on the explanations.

81
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.160 
the instructor comes up with a third explanation based on this data.

82
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.090 
and after another experiment with equal probabilities set to

83
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.770 
each of the three explanations decides that it is better than

84
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.890 
the others and adopted for the foreseeable future

85
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.770 
by setting the probability to zero percent for the first two

86
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.460 
explanations and hundred percent for the third.

87
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.110 
the booklet enables the cycle of iterative experimentation and data-driven improvement

88
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.480 
to be repeated any time in the coming years as new ideas arise

89
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.720 
or data emerges about how to better explain

90
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.590 
them. euclid also enables automation of data driven improvement for example

91
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.150 
logging code can be used to send euclid metrics like student ratings of explanations.

92
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.790 
the next time explanations are proposed to avoid manual analysis the course team

93
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.100 
could use a built in widely used multi-armed bandit algorithm for adaptive experimentation

94
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.370 
to automatically analyze explanation ratings and change the

95
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.030 
experience for future students.
finally the mcat also enables personalization

96
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.860 
as a more diverse range of students take the course survey

97
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.750 
data suggests that changing the vocabulary and examples of an explanation

98
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.380 
could make it more helpful to students from different countries.

99
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.090 
the booklet enables the course team to work with researchers to either

100
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.440 
run an experiment to test the impact of alternative phrasings

101
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.250 
on different subgroups of students or write if-then rules that give certain explanations

102
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.490 
to students from certain countries or apply a range of algorithms

103
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.850 
for personalization and recommendation to optimize delivery

104
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.170 
of different course content based on a more complex learner profile.

105
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.890 
the mcla framework provides an ecosystem that transforms online

106
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.620 
course components into collaborative micro labs where instructors

107
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.730 
experimental researchers and data mining or machine learning researchers

108
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.590 
can engage in perpetual cycles of experimentation improvement and personalization.

109
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.280 
such multidisciplinary collaborations can help improve student outcomes in tandem

110
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.020 
with conducting real world research

111
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.320 
platform. owners and developers can help instructional teams glean insights

112
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.010 
on ways to improve their courses. experimental researchers can

113
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.260 
go from a single experiment to a sequence of iterative studies

114
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.900 
and use data more quickly.

115
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.490 
data mining and machine learning researchers can use mclis

116
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.590 
as a test-bed for applying and evaluating algorithms for adaptive experimentation.

117
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.570 
but the rare capacity to choose actions and get access to outcomes

118
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.740 
and contextual or state data in real time.

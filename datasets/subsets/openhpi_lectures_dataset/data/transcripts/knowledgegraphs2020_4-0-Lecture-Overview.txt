00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.810 
Welcome to knowledge graphs. This is lecture
number four knowledge representation

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.960 
with ontologies. As always we
start with a lecture overview.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.670 
Ontologies are knowledge representations
and to get to learn ontologies

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.190 
better we start with a brief historical
introduction of ontologies.

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.090 
And you will see that it is important
that ontologies are based

6
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.930 
on logic. This is we motivate
why we do need logic.

7
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.130 
We we are aware that probably you
are not really let's say familiar

8
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.170 
with mathematical logic so therefore
we have included two excursions

9
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.010 
that at least provide you a brief
overview with a brief recap

10
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.350 
of essential logics. This will be
propositional logic and first

11
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.570 
order logic, and then you will see
that these two basic logics

12
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.440 
that you probably already
know from school

13
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.740 
are not really sufficient or well suited
for knowledge representation. Therefore

14
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.580 
we introduce you to
description logics.

15
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.810 
And then we will see how can we
express description logics

16
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.240 
with the help of web ontology
language and then we will go

17
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.230 
a bit more deeper into the
web ontology language.

18
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.300 
And then finally again in the next
lecture you will see a bit more on OWL

19
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.290 
and then we
move forward.

20
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.340 
And in the end of course you want
to design your own ontology

21
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.760 
and we will give you an introduction
into methodologies on how to design

22
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.490 
ontologies. Ok so far so good. So
let's start now with a brief

23
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.180 
history of ontologies.

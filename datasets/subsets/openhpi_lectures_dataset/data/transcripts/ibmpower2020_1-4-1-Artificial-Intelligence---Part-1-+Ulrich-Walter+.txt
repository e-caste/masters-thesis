1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.100 
Good morning. My name is Ulrich
Walter from IBM in Germany.

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.950 
I'm in business development of
artificial intelligence and analytics

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.930 
on our IBM power systems. In my second
job I'm also senior IT architect

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.700 
and I have a heritage of
about thirty five years on the

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.170 
usage and development of AI systems
and analytic systems in general.

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.370 
So what the new hype about AI will be? In
the next twenty minutes we will discuss

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.030 
the opportunities we see today on AI
what can be achieved with AI

8
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.070 
and also of course the other
technical limitations and the

9
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
possibilities what we
can see in our economy.

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.170 
In the second part of our
presentation, we then will move on

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.250 
and discuss about the technology
that's necessary to build

12
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.550 
up an AI system and also of course
a software stack and some

13
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.070 
of the challenges we see in
questions of life-cycle management,

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.130 
orchestration and other aspects of the
usage of artificial intelligence.

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.030 
So let me start first about what
is actually the impact on

16
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.710 
the economy from our data to knowledge
and from knowledge to action.

17
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.390 
First of all, we are now running
into a new era of computing.

18
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.410 
If you're looking back in history,
actually when we started

19
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.460 
with client servers back in the ninety
nineties over the world wide web,

20
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.100 
we are now in a situation what we
are calling the cognitive era.

21
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.660 
In the cognitive era we are
talking about the implementation

22
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.470 
and usage of artificial intelligence,
augmented reality and

23
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.770 
of course of autonomous systems, systems
that make decisions on their own

24
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.440 
based on data, immense numbers of data.
And what that means for the technology

25
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.040 
we will also see then in our
second part of the presentation.

26
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.060 
Building up an AI system is
very much of importance for

27
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.060 
the economy, but not just only for
enterprises, but also in public sector

28
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.050 
every area of our daily life will
be affected by the

29
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.070 
usage of artificial intelligence
and will be influenced by

30
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.350 
the usage of analytics in our data,
which is driven by our economy,

31
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.670 
and of course last not least by
ourselves as users and of course

32
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.170 
data providers for
all that endeavours.

33
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.090 
It means digitalisation is one
of the aspects of our road-map

34
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.220 
towards digital rejuvenating of
enterprises in general. So that means

35
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.140 
without digitalisation, we cannot
make a difference in our business,

36
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.730 
we cannot actually transform
ourselves or transform enterprises

37
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.450 
in new areas where they
haven't been before.

38
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.720 
If you take a look in the new
start-ups what has happened in

39
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.500 
the last couple of years you
will see a couple of companies

40
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.300 
we probably haven't seen ten
years before. So for example

41
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.700 
the world's largest transportation
company they don't have any

42
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.990 
cars, which is Uber. The world's largest media
company that doesn't create any content

43
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.720 
is Facebook. The world's most valuable
retailer has no inventory at all,

44
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.480 
Ali Baba and the world's largest accommodations
provider owns no real estate,

45
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.210 
this is our AirBnB.

46
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.380 
And last but not least the world's
largest teleconferencing company

47
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.570 
they have no telco
infrastructure at all, that all the

48
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.290 
space because on communities, on
data and of course of the usage

49
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.380 
of technologies that have not
been available many years ago.

50
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.120 
And most of that stuff is driven
definitely by artificial intelligence.

51
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.180 
Today of course we are
also in many areas

52
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.680 
driving AI in large numbers and
especially in Germany and in

53
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.500 
Europe a very important part of
that endeavor is the usage

54
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.490 
of artificial intelligence in autonomous
driving and the development

55
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.020 
of autonomous systems in industry.
This is really something

56
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.080 
of course what we can see where
the future is heading to and

57
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.100 
there are new jobs created,
there are a number of

58
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.450 
new possibilities to be created
here in questions of developers,

59
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.370 
but also in questions of users
and also new opportunities for

60
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.700 
enterprises to come.

61
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.420 
Also smaller companies like
vendors who haven't been part

62
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.350 
of that endeavor before are
becoming now software providers.

63
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
They are maybe building up their
own software stack because

64
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.760 
they understand that software is
changing the world and artificial

65
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.070 
intelligence and the analytical
capabilities are part of that game.

66
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.760 
So this is a very important to
understand that this is actually

67
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.080 
a game changer, a disruptor in
the technology but also in the

68
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.210 
way how we provide systems to
our end users and customers.

69
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.630 
That means also for the economy
new jobs will be created, new

70
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.040 
profiles will be created, new
partners will be created, of course

71
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.430 
new platforms will actually work
together in automotive, in industry,

72
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.800 
in pharmacy, in public sector. So they're
building new platforms of previous competitors

73
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.370 
will become platform providers
because of the experience of data

74
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.750 
and the integration of that in
question of the usage of the data

75
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.340 
for their business processes. That
means also the need of having

76
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.830 
such technologies for doing that
is dramatically high. That means

77
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.750 
new technologies enable especially
such developments here and

78
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.170 
therefore of course technology
plays a major part.

79
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.960 
Maybe at that point in our presentation
I would make a statement that means

80
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.350 
there is no artificial intelligence
without infrastructure

81
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.040 
architecture. That means
no AI without IA.

82
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.220 
In Germany alone, we expect to have
our GDP in the year twenty-thirty

83
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.380 
increased by, let's say, one hundred
and sixty billion euros alone.

84
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.960 
The accuracy is because of our higher
performance in our systems

85
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.340 
is going down below five percent.
So we are better with artificial

86
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.120 
intelligence today than they have
actually humans can be. For

87
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.820 
example when you do an
image recognition or so.

88
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.430 
Autonomous cars as I said before
are tremendous driver for

89
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.210 
that business and we expect to
see about forty eight million

90
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.880 
of those until the year
twenty thirty five.

91
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.080 
And about seventy five percent
of the people in Europe see

92
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.790 
AI as a positive thing. It's not
always a disruptor but

93
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.900 
it's also a positive technology
that can help everyone and enable

94
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.010 
new possibilities for
their daily life.

95
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.480 
In questions of jobs, I think this is
also very important to understand

96
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.460 
there's a new race and a new
kind of jobs coming out. So for

97
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.300 
example a data scientist and
data analytics specialists,, they

98
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.850 
are of high demand especially in
combination with industry skill,

99
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.210 
with industrial knowledge, on the
individual sector, in banking

100
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.140 
and finance but also in automotive
definitely. So therefore

101
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.120 
this is definitely something I can
underline where the development

102
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.770 
is going to and by building up
an AI system we always have

103
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.170 
to consider, we need a lot of
data scientists in that field

104
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.950 
in order to drive the development
of applications but on the

105
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.570 
overall data pipeline and
the integration processes.

106
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.330 
There are new job roles to be
created. As I said before in each

107
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.330 
phase of our data pipeline,, we
have the data collection the

108
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.460 
analytics and the data engineering
part. We will see new jobs

109
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:09.020 
to arise here in that case like data engineers,
experts, data scientists, content specialists.

110
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.520 
On the other side we have the teams
who are building and training

111
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.590 
the systems like the AI software
developers, the hardware developers,

112
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.970 
using FPGAs, using GPUs in the service
but a lot of other people

113
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.210 
actually have to integrate it, make
life-cycle management complete

114
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.760 
like in a traditional way. So there
is a bunch of new opportunities

115
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.510 
for jobs to be created and people who
are very willing to understand that

116
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:41.250 
can definitely find a great
place to work in that area.

117
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.420 
So if I compare the timeline of
AI development in what we are

118
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.240 
today and what has been in the
past. In the past actually there

119
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.470 
was a very narrow AI as we call it.
So that means we could actually

120
00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:01.210 
just do a very simple task
with the system what we called

121
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.070 
an AI system. And to be honest I
wouldn't even given that an

122
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.970 
AI system it was just built on
purpose system for a simple use case.

123
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.200 
Today we are a little better now.
We can do more things at once

124
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.740 
with the system but I'm still not
sure if it's really an AI system

125
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.910 
which means an intelligence
system or if it's more or less

126
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.500 
a train system for some special purpose
but of course with other possibilities.

127
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.300 
On the right hand side what we

128
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.260 
see in the future, we talk about
the general AI and this

129
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.220 
general AI will be definitely
a revolutionary thing to come

130
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.360 
but this is something what we
are talking about the timeline

131
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.080 
of two thousand and fifty and beyond.
That means we have a combination

132
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:53.240 
of systems that can recognize
speech, text, video, audio and like

133
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.380 
a human being can do understand
actually everything and can

134
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:03.900 
reason and conclude on that endeavours
and in such events.

135
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.850 
And this is of course something
we can see that this will take

136
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.680 
a long long time to happen until
we are here and that area.

137
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:19.000 
Some use cases that work today and most
of you have probably seen that before

138
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.500 
we can do the language translation,
you can do it on google,

139
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.150 
you can do it everywhere. So that
shouldn't be a big deal on that.

140
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.020 
Speech transcription where you
actually can speak to the system

141
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.010 
and and the outcome could be in
another language or maybe even

142
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.360 
in a written form, we have language
understanding that's happening

143
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.450 
today, we have object detection
today but also face recognition.

144
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.440 
These are simple things that work
today or machine reasoning

145
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.600 
for example for predictive maintenance. These
are some of the solutions

146
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.880 
that are more or less become very
common thing in the industry

147
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.230 
and can be utilized quite easily
and implemented quite easily.

148
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.870 
Okay, in our second part then we will
talk about power 9 technology

149
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.480 
and what's actually the technical
enablers for that particular part to come.

150
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.200 
So with that I close our part one
and thank you for attention.

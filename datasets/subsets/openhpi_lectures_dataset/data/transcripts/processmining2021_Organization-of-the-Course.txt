00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.610 
Hello and welcome to this video. In
this video I will briefly explain

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.490 
some organizational aspects of our course "Step-
by-step Introduction to Process Mining".

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.130 
My name is Simon Remy and I'm part
of the teaching team.

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.220 
The course material primarily consists
of our lecture videos. Those

5
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.300 
short video clips are about ten
to fifteen minutes long and

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.270 
for each video, we will also
provide you the lecture slides.

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.980 
You will find them below the
video and you can download them.

8
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.380 
For some videos, we will also provide
additional reading material

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.650 
which we will link either in the
lecture slides or at additional

10
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.630 
learning material
for that week.

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.850 
Besides the videos, the course will also
include self tests and homework assignments.

12
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.590 
Self tests are
primarily for you

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.800 
to check your learning progress.
They are not graded and you

14
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.810 
can retake them as many
times as you wish.

15
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.330 
However, homework
assignments are graded

16
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.210 
and you cannot retake them again.
So once you submitted them,

17
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.810 
no changes are possible.

18
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.410 
Also, once you started to work
on a homework assignment, you

19
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.660 
only have sixty minutes
to complete them.

20
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.570 
Once the course is over

21
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.550 
and you at least visited fifty
percent of the course material,

22
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.710 
you are qualified for a
Confirmation of Participation.

23
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.820 
If you in addition also at least
reached fifty percent of the

24
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.250 
overall score from the homework
assignments, you can obtain

25
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.590 
a Record of Achievement.

26
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.460 
Such a record is also on the
slides, as you can see here, and

27
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.740 
it includes your name, your email
address, the title of the course

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.370 
and the points you achieved. If you would
like more information on those records,

29
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.950 
you can visit our web
page at openHPI.

30
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.100 
In order to get in touch with
you during the course and

31
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.010 
for you to enable discussions
with your peers, we will also

32
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.250 
have a discussion forum.

33
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.360 
You can use this forum, as I said,
to discuss topics of our course

34
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.040 
but also to ask
questions

35
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.130 
or to provide feedback to
us, the teaching team.

36
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.390 
But please keep in mind to always be respectful
to your fellow course participants

37
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.540 
and to the teaching
team, of course.

38
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.650 
However, there's also a second
opportunity to get in touch with

39
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.610 
us in case you need help.
This is the Helpdesk.

40
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.550 
The Helpdesk is located on your
right side of the browser

41
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.180 
and you can use it in case you
have either technical questions

42
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.140 
or course specific
questions.

43
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.920 
Technical questions, for example,
can be related to your log

44
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.160 
in or the registration or any
other technical issue, like, for

45
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.900 
example, submitting
your homework.

46
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.730 
Course specific questions are, on
the other side, directly sent

47
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.190 
to us, the teaching team.

48
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.920 
If you now participate in our course,
you are requested to follow

49
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.210 
the Honor Code of
openHPI.

50
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.180 
That includes that you are requested
to not share your access to open

51
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.740 
HPI with another person and to
work on your homework assignment

52
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.440 
without the help
of others.

53
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.270 
Also, you must not publish or use course
materials without written

54
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.780 
permission by
the authors.

55
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.830 
Also, you must not make solutions of
the homework available, in any way,

56
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.930 
including the forum or email,
to any other participant.

57
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.780 
And lastly, you are
requested to not publish

58
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.030 
any material, which is unrelated to the
objective of a social learning platform,

59
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.700 
on openHPI. With that said, I will now
briefly walk you through the process

60
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.820 
of a typical week
on openHPI

61
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.690 
and we will start on Wednesday
morning at ten o'clock. And please

62
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.640 
note that all the times are
in Central European Time. So,

63
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.980 
ten o'clock means ten
o'clock here.

64
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.270 
At this point in time, we will
publish the lecture videos, the

65
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.390 
teaching material, the self test
and the homework for the week.

66
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.050 
And at this point, your
personal process starts.

67
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.410 
So, you can start watching the
videos, take the self test and

68
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.560 
eventually work on the
homework assignment.

69
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.380 
However, we recommend not to
start with the homework before

70
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.880 
you completed to watch
all the available material

71
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.590 
because remember, once you started
to work on that, you only

72
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.140 
have sixty minutes
to complete it.

73
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.590 
In any case, the homework must be
completed before Friday 10:00 PM

74
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.650 
of the following week. So, that means,
that you will have nine days

75
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.490 
after the publication to
complete the homework.

76
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.490 
On the next day, so Saturday at
ten o'clock in the morning, we

77
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.010 
then provide the solution
for the homework.

78
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.560 
Now let's take a brief look on
the overview of our course

79
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.970 
and you see that we will start on
May the fifth at ten o'clock

80
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.060 
to publish the material
of the first week.

81
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.110 
From that, as I said before,
you will have nine days to

82
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.400 
watch all the videos and
complete the homework.

83
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.720 
However, before, on May the twelfth
we will publish the material

84
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.500 
of the second week and

85
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.190 
from that again, you will have nine days
in order to complete the homework.

86
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.390 
With that, I would like to thank
you and also in the name of

87
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.450 
the teaching team, for joining us and
we are glad to have you on board

88
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.080 
and we wish you a great
learning experience.

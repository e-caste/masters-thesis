1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.810 
Now let's have a look to the
different types of attackers

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.260 
and their motives.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.100 
The reason is if one has an
idea about the profile

4
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.960 
of potential attackers
on the internet and

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.630 
their motives, this helps to secure
internet based computer systems.

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.430 
It helps to concentrate on what
could be particularly interesting

7
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.650 
to attack, for that type of
attackers,
8
00:00:30.650 --&gt; 00:00:36.040
and to design
the security system in

9
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.280 
a way to prevent such attacks.
It's important to mention that

10
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.480 
there are many different
groups of cybercriminals

11
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.030 
with very different
motivations.

12
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.940 
We have insiders, company employees
that want to see more details

13
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.860 
about the business strategy
about personal data of

14
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.380 
other people. They
are script kiddies,

15
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.410 
they are so called underground
hackers and crackers,

16
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.740 
also computer specialist work
as computer criminals.

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.420 
Common criminals for example
blackmailers, drug mafia,

18
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.030 
terrorists use internet
for their purposes

19
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.800 
and of course industrial
intelligence spies.

20
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780 
Let's look to each of this group and
let's start with the insiders,

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.160 
the company employees. Much of
the abuse of computer system

22
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.000 
is proved to be caused by
companies own employees, not by

23
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.400 
hackers coming from the outside
but people that are inside

24
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.790 
the company. And what is the motive?
In addition to the incompetence

25
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.550 
and negligence also perceived bad
treatment, frustration, mischief,

26
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.950 
revenge, all this plays a role
that people try to get access

27
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.950 
to some information in the
system. Often it is naivety

28
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.130 
and carelessness,
for example

29
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's attacks like social hacking
are successful that anyone

30
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.810 
came and say I'm a service personnel
please give me your password

31
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.860 
I have to take care about your system
so the people are not thinking

32
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.280 
and give their password
which later on is misused.

33
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.170 
The internet attacks all what's
possible in the internet

34
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.150 
can also be done within an
intranet, so also techniques all

35
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.520 
the exploits can be applied,
internal people know exactly what

36
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.570 
kind of systems are
run in the intranet.

37
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.740 
So they know what kind of
vulnerabilities, what kind of exploits

38
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.300 
they may use to
get success.

39
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.230 
New threats to integration of
home office and mobile devices

40
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.420 
bring your own device into
the cooperate network

41
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.070 
calls a lot of possibilities
to get access

42
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.740 
to something the people
should not get access.

43
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.120 
Then non compliance with
internal safety instruction

44
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.390 
also leads to complicity that
often no clear regulations

45
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.400 
are given how to use the system,
what is a load, what's forbidden.

46
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.680 
Later on if there is a discussion
about whether it's punishble

47
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.140 
or not such regulations
are important.

48
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.650 
Another group of attackers
also kids script kiddies.

49
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.850 
These are attackers
without deeper knowledge

50
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.610 
and typically this is a
number of school kids

51
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.230 
without deep knowledge,
people that

52
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.970 
try to use the hacking tools that
are available over the internet.

53
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.940 
So the largest number of such
infiltration attempts are carried

54
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.360 
out by this group of hackers.
So they take a tool

55
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.610 
from the internet and
they play with a tool,

56
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.040 
even if they do not correctly
understand what the tool

57
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.340 
is doing, the tool does for
example an automatic analysis

58
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.520 
of access point and otthers
so it has influence on the

59
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.400 
system and sometimes it
helps also to break in.

60
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.310 
Here the motivations
of script kiddies

61
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.560 
is the combination
of curiosity,

62
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.050 
play instinct, self assessment.
In the majority the attacks

63
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.410 
are harmless and without
direct criminal intent

64
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.380 
but they can cause a lot of
damage because the tools become

65
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.990 
more and more powerful
this people are using.

66
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.290 
So the attackers in this category
are usually younger pupils,

67
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.000 
students that is the reason
that are one speaks

68
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.410 
from kiddies. Many hacker tools
are available for download in

69
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.070 
the internet but often can
not be used effectively

70
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.260 
without some basic knowledge.
Here it's a play around with

71
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.940 
such tools but sometimes
a real attack

72
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.670 
is done, for example such a
denial of service attacks

73
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.630 
where with these powerful hacker tools
the correct work of the system

74
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.010 
is negatively affected.
The group of hackers

75
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.440 
these are another group
of cybercriminals

76
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.590 
which typically are
non-commercial oriented.

77
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.180 
The non commercial elite
of the hacker community

78
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.240 
early this movement originally
started in the

79
00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.040 
U.S. with a phone
freaks movement

80
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.090 
in the late sixties,
it was a movement

81
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.320 
to use telecommunication
connections for free.

82
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.950 
In Germany the most well
known is the CCC the chaos

83
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.060 
computer club in Hamburg,
it's an organization

84
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.100 
there are also other
hacker organizations

85
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.890 
use bulletin boards, forums,
hacker journals, conventions

86
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.530 
to exchange information
for example about

87
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
vulnerabilities, to exchange
exploits and others.

88
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:44.010 
Most often this
communication is hidden

89
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.900 
as an insider communication. So
only insiders are available

90
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.030 
to get access to this. For example
the information exchange is

91
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.920 
organized about information
exchange about the

92
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.930 
vulnerabilities, about different
security gaps in key

93
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.580 
IT systems so that the hackers
exchange their knowledge

94
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.310 
to be able to
attack systems

95
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.480 
by for example misusing
such vulnerabilities.

96
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.980 
They develop, they
understand the

97
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.530 
vulnerabilities and are able
are knowledged enough

98
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.300 
to develop such exploits and
they exchange such exploits

99
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.290 
by means these vulnerabilities
later can be

100
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.840 
misused. The hackers are
interested to detect

101
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.350 
gaps in data protection and
mechanisms for the protection of

102
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.790 
sensitive information in
companies but often also

103
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.960 
for governments so they
look in the government

104
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.690 
IT systems to
find out some

105
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.260 
things they later
on make public.

106
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.780 
Another group are the professional
hackers and computer

107
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.940 
criminals, here the combination
of the internet and the

108
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.080 
evolving market of contract
attacks and data theft,

109
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.390 
these are the people you can
ask to do an attack for you.

110
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.430 
So they can be all ordered
like a service - a

111
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:32.760 
criminal service and they perform
attacks as the customer

112
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.760 
wants. So this type attracts
criminals of all kind

113
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.920 
here to work. So professional
data theives are

114
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.330 
from the hackers scene
former intelligence staff

115
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.590 
computer specialist they do this
work this hacking work for

116
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:58.930 
money or other advantages. They
execute special tasks for

117
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.640 
example to steal
the data

118
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.870 
from industrial development
perform, industrial espionage

119
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.720 
intelligence, burglary in highly
secure IT systems, they

120
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.900 
perform denial of service
attacks, targetting attacks

121
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.200 
on networks of special
companies or systems

122
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.400 
they developed worms and
viruses and other malware

123
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.860 
but the motivation
is to earn money

124
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.390 
to press money out it. Indeed
there is a black market for

125
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.130 
contract criminal
for stolen data

126
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.630 
this market is growing, information
for example for unknown

127
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.390 
vulnerabilities is treated
for tens of thousand euros,

128
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:57.680 
you remember these are the
Zero days, they are sold so

129
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.570 
that another can misuse this
and they design exploits

130
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.980 
and viruses and
typically

131
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.690 
using and hiding themselves
in the darknet.

132
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.380 
Another group of cybercriminals
are common criminals

133
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.090 
and they use the internet
because it's much more

134
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.030 
simple to get access
to perform a message

135
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.270 
exchange, to prepare a
criminal activities.

136
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.030 
So particularly organized
crime, drugs,

137
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.220 
prostitution they more and
more use internet for

138
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.700 
organizing and performing
their criminal activities.

139
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.360 
So they use internet for all types
of computer crime, particularly

140
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.550 
for attacks againstfinancial
and purchasing systems

141
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.330 
the abuse of leaked
identity data and others.

142
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.940 
But unlike in real
life, authorities are

143
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.170 
often still not able
and often are

144
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.410 
inadequately equipped to pursue
criminals on the internet.

145
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.060 
So for the criminals this
becomes less dangerous

146
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.910 
to perform criminal activities
then in the real life.

147
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.390 
Criminals move their communication,
prove their criminal

148
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.690 
activities as far as
possible to the internet.

149
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.750 
There is also an interest of
state security authorities,

150
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:40.290 
for example in Germany like
BND or U.S. CIA or NSA

151
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.700 
for back doors for cryptographically
protected systems

152
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:51.110 
because if data are encrypted
it's very difficult, very very

153
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.850 
time consuming to decrypt
and if it's strong

154
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.210 
algorithms used cryptographic
algorithms are used that would

155
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.530 
cost hundreds of years. What they
are interested to see whether

156
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.530 
criminals use such encryption
to hide their criminal

157
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:14.670 
messaging and message exchange,
so as the authorities

158
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:19.050 
asked for such back doors
to have a possibility

159
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:24.520 
to see what the
encrypted

160
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:32.420 
information means to secure
the publicity, to prevent

161
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:38.180 
attacks. Speaking about such a
type of attacks terrorists are

162
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.440 
a new group which use internet
for their activities.

163
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.610 
So the enormous increase in the use
of the internet by terrorists

164
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.390 
has different purposes

165
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.970 
and they use it for
different activities,

166
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.440 
for example they spread
propaganda, they use internet to

167
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:03.890 
spread propaganda.
They provide

168
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.230 
possibilities to collect
money, to recruit people, to

169
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.380 
maintaining networks for their
terroristic activities.

170
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:21.980 
So also the communication to prepare
an attack the coordination

171
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.110 
of such terroristic attacks
is more and more done

172
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:33.360 
via the internet. Terrorists use
the internet for dissemination

173
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.130 
of propaganda videos, websites
for example youtube videos

174
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:44.050 
beheaded or hostages
of the Islamic state,

175
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.980 
building instructions how
to create bombs or other

176
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.000 
terroristic tools, the

177
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.510 
road and building plans
for attack planning

178
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.140 
and others. This is also a group
with very special interest

179
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.190 
that we have to consider
if we consider

180
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.890 
a criminal activities in the internet.
And last but not least industrial

181
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:15.170 
intelligence spies. The internet
offers a wide range of opportunities

182
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.650 
for industrial intelligence
services espionage,

183
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.820 
so for example the theft of secret
information from competitors

184
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.450 
or from other countries,
for example PRISM

185
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.400 
is a screening program from U.S. to
detect such things, in Germany

186
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.010 
there is the xkeyscore
screening program

187
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.600 
to find out to collect
such information.

188
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.690 
Political or economically
motivated attacks on services

189
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:52.760 
and IT systems are run
against competitors,

190
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.610 
against business units against
organizations but also

191
00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:04.290 
against states, for example
stuxnet was such an attack.

192
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.530 
It was a malware which attacked
window networks as well as

193
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.350 
proprietary programmable systems
from industrial installations

194
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.070 
and the goal was the
destruction of the

195
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.750 
Iranian uranium
enrichment plant

196
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:28.870 
to prevent such
Iranians to

197
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:34.260 
get an atom bomb. This
was a successful attack

198
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.480 
which was discussed very
widely and by the way

199
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.130 
for that type of attacks
some Zero days

200
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:49.640 
were used to attack
the systems

201
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.360 
in Iran successfully
and to prevent

202
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.000 
the continuation of the
development of an atom bomb.

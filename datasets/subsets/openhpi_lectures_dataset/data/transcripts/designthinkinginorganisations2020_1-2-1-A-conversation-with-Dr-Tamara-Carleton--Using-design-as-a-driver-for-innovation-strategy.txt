00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.490 
Hello everyone good evening to our speaker
series on mastering design thinking

2
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.240 
and my name is Falk. I'm the main
moderator of tonight and attending

3
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.470 
with
my fellow attendee.

4
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.730 
Hello and welcome. So today's
topic is on design as a driver

5
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.840 
for innovation strategy and it's my
pleasure to welcome Tamara  Carleton.

6
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.520 
and Tamara I know since quite a bit,
since more than ten years time

7
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.210 
and Tamara is a graduate
and phd student from Stanford

8
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.470 
University. She graduated in
two thousand and ten in the

9
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.490 
field of mechanic engineering
cross design but just to drop

10
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.970 
some names she has been an adjunct
professor for American university,

11
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.660 
she has been a visiting professor at
the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland,

12
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.240 
she has been teaching across Asia
in a lot of different countries

13
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.210 
and last but not least she is also
a founder of her own company.

14
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.700 
She is CEOand founder of
Innovation Leadership Group.

15
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.850 
Thank you and I would add one note
that Falk and I had initially

16
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.530 
met through channels of Stanford
University and then the Swiss

17
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.940 
Innovation and Design Ecosystem
and so I keep toe

18
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.190 
at Stanford involved with the
design community there and then

19
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.290 
working with a number of different
groups worldwide around

20
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.250 
the intersection of design and
innovation. So Falk knows I have

21
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.000 
that messy perspective
between these phases.

22
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.590 
Tamara, so maybe let's start
smoothly with base

23
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.130 
definitions because I think a
lot of participants do not

24
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.090 
know exactly what it is innovation
strategy and what has design

25
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.150 
to do with it. So what is
your interpretation of it?

26
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.050 
Let's start with the
easy questions.

27
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.620 
So I may have a different perspective
from a number of the other

28
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.450 
speakers and experts you talk
with. So my view of innovation

29
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.720 
is very broad and essentially I
describe this as the process from

30
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
concept to commercialization and that's
particularly in a corporate context

31
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.800 
which means how do you
go from a new idea,

32
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.220 
and that's typically understood
as having an aspect

33
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.250 
of novelty or originality and then
how do you bring it to impact,

34
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.400 
and in the space of companies this
translates into return on investments or

35
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.990 
more sales or ownership of a
particular product category. Now

36
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.470 
this has been expanded in recent times
where it's not just a measure of

37
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.990 
market adoption, but you could have
social innovation, you could

38
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.650 
have community change; all of
these help to show the bigger

39
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.980 
an aspect of impact. Now design
to me is a important part

40
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.150 
of how innovation works and how you
can lead and define the process.

41
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.190 
And so for me design is really
bringing in the user perspective

42
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.530 
and often design looks much more
at near term impact. What are

43
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.440 
the pain points or the opportunities and
needs that our users and customers have?

44
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.520 
How do we understand them in
context and what can we do to

45
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.110 
better make sure their experience,
their voice is incorporated

46
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.460 
into the broader process? And so you
think about innovation addresses,

47
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.350 
questions around business value, right, the
business value proposition, the finance model,

48
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.010 
often the internal alignment,
how do you make this happen,

49
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.950 
design then says okay what do we
understand in terms of what this

50
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.230 
experience could be and it goes beyond,
I think, how people think of design is

51
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.070 
form and function. Design is really about
that creative process of problem solving

52
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.870 
and making sure that when you go
through the process to prototype

53
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.120 
and test an idea, that at the end
of the day, you're really serving

54
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.840 
what the human or
the user needs.

55
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.380 
And so for me you can have
innovation without design but it

56
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.610 
doesn't mean that you're truly addressing
the the real heart of the problem,

57
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.720 
but that design has to sit in this bigger
ecosystem of innovation activity

58
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.430 
because that's how a company
understands how do you manufactur,

59
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.960 
how do you handle quality service, how do sell this
and get into the hands of the customer

60
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.840 
and design provides that last
sizzle and aspect of substance.

61
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.780 
I mean you just said design is on one hand
leading the process and then defining.

62
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.050 
So when it comes
to leading

63
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.790 
what do you say is required from
the management, I expect the

64
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.010 
management is involved in the
strategy making process, right?

65
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.530 
What is required to really
adopt this design philosophy? Is

66
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.880 
it is something that everyone
can do? Is it, can it be trained or

67
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.780 
is it a magic ingredient
that you somehow have to have?

68
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.350 
I would say that you
can learn design

69
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.720 
and some people will be more open
and able to adopt the design

70
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.390 
principles and tools
faster than others, and

71
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.150 
this goes to any type of
human learning curve around

72
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.660 
how you learn something new and
truly integrate and apply

73
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.510 
it into your work in life. I think a
challenge and companies and particularly

74
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.850 
bigger companies is that design
teams don't typically have

75
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.730 
a seat at the table, at the
decision-making table and this often

76
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:38.300 
has to do with an understanding of
the importance of what is design

77
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.790 
and how can this
fit into a

78
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.850 
classic set of processes
that a company gets, from

79
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.880 
what a CFO does or the
marketing officer brings and so

80
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.420 
what I found is you have some very
forward looking companies such as SAP

81
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.400 
where design has been really
integrated into the leadership team

82
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.080 
and how they think about what
design means alongside a number

83
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.630 
of other very important processes, and then
for other companies that are understanding

84
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.840 
what this means. So I've done a fair
amount of work with corporations

85
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.690 
like airbus group and volvo group
where design is still emerging

86
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.490 
into what I would consider the
leadership model and dialogue

87
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.460 
and this is where
you have more

88
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.230 
open leaders who say I don't
know everything about design,

89
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.490 
I'm not a design professional
but I'm going to include this

90
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.190 
as one of the key considerations
that we need to think about now.

91
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.780 
Or I will have a senior member of
my team champion with design is

92
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.690 
and help remind me at key points
we need to bring this to the

93
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:56.100 
agenda or this has to be something
that influences our next set of

94
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.510 
decisions or this is a key project
criteria that allows us to

95
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.640 
decide whether or
not we go or no go.

96
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.790 
But this becomes a fundamental part
of how we think about what's

97
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.510 
important and those are the
baby steps that you take

98
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.280 
ultimately allow
design to be a key

99
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.900 
component of a bigger set of decisions.
Tamara I have seen some stories of

100
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.640 
companies trying different ways of having
a more fundamental role in design in the company.

101
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.550 
So I have heard some stories, so
bottom up. So they believe

102
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.470 
team members they start to organize
themselves for design to

103
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.780 
have this most prominent strategy
within the company but sometimes

104
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.740 
they don't have management support
for example and that the

105
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.220 
others always have heard that there
are some companies with managements pushing

106
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.000 
in the direction more like top down
and that team members believe

107
00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.220 
they are a little bit hesitant, they
are still not have you ever

108
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.010 
come across either of the
situation and if so what would

109
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.630 
be your recommendation
in this case?

110
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.330 
That's a great question and I don't
think there's one easy formula

111
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.640 
and in fact from my experience
it's often a combination of

112
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.570 
what you would say is top down and
bottom up to really embed a design

113
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.930 
vocabulary and understanding and then
all the tools and methods to help

114
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.080 
embed this type of thinking
into the company's DNA.

115
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.680 
So few years ago I had worked with
Samsung. So this is a Korea based

116
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.470 
manufacturer of consumer electronics
but a lot of other appliances

117
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.950 
and products in the market and Samsung
has this history of being very much

118
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.330 
Korean

119
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.850 
dominated engineering
lead culture

120
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.870 
and I was quite impressed because
design has been an important part of

121
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.700 
how the company thinks about how
their products feel, but they

122
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.680 
don't always start with the customer
needs first and so Samsung had formed a

123
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:17.700 
customer experience advisory board.
They invited four experts worldwide

124
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:24.420 
and somehow to my fortune my name
got thrown into the ring and so

125
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.220 
we were part of this
advisory team who

126
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.780 
flew to Korea two or three
times but then also advised the

127
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.310 
different teams in our respective
countries. So there is a Samsung

128
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.110 
team that's in Silicon
Valley that I spoke with

129
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.400 
and part of what we
needed to do was help

130
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:54.950 
remind Samsung teams about the
customer viewpoint and then emphasize

131
00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.760 
the experience aspect to balance the views
that they were having internally around

132
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.350 
product and engineering
and manufacturing.

133
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.470 
But then also to bring in what I consider
more of the international perspective

134
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.720 
because we had one
gentleman who

135
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.400 
brought in a viewpoint across
the UK and Norway and then we

136
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.560 
had another American who was part of a
major design trade association in the US

137
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:30.350 
and so, you know, now he spoke
to a lot of those viewpoints

138
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.190 
of design agencies and design
firms and freelancers and then

139
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:41.560 
I had the voice of very much mixing
Silicon Valley views on what's design

140
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.740 
and Falk I see you have the Spacex
company logo across your chest,

141
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:53.290 
but then also a design from the
innovation perspective and

142
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.090 
all of this came together

143
00:11:55.730 --> 00:12:01.010 
it was still a challenge for the teams
at Samsung because many of the RnD

144
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.430 
teams were used to thinking
first designing for themselves

145
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.350 
which is a very common default when
you start a new problem to say okay,

146
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.700 
we have, you know, these flat
panel TVs or we have

147
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.720 
so this is still not a new idea but
what's the future of the home kitchen,

148
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.320 
and how do we integrate all of these
appliances for the modern family

149
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.130 
and as the Koreans would think
about it all the appliances

150
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.520 
would talk to each other and you'd
have the internet of things,

151
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.030 
network underpinning and it
would know when your milk or

152
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.930 
eggs are out and immediately
connect to, if it's not Amazon

153
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.890 
in the US, is the equivalent
and you know their country.

154
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.840 
So very interesting is

155
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.720 
what assumptions do we bring and how do
we then allow the teams to know this

156
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.860 
and getting back at your bigger question
is then management to champion this.

157
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.030 
And so we had a few
meetings with

158
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:08.060 
what I would consider near senior and
then very senior leadership layers

159
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.480 
to say here's what we're doing and
here are the questions you need to

160
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.480 
think about and then also what do you role
model for the groups you support?

161
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.860 
How do you make sure and support
the work they're doing? How

162
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:29.260 
do you encourage them to actually go bigger?
And ask those deeper questions and sometimes

163
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.970 
to me it's a
little bit about

164
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.580 
not just the design process but
how do you think about design

165
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:40.430 
and how you help prepare leadership teams
to understand how they can support

166
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:47.480 
their employees and groups better to
do that type of design thinking.

167
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:53.350 
Would you also differentiate leaders
and managers in that regard?

168
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:58.510 
Is that the same concept
to you or different ones?

169
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:05.300 
Yes or no and I think this gets to
also how different companies define

170
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.340 
these terms and some of them introduce
a number of multiple artificial

171
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.800 
layers in a hierarchy around
how to think about leadership.

172
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.930 
In my view at the end of the day
each one of us has the potential

173
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:25.010 
to step up our game and to lead
ourselves, the people around

174
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:29.500 
us and to help role-model change.
Now we have to recognize that

175
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.280 
our sphere of influence may not
be as large or as immediate

176
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.820 
as we would like but
I find I talk to

177
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.400 
students are recent graduates at
Stanford or these other universities.

178
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.720 
They plan to change the world
and they haven't even gotten

179
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.960 
to a big company or organization
and then other times I'll talk to

180
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.850 
these veterans of companies.
Actually just a few days ago

181
00:14:54.850 --> 00:15:00.070 
I was talking with a senior strategy
officer, actually he's responsible for

182
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.460 
innovation strategy
at Xerox,

183
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:09.390 
which is a well respected company
that decades ago had introduced

184
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.010 
a number of major changes
as part of their RnD

185
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.690 
arm called XEROX Parc, or
Parc now for short

186
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:23.540 
and they're watching the
world of offices change and

187
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.520 
much of their business relies on people
being in an office, printing paper,

188
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:35.190 
or printing and moving paper for group
events and major conferences and programs.

189
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:41.510 
But we don't have that in pandemic times
now as many companies are working

190
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.820 
at home or sheltering in place.
In fact here is Google that

191
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:51.120 
just announced their employees are going
to work from home, exactly, until next year

192
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.530 
and so talking with the senior
leader at Xerox to say,

193
00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.080 
how are you
handling this and

194
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.140 
you know he is in a major
leadership position, he's been at

195
00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.600 
the company for thirty some
years. I mean imagine

196
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:13.880 
that long tenure but then he also is
cognizant of layers of leaders above him

197
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.260 
and not just senior management
but the board and the leaders

198
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.450 
that Xerox has to then work with
in this broader challenge.

199
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.420 
And so circling back to
your question Falk, and

200
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.330 
sometimes in a company
setting people

201
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.290 
can get caught up with thinking
about the internal definitions

202
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.940 
of leaders and management and what
I like to do is just remind

203
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:46.170 
at the end the day, you all need to
lead together and leadership happens

204
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:52.490 
as more than just one person but often
as a team or as you know coming from

205
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.600 
Stanford and then this has been
a hot term for the last two

206
00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.030 
years as team of teams. How do you do this
as part of a bigger coordinated or

207
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.730 
shared effort to mobilize change?
I think we are now approaching

208
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:10.450 
the end of our conversation. I have
one last question to you Tamara.

209
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:16.870 
What advice would you give to companies
that are now becoming design led?

210
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:22.480 
From a strategic point of view, what
would be your advice to them?

211
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:28.220 
Wow, you have lots of good
tough questions. So

212
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.380 
advice I might offer to

213
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.690 
these leaders and companies who are
trying to be more design lead

214
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.740 
is to keep doing
it. I think one

215
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.900 
important recognition
is that there's no

216
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.010 
obvious or one way to
start. So just start

217
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.290 
and to keep doing this
and as you're doing,

218
00:17:54.250 --> 00:18:02.110 
to be willing to change and revise. One that
of course reflects the design principle

219
00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.500 
to prototype and have these
feedback loops in place,

220
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.660 
but also I think we need
to recognise that

221
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.370 
in the global situation we're
in and knowing how industries

222
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:19.200 
keep changing and overlapping that
you can't just stick with one model.

223
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:25.610 
And so keep trying and once you start
you realise then it's easy to

224
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.340 
get more people involved. And it's
easier, it's not perfect, and

225
00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.750 
again this isn't something that happens
immediately for many of these groups,

226
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.580 
but if you can just start the
ball moving, that often provides

227
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.670 
more momentum and energy for people around
you and then you can keep increasing

228
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:51.200 
the effect of what you're trying
to do and make it a much bigger

229
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.280 
effort and then hopefully then that
creates the impact you're looking for.

230
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.220 
Let's take this -
keep trying it. Tamara,

231
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.740 
thank you very much and I'm
really thankful for having

232
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.320 
you on that call and to all the
participants, I wish you

233
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.360 
good afternoon or evening or a
good morning, wherever you are

234
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.900 
at the moment and however you are listening
to this video cast or podcast.

235
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:26.550 
Thank you and see you as part of the
next series again. Thank you. Thank you.

236
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.870 
Thank you.

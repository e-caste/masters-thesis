00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.250 
Welcome back! As we mentioned
before, re-framing a problem based

2
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.320 
on what we learn in the field is the
beauty of the human-centered approach.

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.730 
To get there, we need to
synthesize our data.

4
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.930 
We learned that data comes in
different shapes and forms:

5
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.470 
A note from an interesting
observation,

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.930 
interview quotes and memos, or
a picture from a surprising

7
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.620 
observation you had in the field.
In synthesis we go through

8
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.790 
the data again and try
to highlight those

9
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.410 
interesting or surprising aspects of it. We like
to call these &amp;quot;Golden Nuggets&amp;quot;.

10
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.730 
Why? Because going through our
qualitative data and identifying

11
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.040 
those inspiring aspects
is kind of like

12
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
digging for something valuable,
like digging for golden nuggets

13
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.190 
in a pot of sand. Once you
identified those surprising

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.990 
or inspiring aspects, or in other
words the golden nuggets,

15
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.860 
it's time to look for the hidden
need or motivation behind them.

16
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
Try to go beyond what people
said or showed to you.

17
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.180 
Try to ask yourself: &amp;quot;Hmm! I
wonder if this means...?&amp;quot;

18
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.890 
Let me give you an example of how
identifying these golden nuggets

19
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.740 
can lead to an innovative
solution in the field of

20
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.940 
banking and finance. We are
going to use a template here

21
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.720 
that you will be working with
in your assignment as well.

22
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.740 
So this is a classic
design thinking case.

23
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.630 
In 2004 the Bank of America was
looking for innovative ways

24
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.710 
to encourage people to open
new savings accounts.

25
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
Instead of thinking about solutions
right away, what they did

26
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.950 
was that they asked the famous
design agency IDEO for help.

27
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.300 
IDEO took a design thinking
approach to solve this problem.

28
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.110 
They started conducting ethnographic
research and learning

29
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.750 
about people's behaviors when it comes to
spending, banking, and saving money.

30
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.490 
So the designers talked
to a lot of people

31
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.530 
on the streets and to a
lot of different groups

32
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.070 
or observed their behaviors at
home. But one group stood out to

33
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.250 
them and was especially inspiring.
And this group was single mothers.

34
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.650 
Because single mothers are
in charge of the finances

35
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.130 
of their family and often they are
on a tight budget. So it's very

36
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.380 
interesting to see their relationship
to saving and spending money.

37
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.320 
You can imagine that the
design team must have had

38
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.870 
many different types of
data at this point.

39
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.870 
Maybe they took pictures of
interesting observations

40
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.900 
they had in the field, maybe they
captured the journey of a single

41
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.280 
user going through his or her
banking or saving process

42
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.580 
or maybe they had a lot
of interview notes and

43
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.460 
quotes from the interviews
they did with people.

44
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.510 
One observation drew their
attention especially or

45
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.840 
in other words they found
their golden nugget.

46
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.490 
This picture shows the household
book of one of the single

47
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.080 
moms that they observed.
Let's call her Linda.

48
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.730 
As you can see Linda noted down all of her
expenses in this handwritten notebook.

49
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.960 
Take a moment to look
at this picture

50
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.380 
and see if something draws
your attention here.

51
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.010 
Look at all those zeros at
the end of each number.

52
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
In many countries including
the United States,

53
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.930 
prices are rarely
rounded up.

54
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.760 
You usually have a couple of cents
at the end, like 10.99 or 4.75.

55
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.270 
Maybe you realized that

56
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.070 
Linda actually rounded all
of these numbers up.

57
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.740 
So the design team might
have asked themselves:

58
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.560 
&amp;quot;Hmm... we wonder if this
means that Linda likes to

59
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.600 
have the surprise or
enjoys a surprise

60
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.230 
of a financial buffer at the
end of each month.&amp;quot;

61
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.060 
Because by rounding up the
expenses, she actually had a few

62
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.930 
extra dollars in her budget at the end of
each month that she didn't plan with.

63
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.740 
So after interpreting
Linda's motivation,

64
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.220 
the design team wanted to open
up the solution space again

65
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.570 
by asking a good &amp;quot;How Might We&amp;quot; question.-
What is a &amp;quot;How Might We&amp;quot; question?

66
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.460 
A &amp;quot;How Might We&amp;quot;
question is a way to

67
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.800 
phrase the new problem statement
and a good way to start a

68
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.820 
brainstorming session. Instead of
asking &amp;quot;How can we encourage

69
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.640 
people to open new savings
accounts?&amp;quot;,

70
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.800 
now we can ask &amp;quot;How might
we help a real new user

71
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930 
with her real need or motivation
that we have discovered?&amp;quot;

72
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.660 
It might sound simple but phrasing a
good &amp;quot;How Might We&amp;quot; question

73
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.630 
is very important. We ask &amp;quot;How
Might We&amp;quot; questions

74
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.140 
because they suggest that there
are many possibilities and

75
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.290 
solutions to the problems we have.
We don't ask how should we

76
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.230 
because it sounds a bit forceful.
Or how could we because then

77
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.930 
it sounds like we are only interested
in things that we actually can do.

78
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.930 
A &amp;quot;How Might We&amp;quot;
question that is well-phrased

79
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.020 
does not suggest a particular
solution but it gives enough

80
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.730 
creative space to come up with
different solutions and ideas.

81
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.370 
We will talk about good and bad &amp;quot;How
Might We&amp;quot; questions more

82
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.680 
in an exercise that we'll
introduce this week.

83
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.380 
So what could have been a good &amp;quot;How
Might We&amp;quot; question for Linda?

84
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.870 
The design team might have gone for:
&amp;quot;How might we help Linda

85
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.240 
to have a surprising financial buffer in
each month, in a seamless way?&amp;quot;

86
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.830 
As you can see we have Linda's
motivation in there.

87
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.380 
We also have an emotional side to it.
But there's no solution in there yet.

88
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.800 
So there's still a lot of space
for ideas to be developed.

89
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.760 
I'm sure you want to know what happened
to the Bank of America case.

90
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.230 
So this inspirational observation
they had led them to

91
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.080 
a very successful solution: the
&amp;quot;Keep the Change&amp;quot; Program.

92
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.090 
So now users could enroll
in a savings account

93
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.360 
that would round up each purchase
they made with their debit card.

94
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.600 
It would then transfer the
amount that was rounded up

95
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.090 
directly to a savings account. So
now you can imagine those people

96
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.550 
who struggled to save money were
saving money automatically

97
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.010 
with each purchase. Even though a little,
but they were saving automatically.

98
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.090 
This was very successful
for Bank of America

99
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.380 
and it drew millions of new
users also for the bank.

100
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.810 
If you want to read more about this
case, visit thisisdesignthinking.net

101
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.700 
We put the link into the
video description.

102
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.050 
So this process of synthesis, digging
through your qualitative data,

103
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.140 
identifying those golden nuggets,
and interpreting the motivation

104
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.570 
and needs behind them, is what
we want you to explore and go

105
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.630 
through as well in the assignment.-
We hope you learned something

106
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.190 
new in this module and hope
to see you in the course.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
Hi guys! We are at MotionLab
in Berlin today,

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
to look at some more advanced
methods of prototyping

3
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.940 
and we are meeting Aravinth,
who will give us a tour.

4
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:32.230 
So my name is Aravinth. I'm an
engineer and artist in background.

5
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.060 
I have been living in Berlin
for more than eight years.

6
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.870 
I have been building
different communities.

7
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.430 
My communities are not only around
technologies, they are also about

8
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.810 
sustainability, education,
art. So furthermore I do a

9
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.720 
lot of social work in that
spectrum, in different parts

10
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.090 
of the world, mainly in Southeast
Asia. So MotionLab is not for very

11
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.050 
beginner level, which is
something that you can find in

12
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.750 
traditional maker spaces or
hackers spaces, which are more

13
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.280 
catered for beginners. MotionLab
is little bit on the industrial

14
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
side. So what we have initially
thought, that, okay, we

15
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.690 
want to build a huge space for
makers, space to build things,

16
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.460 
within a few months we understood
that the demand is for startups

17
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.360 
or companies and innovators
who are building

18
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.030 
human-sized products and they
don't have a space where

19
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.640 
they can build these things, and
especially they don't have

20
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.760 
those tools and expertise on
operating these machines.

21
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.150 
So in that moment we decided, okay:
MotionLab is something which

22
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.360 
is something business oriented,
innovation oriented.

23
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
The product can be made here,
not some hobby projects.

24
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.190 
So and all the machines that we
have are industrial machines,

25
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.620 
so a lot of inventors, a lot of
founders, they come here but

26
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.340 
they don't have the knowledge how
to use these machines, so we

27
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.810 
give them training on how
to use these machines.

28
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.980 
And this helps them to go really
fast from their prototype

29
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.410 
to let's say, like a demonstrator.
Once they have the demonstrator

30
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.090 
they can produce a small
series production of those

31
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.760 
products in MotionLab, but
still if they have to go for

32
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.640 
mass production, they have to go to
a bigger factory. So MotionLab

33
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.560 
is filling that gap between the
prototype to the demonstrator or small

34
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
series production.

35
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.380 
Yeah, I would love
to show araBot.

36
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.680 
araBot is, as you see here,
a multi-purpose digital

37
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.230 
fabrication machine. The
machine was designed

38
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.710 
and made using different
open-source projects.

39
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.610 
The whole idea of araBot is to
use one machine for different

40
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.340 
purposes. You might see
here a 3D printer,

41
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.720 
laser cutter, CNC mold,
plotter, like you know,

42
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.530 
how to say, pancake printers, we
have also a pancake printer,

43
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.770 
but araBot can do
everything in one place.

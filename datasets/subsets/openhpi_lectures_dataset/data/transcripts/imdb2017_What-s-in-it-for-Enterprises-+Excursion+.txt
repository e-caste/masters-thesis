1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.700 
I put a little sentence here
saying computer scientists

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.100 
often build things because they
can and not because they actually

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.140 
need it. Business
men sometimes get

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.190 
frustrated because they come
up with these amazing ideas and

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.210 
they just don't really
work in the real world.

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.240 
It's important that we're
investing our resources in the

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.270 
right direction. We
remove the aggregates.

8
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.320 
So what, what does that mean?
Aggregates are actually pretty

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.350 
useful, we can base
our decisions on them.

10
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.380 
Why do we want to remove them?
Well what is important to

11
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.400 
business
decision making,

12
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.430 
well what is important
is the information.

13
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.460 
In needs to be fast,
performant and up to date.

14
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.510 
It needs to be easy to consume and it
needs to be at the right granularity

15
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.540 
of detail. What I want to
get, the message I want

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.570 
to get across, what's important
is organizational change.

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.610 
If the organizational
structure did not change

18
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.640 
then everything would be fine. We
wouldn't need to remove the aggregates

19
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.680 
because we could always just rely
on the same aggregate structure

20
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.710 
and analyze the data according
to that. What the problem is

21
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.740 
for businesses is when
organizations change,

22
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.780 
products change, you move
into different regions,

23
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.810 
different countries. Then you have
to analyze the data in different

24
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.840 
ways in different views and
across different dimensions.

25
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.870 
This is what brings
in the flexibility,

26
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
not only that. We are in an
incredibly competitive landscape

27
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.960 
now, technology is opened
up. The possibility for

28
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.990 
the threat of new entrance like
never before. Small companies can

29
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.101 
come in and seriously
disrupt the market.

30
00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.105 
This makes it very difficult for
big companies who have real problems

31
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.108 
to shift and adapt to the
changes that are needed.

32
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.112 
This is part of the innovation
dilemma that's everyone

33
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.114 
has probably heard
about or read about.

34
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:01.121 
As you know ther are aggregates
and hierarchies everywhere.

35
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.124 
If we look at just the
organizational structures

36
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:08.128 
and product hierarchies,
profiting cost structures

37
00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.131 
and then we look at aggregates
across regions and countries.

38
00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.135 
These, as said, are all
very useful but they are

39
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:19.139 
static. The problem for us
is that information gets lost

40
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.143 
in these aggregates. I just want
to give an example, imagine we

41
00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.145 
got a company A that
is acquired company B.

42
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.149 
Once you've integrated
company B into company A

43
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.152 
it is very difficult to know, for
example, where revenue is coming

44
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:37.157 
from. What is the growth in the
next year because of the acquisition

45
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:41.161 
of company B or was it
just simply the growth from

46
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.164 
the acquisition or the organic
growth. It's very difficult

47
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:48.168 
to know where that comes from, the
aggregates hides their information.

48
00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.171 
If you then go down to the line
item level, right down to the

49
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.174 
ground, the lowest
level of data.

50
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:57.177 
You can then really understand
what is driving your business.

51
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:03.183 
Performance, if you say
to business person, ok

52
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:07.187 
it's faster. That is not particularly
in any way business value.

53
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:12.192 
It enables business value. What
is important is it, for example,

54
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.195 
in user experience you get that
reactive performance that you're

55
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:19.199 
expecting. You're getting
sub second performance

56
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.205 
which enables you, it is a prerequisite
for the enterprise applications.

57
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:29.209 
It is not actually the most
important thing straight off the

58
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.211 
bat, you are not going to say ,ok
so it's a bit quicker well great.

59
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:36.216 
Lets see what it can do. What
enables us is to run simulations

60
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.218 
and this is where the business
values starts to come in.

61
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.221 
So I want to go into an
example on our financial

62
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:45.225 
close, then also want to look
at how performance can really

63
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:50.230 
reduce our total cost of ownership.
This is a typical financial

64
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.234 
close on the left hand side,
you wait for example for a

65
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.237 
period like a quarter and then
you run a batch process at the

66
00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.240 
end of the quarter which
is very time consuming,

67
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.245 
a lot of process is involved,
and it's costly and it's

68
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:09.249 
cumbersome. At the end of it,
once you've generated it you

69
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.251 
then have to analyze
it, auditors look at it,

70
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.255 
and they generally frame
problems once the batch is done.

71
00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.259 
This is very problematic because
then you have to run it again

72
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.262 
and it causes all sorts of
problems. You are not dealing with a

73
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.265 
problem before it actually happens,
you're not being pro-active.

74
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.269 
If you can actually run your
financial statement on the fly,

75
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.271 
generate your financial
close on the fly,

76
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.275 
you can then correct any of
the errors that will come up at

77
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:39.279 
the end. You can avoid
them and then pro-actively

78
00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:44.284 
correct issues before
before you actually

79
00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.285 
get to the period end.

80
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.290 
As another thing a performance
to cloud-ification,

81
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.294 
to be cloud ready we need
to be able to reduce the TCO

82
00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.298 
and that performance and reducing
our data footprint enables

83
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.301 
us to do that. We've got integrate
customer data and we need

84
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.304 
to be non disruptive, not
disruptive in the user experience

85
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.307 
and non-destructive for our
customers and being able to

86
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:10.310 
transfer their data
onto the new system.

87
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:18.318 
Looking our total cost if we
look at here on the left hand

88
00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:23.323 
side our TCO is made up of
various things such as purchase

89
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.326 
and set up, maintenance,
acquisition, operating costs.

90
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.329 
The idea I want to get across
here, just a very simple

91
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:34.334 
cost diagram, if you can
manage to reduce your variable

92
00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:39.339 
costs in half, you can seriously,
you're break even point

93
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.342 
will move over to the
left significantly

94
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:47.347 
in this situation. And the other
way around, if your variable

95
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:50.350 
costs were to go up you would
lose a significant amount of

96
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.352 
profit. If you look at the
triangle between the two different

97
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.355 
break even points in between
the two variable cost,

98
00:05:55.355 --> 00:06:00.360 
that is how much profit you would
lose. This is the importance

99
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.362 
of reducing the data footprint
if you can reduce your data

100
00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:07.367 
footprint in half, if you can
increase the performance by two,

101
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.371 
all these elements will go
into reducing your total cost

102
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.374 
of ownership. That is where
you will start to make money.

103
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.376 
If you can't keep your
total cost of ownership

104
00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.380 
below a certain point. You
won't make any money and this is

105
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.382 
very important when you
are moving to the cloud.

106
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.387 
Where does business value
come in on the flexibility

107
00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:31.391 
bit which I was talking
about earlier? If we look

108
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:35.395 
at how planning is
done now, it is static.

109
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:40.400 
What we do is we look at,
say, how are companies

110
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.404 
structured, by regions and say
product unit market categories,

111
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:48.408 
we got cars, bikes, and planes.
Say our target is ok we want 100 %.

112
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.411 
Where is that
going to come from_

113
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:56.416 
Well they would go, ok so
50% Asia, 20% from bikes

114
00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.419 
and then this is grid and then
managers would debate between

115
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.422 
themselves, where with
the revenue come from.

116
00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:07.427 
What are there growth areas? This
is somewhat putting your thumb

117
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.430 
in the air, having a guess what
your revenue percentage, what

118
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.433 
your operating margin
is going to be and then

119
00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.435 
try to allocate and see where
that's going to come from. It is

120
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:20.440 
not particularly scientific, it's
not really basing your information

121
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.443 
on real data and the growth rates
are applied on the aggregate,

122
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.446 
this is the important thing.
If you look at the rules of how

123
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.448 
when you're doing
you're planning,

124
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.451 
if you apply your inflation
rates, your market product

125
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:35.455 
growth rates on an aggregate level
and then your company organizational

126
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.458 
structure changes then you're not
going to have an accurate plan and

127
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:41.461 
then you are going to have a real
problem when going into the planning for

128
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.464 
the next year. Because normally
plans are done across rolling, for

129
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:48.468 
one year plan, three year, five
year. What you need to do, well

130
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.471 
you need to abstract
the revenue structures

131
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.475 
and you need to apply the rules to
the lowest level of granularity,

132
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:59.479 
so that's on the line item
level. What does this mean,

133
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.482 
so for example, on your items you
have certain variables, certain

134
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.485 
attributes that you can
apply these rules to.

135
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:09.489 
For example a country inflation
rate or interest rates can

136
00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.492 
be applied as a rule across
different line items.

137
00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:16.496 
If those line items then aggregated
in different ways between

138
00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.498 
the year, it doesn't
matter, your planning

139
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.501 
still stays the same, you don't
need to adjust your plan from

140
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.504 
year to year because the rules
are set on the line items.

141
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.508 
I can tell you now it
is an amazing effort

142
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.511 
to try and take one
organizational structure

143
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.513 
and then you move to the next
year and adjust the plan for the

144
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.516 
next year. It is very
difficult, takes a lot of time

145
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:41.521 
and trying to work out how you
compare one year to nine is

146
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.524 
incredibly difficult. Beyond
to have this flexibility,

147
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:48.528 
for managers, for financial
managers is incredibly useful.

148
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:55.535 
Another example, similar
situation you abstracting the data

149
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.538 
from the actual structures
and the hierarchies.

150
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:04.544 
In these cases
you can apply data

151
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.546 
from different years
to different structures

152
00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:10.550 
and this is what is very useful.
You can do this in two situations,

153
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.554 
say you want to do a simulation,
imagine you want to do a re-organization

154
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:18.558 
of a company and then you want
to see what that re-organization

155
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:20.560 
would do on the current
data that you have.

156
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.563 
You can then apply, for
example if we were in 2012,

157
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.567 
what would happen if I re-organized
my company in a certain

158
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.570 
way, what would it look like,
what would my P&amp;L look like

159
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:35.575 
in that situation. You can also
do a validation of the data,

160
00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:40.580 
so say ok, I've implemented a
strategy, we want to now see

161
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.585 
what would that look like
on our 2013 data with

162
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.587 
our previous organizational
structure. Have I made the right

163
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:51.591 
decision? Has it been, say we
wanted to do a focus on services,

164
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.594 
for the service
organization that made sense

165
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.596 
the decision that we've
made to re-structure.

166
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.601 
We have a lot of challenges
though, it is very difficult

167
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.604 
to measure the return on investment
sometimes with the flexibility

168
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:08.608 
piece. Easier on the
TCO, but more difficult

169
00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:12.612 
on the flexibility because the flexibility
is more alligned to your strategy

170
00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:16.616 
and the strategic decision
making. You can use these tools to

171
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.618 
validate your strategy but it's
very difficult to measure your

172
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:22.622 
actual return on investment.
This will come over

173
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.624 
time I believe, but
because this is very new

174
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.627 
a lot of people are very
very excited about what

175
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.629 
this can do, because this is
being somewhat of a holy grail,

176
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:33.633 
we have not had this flexibility.
Decision making is all about

177
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.636 
having the right information to
be able to make decisions on.

178
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:41.641 
At the moment we don't actually
have full visibility information

179
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.643 
that we'd like to have
to make our decisions.

180
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.647 
Having our information
based on the lowest level of

181
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.649 
detail gives us the
information we need.

182
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.653 
HANA gives us the performance
that we need to make those

183
00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:58.658 
decisions quickly and it all
comes together in this one piece.

184
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.661 
This is the thing, we haven't
needed to do this for because

185
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:03.663 
we have been able to do it
before, it's been impossible.

186
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.668 
What we'd like to do is just
do a quick demonstration

187
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.671 
that we've done a very quick
prototype in a few days

188
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.675 
of what it would look like to
compare one hierarchical structure

189
00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.678 
from one year to the next and
see whether that strategy was

190
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:24.684 
worked or not. Some of the
guys team at the ICP put

191
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.686 
together this, in
literally a couple of days,

192
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:32.692 
and what we have here is
just a made up organizational

193
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:36.696 
structure. We can see that
ok from the group we got two

194
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:40.700 
board areas, business and
consumer with then sub-groups

195
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.704 
that we can then drill down into.
What would I like to do is then

196
00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:48.708 
compare this with past data. If
I click on this, I can compare

197
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.711 
it from the year
before and press update

198
00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:56.716 
and then you'll see underneath
it, you'll get what it looked

199
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.719 
like below, so
that's 2012.

200
00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.721 
But as you can see here because
the structure was different

201
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.724 
in 2012, you have
un-assigned profit centers.

202
00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.727 
We need to assign this
profit center to the new

203
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.730 
organisational structure
to get a proper

204
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.733 
evaluation of what the
real differences were.

205
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.735 
We can either split them

206
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:18.738 
so if you have a profit center
the needs to be split we can

207
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.741 
split it along an attribute
such as an industry or a country

208
00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:24.744 
or we can allocated a
profit center directly

209
00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:29.749 
to a leaf node. If I was
to go into mobile devices,

210
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.754 
I'm just doing this
randomly, I could say ok

211
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:38.758 
BR production is now in X13
and apply the profit center

212
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:41.761 
and you'll see the
change will go onto 2012.

213
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.765 
If I want to look at BR
sales, I can split that

214
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.768 
and I can split
it by certain

215
00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.772 
attributes and I do it on the
country and we now see that split

216
00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.775 
it all into these different
profit centers by country.

217
00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.781 
I can now drag and drop these
onto the individual items here,

218
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:06.786 
on to the new profit
centers to allocate revenue

219
00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:09.789 
that was missing so that the
total should always be the same

220
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.791 
at the group level. I
can always delete one

221
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.794 
if that organization
actually moved out.

222
00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.800 
If we go back, well we can see
for example on the business

223
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.803 
side ok actually it's
been a good thing.

224
00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.806 
We've improved the situation
but on the consumer side we've

225
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.808 
made a mistake, it's not
been the right decision,

226
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.811 
maybe that was the
goal, maybe the goal was

227
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.814 
the board want to
reduce on the consumer

228
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:35.815 
side and actually increase
the business side,

229
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.817 
It all depends
on your strategy.

230
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.828 
As I was saying, this
is really really new

231
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.832 
and there are lots of different
scenarios where we could benefit

232
00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.835 
from this. I gave a quick
insight onto the planning, just

233
00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:59.839 
a very light overview. I
mentioned mergers and acquisitions

234
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.842 
in terms of understanding where
your revenue comes from, in

235
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:05.845 
terms of organic growth. But
there are so many different areas

236
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:09.849 
and there is just a couple more like
forecasting, sales bag allocations

237
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.852 
which is basically your product
hierarchy, again another

238
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.855 
hierarchy the can break down
and understand where to,

239
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.000 
how to structure to
maximize your revenue,

240
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.860 
improving your
cash position,

241
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.863 
looking at your daily sales that are
standing and the list goes on and on and on.

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.639 
Welcome back everyone! Welcome back to our clean-IT

2
00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:07.860 
openXchange live talk.

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:16.309 
We didn't have a life talk in the last month because we had some technical issues at the HPI, unfortunately, but I'm really

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.410 
happy to see that everything is working again now and I'm also very happy to see that many of you made it even though we

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.649 
had to change the credentials and the zoom link and everything.

6
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.160 
But yeah it's nice to to have you all here.

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.729 
Today's guest for the openXchange session is Zhelong Pan. Zhelong Pan is a senior Staff Architect for sustainable software

8
00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:38.159 
solutions at VMware.

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:46.560 
He has been in the IT industry for about 16 years now and since he had received his PhD degree from the Purdue University.

10
00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.859 
He's very passionate about carbon transparency, resource efficiency and power management as well as carbon aware solutions

11
00:00:53.869 --> 00:01:01.270 
in a multicloud environment and this is also what he will be talking about today or more specifically

12
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.359 
sustainability as a cloud service in multicloud environments.

13
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.689 
In his talk he will share his VMware's journey to data center sustainability and their commitment to service customers sustainability

14
00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:12.060 
needs.

15
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.640 
He will also discuss the VMware's intrinsic sustainability approach to maximizing the productive and efficient utilization

16
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.659 
of cloud infrastructure and how to design resource and carbon efficient applications.

17
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.159 
I'm very much looking forward to your presentation and yeah let's just start! Welcome Zhelong.

18
00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:38.189 
Thank you, Nils and thank thank you for having me. I am in the city office, I'm an architect so I want to tell you

19
00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.549 
a little about my role.

20
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.219 
So in city office we have research group as well.

21
00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.260 
So they work within academia and conducting more research topics.

22
00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:56.659 
They have like founded a few projects with the with different universities and in city office we also have advanced technology

23
00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.310 
development.

24
00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:04.260 
That means we developed some new technology, let's say, in three or five years of vision, right.

25
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.370 
And then for me, I'm also working with the product team to really embed our storage and then advance the storage into our products

26
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.259 
and services.

27
00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.659 
And the topic, the title is called "Sustainability as a service".

28
00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:27.580 
So that's the man that I kind of created because I think of that we, VMware, it's not ourselves that make ourself, IT

29
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.409 
industry,

30
00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:28.780 
IT

31
00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.259 
department are more sustainable.

32
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.659 
But how do we help our customers to achieve their sustainability kind of need?

33
00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.629 
And what kind of services should we provide to them?

34
00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:44.840 
So that's the open question we raised up and then I think we can find some answers commonly together today.

35
00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.960 
So I will share with you what we did, what our thoughts are and please feel free to stop me at any time.

36
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:57.650 
And I'm actually in the USG office, so USG is environmental, social and governance.

37
00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.310 
So I focused on mainly on sustainability because of my background.

38
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.460 
I worked on performance and resource management.

39
00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.550 
Now I think energy in the carbon becomes more interesting for sustainability reasons.

40
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.879 
So the question here is that why? I don't know whether you see this data or not, but over the past decade the

41
00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:26.560 
number of workloads has grown exponentially and that means something to the climate and something not so good actually.

42
00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:35.740 
So if we do nothing today, it's predicted that the carbon emission due to the datacenters,

43
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:45.650 
will be more than 3%, of the global worldwide CO2 emission by 2025. And that number may reach 14% by 2040.

44
00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.409 
Of course that won't happen because we're working on it.

45
00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.039 
Right?

46
00:03:49.050 --> 00:04:00.180 
Then the other thing is that about the energy consumption. So energy consumption in 2020, in one year, is about 200 TWh

47
00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.949 
So it's 1% of total energy consumption worldwide.

48
00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:05.860 
So these numbers are huge.

49
00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.259 
The other thing here is that this number does not include crypto currency.

50
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.319 
The Cryptocurrency itself is adding 100 TW hour and even worse network is another big contribution.

51
00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.889 
Another About 300 TW hour.

52
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.180 
So what does that mean?

53
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:31.860 
So first of all we have to look at the data center as we have done the way in VMware, to our customers via server virtualization

54
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.649 
But we also need to look into the applications because if we do not pay good attention to the future applications then it may

55
00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:47.399 
get out of control and network is another interesting area that what can we do to really reduce the unnecessary network

56
00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:50.459 
traffic and then improve the efficiency of medical devices.

57
00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:50.759 
Right?

58
00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:58.949 
So that are the landscape that we are trying to handle sustainability itself is a new problem.

59
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.660 
Like we talked about energy and carbon.

60
00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.660 
However, it's not entirely new.

61
00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.790 
One thing is that is about utilization, civil utilization.

62
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.660 
I'm showing you two utilization data in a CPU and a memory.

63
00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.540 
So this data is our customers' data.

64
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:25.350 
We look at all our customer utilization and you can see that some of the customers are well utilized more than 40 or 50%

65
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
But a lot of customers are not well utilized.

66
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.360 
The utilization is below 10% or 20%.

67
00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:39.649 
That has a strong indication that we have a small, still a lot of room to improve our service utilization.

68
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:48.519 
And if we improve the utilization, that also means that reduce the unnecessary or reduce the waste in hardware and also

69
00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:50.660 
improve the energy efficiency of the servers.

70
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.589 
So yes, it is an older problem.

71
00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:01.350 
But if we solve that well and better, we may also address the sustainability problems and reduce the problem space which is solved.

72
00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.649 
What do I mean?

73
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.740 
And so first of all, let me tell you what VMware does and at a high level, then we look at the three dimensions on

74
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.759 
what I meant by intrinsic sustainability.

75
00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.990 
So in VMware, we started with virtualization and then later on we become a cloud company.

76
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.470 
We have private cloud storage and a public cloud storage.

77
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.790 
And then we'll talk about hybrid cloud and edge cloud etc.

78
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:35.040 
So this are more like infrastructure level and on top of this infrastructure you can think about VMs in the house and storage

79
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.350 
and network, right! On top of that we hold the SaaS services.

80
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.949 
We hold solutions to run both traditional applications in the cloud native applications.

81
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.060 
And then we also look at the devices like end-user devices.

82
00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:56.560 
So that is what we call "Any-Any-Any" strategy! Any cloud infrastructure wide, any application and any devices.

83
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.250 
What we think from sustainability angle is that we want to build sustainability in all layers.

84
00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:05.360 
What do you mean by that?

85
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.870 
So first of all we want to build carbon efficient applications.

86
00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.930 
We should start from beginning, right?

87
00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:13.980 
Look at the crypto currency problem.

88
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.560 
If we do not pay attention it may use a lot of energy.

89
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:24.759 
And then sometimes if the application is well adopted it will be very hard for us to revert and redesign.

90
00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:29.060 
So if we start from the beginning it will help from the source the application side.

91
00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.480 
And secondly, we're trying to help our admins.

92
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:40.529 
Our IT Admins and maybe also DevOps so that they can make better use of their infrastructure, the IT

93
00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:46.250 
infrastructure and there are a lot of best practices for sustainability.

94
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:53.389 
There are a new trend, for example, using renewable energy that kind of intersect our IT industry with the power industry

95
00:07:53.399 --> 00:08:01.610 
with renewable energy and with more clean energy source. And we'll talk about a little bit in the end about what do I mean

96
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.990 
by the intersection and lastly is the management side.

97
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.759 
So essentially we want to bring the data visible to the users. In the past, we only focused on or were mainly focused on the

98
00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:23.860 
resource utilization side and we have something about power but then for carbon, should we expose the carbon metrics, the

99
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:31.699 
carbon and the energy, we call it the carbon intensity data, to the other domains so they can manage their workloads, manage

100
00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:34.179 
that infrastructure in a better way.

101
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.860 
So you know more intelligent way.

102
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.460 
So that's the management piece.

103
00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:44.259 
Now I want to land that into our product and what do we do about that?

104
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:53.149 
So in the beginning I said that we started with virtualization and that has a huge benefit because if you think that we're

105
00:08:53.149 --> 00:09:02.129 
consolidating 10 VMs into one single host, there is already a tax reduction that roughly that saves you a lot of infrastructure

106
00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:09.379 
that has not only the carbon emission due to power consumption but also the infrastructure build-out

107
00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:11.230 
For the right project you have less building to do, right?

108
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.860 
That has a huge benefit.

109
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:23.389 
And then we have virtualized storage and the network and the VCF stack and we enter into the tens of space.

110
00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:26.700 
So that is all when we develop these solutions.

111
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.360 
We all have like efficiency in mind.

112
00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:33.269 
And then the last part is the realized operation.

113
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:41.580 
That is what I meant by management - will track the progress, track the carbon emissions and also track how efficiently

114
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:52.000 
your infrastructure is proposed, analytics help you to reduce the waste in your resource, reducing the waste and energy

115
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.950 
consumption is under remarkable but it will take some time for us to get there.

116
00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:02.419 
So this is a dashboard for vROps, why do we call it

117
00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:03.350 
a green dashboard?

118
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:11.440 
So you can see that we look at the the suppliers meaning that infrastructure demand, meaning that the workloads and then

119
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.769 
the operations for you to manage, visualize it and manage your carbon footprint and report how good you are doing in different

120
00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:19.360 
areas.

121
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.960 
So that is another interesting management dashboard.

122
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.500 
Well that seems very simple, right?

123
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:28.039 
What the hell is we should do?

124
00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:34.450 
What's a new problem we're facing in this new renewable energy land.

125
00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:43.159 
What I'm mentioning here is the article from a professor, Prof Andrew Chen of the University of Chicago.

126
00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:48.049 
So he pointed out there are three scenarios of using renewable energy.

127
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.070 
The 1st one is a good.

128
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:57.690 
So it's actually, you think that you have a constant workload like here and renewable energy is a good source for you

129
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.470 
to match.

130
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:58.799 
Right?

131
00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:05.299 
So essentially if you can use the solution to power your workloads, then your carbon emissions will be very low compared

132
00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.590 
to power by coal or natural gas.

133
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:18.159 
So this is the good part, kind of you meeting customer, kind of offset based on their energy consumption with a renewable energy

134
00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:26.159 
But you can see there are still room. The room here is that the renewable energies are going up and down because the source,

135
00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:28.500 
energy source is not constant.

136
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.409 
It's volatile.

137
00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:32.059 
The sun may go down and the wind stopped blowing.

138
00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:41.649 
So the second strategy is called 24 x 7 Match. Essentially you match your load, match the renewable energy to the load

139
00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:42.980 
consumption by hour.

140
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.549 
So essentially meaning that every time you will always have renewable power data source.

141
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:55.659 
But this also creates a challenge because it's not always like that. If you do that then you have wasted energy like here

142
00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:57.809 
and nobody's using that energy.

143
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.159 
Right?

144
00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:08.230 
So the next stage he said that we shouldn't do a flexible load, you match not the renewable energy but you migrate the

145
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.669 
load.

146
00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:11.460 
You shut that load based on time or based on space.

147
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:19.929 
So based on time is like you just migrate load, you defer the load until you have enough energy and local renewable energy

148
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:28.500 
over here that you mentioned, should by region or job. It is like you migrate the workloads to the region to the other location

149
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:35.409 
so that you have enough renewable energy in there and do not round workloads when there's no real requirement that will cause

150
00:12:35.409 --> 00:12:36.350 
more carbon emission.

151
00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:45.049 
So with that we have a concept deployment in the edge environment that in this edge environment we have multiple

152
00:12:45.049 --> 00:12:48.799 
sites and you can see that you have region one, region two, region three.

153
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:50.649 
They are geographically distributed.

154
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.169 
And sometimes in this region we have more renewable energy.

155
00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:56.460 
Sometimes the other region have renewable energy.

156
00:12:57.039 --> 00:13:03.200 
What we do here is that we use our management software that you saw in the beginning at the dashboard.

157
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.860 
Right?

158
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:13.350 
So essentially the energy source will kind of create more reports, the data metrics, for management software to track. If there

159
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:20.960 
are some prediction saying that, "okay in my region there's not enough energy in the next hour or something like that.

160
00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:23.059 
Then you should do some action."

161
00:13:24.039 --> 00:13:31.480 
So then the logic will be triggered, do some analytics and find another region have enough renewable energy and then the

162
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.440 
load will be shifted to that region.

163
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:40.570 
So that is the edge department and we have this demo, it's not fully developing it just in concept and we use some real data

164
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.570 
to find the workloads and then make it useful.

165
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:50.940 
There are still a lot of.. Oh! no questions we can discuss after a few slides

166
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.049 
and this actually is the last slide.

167
00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:59.759 
So if you think about the shift by load, the one question here is that what load can be shifted?

168
00:13:59.769 --> 00:14:00.110 
Right?

169
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:09.120 
So the application is actually the source and sometimes the load has some, let's say, latency requirement, you

170
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.889 
cannot do that.

171
00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:11.059 
It's locality.

172
00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:14.509 
However, that brings up a question.

173
00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:24.149 
So that is the green software or the carbon aware solutions that the developers have more to catch up.

174
00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:27.190 
So can we make the applications more carbon aware?

175
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.759 
But can we make it applications more energy efficient?

176
00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:33.580 
Can we feed this carbon intensity that we talked about our renewable energy data?

177
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:40.830 
We talk about into the application so they can be able to more flexibly run their workloads at the

178
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:48.049 
planted location so that we have renewable energy? There will be another opening question for the researchers.

179
00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:54.850 
But the application, what I'm talking about is more of a distributed application, not necessarily traditional application

180
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.960 
and we think that will be an interesting future.

181
00:14:58.539 --> 00:15:06.740 
So I think that will end my talk today and then I hope I can give you more kind of a meaningful discussion after

182
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.059 
that.

183
00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:08.639 
Thank you.

184
00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:14.009 
You mentioned about the CPU usage before, have you got a feel for what is the sweet spot?

185
00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:18.460 
Because if you run a CPU at 100% for a year it'll degrade.

186
00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:24.879 
Do you have a rough feeling for what would be a good load over a longer time?

187
00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:30.460 
So I think I want to answer your question in two ways.

188
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:41.360 
So this is the energy proportionality question. Essentially the energy efficiency goes higher and higher when you have higher

189
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:50.080 
such utilization, but the sweet spot is not only determined by the energy kind of power proportionality.

190
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.059 
Let me show you another slide that I have.

191
00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:56.850 
Sorry, give me a second.

192
00:15:58.539 --> 00:16:01.350 
If you see my slide over here.

193
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:07.850 
So look at the top graph, sorry the top line, the blue line, not so readable.

194
00:16:08.419 --> 00:16:19.789 
If you think of that at this middle line is the 50%,, then you can see the power usage goes across the

195
00:16:19.789 --> 00:16:23.159 
CPU utilization. And at the 50%, it's already good.

196
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:31.570 
but in mind this is a hT enabled, hyper threading enabled, so that actually means that all the cores are utilized.

197
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.559 
That's why the 50% is good enough.

198
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.620 
but sometimes if you go to let's say 40% or so, I think it's also acceptable.

199
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.269 
Right?

200
00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:46.570 
This is from the hardware point of view. But from workload point of view, you're not going to get the high workload all the

201
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.980 
time, it's not controlled by you, right?

202
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:57.399 
In a typical environment, I think that if it's not well utilized, it's more like 20% or 10% and that's typical environment

203
00:16:57.409 --> 00:16:58.970 
but you want to go higher and higher.

204
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:06.769 
I think our internal VMware cloud, I think our utilization is like 60% or something like that.

205
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.140 
But the workload, of course, is determined by the users.

206
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:19.400 
So that workload is a DevOps workload, they kind of submitted build tasks, test tasks, what we need to do as

207
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.460 
infrastructure is to make sure the hardware, the servers,

208
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:34.069 
So basically you scheduled workloads to less servers so that you have enough kind of utilization but also meet their quality

209
00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:36.380 
service like forbidden test, it's easier.

210
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:44.670 
But for other things that you may have latency requirements as well. Onto that because I think you also mentioned about forgotten

211
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.730 
machines out there.

212
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.490 
Have you gotten any idea on how to spot these zombie machines?

213
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.460 
You know, somebody set up something workload.

214
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:59.359 
But then I was telling myself how you could detect that maybe by not ever sending a request to that machine or consuming

215
00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:00.930 
its data or anything like that.

216
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:08.779 
But do you have a kind of feel how much of the cloud usage at the moment could be such zombies machines that have been

217
00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:09.450 
forgotten?

218
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:18.019 
Yeah, that's a good topic. My colleague Nicola is not here and she is a passionate about zombies and she has requested

219
00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:21.269 
that for a long time. We are doing that.

220
00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.730 
There are many zombie.

221
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.950 
First of all we have to define what is a zombie.

222
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:26.670 
Right?

223
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.910 
Yes.

224
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.380 
In the current system we identify that there are a huge percentage.

225
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.710 
She has more numbers, I think it's more than 10% depending on the users.

226
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.170 
A lot of VMs and hosts are zombies.

227
00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:48.480 
In VMware, we internally do something about a simple detection, its called idleVM, so zombiness is detected by the idleness

228
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.170 
of the system.

229
00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:51.849 
And then we found that a lot of VMs are idling.

230
00:18:51.849 --> 00:18:55.650 
So there is a procedure that the IT.

231
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.059 
team will say, "This is idle. Pay attention, what's wrong?"

232
00:18:59.059 --> 00:18:59.599 
Right?

233
00:18:59.609 --> 00:19:05.460 
And I challenged them then why do you have the zombie being in the first place fix, fix the root cause not only the simpleton

234
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.960 
So of course you can turn off right away but you will do that over and over again.

235
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.299 
And sometimes we find out that it's due to the software bugs right?

236
00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:18.579 
You power on VM, run the test then the system is left there.

237
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:23.059 
So fix your script as well and in the cloud environment back to your question.

238
00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:30.599 
I think if you reach a scale, a lot of things are automated and if you have the software bug it's very likely you will

239
00:19:30.609 --> 00:19:32.599 
end up into that zombie situation.

240
00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:33.869 
So that's the reason.

241
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.049 
And zombie is not only the VMs but also data.

242
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.089 
Yeah.

243
00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:44.380 
Well container world, you can think about president volumes PVs.

244
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.660 
Those volumes.

245
00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.099 
I mean you put data, you add up. In the current situation,

246
00:19:49.099 --> 00:19:52.539 
you have, we have lots of data that you may forget about it.

247
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:54.380 
These are all zombies to you.

248
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.759 
Right?

249
00:19:54.769 --> 00:20:01.000 
But this is very simple definition with zombie and some of the zombies are not idle.

250
00:20:01.009 --> 00:20:02.269 
Some zombies are active.

251
00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:10.819 
One reason here is that it's for samples, you create a project, a customer created a project and the project ended or you

252
00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:11.509 
have an electrician.

253
00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:17.660 
The person who worked on the project went off to some other companies and nobody knows where the project is.

254
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.359 
And this workloads runs there and people, IT team doesn't know, right?

255
00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:23.220 
Keep updating yet.

256
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.839 
Upgrading.

257
00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:25.559 
And you have still have workloads.

258
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.210 
So that's the ownership.

259
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.339 
You have to know which VMs, which hosts

260
00:20:31.349 --> 00:20:34.990 
are owned by which team, by which project is this project dead?

261
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.640 
If that's dead, likely your VMs workloads are also dead.

262
00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:41.569 
It's not uncommon.

263
00:20:41.569 --> 00:20:43.460 
So there are a lot of such situations.

264
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:44.869 
Yeah.

265
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.759 
And everybody's hesitant in shooting down somebody else's VM.

266
00:20:47.769 --> 00:20:50.460 
You never know.

267
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.460 
Okay, thanks a lot.

268
00:20:54.339 --> 00:20:54.539 
Yeah.

269
00:20:55.339 --> 00:20:55.869 
Okay.

270
00:20:55.869 --> 00:20:57.559 
I hope you can hear me now again.

271
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:58.609 
Yes.

272
00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.809 
Okay, perfectly.

273
00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:01.200 
I don't know why it didn't work in between.

274
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.079 
I mean, at the start of the meeting, it also works.

275
00:21:03.079 --> 00:21:03.539 
So.

276
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:05.349 
Yeah, but I'm happy that yeah.

277
00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:09.529 
You just put your question anyway out there.

278
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:13.559 
So yeah, if you have any other questions, I see that we've got one in the chat.

279
00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:17.869 
I just wanted to quickly say, which I also said before, thank you very much for the talk.

280
00:21:17.869 --> 00:21:21.589 
And I'm yeah hyped for the questions.

281
00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:23.549 
So I think the next question from the chat.

282
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:25.680 
I'm just going to read it for the person.

283
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:33.059 
Hi, do you do any measures to increase the lifetime of old hardware or do you cooperate with hardware vendors to build

284
00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:37.859 
hardware, which has a lower CO2 footprint during the production and longer life term time?

285
00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:40.640 
These are two questions.

286
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.190 
The first question is we want to but we do not yet.

287
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.670 
Right.

288
00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:50.460 
That is the embodied carbon that you're talking about.

289
00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:55.960 
I can only tell you a plan because there is not easy to do right now.

290
00:21:56.339 --> 00:22:04.250 
So first of all we need to know what is embodied carbon of the hardware and while working with hardware vendors.

291
00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:06.599 
For example there are the HPEs.

292
00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:09.660 
They published some numbers in paper.

293
00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:11.279 
What we want to do.

294
00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:17.309 
We haven't done that yet is that we want to put that data into a database and then we can report these numbers through our

295
00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:17.859 
software.

296
00:22:18.339 --> 00:22:18.630 
Right?

297
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.019 
That will track the embodied carbon for the hardware.

298
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.119 
Then the question is that how do we increase the lifespan?

299
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.349 
That essentially is the controlled by the managers,

300
00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:38.029 
the IT admins. If we expose this data, the embedded carbon for the hardware and I hope we can also create some policies for

301
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:41.660 
the IT admins to prolong the life of the old hardware.

302
00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:47.910 
So you have to make this data visible to the admins, visible to the CIOs.

303
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.490 
Our customers, so they pay attention.

304
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.960 
They want to enforce the policies.

305
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:52.740 
Yes.

306
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.859 
So that is something that we need to do further.

307
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.349 
And the second question is about the do we work with hardware vendors?

308
00:22:59.359 --> 00:22:59.609 
Yes.

309
00:22:59.609 --> 00:22:59.980 
We do.

310
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:07.559 
We have meetings with our vendors like Intel, AMD, Dell and other major hardware vendors.

311
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:13.859 
And we're discussing about how do we improve the hardware efficiency, the power efficiency and how do we control this?

312
00:23:13.869 --> 00:23:15.859 
How do we direct power management policies?

313
00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:17.930 
So that's ongoing.

314
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.359 
I think we have a really close board interest from all hardware vendors.

315
00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:27.099 
Okay.

316
00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:27.690 
Thanks a lot.

317
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.599 
I hope that kind of answers the question already.

318
00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:34.170 
Or maybe if you have a follow up question, please go ahead.

319
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.039 
And I think also this topic comes, comes up really often.

320
00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:45.210 
So we have quite a few talks already, we've had with what data centers in general,

321
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:51.759 
and it's always kind of, it's always important to also think about the the hardware aspect.

322
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.309 
Okay, so I already see there's a new question.

323
00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:56.990 
Are you working on APIs

324
00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:02.960 
that signal current and prediction of new future availability of your renewable energy to the software?

325
00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:05.059 
Yes.

326
00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:09.880 
We are not developing these predictions ourselves.

327
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.380 
We're working with other people.

328
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:17.460 
Right now, there are third party tools like electricityMap.

329
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:22.859 
They provide these predictions. They report the carbon emission and the marginal carbon emission rate.

330
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.869 
They also have some prediction data.

331
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.769 
We want to use that prediction data.

332
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.319 
We're also working with the universities to figure out what is the right way.

333
00:24:31.329 --> 00:24:35.460 
It's not only about the, how do I say that?

334
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:42.420 
So in those predictions, they were looking at the reported numbers called "carbon intensity data". Essentially

335
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.700 
it is like what is the carbon density of your power emission?

336
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:51.500 
It's not the property of one single data center.

337
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.680 
It's the power grid.

338
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.809 
So you have to know where the energy comes from or it's a combination.

339
00:24:56.809 --> 00:25:01.349 
I'm not an expert and so there is one area, but I do not know how accurate those data are.

340
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:08.039 
If we do not make the data accurate, sometimes we may make harm instead of creating help.

341
00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:08.500 
Right?

342
00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:16.440 
And the other thing is that if the load is huge, suppose, you migrate a lot of load into one day center that

343
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.880 
may cause problems to the power grid.

344
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:24.059 
So sometimes the interactions that you also need to detect what is the indication of the power grid.

345
00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:29.559 
The university professors we are working with is Professor Andrew Chen, the paper that I showed to you.

346
00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:34.299 
So he has more interesting ideas on "cut-out" energy.

347
00:25:34.309 --> 00:25:40.259 
So essentially if the renewable energy source is not well utilized, the power grid cannot take it anymore.

348
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.730 
Then it's just cut-out, nobody's using it.

349
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:43.460 
It's a waste.

350
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.319 
Okay, thank you very much.

351
00:25:49.329 --> 00:25:53.059 
Also, I see someone who's amusing themselves.

352
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.799 
I'm trying if my sound works.

353
00:25:56.809 --> 00:25:57.539 
Can you hear?

354
00:25:57.829 --> 00:25:59.349 
Yeah, great.

355
00:25:59.359 --> 00:26:04.799 
So I see great news about efficiency and also bringing those

356
00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:11.200 
CO2 numbers down in production but what, for example, about sufficiency?

357
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:22.400 
How can we make sure that users are encouraged to do less computing and use less hardware and use less electricity from

358
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.950 
a pure software perspective.

359
00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:27.450 
That's a very good question.

360
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.910 
It's I think there's some subtlety right?

361
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.359 
So suppose I'm a user.

362
00:26:31.369 --> 00:26:34.049 
I'm a developer and an application owner.

363
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:40.299 
I really do not control the usage because the consumption is by the consumers.

364
00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:48.759 
My users, I don't have the control, I can only slaughter but that also means I kind of reduced my quality of service.

365
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.750 
That also kind of mean I reduce my revenue incident wave, you translate your usage to revenue.

366
00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:57.559 
So that's a very difficult thing to do.

367
00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:06.059 
That's why if we think about efficiency part it's much easier because you are not, myself as an application owner, I'm not

368
00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:06.970 
reducing my user.

369
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:13.759 
So essentially my revenue is the same but my cost is lower, it's much easier for me to convince other people to do.

370
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:21.440 
There's one thing that you mentioned is interesting here is that usage, I want to translate that into reduced waste, not reduced

371
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.490 
usage because usage is a good thing in a certain way,

372
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.029 
right, in business mindset; but waste is a bad thing.

373
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:34.319 
Everybody would agree and we can say that do you have any wasted usage? There

374
00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.900 
it's easier to do like the early discussion we had about zombies.

375
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.759 
Zombies are waste but what what else?

376
00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.259 
I think that's an open question.

377
00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:43.380 
I need to think about it.

378
00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.009 
But it's a very good question.

379
00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:48.410 
I think it depends also a little bit on the business model.

380
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:58.390 
So if your business model is on toward the maximum number of usage time staying on your platform then of course it's

381
00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.490 
hard to do this.

382
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:09.789 
But, for example, in other enterprise companies they also work on pure processes so that the customer wants to

383
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:16.170 
do an end to end process and if he's done then he can shut down the machine.

384
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:26.460 
So if we not only, for example, measure the time to start up a website but also to measure the complete process of ordering

385
00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:33.160 
a phone or something then we know more when we actually need the machines.

386
00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:48.539 
Okay, so I think, I would also have another question maybe if that's kind of done for and I would think

387
00:28:48.539 --> 00:28:50.930 
about so we have like two ends of the spectrum.

388
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:59.539 
So the optimal solution with data center load and flexible load management would be that we're trying to always fit the

389
00:28:59.539 --> 00:29:05.849 
load as much as close as possible to the renewable energy source supply so that we always kind of match that supply.

390
00:29:05.849 --> 00:29:14.190 
And we never need any brown energy to cover the machines and the worst case state would be we're just taking every load

391
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.250 
as it comes and just executing it right away.

392
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:23.940 
And so we don't really care about renewable energy availability or how much we have to put in of the brown energy.

393
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:30.660 
And so my question would be, between those two extremes, where are we right now in the real production?

394
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.950 
So not just in research but in the actual data centers.

395
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:40.859 
Are we really just at the start because the methods are not far enough developed yet or are we somewhere in the middle already?

396
00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:42.960 
We're in the beginning.

397
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.339 
So this is more like research topics.

398
00:29:46.349 --> 00:29:50.970 
If you look at other public cloud vendors, what are they doing?

399
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:51.190 
Right?

400
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.740 
They're not doing the work load shifting.

401
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.670 
They are mainly investing in the renewable energy.

402
00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.460 
So the first one is saying I want to purchase, it's a power purchase agreement.

403
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:05.589 
So I want to purchase renewable energy to match my consumption, right?

404
00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:11.269 
So that the money from the user will go to the power companies to invest in more energy.

405
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:13.519 
Which is pretty good.

406
00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:13.859 
Right?

407
00:30:14.339 --> 00:30:16.529 
And then the other one is like, I want to invest myself.

408
00:30:16.539 --> 00:30:21.119 
Like I want to have my own solar panels on my roof.

409
00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:21.720 
Right?

410
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:27.920 
Or wind farms, but I have to be very financially strong to invest in that.

411
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:36.559 
So that is the current work that the cloud companies maybe even big companies are doing as good companies, right?

412
00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:37.950 
They want to invest by themselves.

413
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:47.259 
And then that actually is a, I think, is the important step to take forward because if you look at the percentage

414
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:56.430 
of renewable energy in the entire power industry, it's still small, but the growth is very fast of course, but we need

415
00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:03.859 
to have more investment and only after you have enough investment, then the problem will become more interesting to solve.

416
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:12.289 
I hope that you'll see more benefit because I will tell you that you invest that much renewable energy but your capacity is

417
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:19.009 
not fully utilized, you are very sad and the cost is too high, that will demand you to do this kind of load

418
00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:19.549 
shifting.

419
00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:21.759 
Okay.

420
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:28.779 
And so what do you think, how long would it take until these load shifting might be implemented into data centers

421
00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:35.259 
in the real world? Is it going to take quite like, I don't know, 10 or 20 years or is it maybe already earlier?

422
00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:37.920 
10 - 20 is too long.

423
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:46.130 
I usually look at five years, so if the 5 years cannot happen, that means industry is in research collaboration.

424
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:54.309 
So from my point of view, I think the edge environment is a much kind of a stronger phase and we do have very

425
00:31:54.309 --> 00:31:56.950 
strong requirements from telecom business.

426
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:03.460 
In one slide I showed you a demo, we did in the Mobile World Consumption 2022.

427
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:07.859 
This March, we've got a lot of interest from the industry - the telco business.

428
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.069 
The reason is simple, right! You can think that it's an edge.

429
00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:21.380 
You have a lot of distributed stations so they want to use a local renewable energy to power the space station's right.

430
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:26.170 
And then that creates a base for you to do about your workload of scheduling.

431
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.450 
So I think the problem is real and it's starting. How long does it take?

432
00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.170 
I do not know.

433
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:37.859 
I hope that will happen within five maybe 3-5 years or pure guess.

434
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.359 
Do you think it needs like more political incentives or motivations to do that?

435
00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:49.960 
Or more price incentives or is it really just that the research isn't far enough yet

436
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.950 
so you could actually employ that in the real world or what is missing right now?

437
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.440 
Maybe

438
00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.200 
politics.

439
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.299 
I do not know. Policies, I think, if you invest in renewable energy, government is supporting you.

440
00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:07.690 
There's some incentives in government programs, right?

441
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.160 
For technology wise,

442
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.660 
what I mentioned is really a conceptual model.

443
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.549 
You can see that there are challenges.

444
00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:18.049 
I think most research and industry need to move forward.

445
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.839 
Some people ask about the prediction question.

446
00:33:21.849 --> 00:33:23.450 
Yes that's important.

447
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.160 
The accuracy.

448
00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.150 
Yes that's important.

449
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.019 
And then you have to integrate not only the workload of the IT

450
00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:33.539 
management but also the renewable energy source and figure out how these systems work together.

451
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:35.950 
What is the standard? The golden standard,

452
00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:36.750 
Right?

453
00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:39.480 
And then even from the IT part,

454
00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:46.390 
although I kind of say you come migrate the workload but I'm lying a little bit because you need to be very careful on

455
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.170 
the impact of your migration.

456
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:53.900 
Because you can see that the energy proportional chart I showed to you it's not linear.

457
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.720 
Don't think about your migrated workloads will always benefit you.

458
00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.430 
You have to be very smart on the model itself.

459
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.980 
How much workload you're benefiting,

460
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.359 
Right?

461
00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:08.340 
And then the other thing is that when you're migrating the workload there is a cost, the migration cost or network cost.

462
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:10.519 
So it's not always free.

463
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:17.309 
And that also gets to another point of the data because if you do computation, you also have data, where the data comes

464
00:34:17.309 --> 00:34:23.920 
from? And don't always only count the storage or compute but also count the network traffic.

465
00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:27.360 
Do you cause more network traffic or more long distance, what is the model

466
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.250 
you should take care? Otherwise you only have partial vision.

467
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:36.250 
So I want to say really the technology side will have good ideas and I think it's real requirements.

468
00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:44.789 
But we need to be very kind of do lots of study in different models and really think about a user scenario whether that really

469
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.059 
can apply to the real industry and make a big impact.

470
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:58.880 
And that also kind of gets to my last slide, what application change is needed for that to happen because the cut-out and renewable

471
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.159 
energy will be there if you invest a lot of renewable energy, how do we make use of it to lower your costs and reduce

472
00:35:04.159 --> 00:35:05.460 
the carbon emissions as well?

473
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:14.179 
I think that's maybe also what Eric talked a little bit about that applications have to be designed more efficient as well

474
00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:19.960 
so that they're trying to use less and less energy while doing the same thing essentially.

475
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.679 
And yeah, maybe I will just give it back to the round.

476
00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.750 
Any other questions from the audience?

477
00:35:28.139 --> 00:35:30.969 
Maybe just really regarding this point.

478
00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:38.639 
So do you have any collaboration around like software engineers with whom you work together?

479
00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:47.559 
Like for example, there's this new CNCF sustainability group, are you part of this or do you have similar structures where

480
00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:54.510 
you exchange actually with developers? That's a very, very good topic.

481
00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:58.599 
This space, the green computing space isn't new.

482
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.530 
So we,

483
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:10.170 
VMware joined Green Software Foundation, it's a foundation created by quite a few companies, I forgot! Microsoft and then

484
00:36:10.179 --> 00:36:17.809 
Goldman Sachs, and Accenture, and that foundation has I think more than 10,

485
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.739 
around 20 patents already.

486
00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:20.230 
Right?

487
00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:25.750 
But from our participation it is still in the early stage, there are some interesting projects discussion going on.

488
00:36:26.429 --> 00:36:29.110 
What you mentioned, the CNCF sustainability work group,

489
00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:30.480 
it's also just started.

490
00:36:30.489 --> 00:36:36.000 
I'm in there, so you can see my name but I haven't seen any events yet.

491
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.719 
Maybe they're planning, right!

492
00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:46.340 
What you mentioned about is the community of developers, we have to bring the awareness, provide tools and standards

493
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:51.349 
so that we can help the developers to develop green software.

494
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:56.239 
It's really in the early stage, and please help!

495
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:15.230 
I think we skipped the question about the spot market.

496
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.139 
Actually it was just a pointer.

497
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:24.969 
So there is quite an interesting GitHub project out there which would migrate your infrastructure between availability

498
00:37:24.969 --> 00:37:29.239 
zones in that case on AWS based on the spot price.

499
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:39.099 
So maybe the same mechanism of Amazon used to, you know, to disturb your spot using by spiking it but you could probably

500
00:37:39.099 --> 00:37:42.789 
use the same pricing model isn't it?

501
00:37:42.789 --> 00:37:51.099 
Dynamic pricing, bit of pre-warning and after five minutes costs increased by tenfold.

502
00:37:51.099 --> 00:37:57.090 
You just need a big batteries or something like that. Do you think, would that model be applicable?

503
00:37:57.099 --> 00:37:59.809 
I think so, I think so.

504
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.340 
It's a very good idea.

505
00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.730 
I haven't thought about the connection of these two ideas.

506
00:38:04.739 --> 00:38:14.980 
A spot instance itself is a very interesting kind of technology for people to increase the usage of your stranded

507
00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.750 
resource.

508
00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:21.619 
So I think that's a very good idea and if we can embed the same idea that means we have a good business model as

509
00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:28.599 
well to give people incentives. And you already got probably working, I think that project is out there for a few

510
00:38:28.599 --> 00:38:30.380 
years now, so it should be stable.

511
00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:37.650 
I haven't tried it in anger, might be something at least you could tinker with it and we all love tinkering with it!

512
00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:39.039 
That's a good question.

513
00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:45.820 
Yeah!

514
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.360 
Okay!

515
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.119 
I think yeah, we'll just have a look in the chat.

516
00:38:49.119 --> 00:39:04.019 
I think you just mentioned that Spot Price, a spot market idea and any other questions from the audience maybe?

517
00:39:04.019 --> 00:39:10.159 
So, of course, we will put the link that Erick sent to the google spreadsheet, google document.

518
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:14.980 
We can also put that in the recording later on in the clean-IT course.

519
00:39:14.989 --> 00:39:22.349 
And yeah, I think in general what you said about the the load shifting is I think it's a really interesting topic and

520
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:28.050 
I was a bit a little bit surprised when you said that we are really only at the beginning of the high

521
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:34.960 
load shifting topic, I thought that maybe there are some basic principles which are already being applied, but I guess

522
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.480 
it's a really hard logistic problem because you have to look at a lot of different constraints and maybe also kind of related

523
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:48.340 
to that all of you might remember the clean-IT community conference which was a few weeks ago at the HPI.

524
00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:52.369 
And one week prior to that we also had a hackathon at the HPI.

525
00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:55.769 
And one of the challenges was also just about this load shifting.

526
00:39:55.769 --> 00:40:03.150 
So we have had a lot of teams, students from all of Germany, who tried to develop some kind of solutions and ideas

527
00:40:03.159 --> 00:40:09.920 
all around the load shifting and so I think it's really a very recent topic and I'm very interested in maybe we can

528
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:14.880 
see some really important improvements in the next months or years maybe.

529
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:22.530 
Yeah, so I want to say a little bit because in the research side you are ahead of industry, right?

530
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:36.230 
I think that the idea has been there for some time, there are technical research ideas we need to make,

531
00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:44.070 
we still need to address before we really take it into the industry and the industry is really a starting point because we have to

532
00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:51.139 
make sure that it has a real use-case for customers and you have to embed into our system so that takes time.

533
00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:54.519 
Yeah, sure, sure.

534
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:58.389 
But maybe we can see some great improvements soon.

535
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.329 
That would be very important, I think. Okay, cool!

536
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:09.550 
I think with that we're pretty much done, if there are no more questions, just go ahead if you have anything

537
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:16.250 
else set, but then if not I will just share my screen and for the end now, I hope you can all see that

538
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:22.989 
just as a quick note, we will have one more live talk before the summer break as we took last year.

539
00:41:22.989 --> 00:41:30.929 
We will also do probably one or two months break this year in the summer and on the 27th of June we will have another

540
00:41:30.929 --> 00:41:31.190 
talk.

541
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:37.170 
So I think it is in five weeks this time and not in four weeks, but also on Monday of course, as always at 4:00

542
00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:46.219 
PM (16:00) and this time, Ralf Herbrich will again be talking about artificial intelligence and energy and yeah, we will of course post more

543
00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:48.510 
information in the clean-IT forum, as always.

544
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:55.230 
So if you want to be updated and the zoom credentials and everything, you can of course join the forum if you

545
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.320 
haven't done so already.

546
00:41:56.329 --> 00:42:04.989 
And I think with that being said, we are of course going to release some kind of schedule

547
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.880 
after the summer break.

548
00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:11.019 
So for the next half of the year we will also post that in the clean-IT forum as always.

549
00:42:11.409 --> 00:42:14.420 
And yeah, thank you very much for your presentation again.

550
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.210 
I think it was very, very condensed, but very, very interesting really.

551
00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:26.599 
And also for the questions and all the answers and yeah, I hope you also found it very interesting and I hope we can see

552
00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:30.440 
each other again in four weeks and maybe also at the second half of the year.

553
00:42:31.809 --> 00:42:32.639 
Thank you very much.

554
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:34.429 
Thank you.

555
00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:35.440 
Bye.

556
00:42:35.449 --> 00:42:36.530 
Have a nice evening!

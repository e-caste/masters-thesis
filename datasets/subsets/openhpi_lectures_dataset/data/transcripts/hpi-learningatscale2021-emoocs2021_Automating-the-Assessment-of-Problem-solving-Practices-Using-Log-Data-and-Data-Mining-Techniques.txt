00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.550 
hi my name is karen wang.
i have a phd candidate at the graduate

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.980 
school of education at stanford university.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.870 
in today's talk, i will be presenting our last research measuring

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.210 
college students' problem-solving practices using interactive simulations

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.470 
with a specific focus on lock data and data mining techniques.

6
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.490 
in this video presentation i will be addressing three big questions.

7
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
first, what practices are involved in science
and engineering problem-solving.

8
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.290 
second what features can be extracted from the log data of

9
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.740 
students solving an interactive task embedded
in a science simulation.

10
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.820 
and third how useful are these features in
predicting problem solving performance

11
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.920 
and evaluating specific practices.

12
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.870 
problem solving is an important goal of education.

13
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.750 
the national research council has listed practices
related to problem solving

14
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.280 
at the core of the next generation science standers.

15
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.420 
these practices are related to what scientists do to investigate

16
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.260 
the natural world and what engineers do to design and build systems.

17
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
a large part of scientists and engineers jobs involve solving complex

18
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.770 
real world problems. yet exactly what practices go into problem solving

19
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.060 
its still question yet to be fully addressed by research.

20
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.740 
with these questions in mind,
our lab has undertaken a research program to characterize

21
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.410 
measure and teach scientific problem solving practices using

22
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.400 
fit interactive simulations.

23
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.330 
to characterize and measure the practices
used by scientists and engineers

24
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.470 
to solve authentic complex problems, we must first explicate

25
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.340 
the characteristics of authentic problems in science
and engineering domains.

26
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.980 
these problems are open ended have much more solutions
and unknown solution paths.

27
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.360 
they're complex involving many steps require planning
and can all be solved

28
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.020 
by following a set of prescribed rules.

29
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.480 
they're knowledge rich. reaching the goal requires
the selection and application

30
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.630 
of domain-specific knowledge.

31
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.280 
with these characteristics of authentic problems in mind,

32
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.560 
we designed and developed a set of interactive
tasks using the fet simulation platform.

33
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.790 
the circuit construction kit simulation provides an accurate model

34
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.980 
based on ohm's law for every circuit constructed.

35
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.280 
a circuit configuration is hidden behind a black box.

36
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.190 
and this problem solvers job is to figure out
what it is by constructing circuits

37
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.790 
using measurement tools.

38
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.810 
in its deep structure the black box problem resembles
the troubleshooting

39
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.310 
problems that scientists and engineers encounter in their work,

40
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.280 
such as troubleshooting an experiment that did not work as planned

41
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.040 
or debugging a software.

42
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.520 
the problem solver needs to decide what data to collect,

43
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.570 
how to collect the data and how to interpret the data

44
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.960 
using relevant content knowledge to come up with a solution.

45
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.160 
this task allows us to capture students' problem-solving process

46
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.400 
beyond what is possible with traditional paper and pencil tests.

47
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.630 
in our lab's previous work studying how experts and novices

48
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.180 
solve the black box problem.

49
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.500 
we used qualitative research methods to identify eight practices

50
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.890 
that are important for solving complex real world problems.

51
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.070 
these practices are clustered around two categories,

52
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.230 
execution practices and reflection practices,

53
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.160 
execution practices refer to what students do
when solving a problem

54
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.210 
including defining the problem in their own words.

55
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.830 
breaking the problem into small parts,

56
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.380 
collecting the data recording and interpreting the data.

57
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.810 
reflection practices refer to how students reflect about

58
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.110 
what to do when solving a problem.

59
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.450 
including reflecting on problem definition and assumptions,

60
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.380 
reflecting on knowledge, reflecting on strategy

61
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.960 
and reflecting on their solution,

62
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.950 
identifying and scoring evidence of these practices.

63
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.790 
and think aloud protocols are time consuming and labour intensive.

64
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.790 
in this study we explore how to effectively
and efficiently measure these practices

65
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.040 
using log interaction data.

66
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.670 
the following research questions are addressed.

67
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.090 
first what features can be extracted from the log data of students

68
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.850 
solving an interactive task embedded in a science simulation.

69
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.690 
and next how useful are these features in predicting
problem solving performance

70
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.190 
and evaluating specific problem solving practices.

71
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.910 
the procedure of this study is as follows,

72
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.180 
when participants came to the lab they first went
through informed consent.

73
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.680 
and were then given a brief tutorial to learn how to construct circuits

74
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.240 
using the simulation and refresh their knowledge about ohm's law.

75
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.720 
participants were asked to think aloud and were given fifteen minutes

76
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.020 
to work on the problem.

77
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
when the time is up or when they reach the solution
within fifteen minutes.

78
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.740 
they recorded their solution on a piece of paper.

79
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.390 
we use the solution scores as a proxy for participants'
problem-solving performance.

80
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.650 
their solutions were scored using a rubric that
assesses the solution

81
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.980 
in three dimensions.

82
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.260 
did they identify the correct structure of the hidden circuit?

83
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.100 
did they identify the correct component ?

84
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.260 
in this case two resistors in a wire?
and did they identify

85
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.090 
the correct values for the components?
in this case ten and fifteen ohm resistors.

86
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.900 
each dimension has a sub score ranging from zero to two.

87
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.830 
making the total score ranging from zero to six.

88
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.340 
the goal in this study is to evaluate students problem solving process

89
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.310 
beyond their final solutions.

90
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.890 
to this end we turn to the lock data or trace data which captures

91
00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:00.060 
every mouse click cursor move and user initiated actions in the simulation.

92
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.420 
the image here shows five log events out of an average of two

93
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.230 
hundred and thirty thousand events generated by a single participant

94
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.920 
in the fifteen minute task.

95
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.940 
however the large amount of log data does not automatically

96
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.060 
translate into meaningful patterns of students'
problem-solving practices.

97
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.340 
to make sense of the log data we wrote a python script to extract

98
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.380 
information from the jacen file containing
participants' raw interactions.

99
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.230 
the loc data was first pursed into a time stamped sequence

100
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.140 
of actions taken by participants in solving the black box problem.

101
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.130 
for example adding a light bulb to the hidden circuit at a wire

102
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.790 
at a battery use a vote meter.

103
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.860 
then aggregated individual actions into a count of electrical

104
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.060 
components and measurement tools used.

105
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.000 
these features form the first set of action based features

106
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.910 
to be used as independent variables in a regression model predicting

107
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.440 
students solution scores.

108
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.350 
this table presents the best fitting model using action based

109
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.860 
features to predict students solution scores.

110
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.950 
none of the action based features is a significant predictor,

111
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.030 
and the only significant predictor is students'
education background in physics.

112
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.220 
students who have taken higher levels of physics courses are

113
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.690 
more likely to score higher.

114
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.970 
the adjusted r squared of this model is zero point one six,

115
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.920 
indicating that only sixteen percent of the variance in the

116
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.810 
solution scores is accounted for.

117
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.360 
the question is can we do better than this?

118
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.750 
through qualitative observation of students' problem-solving process

119
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.090 
we noted that the type of circuits built by students were closely

120
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.330 
related to the practices used by them to solve the problem.

121
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.010 
this knowledge led us to extract a second
set of knowledge grounded features

122
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.180 
by parsing the log data into distinct episodes of constructing circuits

123
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.330 
taking measurements and pausing in between these episodes.

124
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.680 
specifically most of the circuits built by students

125
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.760 
fell into two categories.

126
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.790 
simple circuits that connect two terminals and complex circuits

127
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.240 
that connect more than two terminals at a time.

128
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.350 
the knowledge grounded features including
the number of circuits constructed

129
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.850 
pairs of terminals connected by simple circuits

130
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.640 
percentage of circuits that were complex,

131
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.700 
different types of vote meter readings,
and meter readings and pause time

132
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.360 
are used as independent variables in a linear regression model

133
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.670 
to predict students' solution scores.

134
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.930 
the model using knowledge grounded features has an adjusted

135
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.810 
r square of point six o.

136
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.230 
indicating that sixty percent of the variance in solution scores

137
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.170 
can be accounted for by the model.

138
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.810 
a subset of the knowledge grounded features are significant

139
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.160 
or marginally significant predictors of
students' problem-solving performance

140
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.170 
including the pairs of terminals that
were connected by simple circuits.

141
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.960 
the percentage of circuits built that were complex.

142
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:32.010 
the n meter readings and pause time after using the n meter.

143
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.920 
in addition knowledge grounded features are
also significant predictors

144
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.480 
of a specific problem-solving practices.

145
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:47.630 
the effectiveness of these practices were first coded by two researchers

146
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.830 
using a rubric developed in previous research.

147
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.090 
in the regression models

148
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.820 
the knowledge grounded features accounted for seventy seven

149
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.490 
percent of the variance in the scores measuring
the practice of decomposition.

150
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.030 
sixty four percent of the variance in the scores measuring

151
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.740 
the practice of data collection,

152
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.740 
and fifty eight percent of the variance in the scores
measuring the practice

153
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.900 
of data recording.

154
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.600 
in summary this study made the following discoveries.

155
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.920 
knowledge grounded features extracted from the log data are

156
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.520 
better predictors of problem solving performance
than action based features.

157
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.040 
knowledge grounded features also provide important evidence

158
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.670 
for evaluating specific problem solving practices

159
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.480 
including decomposition data collection and data recording.

160
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.930 
many people are involved in making this study and analysis possible.

161
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:56.080 
there my adviser karl shima and our student research associates require

162
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.470 
ana max and christian.

163
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.260 
we also like to thank the fet development team and the mohr foundation

164
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.380 
for their support.

165
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.100 
i welcome your questions and comments. thank you.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.819 
Welcome to this video clip in which we discuss the Practical Aspects of Automated

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.110 
Conformance Checking.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.169 
So, the starting point of any automated conformance check analysis

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.414 
is a blueprint process model. This is something that we have discussed and highlighted

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.199 
many times before, so this is also what we need here and we

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.350 
can simply create such a blueprint process model

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.208 
using BPMN, and all we need to sort of say for

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.190 
LANA, is to provide this process model in the BPMN format.

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.659 
There are several editors available for creating such models and

10
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.992 
we need to save and then upload them in the BPMN format and then can

11
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.540 
start with our automated conformance checking analysis.

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.356 
The first step is then to assign this model to the lock

13
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.289 
and of course, and we may have different logs and different models with different

14
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.789 
analyzes in our tool, so we need to tell the tool explicitly,

15
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.700 
ok, this is our event log.

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.019 
What is the corresponding model?

17
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.377 
We simply assign the model to this log and then we can continue

18
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.790 
with our analysis.

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.914 
A very important step that we have to conduct is actually: relate

20
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.680 
activities and events.

21
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.972 
This is something that we haven't discussed before and it may come as a little

22
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.180 
bit of a surprise, but we need to tell the tool which activity from the model

23
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.190 
corresponds to which event from the log.

24
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.369 
So, in our example that we have used, we have simply always used the same

25
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.409 
terms, the same names as we check claim completeness in the log was

26
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.939 
always check claim completeness in the model.

27
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.699 
In reality, you cannot expect this to be the case, especially if you

28
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.559 
derive events from a system, they may have actually very technical names unless

29
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.647 
you rename them, of course. So there is a step where you simply

30
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.919 
have to explicitly explain or tell the tool, OK, what activity

31
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.569 
from the model corresponds to which event in the log and you may also

32
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.009 
actually encounter a case where there are events in the log

33
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.539 
for which you do not have an activity in the model and the other way around.

34
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.979 
This is not per se a problem, this is simply something that the tool needs to know and

35
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.180 
you need to configure this.

36
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.879 
So, what you're going to see after assigning the model in LANA is this dialog here

37
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.216 
where LANA shows you what LANA has figured,

38
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.399 
which activity from the model corresponds to which event from

39
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.215 
your event log. At this point, you cannot really correct this, if

40
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.110 
there are any mistakes, you have to go back into the log and adapt the

41
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.433 
name so that matches them automatically but the idea is, of course,

42
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.589 
that you have to establish this connection, without this connection, there is no

43
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.509 
automated analysis possible.

44
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.469 
Yeah, so this is something that has to be established and in some cases, it really has to

45
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.939 
be established manually.

46
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.419 
Once you have this, you can start your actual analysis, and then you can

47
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.825 
basically run the analysis and the conformance checking analysis that is very similar

48
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.439 
to the conformance checking principle that we have discussed earlier.

49
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.719 
So, it's based on this notion of alignment and comparing the log and the model traces

50
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.120 
and line. LANA does automatically detect violation patterns.

51
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.199 
So, if we look into our example again, so

52
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.919 
this is then the output from, one of the outputs from LANA.

53
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.840 
This is the model that I have assigned. And what you see here is that is enriched

54
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.303 
with information as we use frequency-related information,

55
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.139 
that's about the color here, but you also see that there are some symbols and some

56
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.699 
red lines here, and what these symbols mean is that

57
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.229 
these activities have been skipped in some instances and here this

58
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.669 
yellow symbol indicates that there has been a swap or

59
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.139 
LANA calls this a switch, that this activity has been switched in some instances.

60
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.208 
The red line then also indicates that this is a process flow that is not

61
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.612 
included in the model but has been simply observed in the event log, so that's something

62
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.490 
that has happened and in this way, using these

63
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.639 
illustrations, this model tries to provide a nice overview of the conformance

64
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.529 
violations that have been detected.

65
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.800 
You can, of course, click on each of these violations.

66
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.629 
So what you see here is that in the claim coverage,

67
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.290 
you can see that this has occurred just once.

68
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.540 
So it's a very rare violation and there is some additional information provided

69
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.369 
with respect to the duration, which we will not go into detail.

70
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.055 
If we click on the other violation, for instance, under

71
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.499 
receive claim review, we also get some information.

72
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.380 
We see that the received claim review skip has actually occurred

73
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.481 
over 1500 times, so this is a very, very frequent violation

74
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.010 
in this setting and there is also some additional information provided

75
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.600 
on that violation.

76
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.929 
So in this way, we can get a first overview of the violations

77
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.115 
that have occurred or that we have identified using our automated

78
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.463 
conformance analysis, and there are also some other views

79
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.310 
that provide us with additional information.

80
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.480 
The first one is this deviation view, so what you see here is an overview

81
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.280 
of all the deviations that LANA has detected here

82
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.660 
and this is, of course, very helpful because you see on the one hand what

83
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.579 
type of problem has occurred. So you see that we have three skip's, three

84
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.259 
activity steps have been skipped and there is one order switch and

85
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.980 
we see here the activity that has been affected by this and we also see the frequency.

86
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.969 
So you see that we have one problem related to the order switch that has occurred

87
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.870 
just once and you see that this activity

88
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.470 
skip is related to the claim review, receiving the claim review has been

89
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.929 
skipped over 1500 times, and this is, of course, very important to have

90
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.370 
a frequency indicator.

91
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.455 
The conclusions you draw from this might be varied, depending

92
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.119 
on the context again. So maybe we decide, OK, this just happened once,

93
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.740 
maybe we don't have to even look at this, but maybe we also conclude that

94
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.018 
although this only happened once, this is a very severe violation, so we

95
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.696 
definitely need to look into this.

96
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.040 
And here this violation is very frequent, so it's

97
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.762 
so frequent that we actually probably need to wonder whether this is

98
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.399 
a violation at all or whether this is some behavior that we need to include

99
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.079 
in the model. But then again, depends on the context and we probably have to consult

100
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.290 
the domain expert to draw any conclusions.

101
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.579 
But this view helps you to get the first overview.

102
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.816 
The second view is this,

103
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.466 
where you can see the violation patterns very nicely.

104
00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:24.868 
It is this view of the variance, what you can see

105
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.420 
here are the different variances. So you see here are the variant groups, 41 to

106
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.238 
45, so the rather infrequent variance and you see on

107
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.434 
the right-hand side the activities that have been recorded for each of these different

108
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.963 
variants and what you see for the nonconforming

109
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.539 
variance is that the violation parents are included.

110
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.949 
So here you see there is a skip here, so the invite claim of activity has been skipped

111
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.054 
here and in this variance, you see that there is a switch-insert

112
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.600 
and the switch-skip.

113
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.653 
So, Lana obviously differentiates whether there is a switch-insert

114
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.209 
or switch-skip that is very much in line with our discussions, we had earlier.

115
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.493 
So, you may remember from the conformists checking lecturer that we

116
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.569 
have observed that we first have observed that an activity is missing,

117
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.250 
although we expected it to happen.

118
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.236 
And then at another point, we realized now it's coming, although we didn't expect it

119
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.860 
to happen anymore. So this is exactly the concept that is picked up here,

120
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.070 
so based on this notion of alignment, we see very specific information

121
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.839 
on the type of violation pattern and the type of violation that has occurred and

122
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.739 
is provided in this view.

123
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.119 
So, what we see is that this automated conformists

124
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.897 
analysis provides us very quickly with quite rich insights into violation

125
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.059 
patterns and provides a very important basis for then

126
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.049 
following up. Important to realize that this is just input to

127
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.210 
what the conformance checking analysis does not reveal is how to fix these problems,

128
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.760 
whether these are problems at all.

129
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:14.139 
So this is something that needs to be discussed with domain experts once

130
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.769 
they have once these violation parents have been discovered.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.550 
Ladies and gentlemen I'd like
to welcome you to the second

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.160 
week of our course on business
process modeling and analysis.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.330 
In this week we'll be covering
basic business process modeling.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.030 
Six video clips will be provided this week.
The first one deals with fundamentals

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.350 
of modeling languages, the second one
looks at process activities in BPMN,

6
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.580 
the third one looks at gateways
exclusive gateway and the

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.340 
parallel gateway both in the split
variant and in the joint variant.

8
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.760 
Video clip 2.4 looks at
inclusive gateways also at loops,

9
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
2.5 start events and
end events of process models

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.830 
and 2.6 covers
intermediate events.

11
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.470 
Right, so basic business
process modeling.

12
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.200 
Business process models are abstract
representations of originals

13
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.560 
with the feature mapping, abstraction and
pragmatics. This is what we learned

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.970 
last week when we were discussing
the properties of models

15
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.670 
from the modeling
theory.

16
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.900 
And here we have an example of a
business process model that

17
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.680 
specifies what are the activities
we need to perform in order

18
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.370 
to process an
insurance claim.

19
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.510 
And this process model is an
abstract representation of the

20
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.290 
process as it runs in
the insurance company

21
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.730 
because only the main
activities are shown here

22
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020 
and also certain things are
abstracted from so maybe activities

23
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.360 
that are not so important are
abstracted from it, if I need to copy

24
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.030 
Something, if I need to
put the documents from

25
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.280 
one office to another office
these types of activities

26
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.280 
are extracted from
here for instance.

27
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.590 
But it still covers the
pragmatics because I can

28
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.890 
use these process model instead of
the original process which is

29
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.510 
really not easy to go to grasp if you
don't have a model representation for it.

30
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.440 
So putting it the other way around,
business process modeling

31
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.620 
languages need to express exactly
what we like to represent

32
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.330 
in business
process models.

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.870 
So we need these languages need to provide
language constructs to represent

34
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.680 
the important aspects of
business process models.

35
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.240 
In general business processes
consists or general languages

36
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.750 
consists of concepts and their
relationships. So that's a very

37
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.760 
let's say fundamental finding, so when
whenever we encounter language

38
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.160 
the language contains concepts
and their relationship. And this

39
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.910 
is also called the abstract
syntax of the language.

40
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.660 
Then we need to express the
concepts of the language and in

41
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.710 
order to do that we need something called
a concrete syntax or the notation.

42
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.360 
And finally the elements the
concepts need to have a meaning

43
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.710 
and that is the semantics
of the language.

44
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.560 
I could spend almost a week to
discuss all these these things in

45
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.720 
a lot of detail but in the context
of this course I'd like to

46
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.120 
informally introduce to you the
concepts of abstract syntax,

47
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.860 
concrete syntax or
notation and semantics.

48
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.220 
So the first thing is abstract
Syntax. So what are the concepts

49
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.540 
and the relationships that we
find now in business process

50
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.850 
modeling languages?

51
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.240 
And if I look in this example we
see well there are a number

52
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.230 
of concepts that are provided by
the language. One concept is

53
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.690 
the concept of the activity. So
activity is a concept that is

54
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.320 
available in the language and that
makes sense because we need to

55
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.330 
model activities in organizations
as part of business processes.

56
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.930 
And this concept is used here four
times. So we have four activities.

57
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.400 
So the concepts of an the concept of an
activity is used four times in this

58
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.810 
process model. What is the other
concept? The other concept is

59
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.440 
a sequence flow, we need to have
ordering execution ordering

60
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.050 
that's a second concept. The second concepts
the context of the abstract syntax

61
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.450 
then we have the sequence
flow is what you see here

62
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.900 
Then you see that the gateway
there is one gateway that's a

63
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.800 
decision point or point
where concurrency starts

64
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.780 
and we have events,
this is for events.

65
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.550 
So in order to capture business
processes we at least needs

66
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.500 
the following concepts and
that is the activity,

67
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.920 
sequence flow, gateway and the
event. And these are elements

68
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.090 
of the abstract syntax, so there
is something like an activity,

69
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.700 
there is something like a sequence
flow, there is something

70
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.620 
like a gateway and there
is also something

71
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.430 
like an event.

72
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.870 
But now we need to have ways to
express that and of course

73
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.670 
it is already expressed in this slide
and that's also part of the language.

74
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.470 
I could use any symbol to describe
an activity. I could use

75
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.480 
many different symbols to describe
sequence flow gateways and events,

76
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.030 
but the language comes with the
notation and the notation is

77
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.480 
what you see here. So the
activities are represented by

78
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.380 
rectangles with a rounded edge, so the
sequence flow is represented by an edge,

79
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.610 
so that gateways are represented
by this a diamond shaped symbol

80
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.890 
and events are
represented by circle.

81
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.060 
So could we create a language with the
same concept and a different notation?

82
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.590 
Yes we could do that. So let's
try to do

83
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.560 
That. But before we try to do that i briefly
like to say something about semantics.

84
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.970 
We will discuss semantics of modeling of
process models throughout this course so

85
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.950 
and we already did. So the
semantics of a

86
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.450 
language as the meaning of the
elements that we see here. So

87
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.230 
the meaning of an activity in
activities stands for something

88
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.600 
activity you conduct during the
operational and business that takes time

89
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.470 
and that is performed by resources
by roles in the organization.

90
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.580 
So all these elements have a
semantics and also the process

91
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.350 
as a whole has a semantics and that
is the execution semantics. So by

92
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.240 
sequence flow we can specify the
order in which the activities

93
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.240 
have to be executed and using
the decisions for instance

94
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.830 
we can also have alternative paths
that are executed here. Though

95
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.820 
the semantics is basically the
execution semantics that is specified

96
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.970 
by the process model.

97
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.820 
All right but no we wanted to
create a language with the same

98
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.330 
concept of different
notation.

99
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.540 
Ok so let's try to do
that using the pen.

100
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.770 
We could

101
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.190 
say that we use

102
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.090 
the triangle
formed event.

103
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.330 
This ellipse
for an activity

104
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.920 
and a these box
for a decision.

105
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.050 
Then we could draw the same process
model in a different notation

106
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.780 
so it has the same concept the same
abstract syntax these other three

107
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.820 
elements that we have here plus
the sequence flow. Letâ€™s do the

108
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.840 
sequence flow the same as before
and now I can start drawing

109
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.390 
this process model in our new
notation. So that starts

110
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.010 
with an event I'm not
writing this because that's

111
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.420 
too much complexity here for this
slide, then we have an activity

112
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.800 
that is registered
claim.

113
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.050 
then we have an activity that is
decide on claim coverage forget this

114
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.550 
plus symbol for
the time being,

115
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.120 
then we have a decision decision
is something like that,

116
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.390 
then I have another activity and
another activity and here I have

117
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.550 
another

118
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.570 
another event and that
could be the model.

119
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.090 
Now but the question is a good
idea is it not a good idea well

120
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.980 
I think it's not a good idea,
because the standard for concepts

121
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.900 
and notation eases communication.
And therefore it's not only

122
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.980 
the abstract syntax of the elements
that is specified by BPMN

123
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.470 
for instance but also the
notation that makes of course

124
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.850 
makes it easy to understand a
model that other people have

125
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.470 
have created.

126
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.000 
Alright that brings us to the
end to the business process

127
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.010 
model and notation.
We will

128
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.790 
be discussing version two
of this industry standard

129
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.560 
industry standard by the
object management group.

130
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.130 
In previous versions the acronym spelled
out to business process modeling notation

131
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.530 
version two changed also this
but I think it's fine

132
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.750 
to say any of these
two or just BPMN.

133
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.140 
It is an expressive modeling language
expressive process modeling

134
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.960 
language but also
quite a flexible one.

135
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.520 
It allows to use different
sets of modeling concepts

136
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.370 
so we can start with a minimal set of
modeling concepts and create already quite

137
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.970 
a meaningful
process models.

138
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.980 
BPMN focuses on operational business
processes and so it is not suited for

139
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.030 
process landscapes, for organizational
structure also not for

140
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.350 
data structure and for
IT infrastructures.

141
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.230 
Therefore in most projects other modeling
languages would complement BPMN

142
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.160 
to express things like process
landscapes organization a data

143
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.450 
structure IT infrastructure
for instance.

144
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.400 
There are a number of notation
categories of BPMN and these on these

145
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.660 
four categories three of them we
will be discussing this week.

146
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:31.350 
And so one is the flow objects
so these are the objects that

147
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.400 
can be embedded in the
flow of the process.

148
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.170 
There are artifacts

149
00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.100 
that represents additional
information that is used for the

150
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:47.530 
Process. There are connecting objects,
these connecting objects can connect

151
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.980 
flow objects. Not all flow objects but
specific connection rules apply here.

152
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.620 
And also later we discussed swim
Lanes, this is great out here.

153
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.570 
Look at swim lanes lines in this
week will come to this later.

154
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.710 
In particular we look at events
activities and gateways related

155
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.300 
to flow objects, we look at the
notations regarding defects

156
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.050 
and we look at sequence flow
regarding connecting objects.

157
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.680 
And that concludes videoclip 2.1
where we discuss fundamentals

158
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.150 
of modeling languages.

159
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.620 
We were discussing what an abstract
syntax of language is. We

160
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.860 
also discuss with the concrete
syntax or notation of language is.

161
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.520 
We briefly sketched what execution
semantics is. We will come

162
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.860 
to semantics of a process a model
throughout this course, and we

163
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.720 
talked a little bit about BPMN
as the industry standard

164

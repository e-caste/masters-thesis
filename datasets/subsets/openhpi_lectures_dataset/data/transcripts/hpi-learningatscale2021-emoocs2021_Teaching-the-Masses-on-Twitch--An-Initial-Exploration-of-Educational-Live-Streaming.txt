1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780 
through a descriptive study of one hundred popular gaming streams.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.610 
we systematized inductively found streaming features.

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.550 
we took these top one hundred because we argue that they do something fundamentally right.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.340 
so that people continue to watch these basic features were identified,

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.110 
then we took twenty educational streamers and we mean real lecturers and professors.

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.510 
and analyzed what they do and how they do it.

7
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.130 
what these edu streamers unite is growth teaching wasn't a

8
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.640 
usual business in twenty twenty and for the streaming ecosystem.

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.630 
the year was unusual in terms of growth.

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.680 
youtube had over one hundred billion hours twitch has lost

11
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.580 
one point nine billion hours of life watch time top gaming

12
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.870 
channels attract eleven to fifteen thousand viewers in an average stream.

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.590 
top educational content has something between six hundred and thousand viewers

14
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.160 
when we submitted the paper the trend was already viable for twenty twenty one.

15
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.940 
the updated charge for average monthly educational views and

16
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.270 
channel's streaming in the science and technology category is increasing.

17
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.290 
another key finding was the presence of almost every faculty.

18
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.960 
yes the representatives from the field of math and they are somewhat dominant in numbers.

19
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.980 
but in all of these categories students can choose between different lecturers.

20
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.520 
as for the student side not too much is known because the principle of

21
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.900 
anonymity of user names is written in all caps in the internet.

22
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.010 
watching the streamers over period of two months we inferred three major groups

23
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.950 
of enrolled students that have been navigated to this particular

24
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
distribution of their classroom strangers randomly finding
an educational stream

25
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.710 
and regular watchers aka internet strangers that kept coming back.

26
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.730 
here are more features that are prone to be included in educational streams.

27
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.570 
for now we focus on the following question,

28
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.530 
how does a professor interact with a mixed crowd while broadcasting

29
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.660 
a screen into the ether.
but once there's a chat and now you

30
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.070 
may think that this might be a silent zone as it is in video conferences.

31
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.290 
but within the analyzed streams the classrooms either had a

32
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.120 
private back channel in their lms or dischord, or the public

33
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.550 
jet was actively used.
even more so all viewers are sometimes collectively addressed as
the chat.

34
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.970 
â€ºanother way a pull mechanisms that are initiated by the viewers.

35
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.250 
as way to influence the stream changes the background music.

36
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.650 
asking a question anonymously triggering frequently asked questions by check command

37
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.410 
or redeeming channel points.

38
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.330 
checking the learning progress in class could be done by a

39
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.590 
lecturer by using click maps. and gaming streams they are often

40
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.790 
used to let the audience decide what card or move to play next.

41
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.040 
in academic and academic streams you could ask about the correct thermal dynamic product.

42
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.260 
as seen in this chemistry lecture. for the munk community we

43
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.640 
recommend to include some synchronous sessions, because you

44
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.480 
can bring your audience or you stay with your learners in a private streaming session,

45
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.230 
when it comes to platforms the technical infrastructure to reach students

46
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.880 
seems to be more important for lecturers as of now.

47
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
more recommendations and future research areas can be found in the paper.

48
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.120 
for now i thank you for watching and can regards from the HPI.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.550 
Hello and welcome to this little
video unit on openSAP learning

2
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.270 
behaviour in times
of crisis.

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.250 
my name is Michaela Laemmler. I am
working for SAP since twenty years now.

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.600 
and I'm leading the openSAP team. OpenSAP
is SAP's free learning platform

5
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.720 
and was founded
in 2013.

6
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.930 
I'm very happy that I can be part
of this year's openHPI forum,

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.520 
although it's in a different,
let's say format, not in person,

8
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
not presenting in person in
Potsdam, but reaching out to you

9
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.680 
in this openHPI course.

10
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.720 
I'm very happy to give you some
insights about openSAP and how we

11
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.150 
with our team or with our learners went
through the times of crisis so far.

12
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.740 
and how we plan to continue, of
course in the next month and years,

13
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.680 
because the situation
needs a kind of change

14
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.680 
a kind of push for the digital
formats and I would

15
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.620 
like to share with you the findings.
a few words about openSAP.

16
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.710 
because you need to know a
bit where we come from.

17
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.030 
in 2013 openSAP was
founded by my

18
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.450 
dear colleague **
, so he will

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840 
be able to meeting, because
he will do a kind of little

20
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.900 
workshop during the
hpi forum.

21
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.250 
and so I would like to give
you an idea why openSAP

22
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.870 
was founded in 2013,
because there was a need

23
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.230 
to reach out globally to customers
and partners, students, prospects

24
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.580 
of SAP, the SAP ecosystem
and to share with them

25
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.440 
the knowledge of the latest
innovations. at that time SAP

26
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.960 
hanna was the main, let's
say, focus topic also for

27
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.160 
us when we started. and when we
decided to use the format of moocs,

28
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.610 
massive of open online courses
and give it a try, also

29
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.900 
from SAP perspective
if it works or not.

30
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.310 
this was a really good decision
from our perspective.

31
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.460 
it was a mixture of really
good platform. so thanks

32
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.950 
to professor Minel and the
openHPI team that we could make

33
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.070 
this journey together so far. and
that we had chosen the right one

34
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.080 
to be very honest. and we
are very happy with this

35
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.860 
partnership and i would like to
especially mentioned that.

36
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.840 
of course the moocs, the
massive open online courses,

37
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.500 
this is a kind of

38
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.570 
classroom like format
that we use videos,

39
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.240 
learning videos they are made
from our SAP experts. so

40
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.760 
they talk to the learners directly
from the product management

41
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.810 
or development side. this
is important to us.

42
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.340 
and of course we bring the learners
and the SAP experts together

43
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.240 
in the discussion forum and
this works very well. so we

44
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.440 
call it enterprise moves in
the meantime. and we produce

45
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.270 
around forty courses per year. this is
the heart of our openSAP offering.

46
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.040 
we have gained and we have
just passed the one

47
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.170 
million unique learners' unique
registrations on the openSAP platform.

48
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.920 
we are very proud of it because it really
works and people join us individually

49
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.850 
to learn with openSAP.
of course, we did not

50
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.890 
forget to also make
our offering

51
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.240 
even more attractive. and
so we here and there

52
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.510 
developed different things
with regards to the MOOCs.

53
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.890 
together with the openHPI team.
we have native apps available

54
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.600 
for example and we just recently
and that it was a lucky time

55
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.180 
for us, if we take it as
a letter with a view on

56
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.090 
the epidemic situation
the corona crisis

57
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.380 
that we added last year at end
of last year, early this year,

58
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.880 
also, the so-called openSAP
microlearning season, a little

59
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.570 
self contained videos knowledge
nuggets, where we say ok

60
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.260 
here and there in our products
we have some updates and for

61
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.340 
these updates. we do not need
to create a complete course.

62
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.810 
so we just add these
knowledge bides.

63
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.990 
and for sure also we added a podcast
environment also as a complimentary offering

64
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.250 
to our courses to the
heart of our MOOCs.

65
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.640 
this is basically it.

66
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.380 
so and now i would like to show
you as well on the next slide

67
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.050 
how we went through
the crisis so far.

68
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.320 
when we yeah had the lockdown
situation in germany

69
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.230 
in march

70
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.090 
early march. we got the week west
from our board area questioned line

71
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.170 
to create a digital learning
initiative, now so to let

72
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.060 
the SAP eco-system
know hey. we offer

73
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.980 
you something in this time
frame, so that you have

74
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.440 
the possibility to learn for
free to learn what you need.

75
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.080 
and to continue your
professional career.

76
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.200 
and so there was a kind of, it
was called new digital learning

77
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.340 
initiative, this was promoted and
we changed our homepage this time

78
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.360 
by purpose. so we edit
links to different sites

79
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.690 
that we promoted actively. so in a way,
we rooted learners away by purpose

80
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.690 
from openSAP. but believe
me we still had enough

81
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.660 
learners who stayed and also went
into the courses and you see that

82
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.280 
in few seconds. what did we do
we wanted to offer something

83
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.990 
especially for pupils and
teachers. so we made use of

84
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.070 
our openSAP young thinkers program. this
is also a little program where we

85
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:38.660 
teach in schools, usually so
that also pupils and teacher

86
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.460 
can make use of how
to program and to

87
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.410 
learn this and of course, we also
promoted the hpi school loud

88
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.250 
with a link. and then we did a kind
of special offering for students.

89
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.830 
students we rooted them to the so
called SAP learning up. this is

90
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.640 
the subscription based on digital
platform, running platform

91
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.760 
from SAP side. and there was a
special use case for students

92
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.870 
where they were offered a free
edition, also during a certain

93
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.380 
time frame for three months, to
learn about SAP innovations.

94
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.080 
and then of course we said okay
for the global learners.

95
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.940 
we also offer our openSAP
courses and also those courses

96
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.380 
which were already in
self-paced mode we opened

97
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.540 
the excess to gain a record of achievement
a little online certificate.

98
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.220 
and as you can see on the right
side of the slide. we gained

99
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.830 
a lot of attraction to
these promoted sides. and

100
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.620 
in total, we had more than
eighty thousand outlinks. so

101
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.960 
this had a huge effect also
due to the promotion with an

102
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.670 
SAP press release. but also because
of course learning behaviour

103
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.350 
especially in this time
frame. in the first three

104
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.340 
months of the pandemic
situation started

105
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.530 
to be very high. and if we
move to the next slide.

106
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.320 
I can show you for example the
new reaches that learners on

107
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.090 
openSAP per month. so what you
immediately see is that there

108
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.880 
is the difference between blue and
green bars and the green bars

109
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.990 
are especially showing the time
frame from march to June. although

110
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.530 
it's clear that we are still in
the pandemic, but this was

111
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.920 
yet during the first month
we had a very very

112
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.110 
high attraction of lerner's
with our offering. and

113
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.760 
where we saw that people are
very keen to learn, keen to

114
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.670 
use openSAP and
its offerings.

115
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.120 
so of course you can see that
there is still a difference

116
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:12.040 
to the world before. and after
but the question now.

117
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.720 
is there a new normal?
this is hard to

118
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.890 
answer, because it's not a
kind of yes or no question.

119
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.440 
since quite some years. of course
digital learning is a need.

120
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.540 
it's quite popular, of course people
select the certain offerings they like.

121
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.760 
there is a lot
out there and

122
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.640 
this is already a
change since years.

123
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.840 
but of course in this time where
people are not allowed to travel,

124
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:46.800 
aware that the travel is restricted,
especially if I speak about my company

125
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.530 
we do not travel at all during
this year. and we don't

126
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.130 
know yet what will happen next year,
if this will change if we will be

127
00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.720 
back to a kind of normality as
it was before I doubt. but

128
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.700 
of course we could prove
during this time that

129
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.690 
such a learning platform has a
huge potential and a huge reach.

130
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:15.390 
so we gained over this
time in each month

131
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.150 
more than twenty five thousand
new registrations of new

132
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.940 
learners joining the openSAP
platform, joining the courses.

133
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:29.200 
and as you can see also in the
time after, so until september

134
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.420 
but in october it's quite the
same picture. we still have an

135
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.480 
increase, if we compare it to
the years before. so the

136
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.740 
assumption is of course that
the corona rises changed

137
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.860 
of course also the
learning behaviour

138
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.520 
and this will persist from
my perspective. and i

139
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.870 
mean let's see.

140
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.440 
i cannot predict to say ok
there will be a change but

141
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.340 
what we can do is next
year to take a look back

142
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:07.120 
how the next month's that we
are now have in front of us,

143
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.820 
how they will change or influence.
of course the darling

144
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:15.660 
baby of our learners. and yeah how
they use the digital formats.

145
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.570 
so with that i would like
to end this little video.

146
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:27.620 
you can see here on the last
slide and happy team. this

147
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.190 
was in another time. so this
is already a three years

148
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.330 
ago or two and a half years
ago. and what we of

149
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.970 
course had a challenge over the
past month was to make sure

150
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.840 
that we could start or continue
our course production.

151
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.260 
and this was not so easy because
immediately from march on

152
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.900 
we were in a in a home office
situation. and you see here that

153
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.530 
i am still in the home
office. this is my home,

154
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:05.030 
my little office where I
am in since march. and

155
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.890 
so we face then of course besides
the fact that we had an increase

156
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.910 
in learners. we faced the situation how
to continue with a scalable production.

157
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.650 
how to continue with video
recordings. because if you think

158
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.920 
of the microlearning. of
course, the big moose courses

159
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:30.270 
that we put use with roughly yeah
thirty video units per course.

160
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.690 
and coming from an
on-site recording in a

161
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.120 
video studio in waldorf and
in other SAP locations. we

162
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.070 
had the challenge. ok how can we
do this now in a remote way.

163
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.420 
we were lucky because we already
started at last year,

164
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.210 
a little project within our
team where we said ok we need

165
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.790 
to face the situation that people
are not allowed to travel

166
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.150 
all the time for recording a
video session. just keep in

167
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.470 
mind that in some areas we
have globally have employees

168
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.260 
that are working together with
us. and they are not allowed

169
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:15.420 
to travel just for a video unit.
so we wanted to have a perfect

170
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.840 
environment for a remote recording
as good as possible. and

171
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.500 
so we were lucky that we started
that already last year. and so we

172
00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:30.750 
were just ready in time to
do the remote recording

173
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.380 
in a scalable way. and if you are
interested how it works are

174
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.450 
and how we do this. and how
we do this remotely and get

175
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:44.650 
some insights from a video expert
then just go to the next

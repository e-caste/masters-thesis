00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.590 
Ok, so we heard a lot
of issues that you

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.040 
can have or that can come up
with a coordination or in the

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.320 
context of coordination
of remote teams.

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.830 
Are there other issues that
can come up in other areas?

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.900 
yes, definitely there are and when
we talk before about coordination.

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.180 
It means that coordination
between everyone.

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.740 
Not just the management
not just employees

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.690 
but also there is necessary
to have at leadership.

9
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.990 
A team that is leading the whole
process of working outside

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.510 
working remotely working at
home, it is necessary to have

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.220 
some special consideration
on that regard because

12
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.990 
the management and the
leadership is the one

13
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.530 
that pushes this in front, we
can expect from employees

14
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
to drive this forward but if
the leadership doesn't play

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.330 
a role of really bringing
this forward, this will not

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.430 
happen and then you
will have some issues

17
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.530 
in defining particularly, targets
if you don't define the targets

18
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.390 
and when i say define the
target is make them written

19
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.770 
put it somewhere where
everyone can see them

20
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.860 
and everyone will see who is
necessary to achieve what and when

21
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.990 
this leadership in terms of
the achievement of the goals

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
is probably the most important task
and when the team is clearly

23
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.110 
informed about what is happening
then it will happen.

24
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.770 
Also very very important is that
if you have a small team that

25
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.330 
is working remotely but
you wanted to keep it

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.130 
hidden from the rest
of the organization

27
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.580 
big mistake, big mistake because
then the others want to

28
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.280 
go there why i'm not
selected why is this team

29
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.190 
make it official make it official
and make a day we are going

30
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.550 
to try this
working model.

31
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.350 
and give the others the
chance to participate

32
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.640 
you have to have an input not
just from the people that are

33
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.530 
working outside but also
from the people that are

34
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.870 
sitting there...... So you basically
tell the others that are

35
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.190 
not selected that
you are kind of

36
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.360 
just starting with the
experiment and you want

37
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.050 
to see how it goes and
then you will extend

38
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.270 
the problem. Exactly it is if you
keep information hidden from

39
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.610 
the rest of the organization you
will have definitely definitely

40
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.480 
a problem and also its extremely
important those people that are

41
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.950 
outside, that are working
remotely you have to

42
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.320 
to hear them you need feedback from
them, "ehy.. I have problem with

43
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.350 
this" potentially I don't know
"I cannot connect to the email

44
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.950 
server" whatever the problem
is and don't wait, don't wait for

45
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.810 
this to happen probably in the
next meeting in three weeks.

46
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.000 
No, constantly ask
feedback in this.

47
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.140 
In this let's say remote world
it is extremely important if

48
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.340 
you wait you lose....... So it actually
would make sense to have more

49
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.110 
meetings in remote work....
exactly... meetings maybe daily

50
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.070 
short meetings..... Exactly we may
need to use in that case your

51
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.980 
tools, that you suggested before
but it is extremely important.

52
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.940 
Feedback if you don't
have a feedback channel

53
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.440 
or but attention not just
in this direction.

54
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.510 
As a manager you need to say to
people this is not working properly

55
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.700 
and they need to be ready
to listen to that.

56
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.080 
This communication is
a golden rule there.

57
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.340 
I say before that we
need also to bring

58
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.070 
team leaders outside
because the team leaders

59
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.130 
are gonna make the things speed
up and going to make the

60
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.200 
coordination also by far
better, we cannot expect

61
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.540 
that this situation that is
happening at the office is exactly

62
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.080 
the same situation that is happening
outside, probably outside it would

63
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.230 
be five but by far faster,
but if the team outside

64
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.960 
is working faster than the old
one you will have a problem.

65
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.520 
You will have a collision there
and therefore it's necessary

66
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.970 
to empower team leaders to
make the movement faster

67
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.320 
and when i say faster also keep
also communication all the

68
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.780 
time use collaboration tools I
don't think that because you

69
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.180 
use it today in the morning you cannot
use in the afternoon, go ahead

70
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.430 
use it afternoon again talk to
people the feeling that people

71
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.160 
are feeling that they are valuable
for the organization that

72
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.490 
they the organization count on me
this is really really important

73
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.900 
and they are organizing themselves
on the times what are they

74
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.360 
doing there but the
targets the achievement

75
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.110 
talk to them feedback important
go in both direction this is

76
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.650 
definitely very important
and as a leader

77
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.590 
how do you know that
things are getting

78
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.960 
good is there is a there is a a rule
if you are ready for disasters

79
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.760 
you're doing well. It means if
at any time your organization

80
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.270 
can fully operate remotely
you are doing very well.

81
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.030 
Some of the experiences i
think in the past in the

82
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.690 
Obama legislation in the
USA when katrina appeared

83
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.820 
one of the targets.... You
mean the hurricane? Exactly

84
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.360 
uh one of the targets
was "we

85
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.300 
need to start thinking about
working remotely"

86
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.090 
during disasters and they
managed to implement in some

87
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.570 
organization this they are ready
for disaster all the time.

88
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.300 
And actually it doesn't need to
be a big disaster like katrina

89
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
when i remember when i was working
a couple of years ago in

90
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.180 
a silicon valley for
couple of months

91
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.420 
and it happened kind
of not every day but

92
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.580 
often enough in the in the
three months that i've been

93
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.770 
working there it happened at
least three or four times

94
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.200 
that some machine cut off
the internet cables

95
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.080 
and I mean imagine, in silicon
valley in the heart of the

96
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.440 
internet world digital world and
we didn't have any internet

97
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.180 
anymore in the office,
so we had four weeks

98
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.340 
or a couple of days at least......
But you keep working?

99
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.500 
Yeah, at home....... Exactly and it
worked then you were ready at the

100
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.860 
time ready for disaster. Drive
your organization to be ready

101
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.960 
for disasters because
anything happened

102
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.960 
any time just get ready on this
and when i mentioned before

103
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.430 
listen to people feedbacks open
discussions is not just tell

104
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.350 
me something i tell you something
no open discussion in a team

105
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.010 
don't be don't be afraid of this
if you let these discussions

106
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.890 
to happen where the management
is not taking part

107
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.670 
you will have a problem because
you will have some ghettos

108
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.360 
there who are taking some
decision by themselves

109
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.390 
and then suddenly everything
will come against you, no.

110
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.340 
Go on the discussions
and discuss with them.

111
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.410 
But this is actually
also what you've been

112
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.530 
saying a couple of times already
that you need to change

113
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.080 
the culture if you don't have
that kind of culture already

114
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.130 
you can have also this or this
open culture that encourages

115
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.850 
the people also to talk to you and tell
you the truth..... and tell you the true

116
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.010 
exactly some people it's
also something important

117
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.330 
to know some people they they
are not confident to speak in

118
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.550 
public you need to count on that
because we are all different

119
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.410 
and it is not better or bad people
but for those people that

120
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.760 
you detect a he is not saying
much or she is not saying much.

121
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.870 
Just talk to them individually,
personally "ehy hows everything

122
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.540 
going on" because
you need t try to keep

123
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.800 
the communication open at all
levels this is very very very

124
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.320 
important and when we
are talking about

125
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.740 
remote work it is also very
important at the end what we want

126
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.200 
are results result when are you
doing this how are you doing

127
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.000 
this i don't know i give you the
resources we have a plan is

128
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.420 
accorded a coordinated plan
the leaders are there

129
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.910 
the team can speak together we
want a target to be achieved

130
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.420 
that results are the ones that
are proving a good working

131
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.700 
model is working
or not.

132
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.990 
if suddenly after two
weeks we have nothing

133
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.000 
ok something is going on here.
And I see on the slides

134
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.920 
and i'm not the expert on that
but i see that you talking

135
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.490 
about like passive peers and that
they are toxic what do you

136
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.430 
mean with that?...... look
a when you have a team

137
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.020 
i would put an example we have
a team of ten people outside

138
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.090 
working there, but two of
them are really passive

139
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.550 
they don't interact, we
don't hear from them

140
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.940 
we don't know if they are delivering
information to the other

141
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.830 
part of team, we
mainly see that

142
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.180 
they are working there if they
are logged on we can see them

143
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.990 
because in the management tool
you mentioned before you can

144
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.760 
see them the status of
each one of the members

145
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.550 
yes they're there but they are
passive and they don't contribute.

146
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.010 
Those in our experiences in
the past they are toxic

147
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.290 
because they slow down the
team the team that is

148
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.140 
with eight people performing
fantastic two of them are slowing

149
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.860 
down.... "ehyy I need your
information" giving your feedbacks

150
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.250 
all this passive peers
are toxic either

151
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:24.070 
you activate them because you
you need a dynamic outside or

152
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.080 
you remove them from the
team because it definitely

153
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.230 
slows down the performance
of the whole team

154
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.640 
and because of two people
let's say in this example

155
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.320 
it is not a fair with the rest
of the team and even for the

156
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.020 
rest of the organization
to then stop the

157
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.150 
the remote plan you're
trying to implement.

158
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.110 
Get ready for disaster, open
discussions and please please please

159
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.250 
review the results because this at
the end of it for top management

160
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.130 
they will ask it this
is working or not.

161
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.190 
Yeah, again we would
like to invite you to

162
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.910 
contribute or join the
discussion forums.

163
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.480

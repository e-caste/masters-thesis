00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.150 
What is design thinking
and why is it important?

2
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.810 
Suppose you want to help people
to take better care of their

3
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.990 
health or you wish to improve the
experience of daily commute

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710 
to work. Suppose you work
at a bank that wants

5
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.080 
to help teenagers with their
financial planning in an organic

6
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.460 
and convenient way. How do you go
about solving these challenges?

7
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.660 
When we face a problem our
initial reaction is to start to

8
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.210 
think about possible solutions
based on our own experiences

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.470 
and expertise. We might have a
light bulb moment and come up

10
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.080 
with a great idea. Once implemented,
it may succeed or fail in

11
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.340 
solving the problem that people have.
When applying design thinking,

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.420 
instead of thinking about
possible solutions right away,

13
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.710 
we take a human-centered approach
and try to start by discovering

14
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.060 
people's hidden needs. In this way
we make sure that the solutions

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.240 
we create will be meaningful
and helpful to people.

16
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.420 
Design thinking is a powerful
tool for tackling the unknown.

17
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.490 
It starts with finding inspirations
through careful observation

18
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.190 
and qualitative research. After
interacting with people we wish

19
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.050 
to design for and learning about
them, we then create solutions

20
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.190 
and possibilities for the
needs we discovered.

21
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.300 
The next step is to create simple
models of our idea and test it

22
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.140 
with the people that we designed
for. Our aim is to hear their

23
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.050 
feedback and refine our solution
or create new ones if needed.

24
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.380 
Instead of solving problems with
purely technological solutions

25
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.930 
or focusing on what is
economically viable

26
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.140 
we begin by placing a strong
emphasis on what is meaningful

27
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.210 
and desirable to people. You want
to make sure that we create

28
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.460 
solutions that are valuable
to people first,

29
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.940 
then we can apply the technology
and business models

30
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.230 
that would
support them.

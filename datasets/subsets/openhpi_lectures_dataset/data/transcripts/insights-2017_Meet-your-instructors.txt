00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:08.250 
Hello and welcome!

2
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.250 
We are very happy that you're joining us.

3
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:13.810 
My name is Mana and I'm a PhD candidate at the HPI-Stanford

4
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:14.910 
Design Thinking

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:15.720 
Research Program.

6
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:19.660 
I'm also a member of the teaching team at the HPI School of Design

7
00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:19.880 
Thinking.

8
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.750 
Hi I'm Karen, I am also very happy that you're joining us.

9
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:25.340 
I also work in the Design Thinking

10
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:26.950 
Research Program with Mana,

11
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:27.700 
and as a journalist.

12
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.210 
So we have created a little game for us to get to know each other better.

13
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:38.050 
So we're going to share three artifacts with you.

14
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:43.210 
One is something that is very useful and practical in our daily life.

15
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.800 
The second one is something that we often have to use,

16
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:50.230 
but it's actually not so helpful, or it kind of bugs us

17
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:52.340 
and we would like to change something about it.

18
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:55.890 
The third one is something that is personal and valuable to us.

19
00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:57.190 
- Do you wanna start Karen?

20
00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:58.040 
- Yeah, why not.

21
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:02.150 
So the first object that I use every day is my lunch box.

22
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:05.910 
I use it to bring food to the office every day and have spontaneous snacks.

23
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.990 
So that’s very helpful and very important

24
00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:09.800 
if I have food craving.

25
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:12.810 
My second object that I have to use,

26
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:15.250 
but bugs me a lot, is my contact lenses container,

27
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:17.190 
because I have to use them.

28
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:18.540 
I have very bad eyesight.

29
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:19.980 
But I often forget them

30
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:22.730 
and then I cannot change them, or the liquid runs out,

31
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:23.740 
and it's just in general

32
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:24.840 
not very practical.

33
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:26.360 
So I don't like it very much.

34
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:30.840 
And my third objects that is very special to me is my notebook,

35
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:33.770 
where I have all my important notes and my thoughts.

36
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:35.090 
So it's very dear to me and very important to me.

37
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:41.110 
The first object that is very practical for me

38
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:42.410 
is this blue pencil.

39
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:45.860 
I sketch a lot and sometimes I draw comics. So

40
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:49.060 
for me it's really cool to start with a blue pencil

41
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:52.970 
and then refine things with a marker later.

42
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:56.950 
The second object that I use very often

43
00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:00.820 
but I'm actually not really happy about is my key card.

44
00:02:01.151 --> 00:02:05.490 
I need this to get around on the campus and open the doors.

45
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:07.190 
But this is white

46
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.060 
and most of the surfaces around us are also white.

47
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.870 
So you can just imagine how many times I leave this somewhere

48
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.600 
and I cannot find it anymore

49
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:15.590 
and I oversee it.

50
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:17.680 
So I’m not really happy about this design.

51
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:21.890 
The third object that is very valuable to me

52
00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:24.330 
is this ring that

53
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:28.420 
I got from my mom in one of my latest trips back home to Iran.

54
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:31.590 
I just love it, I wear it often.

55
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.950 
So now it's your turn!

56
00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:37.220 
In the next section

57
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:39.640 
you will find some instructions about where

58
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:43.920 
and how to upload and share your artifacts.

59
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:45.880 
See you in the course!

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.980 
In this video, we would like
to share with you how to

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.090 
actually get it all started when it comes
to making a spatial change happen.

3
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.610 
And this actually means to move
away from the concept of strategy

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.660 
also as introduced by the Certeau
for example, who defines it as,

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.220 
"Creating the space into the concept of
tactics" or even hacks, which is about

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590 
developing new patterns of usage
but also patterns of temporary

7
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.950 
ownership of space that's already
existing. So to show as an example,

8
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.920 
why not change the way you have been
running regularly your meetings?

9
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.010 
Typically those meetings take
place in a meeting room that

10
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.950 
has a conference
table and chairs.

11
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.480 
Why not remove the table from
that room and bring in coffee

12
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.040 
tables, that will actually lead to
stand-up meetings where people

13
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.100 
then also will start interacting
with each other, because the space

14
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.700 
would allow them and foster
them to do so. To make

15
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.820 
the space more flexible why
not put furniture on wheels?

16
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
Like these tables we have been
designing, they're all on wheels

17
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.310 
because that enables us to move
team spaces around, create new

18
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
settings and new environments, which
will trigger new ways of behaviour

19
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
of your teams. If your
facility management is

20
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.940 
not allowing you to put up new
partitions for team spaces, you

21
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.300 
can simply use neon coloured
duct tape and put it

22
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.530 
on the floor in order to actually
assign this space to be

23
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.340 
a team space and a team zone that you're
about to enter. So, therefore, these hacks

24
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.940 
are two things built in one.
First of all, it's about

25
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.390 
sending out the signal that Yes, that's now
something that can be used differently

26
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.340 
and secondly, it's also something
that allows you to prototype

27
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.820 
and play around with it. Because, before
you start setting up a new final

28
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.040 
designed team space, you can also
try several different options out,

29
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.460 
by making use of the concept
of spaces. Now in this video

30
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:34.210 
I have actually looked into the
juxtapositions, but also the opportunities

31
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.430 
that will come into play if we
start looking at space not just

32
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.130 
from 'how to create a spatial
environment that surrounds us

33
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.090 
physically' but also mentally.
That actually leads us

34
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.380 
to the concept of an extended
space that also includes the

35
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.120 
virtual space. So why is it that virtual space
is so important within an organization?

36
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.580 
Well, there is one
simple reason,

37
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.980 
if we do look at the usage by the
employees and workers of their

38
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.350 
space in the organization, there
is one important finding that we

39
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.600 
want to share with you. So actually
everything, every space,

40
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.870 
that's more than 30 seconds away
from your office and 30 seconds is

41
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.040 
the time it will take you to
walk there is not considered

42
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.240 
as being an option. An option to
use that space for your personal

43
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.650 
means, but also for
your team means.

44
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.540 
So even if you have been starting
to implement innovation lab

45
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.540 
spaces within your
organization,

46
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.390 
they might not work out, because they are
not perceived by lots of your employees

47
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.670 
as accessible space for them
because it's just too far away.

48
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.280 
Another reason is that once you start
working in cross-functional teams

49
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.920 
your team members won't
sit next to you.

50
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.380 
So, therefore, in a given
organizational environment

51
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.860 
that's about to make a change
into a networked organization

52
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.350 
people are not close to each other
in order to meet regularly,

53
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.300 
one on one or like the full team. So,
therefore, the concept of remote teamwork

54
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.470 
and virtual team
spaces becomes

55
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.990 
more important.

56
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.390 
Once you start forming

57
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.020 
diverse teams, they also might work
at completely different locations,

58
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.240 
either in the same city or in the
same country or even spread

59
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.230 
out through different time
zones, here the virtual space

60
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.200 
becomes even more crucial. So,
therefore, it leads us to a situation

61
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.480 
where it's not just about designing
the analogue spaces for

62
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.280 
teamwork, but also creating as
inviting as this can be virtual

63
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.220 
team spaces. Where those teams can
actually literally virtually

64
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.420 
meet to collaborate, to interact,
but also develop ideas, concepts,

65
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.750 
prototypes, altogether. There
are a lot of solutions

66
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.510 
out there that will help you to
design your virtual space,

67
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.580 
but unfortunately, most of the existing
solutions are only optimized for one function.

68
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.040 
So for example, making use of a software
that helps you to brainstorm together,

69
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.340 
or making use of a digital
whiteboard in order to flesh out

70
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.630 
ideas and concepts, or even to
make use of virtual technology

71
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.210 
in order to meet together in a room where
you can virtually design objects.

72
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.230 
So, therefore, your challenge and
also our challenge right now

73
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.580 
at the HPI D School is to find
a good configuration of

74
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.200 
these different
digital tools

75
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.600 
in order to create a team experience
that will work for analog

76
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.130 
teams as well as virtual
and remote teams.

WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.129 
Yes Mr Meinel, thank you very much for the introduction and the introduction, it is a great pleasure for me to moderate the panel here.

2
00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.109 
As we have already heard, there is no title to be seen yet.

3
00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.349 
It's about measuring energy efficiency.

4
00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.609 
Measurement is the basis of all science, measurement is also the basis of all decision.

5
00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:21.019 
You need to know what the state of affairs is in order to make a sensible decision, an optimisation, a purposeful decision.

6
00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's what we're going to talk about.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.730 
But it is also not only the measurement of energy consumption that is the issue here, but the measurement of energy efficiency, so

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.649 
what they get compared to what they spend.

9
00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.490 
That is also the question: what is the numerator and what is the denominator in this consideration?

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.229 
We have four panellists on this.

11
00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.799 
I'm going to be very brief here, I'm not going to make a long introduction either.

12
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.659 
We have just agreed that the colleagues will introduce themselves briefly if they want to.

13
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.090 
We will make a very short presentation of five to seven minutes and then give you the floor.

14
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.350 
We will try to involve them as much as possible in the discussion.

15
00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.020 
We look forward to your questions and to your contributions to the discussion.

16
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
We hope this will be a lively session here.

17
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:10.040 
On that note, you begin,

18
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.290 
Thank you very much, Professor Meinel, Prof Karl, it is a pleasure to be here, my name is Jan Peter Schemmel, the Managing Director

19
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.569 
of the Öko-Institut. This is a non-governmental institute, an environmental research institute, independent

20
00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:30.700 
since 1977 and one of our important topics is, of course, the question of how digitalisation and sustainability, the

21
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.549 
two essential transformations of our time, fit together.

22
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:45.469 
The powerpoint is about to run, I might start with it for a moment, this is the wrong one to bridge

23
00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.420 
to what we had this morning, that of course you can ask yourself first "Is it worth it?"

24
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.340 
To measure that about some difficulties from measuring we had already heard, and then you can ask yourself "Is it worth it?"

25
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.069 
But I think this morning it has become very clear that it is worth it.

26
00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:06.780 
In the different presentations the energy demand became clear and also the contribution then logically to the climate goals.

27
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:15.590 
or the difficulties in contributing to the climate goals that are associated with the energy use of data centres of software, of Cloud

28
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.849 
computing.

29
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.330 
In that sense, the question is: why should we measure that?

30
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.849 
We should measure it because digital systems contribute significantly to heating.

31
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.569 
And because we can't afford the inefficiency.

32
00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.900 
That also became clear this morning.

33
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.319 
We will also not be so fast in growing renewables that we can say, We'll just buy renewables.

34
00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:44.409 
energy and then it's good. Two slides on this just here the middle one is the red one on data centres, how consumption is developing

35
00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.689 
will.

36
00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.639 
After the prediction was also already mentioned and we also had the bitcoin example varies of course, but in the

37
00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:56.379 
recent times roughly the equivalent of a third of Germany's electricity consumption, you could also say it's relevant

38
00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:03.039 
how you work with blockchain, whether it runs efficiently or whether it doesn't run efficiently, to that extent: Measurement makes sense.

39
00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:09.159 
But please don't just measure energy efficiency, because that alone was also said this morning, is not enough.

40
00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:16.009 
We have in the ICT sector and of course also in software indirectly and in data centres directly in hardware also directly of course

41
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:21.060 
enormous consumption of resources and thus an environmental expenditure that we also have to factor in.

42
00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.629 
The climate goals cannot be achieved without a cicrular economy and a significant increase in resource efficiency.

43
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.439 
We may not notice it so much at the moment because the energy supply, the increase in renewables, is still very low.

44
00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.909 
has been so successful in the last few years, but the hard sectors are still to come and that includes the energy sector.

45
00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.270 
This means that the goal must also be to reduce the use of resources, and an important point here is the issue of obsolescence,

46
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.169 
which is often software-induced, which means that the hardware could actually still function wonderfully.

47
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.569 
but because the software requirements are increasing - we had that this morning too - the software requirements are increasing.

48
00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.030 
faster than the hardware keeps up I have to buy new hardware, I have to use new hardware.

49
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.409 
I throw the old one away and you all know there are valuable resources in there accordingly.

50
00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.759 
Is it worth measuring, is there any difference at all?

51
00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.330 
That was also said this morning.

52
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.569 
Yes, there are immense differences, there are only three slides, that's something we had done, like a lot of the other stuff

53
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:24.269 
also, as part of assignments for the UBA, which was mentioned here, earlier, which is on many of these issues.

54
00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:30.600 
Here it's about the question of software: What is the energy demand of software in use and there you can see now simply

55
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:39.410 
two word processing programmes in parallel it's about software in desktop applications like the energy requirements

56
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.560 
and there the delta is also clearly 16 watts higher power requirement.

57
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.189 
One over the other, although they don't do anything different. And you can do that with different things as well.

58
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.750 
think about.

59
00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:56.889 
And if you now have this software, we had seen this here with the word processing programmes, there I have partially

60
00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.759 
a factor of four for energy. Of course, we didn't look at all of them, but at a few, as an example, if I look at the browsers...

61
00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:10.379 
not with word processing, then I also have a factor of two there and when I look at it in idle mode:

62
00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:16.829 
So not only in use but also there are huge differences, as you can see here, so that it also becomes clear that yes, there is a factor of two.

63
00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:17.600 
there are differences.

64
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.470 
Measuring is also worthwhile to see how we can get better?

65
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.360 
That was the question this morning.

66
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.449 
How can developers, for example, then set out to develop better software in that respect?

67
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.500 
Where it is more difficult is in the data centres.

68
00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.970 
Now these are not efficiency

69
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:43.120 
numbers that are different from data centres, but simply the needs or respectively.

70
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.660 
then derive the greenhouse gas emissions and thus the global warming potentials of different data centres.

71
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.519 
Of course, this depends very much on the variables, but it doesn't say much at first, because if I add the key figures

72
00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:57.720 
that make sense, then that's exactly what I have to do.

73
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.189 
which has now already been mentioned in the introduction: I have to put effort and benefit in relation to each other and there were not yet

74
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.930 
because too many figures are not yet available.

75
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.680 
That was also said this morning that the clarity there about what is going on in the data centre is not

76
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.970 
there. What should you look for when measuring resources and energy efficiency?

77
00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:24.910 
That you relate these two aspects of effort and benefit and that in a standardised way, of course. Let's go

78
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.329 
for three topics For software, data centres, cloud computing: For software, an essential element here at the

79
00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:33.560 
Example from the desktop application,

80
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.379 
that of course I have standard usage scenarios. The problem with that is of course what do I do with other usages that are then

81
00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:44.279 
and the problem is, of course, also with software that is not used by many people.

82
00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.839 
people in a very standardised way.

83
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.379 
With those it also becomes more difficult at first, but for a whole range of software a few examples we had mentioned

84
00:06:52.379 --> 00:07:00.339 
you can certainly develop such scenarios and then measure them. What is important with software, with measuring

85
00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:06.300 
of software and key figures is that we take the resource dimension into account, and these are above all the points

86
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:15.360 
here under two and three, namely whether I have a downward compatibility of a software with older hardware

87
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:23.319 
devices, for example, whether I have portability, whether I can use it with other systems and whether I can use it with other systems.

88
00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:29.350 
like that, because all of that implies that I either have to buy additional software, or that other hardware

89
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.750 
need.

90
00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:39.379 
With data centres, of course, I have to relate the benefit of the data centre to the expense, and here is the question:

91
00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:42.550 
How can I define the benefit, how can I define the effort?

92
00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:51.220 
In the case of standard utility, in the case of the data centre, of course, I have the computational operations, which in terms of storage space are the amount of data at

93
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:59.879 
external network interfaces, which are very important aspects and in the, if I look now: What environmental expenditure do

94
00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:07.149 
I have with a data centre like this, then I have, as with all of them, always the production of the devices, in

95
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:12.870 
in this case the centre itself and the use phase and in manufacturing of course the resource issues are more important.

96
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.050 
in the use question, the energy questions tend to be more important.

97
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.410 
I don't want to go into all the details now.

98
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:25.519 
Important quantities on the right in the context of environmental expenditure are then the abiotic raw material consumption, greenhouse gas, potential,

99
00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:27.550 
energy and what was now missing was water.

100
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.429 
And if I put that in relation, the specific benefits and the specific environmental expenditures, then of course I can

101
00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:39.169 
different categories and combinations in order to arrive at efficiency ratios,

102
00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:40.990 
for data centres. For example:

103
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:48.590 
How much storage space is actively used per unit of CO2 or how many computing operations are performed per unit of raw material.

104
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:56.539 
I can then combine this in different ways and have a comparability there and that is together with a

105
00:08:56.549 --> 00:09:03.070 
register of data centres where such data is then kept, is of course also a basis for, thirdly, comparing the data.

106
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:03.649 
to come:

107
00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:11.429 
How do I get to metrics for green cloud computing, where multiple services from one data centre, if applicable

108
00:09:11.429 --> 00:09:16.679 
and different parts of the data centre are used differently for different services.

109
00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:17.210 
are used.

110
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:24.590 
However, I can actually allocate this according to the corresponding needs and how I use these units in this case.

111
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:34.269 
for example, the storage, server, network and the like for the different services.

112
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:41.679 
that I have and then see in this combination how the benefit and effort is in relation to each other. How are we getting on?

113
00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:49.529 
Last slide: We have to make the efficiency figures binding and thus create the transparency that we are talking about this morning.

114
00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:54.429 
so that the actors can, first of all, improve and know where they can start and, secondly, so that they can

115
00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:59.860 
as consumers be it and companies that use data centres or use cloud computing or the like or individuals

116
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:06.649 
know what that costs them and also enables them to portray themselves as carbon neutral.

117
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.750 
If we have the mandatory standards for the labels, then we have the comparability, then we have the transparency.

118
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.690 
for competition.

119
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.649 
Of course, we can do it with labels like Blue Angel.

120
00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:26.110 
But this whole thing is also important, because only in this way can the companies, which increasingly do not run data centres themselves

121
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.450 
but only use them and say: I want to be able to present myself as climate-neutral to the outside world.

122
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:37.669 
Of course, they have to be able to balance their IT services that they use and they have to know on which figures they are based.

123
00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:43.799 
based on you can say you are climate neutral and also for that we need that and also that will have a market effect.

124
00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:49.350 
and a steering effect, because the demand changes and as a basis for that we will of course then also have a register.

125
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.039 
for data centres.

126
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.629 
I would leave it at that.

127
00:10:51.629 --> 00:11:02.389 
Thank you very much, it's been a bit of a parkour ride, but we'll have time for further discussion in a moment.

128
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:06.720 
Thank you very much, that was a parkour ride, but it was a very comprehensive and very nice parkour ride as an opening.

129
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:13.539 
Mr. Bauer, the floor is yours. Great, thank you!

130
00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:20.850 
Good, I have a presentation too, I can see it's right there. So I came here yesterday from the beautiful Würzburg

131
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:26.950 
and because the journey was longer, I spent the night in a hotel and then probably like that one

132
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:33.450 
or others watched Netflix last night and just enjoyed the evening after the long train journey.

133
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.029 
I don't know if they've ever asked themselves the question, but I've asked myself the question, what does Netflix actually look like?

134
00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:41.450 
under the bonnet. And I wasn't the only one:

135
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.539 
There's a research team that designed this.

136
00:11:44.549 --> 00:11:46.129 
Now you don't recognise anything here for the time being.

137
00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:48.950 
I will explain so that they have an idea of what is here.

138
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:56.610 
Netflix was one of the first to move from monolithic architecture to microservices-based architecture

139
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:56.960 
has been.

140
00:11:57.129 --> 00:12:03.320 
That is, we had quite a lot of services taking over different things. When I log in then what content do I get?

141
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.139 
and that's what you see here.

142
00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:09.710 
We have over 500 different services doing different tasks.

143
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.049 
All our blue lines that you see here are connections in communications as they interact with each other.

144
00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:23.950 
Now Netflix is not the only service provider, we still have for example Twitter also has 500 plus microservice.

145
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:33.450 
We have other players like Uber, Coca Cola, Amazon, everything runs on a microservice basis.

146
00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:42.929 
And why I'm saying this now is that simply these modern web application that we actually use, day in and day out this

147
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.139 
hundreds of microservices and we've heard it several times today that they are deployed in the cloud because

148
00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:56.450 
it just makes my life easier. And because the whole thing is like that, it makes it very hard to even measure them out

149
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.789 
how energy efficient they are.

150
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:07.039 
Because in the case of for example Amazon they update their service 1000 updates a day, so that means if I measure today, in

151
00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:12.690 
a few hours the measurement could be completely out of date again, because they simply have completely new software in the meantime.

152
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:19.139 
Furthermore, if I now deploy my service in the cloud, I don't have dedicated access but I have access to the cloud.

153
00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:25.980 
it's shared. I have overprovisioning, I have for example 200 % resources are sold although 100 % is there. That is

154
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:32.080 
I have resource competition and therefore I also have problems to find out what resources I actually have there.

155
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:38.720 
and in the end, if I now have my service at Amazon, for example, I can't use it with the

156
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:44.370 
meter and measure it - it doesn't work, I usually don't have any information on which hardware I'm using.

157
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:49.950 
that is running at all. That is, I simply lack information about where and how my service is being carried out.

158
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.620 
That's why measurement is quite difficult in the case of cloud computing.

159
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.250 
That's why, in principle, I have the possibility to model only that.

160
00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:03.179 
Now you can say: we do it in a "wide box" manner.

161
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:11.059 
So we really know everything about our application and in the case of Netflix, have 500 service that we need to model.

162
00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:17.690 
So we need all the information, we need every parameter, we need to know when which service is running with which

163
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:23.059 
service interacts, with what probability it interacts and what parameters it can send.

164
00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:25.350 
That is, it's an incredibly large effort.

165
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.450 
And as I said before, if we just keep updating our srvice, I can't keep up with it.

166
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:37.169 
to change the model. That's why, in principle, the exact opposite of "wide box" modelling is "black box" modelling. And here come

167
00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:39.549 
for example, methods from artificial intelligence.

168
00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:41.799 
We have already had this topic,

169
00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:44.190 
so I'm trying to go over it a bit faster.

170
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.690 
Why are we using artificial intelligence now? Well the artificial intelligence

171
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:52.539 
it already surpasses us humans in many areas. For example:

172
00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:57.850 
In 1996, DeepBlue defeated the reigning world chess champion.

173
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:05.350 
A few years later, six years ago, Go, which was considered unbeaten, was defeated by Alpha Go.

174
00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:13.029 
So these have been milestones, and nowadays we use this all the time and for life. Either in research to

175
00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:18.899 
example early detection of diseases or in autonomous driving, so in many things we simply can't afford it.

176
00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:28.149 
and we have already heard immediately that all this AI-driven learning and use also causes unbelievable costs.

177
00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:34.809 
and has the corresponding very high CO2 footprint. To give you some other house numbers we have google for example.

178
00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:41.120 
go: If I were to use this now, one hour would cost me 1000 dollars, so this 1000 dollars is calculated from

179
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.240 
the training time and to talk a bit in terms of CO2:

180
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:52.450 
We have the network GPT-3, which is a human language recognition and processing network.

181
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:59.200 
Training has cost so much, now if you get in the car and drive to the moon and back,

182
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.179 
that's how much CO2 this network has consumed.

183
00:16:02.179 --> 00:16:11.070 
So these are huge amounts that, for example, a single grid has. That means clearly, we can now model with such

184
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:18.139 
black box methods but is it at all meaningful if we spend incredible amounts of energy to estimate what we are going to spend somewhere else?

185
00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:19.250 
for energy?

186
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:26.809 
Accordingly, I am already coming to the end: What I really want to say is that we have a lot of work to do in the next few years.

187
00:16:26.809 --> 00:16:28.679 
challenges to overcome.

188
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.730 
The application is becoming more and more complex.

189
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.299 
Now I was talking about microservices earlier.

190
00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:34.840 
Meanwhile we have serverless.

191
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:40.559 
That doesn't even mean small service, but we go down to the function level like virtualising individual functions.

192
00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:45.460 
which are short-lived and it is much more difficult to find out when who does what where.

193
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:52.409 
And with the whole movement of IOT and digitalisation, we just have a lot more data to process.

194
00:16:52.409 --> 00:16:58.460 
in the cloud. And they say to get on top of it we just need better and more accurate methods of AI.

195
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:06.990 
But the current situation is that if we want to have an increase in the performance of AI methods in the years to come, we're going to need about an exponential increase in the performance of AI methods.

196
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.680 
larger network and how do we do that these days?

197
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.660 
Well, we throw more hardware at it. We've got a bigger network so I need more hardware so

198
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.160 
I need more CO2 again.

199
00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:22.339 
And accordingly, the question I want to raise now is also a little bit if

200
00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:27.960 
in principle, an artificial network or methods from artificial intelligence are also nothing more than software systems that use

201
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:33.339 
all these little interconnected neurons that basically work like any other network.

202
00:17:33.349 --> 00:17:39.160 
And so the question is are we even ready to take the next step and build these big networks?

203
00:17:39.339 --> 00:17:46.710 
I say no, we first need to create some awareness that we are doing the AI green, so like before.

204
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:54.960 
already indicated: do we need 99.99% or maybe 95% accuracy is enough for us. And if we solve this problem

205
00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:01.660 
then we can take AI, for example, to then create such black box models of ultra complex systems.

206
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:15.769 
Accordingly, I would be finished with my presentation now and look forward to the Q and A session later.

207
00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:20.039 
Yes thank you very much nice example of how the cure could be worse than the disease.

208
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.200 
Mr Gerbothe, Otto what do you think?

209
00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:25.349 
Thank you!

210
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:31.430 
First of all, thank you very much HPI for hosting the conference today.

211
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.359 
I am also very happy today

212
00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:37.329 
to speak on the panel "Measuring Energy Efficiency in Digital Systems".

213
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:45.509 
I'm Tobias Geborthe, I'm a developer at OSP and we've already heard today about the impact of digitalisation on the energy sector.

214
00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:49.049 
in general, how important it is and the opportunities that come with it.

215
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:55.769 
In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, 17 pieces of the UN, what you can actively contribute to that.

216
00:18:55.779 --> 00:19:02.140 
On the other hand, we also know the challenges that come along with the huge amount of data that is stored.

217
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.750 
that has to be made available.

218
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:09.380 
And of course, with that comes a very big responsibility, and we as Otto Group Solution Provider want to take care of that.

219
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.849 
responsibility.

220
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:17.849 
The Otto Group: We are part of the Otto Group, which has been facing this responsibility for many decades.

221
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:27.569 
We are taking this on, and we have already heard today from Mrs. Brantner and Mr. Messner that more from the software direction.

222
00:19:27.579 --> 00:19:33.569 
and we want to tackle this responsibility from within, we want it to come from us, from the developers.

223
00:19:33.569 --> 00:19:39.019 
I hope that I can present that a little bit today, present it authentically as a developer that we are driving that

224
00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:41.759 
want to do without there being regulation coming from the top.

225
00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:47.289 
There can be, we welcome it, it supports us in what we want to do, but we want to start early,

226
00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:53.430 
we want to be active from the bottom up, we want to set out on the path of taking this responsibility, we have that

227
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.890 
we have already started in the last years.

228
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.309 
We've started to, at the corporate level, what you typically do, green power.

229
00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:01.289 
Selecting green electricity providers.

230
00:20:01.289 --> 00:20:09.160 
We started a lot of different initiatives, the Green Initiative, where we did a lot of things.

231
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:15.130 
We looked at: What is on the move in our premises, what is our equipment, how can we

232
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.190 
become greener?

233
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:22.099 
But we also looked further, what is our CO2 footprint in the whole company at the corporate level?

234
00:20:22.269 --> 00:20:24.549 
But it remains at the company level for the time being.

235
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.319 
We have also gone so far as to compensate for that.

236
00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:33.339 
Of course, but at the end of the day we want to become more energy efficient, and that has to come out of the machines, out of the machine room.

237
00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:34.180 
come out.

238
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:41.089 
And that's where we want to start and we have set up the Sustainable Programme Initiative and this initiative employs

239
00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:46.039 
deals with exactly that. There are developers in particular in the initiative, and the developers are trying to work on this together with

240
00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:48.660 
the developers what we can achieve.

241
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.160 
We have developed a strategy, we have developed a vision, and we want to drive that together.

242
00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:00.670 
We want to focus a lot on collaberation there, we want to do that together with the developer, we want to work in

243
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.789 
the projects into the teams together, we want to see: What moves you?

244
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:10.259 
How can we make energy efficiency visible in your context, make it transparent and also work on it?

245
00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:17.529 
And we talk a lot today about how bad things actually are and what negative effects this has and how

246
00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:18.630 
bad it all is.

247
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:24.240 
And what motivates and inspires me personally, though, is actually the other side if you look towards

248
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.849 
space travel.

249
00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:29.549 
I actually come from the air and space travel corner too, if you look at space travel what is actually possible.

250
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:35.869 
Let me give you the example of the rover perseverence and ingenuity with the helicopter about what they can actually do.

251
00:21:35.869 --> 00:21:40.930 
are able to do with what little effort and with what constraints.

252
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:48.470 
That's amazing and that shows us clearly where the potential actually is and what needs to be done with it.

253
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:53.710 
Maybe I'll give you some data on that: The perseverence rover

254
00:21:53.710 --> 00:22:01.150 
is on Mars and of course it's got a lot of hardware, it's got a lot of equipment, it's got different camera systems, it's got

255
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.980 
different spectroscopes to measure UV, infrared.

256
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:10.609 
He has a ground radar which evaluates ground samples, of course he has to move, all these things, there are many of them.

257
00:22:10.609 --> 00:22:15.849 
different things that he has to do and the hardware that he has on board is a 200 megahertz processor,

258
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:24.880 
which is already ten times what the previous rovers had. The two gigabytes of main memory, 256 megabytes of RAM.

259
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.109 
and an additional 256 kilobytes of ROM.

260
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:33.019 
And that's it, and that takes care of that and the Ingenuity maybe goes a little bit further.

261
00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:41.740 
That's this helicopter that kind of counts into the project a bit and that's the first motorised

262
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:47.819 
aircraft that has flown on an alien planet under its own power, and if you look at what the helicopter has done.

263
00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:54.319 
has already achieved, it's only had 23 flights, but it's covered five kilometres, it can fly up to 12 metres, and it's got a very high altitude.

264
00:22:54.319 --> 00:23:02.160 
high, has reached a speed of five metres per second, and what kind of energy consumption is there?

265
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.960 
behind that is only 350 watts, which are available per flight event. And with that the

266
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.400 
that and that should kind of illustrate where the journey can go, what we can actually achieve.

267
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.970 
And we are also coming out of the history where resources are not unlimited.

268
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.509 
Today it's like this: resources are almost almost infinitely available.

269
00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:27.049 
And as developers we can say: yes well, we have it, we go to the cloud, and there is a bunch of resources available

270
00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:29.150 
and we use those.

271
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.769 
And that's where we want to get away a bit, when it comes to energy efficiency, it's just about how do we define for you

272
00:23:35.769 --> 00:23:39.970 
Energy efficiency, what is the current level and how can we reduce it?

273
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:46.059 
By maybe also just saying assume that you are moving from energy efficiency maybe back to where you are now?

274
00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:47.099 
we used to come from?

275
00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:48.000 
That wasn't all there was:

276
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.579 
The bandwidth was not so given, the energy, computing power was not so given.

277
00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:58.799 
And assuming that you don't consume as much resources that you could consume, that's for us.

278
00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:04.460 
already a big driver that we want to address together with the with the individual teams. And maybe to the

279
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:11.210 
Finally, on a personal note, we are here together today, IT is our passion, and beyond that

280
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:21.539 
we certainly share a responsibility to take action, and every single one of us has so

281
00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:26.420 
the right to fulfil this responsibility and perhaps also a little bit of the duty to do so, And if we are able to

282
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:32.309 
to share this and to carry it on broad shoulders, then we can also contribute efficiently as an IT community.

283
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.819 
that we achieve the goals,

284
00:24:33.819 --> 00:24:34.980 
that have already been presented today.

285
00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:41.509 
Thank you.

286
00:24:41.509 --> 00:24:48.319 
Yes, Mr Gerbothe, thank you very much, one can only join the appeal. If you know Mr van Vliet, then you will be surprised at how

287
00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:52.640 
much he has changed in appearance, he unfortunately had to cancel.

288
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.549 
But we have with Mr. Fridtjof Chwoyka, sometime I will get it,

289
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.259 
a wonderful deputy.

290
00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.259 
Thank you very much for the introduction.

291
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:07.309 
I have known for 16 hours that I am allowed to stand here, a period of time that is normal for me as a human being, I can prepare myself

292
00:25:07.309 --> 00:25:08.309 
and do everything.

293
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:14.549 
A data centre doesn't know that, a data centre can't prepare for what's in 16 hours.

294
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.759 
Why it can't, because the information is not there.

295
00:25:19.339 --> 00:25:25.920 
How do I know that? My company, Data Center Exzellenz GmbH, deals with energy efficiency in data centres.

296
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:32.450 
I used to plan data centres and the first question was always: How much power do you want for IT?

297
00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:41.230 
A number is given and then we build a data centre to reach that number, we don't question the sense of it.

298
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.940 
of that number.

299
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.450 
We might say to the customers.

300
00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:46.710 
200KW per rack is a bit much take a

301
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:51.640 
only 20, that's from experience, the better value.

302
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.259 
I wonder if this is meaningful work that's happening?

303
00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:00.000 
Crypto mining is not meaningful some will say, others may see it differently because they have become rich with it.

304
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.180 
It doesn't matter to us. We provide infrastructure that is efficient, but the responsibility of the IT developers and the

305
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:14.490 
owner of the applications is actually to build applications that are efficient, that use the resources that we have with a lot of

306
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.950 
effort, efficiently utilise.

307
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:25.029 
You have to be able to measure that. We in building services actually measure everything. We know how much electricity is going somewhere,

308
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:33.950 
we know how much cold we produce, how much waste heat we can transfer to other processes to, for example

309
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:43.279 
to run a heating system, to heat a building. But what we don't know is: how efficient is IT and also IT itself?

310
00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:48.349 
don't know that at all, if you are running a cloud service today and you want to re-tender that.

311
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:57.269 
Would the first question be: how much electricity did my current cloud applications consume, what are the metrics?

312
00:26:57.269 --> 00:27:02.759 
that? They don't get that information, they might get the efficiency of the data centre where it's running in.

313
00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:07.160 
POE these are standard metrics that maybe everybody in the data centre has heard.

314
00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:10.160 
How much power do I need to run my IT?

315
00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.049 
That's all there is.

316
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.269 
But is that really the efficiency

317
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:22.390 
that I have? That is, if we could construct an interface there with measurements that would give me, besides the CPU requirement,

318
00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:29.829 
I can start benchmarking, and then I can say: provider, provider, provider, provider. So I can say: Provider

319
00:27:29.829 --> 00:27:37.220 
a-b-c, all cost the same can all do the same, but the one provider is more efficient because its hardware is simply

320
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:45.720 
is better utilised because - to come back to the example: a server that is not on is the best server there is.

321
00:27:45.779 --> 00:27:51.809 
Theoretically, it doesn't have to be produced. Now, if I know I have day-to-day over the energy demand, over the

322
00:27:51.809 --> 00:27:59.960 
computing demand of a service, I can switch computers off and on. But this information is in this black box IT -

323
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.490 
which is just the way it is for us as building services engineers,

324
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:09.049 
we don't have access to this data - a huge disadvantage and that's where we have to go with measured values. We have to once the

325
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:16.900 
users what resources they are actually wasting with their processes that are running there. At the same time we need

326
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:24.950 
feedback information: "how many resources do you need right now, how many resources will you need in an hour?

327
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.859 
to run all the plant technology efficiently. And that's the bottom line approach.

328
00:28:29.859 --> 00:28:38.569 
We have to make a strict separation between the infrastructure which is usually, to put it succinctly, the caretaker of the services.

329
00:28:38.569 --> 00:28:42.950 
again made sure that my data centre crashed and I had to work overtime on weekends.

330
00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:50.480 
He has to get information from IT and at the same time IT has to get information from the building services in order to

331
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.549 
optimise each other even further.

332
00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:02.210 
There are measures, we are building up a pattern with the SDIA to develop this interface, that is this interface.

333
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.000 
is in development, would like to participate in it

334
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.329 
it's open for public so

335
00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:13.250 
everybody is allowed to participate. Feel free to go to the SDIA page, we are always looking for labs that can support us on it.

336
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:22.380 
with the goal of being able to report the energy efficiency of every application in real time. That means I see cpu

337
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:30.269 
load so and so many minutes, ram so and so many gigabytes, energy demand so and so many kilowatt hours. And a 2nd thing that

338
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:37.049 
we as data centre experts are doing together with the eco institute we are currently revising the requirements for the blue angel.

339
00:29:37.059 --> 00:29:37.950 
for data centres.

340
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:45.559 
There is an expert hearing there as well and you are all welcome to attend.

341
00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:52.380 
There will be a release on this in the next few weeks as to when these dates are because we need the community feedback.

342
00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.950 
to improve these requirements.

343
00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:56.950 
That would also be the end of it.

344
00:30:04.349 --> 00:30:08.539 
Thank you, wonderful language efficiency, content per minute was excellent.

345
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.940 
Thank you very much, I can invite you in the audience.

346
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:16.660 
Ask questions to the speakers Comments, remarks.

347
00:30:18.039 --> 00:30:23.339 
I'm also happy to repeat for the microphone in case you can't be reasonably heard,

348
00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:53.130 
but just start. Question to the first speaker: In your cost consideration of energy costs, there are costs for production in your calculation. But you didn't consider recycling of hardware. Was that intentional or does that fall under the share of hardware production?

349
00:30:53.130 --> 00:31:01.559 
In the factors that are decisive, a little bit of the focus is also the one that Mr. Messner, I think this morning

350
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.109 
said, it is better to start at the front than at the back.

351
00:31:05.109 --> 00:31:10.579 
We have too much end-of-pipe thinking in Germany anyway in the context of the circular economy "recycling and then that's it

352
00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:15.660 
that" but of course it's even better if I can use the device much longer, there's much more potential there.

353
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:22.049 
If you take computers now, for example, I can work with the energy efficiency, if I still create so much, then I can use the device much longer.

354
00:31:22.059 --> 00:31:29.059 
how efficiently I can run the thing, then I actually need 20 years 15 years runtime of a laptop or PC

355
00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:36.230 
so that I can get out what I have in production in terms of resource input and in terms of energy costs for this resource input.

356
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:40.529 
and there it is still the case that then avoiding the use of resources brings significantly more.

357
00:31:40.529 --> 00:31:49.339 
Therefore the focus is on

358
00:31:49.339 --> 00:32:05.039 
Further questions gladly

359
00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:26.170 
I will speak in english: I will refer to Tobias' example of "How much you can do with so little" And I was wondering if you considered if we could actually do something in the software libraries. So that all components, all hardware could have an integrated measurement so that measurement could be done right at the source.

360
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:35.380 
Thanks for the question, it would be ingenious in the end if the server hardware automatically reported its energy consumption to the outside world.

361
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:42.839 
that is, that the systems, the chips themselves, via an interface, could report their energy requirements to the operating systems.

362
00:32:42.839 --> 00:32:48.269 
or to the upper levels, that would of course be the easiest for all parties involved, because we don't need to have

363
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:56.349 
measurement technology would be needed. Just the network parts, so the electricity generation side already does that to some extent.

364
00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:03.970 
but also the CPUs could report that, that would of course be a great thing that would also be standardised and then

365
00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:10.740 
for all information that would actually be the best way to get this information.

366
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:22.309 
My I add something, I will switch to english, so you don't need a translation. Which one do you prefer? German.

367
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:31.430 
Good, then switch back to German so I don't have to jump back and forth. Now, for example, in the server section there is

368
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:35.119 
there's the Energy Star in the Americas, so over there with the Americans.

369
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:41.940 
That measures exactly how energy efficient a server is now. The server or the hardware is part of the problem, of course, but we're not

370
00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.579 
have of course the software that runs the software, yes ultimately the hardware that says I need CPU now.

371
00:33:46.579 --> 00:33:52.420 
access, I now need memory access and it's all well and good if I know I now have a server here that consumes

372
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:59.700 
so and so much power, but now if I, as I tried to tell you earlier, if I have a lot of different users on the same server, I can't use that much power.

373
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.779 
the hardware.

374
00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:03.009 
Then how do I get out

375
00:34:03.009 --> 00:34:09.369 
Who is really responsible for this now? Am I now, let's say the one who consumed the five watts or the one next to me?

376
00:34:09.369 --> 00:34:14.440 
I'm running on the same one myself virtually next to it, so clearly measuring the hardware is one thing.

377
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.340 
But we also have to look at the abstraction higher up.

378
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:24.170 
And in some processes, the cloud for example, there's infrastructure service and at the top is one now FaaS or

379
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.599 
once below that Software as a Service.

380
00:34:25.599 --> 00:34:30.219 
They don't have access to the lower layers at all, it's deliberate and it's hard when I'm completely

381
00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:33.250 
top of this layer, to get information from the bottom.

382
00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:39.039 
But it is precisely this separation that has to be resolved.

383
00:34:39.039 --> 00:34:47.639 
We need to bring information from the hardware level in a non-writable way all the way up to the end process.

384
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:52.559 
If we don't do that, the end process can never be able to evaluate itself whether it's efficient or not now and that's just

385
00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:58.949 
the problem we have in the data centre the information from the building services I can't pass on to the IT because the ITSec, so

386
00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.659 
IT security forbids me to do that.

387
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:06.690 
These are the problems we have to solve to get rid of this strict separation and we have to figure out how to do that safely.

388
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:12.239 
but all this energy information is really always read-only, the rest is done by the

389
00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:15.170 
higher level systems

390
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.679 
I will directly

391
00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:20.909 
because they were talking about security, it's always stressed here.

392
00:35:20.909 --> 00:35:27.639 
At the same time, we think that it goes without saying that in the steel sector, in every sector, the data is made available,

393
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.420 
also in aviation and so on.

394
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:35.190 
Where you say there are competitive aspects because that's mainly driven by how efficiently I fly.

395
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:41.920 
That's a major cost factor, I think the IT area also has to get away from saying I can use it for security and safety.

396
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:48.559 
arguments, but it must nevertheless come to the fact that this data is made available and there are these

397
00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:54.960 
approaches that we have via measurement are a first possibility that you then oblige the actors who are further down these

398
00:35:55.059 --> 00:36:01.710 
data and then you can use this check to see how much of these capacities, you had also said at the

399
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:02.590 
CPU and so on,

400
00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:07.090 
then i use for which service, then i can add up again on the next higher level until i reach

401
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:13.130 
where in fact the end consumer is of the service who then either for reasons of cost because you have price incentives

402
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:21.809 
or for self-promotion reasons and and commitment reasons i want to be climate neutral then stop

403
00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:26.150 
one or the other data centre chooses one or the other cloud provider, therefore manages more efficiently.

404
00:36:27.889 --> 00:36:30.610 
Security should never beat energy efficiency.

405
00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:37.480 
Energy efficiency is not secret information, this is not information that will allow any attacker to create a

406
00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.030 
data centre, a service that has nothing to do with this at all.

407
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:48.179 
It's solely about preventing them, as a customer, from being able to transparently choose another provider if I, as a provider, have

408
00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:53.860 
don't tell them how bad my data centre is, just say I have the best price and the other one is super good,

409
00:36:53.860 --> 00:37:01.110 
is more expensive, gives a super efficient price, but the purchasing department says "Friedjof is much cheaper, we'll go for him".

410
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:01.949 
go to him".

411
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:08.769 
Then I won, but if I am obliged or obliged by the client, we don't have to be regulatory there at all.

412
00:37:08.769 --> 00:37:09.219 
intervene;

413
00:37:09.219 --> 00:37:14.300 
The client can demand that and say "If you don't tell me how efficient a data centre is, then you get the contract

414
00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.639 
not", then the issue is over. And that comes

415
00:37:16.639 --> 00:37:19.050 
and that's what the blue angel is for, for example.

416
00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:24.239 
Of course, I can also demand that your data centre must have a blue angel, otherwise you won't get the order.

417
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.230 
I think the conversation thread is over.

418
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.170 
Then we go to the next question.

419
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:39.929 
There was a mike just now, I was

420
00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:43.019 
Thank you, my name is Alexander Felsenwerk from

421
00:37:43.019 --> 00:37:51.340 
Green Coder Initiative of the World Summit Awards, we are a UN competition and award digital solutions that help support sustainability.

422
00:37:51.829 --> 00:38:00.469 
I have several questions, and that is I know that your initiative is a measurement process for, or I have knowledge of, a

423
00:38:00.469 --> 00:38:07.670 
measurement process for cloud providers. I would be interested if you could maybe go into that briefly again.

424
00:38:08.289 --> 00:38:16.039 
That would be one point, the other point, so at the moment I am still lacking a bit of transparency in the measurement procedure.

425
00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:23.139 
and the motivation, how to get it to the companies or into the teams,

426
00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:28.510 
because in the end it's always what does it cost and how quickly is it implemented?

427
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:32.920 
And how safe is it, so in the triple jump approximately and how,

428
00:38:32.929 --> 00:38:42.219 
if we actually have an implementation of the ideas that we want to make IT greener, save energy resources, how do we get

429
00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:52.210 
we actually get it into the companies that the decision is made for green IT or for green IT criteria?

430
00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:52.969 
fall?

431
00:38:53.239 --> 00:39:00.320 
I know that was a lot, but the topic is extensive. Yes so the SDIA With the cloud system I can't say that much I am

432
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:07.610 
in this working group or steering group, but there is a publication on our homepage from the

433
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:16.559 
SDIA on this, you would just have to talk to Max Schulz or just the people who are the contact persons, it's on all of them.

434
00:39:16.559 --> 00:39:23.269 
It is an open standard in all cases that anyone can use and the idea is to create this transparency and to make it easier to understand.

435
00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:25.780 
to be able to assign them,

436
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:31.280 
how much energy does the cloud need to provision one of my application my application accordingly, that's the

437
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.130 
idea behind it.

438
00:39:32.139 --> 00:39:37.519 
And for that we are also looking for a practice partner who supports us, where we can simply try it out.

439
00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:39.030 
Because at the moment the status is,

440
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:44.030 
we have defined the interface, that was not so difficult, but now have to go into the field and try it out.

441
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.670 
Maybe I'll add to that because we worked on that in the theme as well.

442
00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:53.980 
Rather exemplary as a proof of concept does this basically work or not.

443
00:39:53.980 --> 00:40:01.210 
And there is indeed a need to talk together with practice partners about how you can

444
00:40:01.329 --> 00:40:10.329 
a correct allocation of effort for a service related to the individual elements of the data centre, what is required there?

445
00:40:10.329 --> 00:40:12.739 
reasonably make?

446
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:20.099 
That, that is sort of still open, but the basic logic that works at least in the pilots was that

447
00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:24.679 
you say I have a data centre, which consists of certain parts infrastructure, storage and so on.

448
00:40:25.159 --> 00:40:33.679 
I have a service which I can also categorise, for example video streaming I want to do or online

449
00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:43.300 
storage space, and for that I can also find numerical numbers, so an hour of video streaming and then look at how much

450
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:47.730 
of the data centre, the different elements of the data centre are used for that.

451
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:55.309 
What are the costs of these different elements of the data centre, do we need to look at the utilisation phase and the production phase again?

452
00:40:55.309 --> 00:41:01.059 
phase, in terms of resources, and then I can allocate that accordingly and then actually come to

453
00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:06.650 
Effort metrics of one hour of video streaming for the resource;

454
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:13.010 
How much resource demand does this have, how much energy demand does this have, what is the greenhouse gas potential of this and what is the water consumption?

455
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.150 
does that have?

456
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:18.010 
And so then I have comparability, but for the comparability to be there, the standards have to be the same.

457
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:23.769 
And the point is above all the question If a data centre does not only have one service, i.e. only video, then it has to be comparable.

458
00:41:23.769 --> 00:41:30.360 
streaming or so, but several how do I then divide, how do I get the numbers, how can I divide that sensibly:

459
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:39.710 
The expenditure that the computer centre has in general, related to the respective services,

460
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.900 
Well that didn't cover your questions exhaustively.

461
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:50.809 
But I think within the scope of what we can do here today of the situation.

462
00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:55.409 
There was still the question of motivation, how do you bring that into the teams, into the management?

463
00:41:55.409 --> 00:42:01.130 
Maybe one point on this from our side we would say that it will certainly not just be on a voluntary basis.

464
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:06.030 
based, if only because we don't have the time when they look at the dimensions:

465
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:12.260 
Was also said this morning at what rate we need to save much more greenhouse gases than we have so far, and

466
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:17.690 
that at the same time in the field of ICT, which is running exactly in the opposite direction, so there is more and more of everything.

467
00:42:18.699 --> 00:42:24.960 
If it is multiplied again, then it is clear that we have to move forward relatively quickly and ultimately this will be achieved through transparency.

468
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.519 
obligations in many areas.

469
00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:33.090 
You can start transitionally with like the blue angels and like voluntary aspects but even there they have

470
00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:37.610 
yes, it is a good idea to make it compulsory to procure according to blue angel standards.

471
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:37.880 
is.

472
00:42:38.019 --> 00:42:43.260 
You could start in the public sector by making this a condition of public procurement.

473
00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:50.289 
and create a market incentive and also reward it for those who go ahead but ultimately we're certainly going to see

474
00:42:50.289 --> 00:42:54.320 
with standards that are set and then the market can act on that.

475
00:42:54.449 --> 00:43:00.070 
Last point price signals this morning said important I would say yes important I honestly know myself at the price signals.

476
00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:01.769 
when they become effective here.

477
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:08.550 
Just a warning message, because this also happens in other sectors. We just have to get the prices right.

478
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.219 
and then it's good.

479
00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:15.039 
If you compare what kind of price signals you need to have a control effect in the energy sector and in the building sector, you can see that the price signals are not the same.

480
00:43:15.039 --> 00:43:18.429 
sector in the transport sector, then they, then I wouldn't need to talk any further.

481
00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:23.750 
Then it is clear that a uniform CO2 price will not do it, but I need other measures to accompany it, for example

482
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:24.809 
standards and things like that.

483
00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:36.000 
Thank you I think we have time for a short final question. He's been somebody else before please,

484
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:46.500 
I think there's a mike

485
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:57.659 
My german is not good enough to say this or I would turn this into a comedy show. My question really is that on one hand you talk about standards and the way of measuring.

486
00:43:57.659 --> 00:44:06.760 
I'm wondering a little from the other side, which is expectations in the public, particularly, but more broadly in industry as well,

487
00:44:06.769 --> 00:44:20.880 
that is, do you see a way to build a greater sense of responsibility if you will or opportunity

488
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.880 
on the other side through building better understanding

489
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:33.170 
of what is clearly a fairly complex, I mean as everybody has outlined, a very complex situation in terms of the actual energy use

490
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:41.400 
and the nature of the applications and the cloud computing etc. I think from my

491
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.519 
observations I would

492
00:44:42.519 --> 00:44:46.199 
that that's not well understood

493
00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:49.889 
broadly, even in

494
00:44:49.889 --> 00:45:00.150 
parts of the industry that is not directly involved in solving these kinds of problems. I would just be very interested in your thoughts on how to

495
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.199 
match those expectations and the understanding that would drive it.

496
00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:09.190 
Thank you.

497
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.289 
Who would like to?

498
00:45:11.289 --> 00:45:14.710 
I can maybe say something about how we try to resolve this a little bit.

499
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:20.570 
We're very values driven and very driven about culture and we try very much to go into exchange which for us is

500
00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:25.510 
important for us and also to exchange with our colleagues and to talk about things we have for example the

501
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:31.409 
"why how and what" after Simon Sinek and sat down together with the big team and talked about the

502
00:45:31.409 --> 00:45:33.710 
tried to find out What is it that really drives us?

503
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:42.110 
We found out that it is indeed the case that many people in the company feel responsibility and sustainability

504
00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:43.289 
and would like to take that on.

505
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:47.809 
It may also have the background from the Otto Group that with the cultures of the 4.0 very much in

506
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:54.230 
and I think we are very well positioned in this respect and it is noticeable.

507
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:57.550 
That this reaches the individual and the individual, that is important.

508
00:45:57.559 --> 00:46:03.230 
And that one then notices Oh yes, this is an issue for many, one cannot integrate it into the daily work.

509
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:09.000 
that is super difficult to say, I now integrate responsibility in my daily work and do something for it, because that

510
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.519 
is so abstract, it's so diffuse, it's not really tangible.

511
00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:19.130 
But if you manage to agree that this is a value and then work together on it, on a strategy, then it's a value.

512
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:23.989 
from the company management says yes, we want to drive the issue, we set the guidelines.

513
00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.940 
We see to it that it goes in the right direction, that it is consistent, that it is transparent and that it is in line with the specific objectives.

514
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:36.030 
principles, then you create the framework, but at the same time you have to make it possible that the colleagues of their own accord

515
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:42.829 
are able to develop this and to live this and that is what is emerging in our case, which I think is very valuable.

516
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:49.550 
and where we are actively working on it and where we really hope that what is emerging now will bear fruit in the long term.

517
00:46:49.559 --> 00:46:55.710 
and that this will also transfer to other companies and that they will find a similar approach without it being regulated from above

518
00:46:55.710 --> 00:47:01.269 
and that they say you have to do this now, but it is just such an intrinsic asset that is developing

519
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:07.039 
and that is shared the example with security: IT security is a topic, that is in everyone's heads everyone does IT security

520
00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:13.059 
that's normal and that's by design and we would like that to be exactly the same with sustainability and

521
00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:18.690 
responsibility, that that is by design and that we develop that from the ground up and take that into account, that

522
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:23.090 
is our commitment that we want to pursue and we hope that is fruitful.

523
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.679 
Half minute.

524
00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.650 
What I have to add to this briefly,

525
00:47:30.659 --> 00:47:31.380 
would like is.

526
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.570 
I don't only see politics and the economy as being responsible, but also the user himself.

527
00:47:35.579 --> 00:47:41.349 
When I buy a refrigerator, for example, I know exactly what its energy efficiency is. As a computer scientist I now know

528
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:48.650 
for example a google query consumes about or imitates for a gram of co2 so I really need to know everything about it.

529
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:55.489 
google I really have to use every webserver all the time, so I can't go say into libraries for example, the five

530
00:47:55.489 --> 00:47:57.920 
metres over there and look it up myself.

531
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.119 
Or do I have to call up Wikipedia and read ten thousand pages now?

532
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:06.780 
So the responsibility is also with us, but for that we need the awareness of what needs to be done e.g. a Google query, what needs to be done.

533
00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:09.760 
is a TikTok video, how much a YouTube video and so on.

534
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.210 
And I would like to end with this appeal.

535
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:20.929 
One more quote I think it's from the little prince and it fits in very well with what you both said at the beginning.

536
00:48:21.579 --> 00:48:26.699 
We also have to practise a bit of self-restrained, not always doing everything that is possible, also sometimes with others.

537
00:48:26.699 --> 00:48:33.409 
And that's the famous thing, if you want people to build a ship, don't teach them to build a ship.

538
00:48:33.409 --> 00:48:36.730 
how to build it, but the longing for the sea and this longing for the sea,

539
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:43.159 
if that is with all of you who are in the IT field, the longing for sustainability in digitalisation

540
00:48:43.159 --> 00:48:49.420 
then that helps at least the same, if not much more, than the best standards and so all their difficulties

541
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.289 
to get them good enough so that they can be easily implemented.

542
00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:58.079 
I think the longing for more, like this in such a sustainability is the perfect closing word for this session.

543
00:48:58.469 --> 00:49:04.639 
I thank the panellists, I thank the audience for the questions asked and I hand over to Mr Meinel for the next

544
00:49:04.639 --> 00:49:04.840 
Sentences.

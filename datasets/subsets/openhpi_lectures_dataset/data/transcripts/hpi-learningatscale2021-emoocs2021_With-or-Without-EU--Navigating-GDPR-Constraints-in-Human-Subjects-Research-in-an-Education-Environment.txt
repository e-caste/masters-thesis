00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.010 
hi there my name is alex duncan and i'm the associate director

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.870 
of student experience for georgia tech's online masters of

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.170 
science and computer science program or mscs.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.260 
today i'll be presenting a paper i wrote with david joyner

5
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.480 
who is the executive director of online education and

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.170 
mscs at georgia tech.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.770 
the paper is titled with or without navigating gdpr constraints

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.830 
in human subjects research in an education environment.

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.850 
it describes our experiences with and recommendations for ensuring

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.940 
data privacy compliance when working with data subjects in

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.050 
the european union.

12
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.510 
the general data protection regulation or gdpr outlines principles

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.670 
for collecting and using personal data related to people living

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.820 
in the european union or EU.

15
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.940 
it applies to eu residents regardless of where the data collectors are located.

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.610 
this means that an institution like georgia tech even though

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.710 
it's located in the united states must comply with the gdpr

18
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.810 
when conducting research on students living in the eu.

19
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.530 
we wanted to survey students in our own cs program about personal

20
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.890 
obstacles they faced during their time in the program. as of

21
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.420 
the fall twenty twenty semester, about five percent of our students

22
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.460 
lived in the eu we didn't want to exclude these students from

23
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.440 
our research and risk losing their unique perspectives.

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.210 
so we needed to ensure our study complied with the gdpr

25
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.050 
per georgia tech's gdpr policies. this meant we had to get explicit

26
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.020 
signed consent from our eu respondents.

27
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.540 
there were two main challenges with making sure our research was gdpr compliant.

28
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.330 
first we needed to contact respondents by email and their consent

29
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.830 
was required to retrieve their email addresses.

30
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.930 
to email students to obtain their consent we obviously had

31
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.130 
to retrieve their email addresses which required obtaining

32
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.840 
their consent which required retrieving their email addresses

33
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.210 
and so on. setting up a paradox that seemed to prevent us from

34
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
ever contacting anyone in the eu.

35
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.990 
our second challenge was obtaining signatures from eu respondents

36
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.630 
indicating their consent to participate in our study

37
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.660 
our survey software did not include a signature option and

38
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.930 
upgrading or modifying the software would be a long process.

39
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.100 
asking instead for hand-written signatures would have dissuaded

40
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.060 
many people in the eu from responding to the survey introducing a response bias.

41
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.790 
ultimately our legal team concluded that the gdpr would not

42
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.210 
actually apply to our survey which fortunately allowed us to

43
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.260 
run the survey in the spring of this year.

44
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.280 
based on our experiences we have a few recommendations for

45
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
anyone conducting research that might be impacted by the gdpr.

46
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.140 
first learn about the gdpr and its major components, personal

47
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.990 
data lawful basis consent research and the rights of eu data subjects.

48
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.570 
second work with your legal team and involve them early

49
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.230 
you may also consider getting your legal team to help develop

50
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.890 
your gdpr procedures and best practices.

51
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
third consider requesting consent from all research subjects

52
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
far in advance and outside the context of any specific research study if possible.

53
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.790 
our experiences along with the growing number of countries

54
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.360 
that have national data privacy laws highlight the increasing

55
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.010 
need for collaboration within research communities to develop

56
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.090 
tools and processes that facilitate data privacy compliance.

57
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.170 
this will prevent research being stalled and more importantly

58
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.520 
prevent the systematic exclusion of certain populations.

59
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.830 
thanks for watching this presentation. i hope it was helpful

60
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.990 
to you all. and if you have any questions our emails are right

61
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.830 
there on the screen. thanks again.

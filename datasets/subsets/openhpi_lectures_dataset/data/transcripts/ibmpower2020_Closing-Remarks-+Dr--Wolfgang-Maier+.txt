00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.400 
Hi, out there! First of all, let
me congratulate you for working

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.910 
through the course of
Future of Computing -

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.100 
on the Road to Quantum and at the
same time let me thank Andreas

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.630 
for this great opportunity to
introduce the IBM power architecture

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.250 
in the light of enterprise computing and to
introduce completely new compute paradigms

6
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.160 
as you have seen for quantum
computing, featuring the openHPI

7
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.120 
MOOC platform. In the course
of the past few weeks

8
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.720 
you've got detailed insights into the
challenges of today's IT infrastructure

9
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.880 
and hopefully, you also got the
right pointers to face challenges

10
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.570 
by means of picking a workable
architecture which is capable

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:58.600 
to deal with them. The course took you
through the complete system stack

12
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.720 
of today's IT systems and it
also opened some new doors

13
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.860 
in regard to new
compute paradigms

14
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.230 
The journey of innovation
is a never-ending one

15
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.330 
In the research and development
labs, scientists were constantly

16
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.550 
on the characteristics and implementations
of future computing machines

17
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.900 
As a major critical step for the well familiar
with Neumann architecture, the adoption

18
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.170 
of CMOS technology based on the so-called
Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL)

19
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.830 
is approaching soon. EUV will
push the ending of Moore's

20
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.760 
law a little bit further into the future
as it allows for an even higher density

21
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.560 
of transistors
per square inch

22
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.720 
The IBM power architecture is
well underway in this endeavour

23
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.210 
and the next generation of systems
will leverage the advantages

24
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.180 
of such technology

25
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.920 
At the same time, there are completely
new computer approaches on the horizon,

26
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.160 
these architectures have the potential to augment
today's implementations of computing machines

27
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.460 
and focus on specific applications
as they are brought in by

28
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.720 
artificial intelligence and analytics
issues in the context of big data

29
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.560 
Brain-inspired computing
respectively quantum computing are

30
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.950 
prominent representatives
of such approaches

31
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
which embrace analog compute paradigms
as they had been considered

32
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.100 
in the early days of automated
computing or introduced completely

33
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.210 
new widgets like so-called qubits (quantum bit)
which operate on the base of quantum theory

34
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.640 
The task at hand is to find the best
solution for how these various

35
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.980 
approaches can be combined and
integrated in the best manner

36
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.910 
to solve the problems of
tomorrow and beyond. With this

37
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.450 
thanks again for joining this
course and stay tuned for the

38
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.990 
future. Bye Bye :)

Hi, my name is George Kembel. I teach
design thinking and creativity

2
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.340 
around the world. I want to talk
to you a little bit today about

3
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.030 
how do you start to move from
finding inspiration to creating

4
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.620 
new solutions. Now, in your
finding inspiration work

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.610 
you probably gathered a lot
of really interesting

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.810 
information about people and
observations about things that

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.570 
you found out. And you
want to start to-

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
my guess is: &amp;quot;How you
make sense of it all?&amp;quot;

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.210 
That would be a natural question.
At one level you don't have

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.110 
to make sense of it all. It's
not really a thinking process,

11
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.990 
it's more about a practice of
noticing and about finding those

12
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.450 
little gems that stand out to
you that might be the nuggets

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.040 
of good insights. And so
one of the questions that

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.300 
students ask us all the time is: &amp;quot;How
do i know what a good insight is?&amp;quot;

15
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.650 
I think for me, a good insight
is just something that is-

16
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.460 
that surprised you or is unexpected to you.
You don't have to think too hard about

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.380 
it but if you notice something
and it stood out to you

18
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.110 
that's worth calling
out. For example

19
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.250 
I was having a conversation
about a different project

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
with a sound designer in Florence
and I was asking him about

21
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.720 
how does he mark meaningful moments in his
life. So we had a really interesting

22
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.100 
conversation about that, and one
thing that really stood out

23
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.990 
to me that I noticed that
surprised me is: He had a ritual

24
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.040 
before he went into the
city to record sounds.

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.570 
He would put himself in a
place of silence first.

26
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.170 
That surprised me. So that's
an example of something that

27
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
stood out to me, I would
call that an insight:

28
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.910 
that sometimes in the
practice of sound recording

29
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.200 
and maybe something
to do before you go

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.180 
to put yourself in place of silence.
So whatever you're working

31
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.760 
on, I would say go back through
the information that you had

32
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.730 
in those conversations or observations
and just look at all of

33
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.510 
that. Again, don't make sense
of all of it but just

34
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.440 
in a practice of noticing what
stood out to you as unexpected

35
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.900 
and surprising and just note that.
You might want write that down

36
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.730 
and put it on a board next to you
and gather a handful of them

37
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.610 
and one of them will be interesting.
You don't really know which one

38
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.130 
would be most insightful until
father on the process.

39
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.430 
So go ahead and give that
a try, and good luck!

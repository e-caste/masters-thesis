00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.220 
Now we are at the end of our openHPI
course - A Half Century of Internet

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.810 
We discussed in the first week the
digitalization of our world.

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.240 
How our world is changed by these
new technologies on the internet?

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.390 
What was the internet changing
in our world that it became,

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.210 
in a very short time,
global communication

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.280 
platform and
interaction platform?

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.730 
In the second week, we had a closer look
at how computer networks are working

8
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.460 
to understand the idea of how information
is transported from computer to computer

9
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.780 
at the end on the internet. In
the third week, we saw that

10
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.890 
the internet is a network of networks.
The various, the millions, the

11
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480 
hundreds of millions of computer
networks are interconnected

12
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.170 
to form the internet and for the
user it looks like a uniform

13
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:13.370 
network by means of the internet protocols,
by means of TCP/IP protocol stack

14
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.420 
Then we start in the third week
and continued in the fourth week

15
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.010 
to discuss these protocols in more
detail to understand how communication

16
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.180 
is organized on
the internet.

17
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.380 
Then the internet, of course,
is so interesting so popular

18
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.070 
because of the many
internet applications.

19
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.400 
We considered how internet
application could use the internet

20
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.230 
for their purposes and in the
final week, in the six weeks of

21
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.470 
our openHPI course we discussed
internet and web security.

22
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.560 
We saw different risks and
attack possibilities and also

23
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.910 
gave some information, some hints
on how to protect oneself.

24
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.520 
So, now as the course is finishing
and the final activity is the exam.

25
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.550 
You can take the exam to get a certificate
and the exam's week is the week

26
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.080 
from 13th to
19th October

27
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.730 
in this year.

28
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.680 
So, the final
exam works

29
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.080 
very similar to the weekly
homework, weekly assignments.

30
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.440 
The only difference is that
it takes 120 minutes

31
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.150 
instead of 60 minutes and that the
questions are not only about

32
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.310 
the last week, the questions are
now about the content of all

33
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.140 
six weeks of
our course.

34
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.360 
The results of this final exam
provide 50% of the mark,

35
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.560 
the other 50% came
from your homework.

36
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.870 
So, what I wish to you is good luck.
Good Luck for the final exam!

37
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.690 
and hope to see you in one of
our next openHPI courses.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.030 
Welcome to this video clip in which we discuss the objective of conformance checking.

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.560 
So the essence of conformance checking is comparing the event log

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260 
and the blueprint process model. Well, so what we are basically interested in is

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.930 
whether the intended process execution deviates from

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.579 
the actual process execution. And to this end, we compare the event log

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.059 
and the blueprint process model and simply investigate where the actual

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.319 
process of execution deviates from our plan.

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
The most common use case in practice is identifying so-called violation patterns.

9
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.590 
So let's take a look at what these violation patterns are

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
and what kind of feedback they provide us with.

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.639 
There are a number of violation patterns.

12
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.259 
A conformance checking analysis can reveal and illustrate this we use this

13
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.939 
very small fragment here of just consisting of two different activities

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.641 
invite claim review and receive claim review.

15
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.549 
So the first violation pattern we may observe, we may find is

16
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.274 
that particular activity has been skipped, in this particular case receiving

17
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.079 
the claim review, we invited it, but we never received it.

18
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.029 
So we realize, OK, this activity was skipped or

19
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.030 
has been missing.

20
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.672 
The second violation pattern we may find is that the activities have

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.540 
been executed in the wrong order.

22
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.571 
You know, we can argue whether this makes sense in this context, but we may still observe

23
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.000 
it for some reason we don't understand yet.

24
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.879 
And so the wrong order activity order is a second violation pattern.

25
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.520 
The third violation pattern is a pattern relating to unexpected activity.

26
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.199 
So additional activities that we have not foreseen in our blueprint process

27
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.969 
model, that we have not foreseen in our plan. Here in this particular case, we have

28
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.596 
used this to illustrate this, Imagine we have invited the claim review and

29
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.330 
then we receive the claim review.

30
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.370 
But we for some reason observed that this activity has been executed multiple times,

31
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.369 
not just once, but multiple times.

32
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.689 
So this would then be an unexpected activity.

33
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.699 
So these are three main patterns, main violation patterns we may identify

34
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.229 
we may find as an outcome of a conformance checking analysis and of

35
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.910 
course, provide us with valuable insights about the process of execution.

36
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.610 
In general, why do we do conformance checking?

37
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.748 
And then it's important to point out that there are different scenarios in which a

38
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.879 
conformance assessment is important.

39
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.589 
The first is detecting problems and quality improvement potential in the process.

40
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.139 
This is something that we have looked at in week one.

41
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.115 
So we have discovered the first model and then have realized that there are

42
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.559 
aspects we haven't included and that should be included in the model.

43
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.169 
And we have enhanced our model.

44
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.288 
We have improved the representation of the event log.

45
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.614 
So we have included additional aspects in the model.

46
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.719 
And this is something that we can use in conformance analysis realized that simply

47
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.370 
aspects missing and we include that.

48
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.525 
The second is obtaining feedback on how well the process is aligned with expectations

49
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.497 
and the intended process. So our expectations and the intended process are captured

50
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.842 
in our blueprint process model and the actual process execution is, of course, the event

51
00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:31.229 
log. And by understanding where they differ,

52
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.620 
we can get valuable feedback on violation patterns, on a

53
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.999 
potential compliance violations.

54
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.719 
And this is something that can be very important in many contacts.

55
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.639 
And this is also related to the third use case we have listed here.

56
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.770 
So complying with laws and regulations.

57
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.990 
So besides detecting that there may be an inefficiency because we have conducted

58
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.155 
an activity twice, there are also very severe cases where we would like to understand

59
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.469 
do we comply with laws and regulations?

60
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.909 
So think of the banking or the financial sector, in general insurance

61
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.020 
sector. There are a lot of strict laws and regulations that we have to follow.

62
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.879 
And of course, we would like to make sure that these are followed in the context

63
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.283 
of our processes and a process executions.

64
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.660 
And conformance checking can help us to detect violations

65
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.279 
and to understand, of course, also when and where

66
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.399 
these violations happen.

67
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.861 
In the next clip, we will look at how such a conformance analysis can

68
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.749 
be actually executed and we will look a little bit into the technical mechanisms

69
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.290 
behind it.

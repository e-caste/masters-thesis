Hi everyone! In this video we would
like to talk about the ethics

2
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.970 
and values that we would like
to promote in this course.

3
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.250 
Our aim as instructional designers
is for you to learn the skills

4
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.920 
relevant for human-centered
design. Especially when it comes

5
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.450 
to synthesizing data
and coming up with

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.490 
creative solutions.- We designed
opportunities for you to practice

7
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.650 
what you learned without being
graded. There is one assignment

8
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.840 
which is peer-reviewed. This
means that you will evaluate

9
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.640 
each other's work.- But getting
a good grade in the assignment

10
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.720 
should not be the focus of your work.
Instead, use the open feedback

11
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.390 
section of your assignment to give
each other constructive feedback.

12
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.630 
We all like to get
feedback because it

13
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.630 
helps us to reflect on our
work and improve our work

14
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.300 
so keep this in mind when you review
the other peers' work and elaborate

15
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.190 
on your points. Also give the reasoning
behind your feedback so that

16
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.430 
we get more constructive reviews.-
Although in most education

17
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.140 
systems around the globe we get
evaluated by our competitiveness

18
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.100 
and the grades we get, here's a
chance to try out and learn.

19
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.280 
So take advantage of it and don't
only focus on getting a good

20
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.250 
grade in this course.

21
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.210 
We're very excited to have thousands
of participants from all over

22
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.200 
the globe. This means that we have
a very diverse learning community

23
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.990 
in terms of culture and language.
In this course we celebrate

24
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.540 
diversity and our aim is to create
culturally inclusive learning experiences.

25
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.400 
Be mindful of the language
that you use in the

26
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.740 
discussion forum and the comments
and the assignment reviews.

27
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.730 
While in some cultures people are
used to very direct feedback,

28
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.290 
it might sound a bit harsh for
people coming from other cultures.

29
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.000 
So point out the positive as well
as the shortcomings when you

30
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.980 
write your reviews. And it also
helps if you give the reasoning

31
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.930 
for why you think something is
positive or why you think something

32
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.300 
is improvable. It helps your
peer to better understand

33
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.380 
why you graded the
person like this.

34
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.040 
And we would like to ask you to keep
the questions and discussions

35
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.950 
in the forums in English so that
everyone can participate in them.

36
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
This course shall help you to
learn about the fundamental

37
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.150 
skills of synthesis and idea
generation and we would like to

38
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.550 
encourage you to take this back
to your work and projects.

39
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.360 
So we hope you have fun and you learn
something new in this module.

40
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.910 
See you in the course!

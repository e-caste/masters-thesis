00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.570 
hello everyone. my name is Jonna Lee,
i'm pleased to present with

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.820 
my co-author Dr. Farahnaz Soleimani on our research projects

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.710 
on the micromasters program.

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.930 
next slide please. As the both of us are research scientists

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.050 
at C21U.

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.990 
next please. first please let me give you some background of our project.

7
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.940 
our data sources primarily came from georgia tech's micromasters
program in analytics.

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.750 
these courses came from the actual online master of science analytics or

9
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.270 
msc degree program at georgia tech since the program's inception

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.270 
in the fall twenty seventeen. this allein program has been increasingly

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.620 
popular for its affordability convenience and career focused courses,

12
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.310 
despite the increasing popularity, however, various learning

13
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.690 
aspects of this type of program have not yet been sufficiently investigated

14
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.190 
compared to traditional

15
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.870 
undergraduate level freely accessible massive open online courses or MOOCs.

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.990 
next slide please. so in this paper

17
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.540 
we were motivated by three main factors.
first, existing literature

18
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.530 
suggests that relying on conventional metrics such as final grade alone

19
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.360 
may not accurately capture full learning experiences.

20
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.170 
therefore it's necessary to explore other alternative measures.

21
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.990 
for example, how learners explore and navigate
course content throughout the course.

22
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.460 
in fact most recently researchers have increasingly used click stream data

23
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.860 
from MOOCs which log detailed user activities in order to understand

24
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.880 
old-line students' behavioral patterns and inform their cognitive needs.

25
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.330 
next slide please,
so this study aims to pave the path towards

26
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.190 
enhancing the design of constituent courses of micromasters program

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.040 
with a focus on the application of machine-learning algorithms.

28
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.030 
thereby we use a large scale click stream ethics database to

29
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.280 
explore the trans in the online engagement of
learners in the micromasters program

30
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.300 
detect click stream events that are highly
correlated with the student's progress

31
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.340 
and investigate how the engagement differ from those in the classic MOOC.

32
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.770 
we elaborate on notable differences in engagement patterns

33
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.690 
between these two student groups.

34
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.420 
in order to predict a student's progress rate.

35
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.210 
we explored the statistical properties of
the masters level micromasters program in analytics.

36
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.130 
we analyzed three micromasters courses including introduction

37
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.970 
to analytics modeling computing for data analysis and data

38
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.860 
analytics for business, as well as an individual classic mode

39
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.810 
introduction to computing in python
which was not offered in the micromasters program.

40
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.880 
then we compared the analysis results from micromasters courses

41
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.990 
with those from regular mode to elaborate similarities and distinctions.

42
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.160 
we applied some of the well-known national learning algorithms

43
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.140 
from both the linear ones including a linear regression a stepwise regression

44
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.710 
lasso and non linear ones including backing,
boosting and random

45
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.390 
forest to predict a student's progress.
we implemented a ten

46
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.660 
fold cross-validation technique to set the hyperparameters.

47
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.680 
the k fold cross-validation technique randomly partitions data

48
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.260 
into similar sized case subsets in an iterative process.

49
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.640 
the model is trained using k minus one subsets and is validated

50
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.290 
on the remaining one subset.

51
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.500 
based on comparing the performance of the prediction models

52
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.230 
that we developed using machine learning methods.

53
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.550 
we found that the three based algorithms
including bagging boosting and random

54
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.280 
forest showed the highest prediction accuracy
and the lowest cross-validation error.

55
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.030 
for example for the eyes twenty sixty five or one d nonlinear

56
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.810 
tree based algorithms provided models with
around eighty five percentage accuracy,

57
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.600 
however the other models for a wide accuracies
around seventy five percentage

58
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.220 
overall random forest performed slightly better.
so we recommended

59
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.330 
using it as the promising approach.

60
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.930 
using machine learning techniques on particularly the random

61
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.820 
forest. we identified bleak extreme events that are highly correlated

62
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.340 
with a student's progress based on the results.
we found that

63
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.980 
in the micromasters courses accessing to provided links has

64
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.610 
the highest impact on the student's progress while it was not

65
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.450 
that significant for the regular army.

66
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.780 
also we found that although problem interaction was indicated

67
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.250 
as a significant activity in both courses.
it had more weights

68
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.290 
in the micromasters courses in another hand in the regular.
army

69
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.390 
students were more willing to navigate through the only tools

70
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.720 
and search particular contents.

71
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.180 
in this project we applied a variety of machine learning techniques

72
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.130 
to investigate the best feature approach, feature selection

73
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.550 
approach among machine learning predictive models to reduce

74
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.580 
model complexity and improve prediction performance.

75
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.670 
we observed that the non linear algorithms provided
better overall performance than

76
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.920 
the linear alternatives which indicate the non linear relationship

77
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.420 
between the click stream events and the learning outcome.

78
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.190 
that the for instance between the carrier inspiration of the students

79
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.660 
in the professional micromasters program and those in the non-degree

80
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.920 
mode revealed some significant discrepancies among their online

81
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.610 
engagement with the course contents. one notable observation

82
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.950 
is that those features that are related to provided links and

83
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.090 
problems embedded in the courseware indicated high weights

84
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.380 
in the progress rate of learners who were enrolled
in the micromasters program.

85
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.500 
there why these two course features should be efficiently optimized

86
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.700 
in the instructional design process.

87
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.290 
thank you everyone for your attention throughout our presentation.

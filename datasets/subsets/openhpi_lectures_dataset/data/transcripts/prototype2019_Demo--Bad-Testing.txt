00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.360 
For our testing videos we
picked a colleague, Dominic,

2
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.570 
to test the 'Sports Buddy' prototype
because he practices a lot of sports.

3
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.860 
Hi Dominic, it's great that you
found time today for the testing!

4
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.390 
I want to test an idea that
I put a lot of thought and

5
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.110 
time into and I think it's a
very cool prototype. And

6
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.330 
I picked you because I know that you do
sports right? - Yes, a lot. - Okay.

7
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.100 
And you also like to do things with
your friends I guess. - Sure,

8
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.370 
all the time, yeah, like everybody does.
- Like everyone. Yeah. So I think

9
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.170 
this idea is really something
for you, and it could make

10
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.590 
your 'doing sports' easier. It's an
app, it's called 'Sports Buddy',

11
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.030 
and it shall help you,
to motivate you, to go

12
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.170 
and practice because of your friends.
- Great, I would like that.

13
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.670 
Yeah, so let me show you how it
works. So this is what it looks

14
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
like, and you enter the app
and it asks you 'who do you

15
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.250 
want to partner up with?', 'who do
you want to pick as your sports

16
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.650 
buddy?' Here you access
your phone book

17
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.410 
and it asks you who you
want to partner up with.

18
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.430 
So who do you think is a good
pick for doing sports together?

19
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.740 
So a good friend of mine, like Chris for
example. - Okay, then we add Chris

20
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.230 
and the app sends an
invitation to Chris.

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.460 
Of course we have to wait a
little because Chris also needs

22
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.570 
to look at his phone, and... all right,
Chris accepted your invitation.

23
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.630 
Hey, cool! - So now
actually we can start

24
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.750 
with the real idea. So what
you see here is a calendar

25
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.510 
and you already see all the dates
that Chris picked, where he wants

26
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.160 
to go exercising. So what
would you do now? - So I can

27
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.360 
plan my training with Chris,
right? - Yeah yeah, sure.

28
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.680 
So you need to pick a date now. -
Okay, so I would go for Thursday.

29
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.700 
Only Thursday?- Yeah maybe
I can do Tuesday as well.

30
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.220 
Tuesday and Thursday, ok.
Yeah I mean to get fit,

31
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.250 
two dates is better.- Or maybe even
more. but for now it's good.

32
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
Okay, yeah, then we leave these,
you see when you go and do sports

33
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.010 
and when Chris will go and do
sports. So one day before you want

34
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.760 
to go, you get a reminder you
get this push notification.

35
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.840 
Yes, 'my friend is ready for sports,
how about you?' Yes, I'm ready

36
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.230 
too. I want to go to the spot
with Chris now. - Okay,

37
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.150 
so do you think you're going together
with him? - Yes. - No, no,

38
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.100 
I mean he is going probably
on different dates so

39
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.650 
it doesn't mean that you have
to go together with him but

40
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.760 
you plan your dates, he
plans his dates and then

41
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.170 
all of you go and work out. So it
pressures you to go. - Okay so we go

42
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.770 
separately? - Yeah, exactly.
So you like the idea?

43
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.260 
Yeah yeah, its nice. - Yeah?
Okay. I also have some other

44
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.430 
features in mind, I don't know
if you would like them. So for

45
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.930 
example you could have at the
end of the month an overview

46
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.740 
how often you went. Would
you like that? - Hmm,

47
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.910 
yes, yesm to get statistics, right?
- Yeah and is it better...

48
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.630 
do you want this, or then
we could also put your

49
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.060 
status next to Chris' status. -
Okay, then I can go with Chris

50
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.080 
the next month. - You will
still go by yourself,

51
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.170 
no ... that's actually not of your
concern, it's just to show,

52
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.740 
like, you for example went
more often than Chris.

53
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.020 
Yeah yeah. I like it. -
Yeah you like it? - Hm.

54
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.680 
I think you just confirmed what I
already thought: my prototype

55
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.900 
is.... that it's good. Yeah,
I think I'll let you know

56
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.760 
when we launch it and will celebrate
you as our first user, I hope!

57
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.910 
And, yeah - have a nice
day. - Cool, thanks!

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.950 
Welcome. Welcome to our coffee
talk session for our openHPI

3
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.550 
course Digital Entrepreneurship.
With this course, we aim to

4
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.210 
introduce students to the world
of digital entrepreneurship.

5
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.500 
We're glad to have you

6
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.830 
and especially happy to have with us
today Frank Pawlitschek who is

7
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.190 
the head of the
HPI e-School and

8
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360 
who is not only an educator for
entrepreneurship, but actually

9
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.340 
a very successful entrepreneur
himself. So we are quite curious to

10
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.380 
learn more about your view on digital
entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial mindset.

11
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.160 
I hope you have your coffee or
tea ready and let's get started.

12
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.850 
So first of all could you please
introduce yourself to our

13
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.460 
viewers? Who are you, what's your
background, what do you do?

14
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.470 
Thanks a lot for introducing me
and in particular for having

15
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.700 
me here. It's a great pleasure.
My name is Frank and

16
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.180 
I am heading, as you said, currently
the school of entrepreneurship

17
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.720 
here at Hasso Plattner Institute
and actually make that here

18
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.810 
maybe for the audience that the School
of Entrepreneurship basically is

19
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.340 
existing at HPI to make it easier
for all our students and others

20
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.410 
to actually found a company. So it's about
execution of entrepreneurship and

21
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.250 
my personal background is actually, I
well grew up and became a lawyer first,

22
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.460 
interesting enough. But I was very
lucky that in my early years

23
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.620 
I was able to spend some summers in Silicon
Valley doing some software development and

24
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.730 
have inspired very much from the
whole ecosystem and from the

25
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.260 
whole atmosphere that practically
everyone who has an idea is

26
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.210 
thinking why not just trying it
and found their own company and

27
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.370 
that's that coined me a
lot actually and well

28
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.250 
still I decided to become a lawyer
first and I worked in international

29
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.380 
law firms advising mostly large
clients in technology law and

30
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.650 
mergers and
acquisitions and

31
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.750 
eventually I ended up in Berlin
and a law firm and I met

32
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.290 
someone who was like really
interested in renewable energies

33
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.660 
and suddenly we started discussing
more how to make it possible

34
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.490 
to integrate more and more renewable
energies into the power grid

35
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.480 
instead of discussing law. And well, in
the end we ended up having an idea

36
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.290 
and said, well, wait a moment, why
not trying it? It's really worth

37
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.460 
trying it and this is when we actually
founded in 2008

38
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.070 
a company called Ubitricity and deriving
from ubiquitous and electricity.

39
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.410 
And this company was founded to make it
possible to use the huge batteries

40
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.150 
within the electric vehicles
which we thought need to come

41
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.740 
in future in 2008,

42
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.160 
to use these
huge batteries

43
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.910 
at a large distributed storage
for renewable energies. So,

44
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.030 
make it possible that
each and every car

45
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.410 
during the twenty two hours it's
not driving but it's parking,

46
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.920 
is intelligently connected to
the power grid and can serve

47
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.590 
as a storage for renewable energies.
And well this is when we started and

48
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.030 
we probably did not think
that it would take so long

49
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.190 
because we thought it's a good
idea, let's prove that it is

50
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.510 
right and then we will see what
we do. But it took actually

51
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.150 
twelve years and yeah we actually we
just sold now the company a couple of

52
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.700 
weeks ago to a small
company called Shell

53
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.140 
to make it possible for Shell actually,
that they have an instrument

54
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.870 
on their road map to become
carbon neutral. And this was

55
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.950 
great enough, always the plan for the
company to really make an impact

56
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.460 
on the way to reducing the CO2
footprint of mankind and

57
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.060 
to hopefully do something against
climate change and, well yeah, since

58
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.490 
two thousand and twenty in
September, then I took over

59
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.390 
School of Entrepreneurship because I
thought it's so important to do something

60
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.480 
for young entrepreneurs and to
promote entrepreneurship as

61
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.870 
a really really important tool. Right.
What a journey, I mean, you know,

62
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.180 
in two thousand and eight you
were the visionaries, right? You

63
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.410 
were the ones actually say okay
this is what we should do and

64
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.620 
as you just said it took so long.
Gosh! But I guess that's also

65
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.990 
part of the entrepreneurial
journey. So you already said, so

66
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.270 
you joined HPI and
the two of us have

67
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.770 
had a couple of discussions
about, you know, how to actually

68
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.150 
build a hub here for digital
entrepreneurship. So

69
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.340 
what is digital entrepreneurship
for you? How do you define

70
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.450 
it or what does
it mean for you?

71
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.800 
It's a very
good question.

72
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:43.150 
Well, to start with, I made it my life.
Yes, since September

73
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.930 
it is really the focus of what I'm
doing every day. And maybe to start

74
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.490 
with entrepreneurship first and then
at the digital as a second part.

75
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.660 
I think really
entrepreneurship

76
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.130 
unlocks an incredible amount of
opportunities to make an impact.

77
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.210 
Not necessarily as I just told
you with regard to Ubitricity

78
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.570 
just only for our planet but also for
our society and for our economy

79
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.960 
and I really understand
entrepreneurship as a really really

80
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.920 
important tool for our society
and I think it's heavily

81
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.850 
underrated in
the view the society

82
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.100 
is looking at entrepreneurship
and I for myself

83
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.630 
came to the conclusion that it
is a really rewarding choice

84
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.420 
that someone can make and a really enriching
opportunity personally and no matter

85
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.020 
where it takes
you to and

86
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.670 
this is actually what entrepreneurship
means to me. It's

87
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.880 
an incredible tool and it's
the basis for inventions, for

88
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.840 
new jobs, for the society's wealth
and peace to a certain degree.

89
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.720 
Well thank you. So what about
that digital piece of it?

90
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.740 
Digital to me and I always have
to be a little bit careful

91
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.840 
because digital is so big at the
Hasso Plattner Institute obviously,

92
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:24.740 
digital to me is a particular way to
execute entrepreneurship. It's a tool

93
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.870 
and entrepreneurship itself is a
tool and digital is a second

94
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:35.250 
tool that makes it even stronger
because it can make it quicker and

95
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.630 
broader and thereby
more powerful.

96
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.370 
If you remember, I mean
everyone selling -

97
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.750 
I don't know - newspapers is an
entrepreneur, everyone selling

98
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:52.530 
meat, grocery whatever is an entrepreneur.
But the power that digital gifts

99
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.410 
to every one of us actually makes
it so easy to go to market

100
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.810 
and to become broad and to think broad
because it's basically very quick,

101
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.160 
scalable and without limits and
this is, I have to admit, what

102
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.040 
makes it really
fascinating to me

103
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:16.870 
to think in digital entrepreneurship and
not only in entrepreneurship. Right, yeah,

104
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.820 
and I agree. I mean you
just said it makes it

105
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.190 
so easy or it makes it a lot easier.
Now the question would

106
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:32.640 
be, is it therefore also easier to
become an entrepreneur and do you see

107
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:38.350 
that the amount of people who
become an entrepreneur or call

108
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.800 
themselves an entrepreneur
has increased?

109
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.270 
That's a very good
question. I think

110
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:51.020 
the question why someone is becoming
an entrepreneur is not so much

111
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.410 
depending on the
digital tool.

112
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.970 
I think it's strongly depending
on the mindset someone has and

113
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.320 
how he is well raised and how
he grows up or she learns

114
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.110 
what entrepreneurship
can actually mean and

115
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:16.570 
I think it makes it much easier to
start, yeah. And to market yourself, to

116
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.820 
make people aware of what you are
doing and to reach more people. I

117
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.160 
personally do not have
the feeling that

118
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.210 
so many more persons are actually
founding a company just because

119
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.140 
they can go digital and things are
so easy and that is probably

120
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.680 
not the reason
alone. But

121
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.270 
if more people knew what
digitalisation could do

122
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.560 
for them, it might be just
the other way around

123
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.180 
that they would say, okay, if this
is so easy then I would even

124
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.850 
reconsider my decision not
to found a company and

125
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.820 
still to become
an entrepreneur.

126
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:59.310 
Yeah, I agree. So what is this entrepreneur
mindset you just mentioned? I mean,

127
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:07.510 
how is it constituted? Is it really
only shaped by the way we are raised

128
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:14.240 
or we are trained in schools? I
mean, how how would you describe?

129
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.180 
Obviously you have an entrepreneurial
mindset. I mean, you say, yeah,

130
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.540 
I became a lawyer first but
something and you related it back

131
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.690 
to your childhood
where you had the opportunity

132
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.540 
to go to Silicon
Valley but

133
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.890 
obviously that's
probably not all, right?

134
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.830 
No, it's not. And it's really hard to
describe mixture out of personality

135
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.610 
and circumstances and the
willingness to bring both together

136
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.020 
in the end.

137
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.090 
I think entrepreneurial
mindset has a lot to do with

138
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.770 
curiosity. If you're a curious
person, this is a very good

139
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.610 
basis because if you're becoming
an entrepreneur, you're

140
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:06.470 
instantly responsible, three hundred and sixty
degree, for practically everything and

141
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:12.720 
the more curious you are in how the
world is ticking, how things are working,

142
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.040 
the easier that is to to deal
with a lot of different topics.

143
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.660 
That was always what
fascinated me personally most

144
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:28.550 
in that decision to be responsible
for so many different things and

145
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.140 
to deal with so many
different things.

146
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:38.040 
I think the second thing is that
you need to understand opportunities.

147
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:43.440 
You need to see when something
happens that you can actually

148
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.240 
use and make something out of it. Even
a crisis can be a great opportunity

149
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.180 
and if you have someone who
actually sees okay this

150
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:59.300 
is an opportunity, I met someone,
I stumbled across an idea, be

151
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.280 
it my own or the idea of someone
else. Not always you

152
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.840 
need to come up with the perfect
idea yourself. Opportunity

153
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.340 
is great but it's nothing
without execution. So you

154
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.570 
you need to be there for the
first time to execute it and

155
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.960 
it needs to feel normal yeah. If
it takes a lot of

156
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.690 
courage for you to actually
dare to execute, then you

157
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.210 
maybe should reconsider whether
this is already the right time

158
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.730 
or the circumstances are right
or whether a co-founder would

159
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.430 
be a great idea yeah
but in the end

160
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.150 
being an entrepreneurs
is about execution. It's about

161
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:47.320 
bringing things to the roads, to
the market and to learn fast,

162
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.720 
fail fast, learn from
failure and again execute.

163
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.830 
Talking about digital entrepreneurship,
yeah I really think

164
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:04.440 
this is the huge difference compared to many
many many other forms of entrepreneurship.

165
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.240 
You can start very easy and very
quickly, you can learn what

166
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.920 
works and what
does not work

167
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.530 
and you can learn not only
with a very small group but

168
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:21.070 
comparatively quickly with a very
large group of people. Okay.

169
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:29.810 
So, if I now take what you just said,
so it needs curiosity. It needs

170
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:34.450 
responsibility for yourself
and the others. It needs

171
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:41.790 
the skill to recognize opportunities
and then to execute and

172
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:46.430 
really bring it forward. Now I
would expect that many of our

173
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.890 
listeners and probably
also many other people

174
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:57.780 
in our society say whoa, that's
way above my pay grade. So what

175
00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.740 
would you say?

176
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:08.190 
I think this is the typical interpretation
or answer that you will hear

177
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.490 
in Germany or
even in Europe

178
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.560 
because people are just not very
familiar with the thought

179
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.910 
of becoming an entrepreneur and
I think the reason for this is

180
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:26.840 
that our environment is not really
evaluating this opportunity a lot.

181
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:33.730 
As I said coming from some summers in
Silicon Valley, it felt totally normal

182
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.890 
that at a point in my life
when an idea came across

183
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.940 
that I really really felt that I
would like to try out this idea,

184
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.750 
and this is not only because I
was thinking my whole life that

185
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.710 
I need to become an
entrepreneur but because I

186
00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:01.130 
personally experienced in Silicon
Valley that it might be the

187
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:06.220 
right idea, that it might work, but
that in any case I will learn a lot.

188
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.390 
And so the biggest problem from
my perspective and this is

189
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.330 
actually why I take the
decision to come to Hasso

190
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.390 
Plattner Institute is
to bring down barrier

191
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.400 
in the heads of people.

192
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.100 
I am always asked whether

193
00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:35.130 
this entrepreneurship is a great
opportunity, an option for a career.

194
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:41.980 
And to me entrepreneurship never
felt like something either-or,

195
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.860 
like an opportunity

196
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.320 
that I have to take and then
can't follow anything else.

197
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:56.100 
I think it needs to feel very
natural without barriers and

198
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.960 
you need to grow in that
and everything we do at

199
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.840 
e-School is basically now to
start making entrepreneurship

200
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.080 
as easy as possible to
experience and to

201
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.790 
just look at it and to meet people
who, well, study at a place,

202
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:21.880 
where others are already working in a
startup or have founded their own start-up

203
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:28.260 
and to bring down these barriers in
the head. Yeah, and it takes time

204
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:33.060 
to build that trust but you can
do it and the I think the really

205
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.680 
important thing is it takes trust
to do it together with another

206
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.610 
person. Yeah well yes there are some
characters who do it alone but typically

207
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.370 
people are not founding
the company alone and

208
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.290 
you're not founding the company
with someone that you just

209
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:54.220 
know for a day or some hours
even. It takes trust to do

210
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.990 
that together with someone but
it can be highly motivating

211
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.840 
to do it with someone as well. So
building an ecosystem where

212
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:07.850 
all comes together and it feels
natural to become an entrepreneur is

213
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.730 
what I hope we can achieve
here at e-Shool.

214
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.810 
Yeah this is great. I mean, I
completely sign that, so count

215
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:22.150 
me in on that. And I actually have
as my second last question

216
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.370 
on your future perspective on this
topic and kind of your hopes

217
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.670 
and wishes for the future.
So I think you already

218
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.910 
covered that but maybe there's
something else you'd like to

219
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:35.920 
add because it was

220
00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.390 
a little bit focused on our
ecosystem here. So if you think

221
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.270 
because you touched up on the
German and the European mindset,

222
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.030 
how can we change that or what
would be your hope for the future

223
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:55.300 
for an entrepreneurial Europe
maybe or a world? I don't know.

224
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.360 
First of all, let me say, I
think we have to change it

225
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.690 
because I think we are
playing here with a

226
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.240 
very high risk that what
we are used to in Europe

227
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.030 
a certain level of
wealth and peace

228
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.390 
needs a working society somewhere
between the United States

229
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:21.330 
and China in future and I think we really
have to rethink entrepreneurship and

230
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.090 
re-promote
entrepreneurship and

231
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:30.510 
so what we have to do is to bring
down these barriers in the

232
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:36.290 
heads and to make it natural. It's
not the "I can't do my job

233
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.680 
any longer because I'm now
becoming an entrepreneur".

234
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.670 
You can do both, you can switch, you can
try out and it needs to feel natural

235
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.960 
to follow an idea. You follow your
heart basically and you have

236
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.760 
to trust that this idea could be
the right one and that it's

237
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.210 
really worth
to progress it.

238
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:03.750 
Excellent. Thank you so much, Frank. This
has been a very inspiring talk and yeah

239
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.270 
let's get that vision and
wish reality. Thank you.

240
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.910 
Thank you very much. It was
really a pleasure being here.

241
00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.620 
Thanks for having
me. Thanks.

1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.370 
I want to introduce HPI clean initiative
for sustainable technologies.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.670 
If you look around the awareness
that digital technologies which

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.510 
are changing our world

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.630 
also need a huge
amount of energy

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.220 
has led to initiatives
like the greenIT.

6
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.100 
So for example, the new
EU commission has

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.660 
designed an
European green deal.

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.170 
The united nations,
the

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.880 
big and small companies,

10
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.440 
many of them advocate
for green IT.

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.700 
So greenIT is a part of the EU
green new deal and internationally

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.640 
green IT labels were created,
for example the energy star.

13
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.160 
But we think greenIT is not enough, green
IT focuses on renewable energy resources

14
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.040 
for IT infrastructures. The digital
sobriety, the sustainable

15
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.490 
production of digital technologies
as well as the hardware,

16
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.950 
as well as the use of
computing centres and others.

17
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.250 
But what is missing? In our eyes are
missing the contributions of the

18
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.300 
designers and the promoters of
the IT technologies itself.

19
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.670 
so we have to think as Architects, as
Programmers, as Researchers about

20
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.370 
digital technologies, we have to think more
carefully about algorithmic efficiency,

21
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.760 
about how we use AI, how we develop
artificial intelligence applications

22
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.710 
that are energy efficient. So what we
need is a sustainability by design

23
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.760 
in designing such
IT technologies.

24
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.760 
So the HPI clean IT initiative
will exactly focus on that.

25
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.730 
Everyone knows that digital
technologies are the driver

26
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.040 
of sustainable development
according to UN global compact

27
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.610 
and to the sustainable
development goals.

28
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.410 
But what we want to contribute
what needs to be contributed and

29
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.720 
these are the facets of the clean
IT initiative is raising

30
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.080 
awareness of digital carbon footprint.
Starting to do this in the education,

31
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.310 
in our study programs,

32
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.210 
with our researchers in designing a new
digital platform, a new digital application

33
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.450 
we have to think about algorithmic
efficiency, we have to

34
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.800 
establish the principle of
sustainability by design.

35
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.980 
So major challenges in digital engineering
for example are, the optimization

36
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.860 
of the energy efficiency of
algorithms, of programs, of implementations,

37
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.500 
of computing systems.
So algorithms

38
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.150 
solving the same problem can
drastically vary in their energy efficiency.

39
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.760 
So programs that implement the same algorithms
can vary in their energy efficiency,

40
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.730 
and there is a tradeoff between the
accuracy, the speed, the memory size,

41
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.290 
the energy efficiency. One has to think
about and has to find a good balance.

42
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.210 
The sustainability by design could
be a goal like we have the

43
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.110 
principle of
security by design.

44
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.210 
So incentivising research
to take the trade-off

45
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.990 
between energy consumption and performance
into account by algorithmic efficiency.

46
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.480 
To focus on developing energy efficient
computer systems from the start,

47
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.410 
this is the paradigm of
sustainability by design.

48
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.980 
To establish international standards on
developing sustainable computer system

49
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.760 
and implementations
of such IT

50
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.910 
systems and products.

51
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.140 
Let's have a look to some examples,
some examples of our research

52
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.950 
work here in the Hasso Plattner Institute. Let's
start with some heuristic algorithms.

53
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.590 
Algorithms that aim to solve complex problems
with hundred percent precision

54
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.380 
may run into
run-time excesses.

55
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.070 
This is a knowledge

56
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.620 
every student is already
becoming aware of.

57
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.840 
So a new class of algorithms that
takes a trade-off between precision

58
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.770 
and run-time into account are
investigated for a while.

59
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.860 
But we propose also to take into
account the energy efficiency in this

60
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.710 
trade-off investigations.
Heuristic algorithm produces results

61
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.840 
with less precision, but gaining
reductions of run-time and

62
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.510 
this means in the consequence
of energy consumptions

63
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.170 
often by orders of magnitudes. So
an example from our HPI

64
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.410 
engineering
research group,

65
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.090 
was that they designed a class of heuristic algorithms

66
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.420 
that are fit to solve
submodular functions

67
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.130 
300 times faster and
in this way reducing energy consumption

68
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.630 
to a 0.35%

69
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.270 
Another example is
binary neural networks.

70
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.310 
The state of the art deep neural
networks are trained and operated

71
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.000 
on 32-bit models.

72
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.270 
And we already show that there
is a huge amount that's needed

73
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.180 
to train such architectures.

74
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.230 
So the training of deep neural
networks on a binary level,

75
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.210 
not on the 32-bit models, but
on the binary level

76
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.620 
could provide huge energy savings. So
here's an example of my research group

77
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.120 
about internet
technologies and systems.

78
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.210 
We showed that training a deep
neural network on a binary level

79
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.550 
saves 64 times of computing
operation and therefore about 95%

80
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.690 
of energy
by sacrificing currently only

81
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.280 
5 percent precision and we
work hard to improve this.

82
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.490 
Here is another example. An example
of energy-aware computing.

83
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.810 
The current data centers mostly use
homogeneous hardware for computing tasks.

84
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.710 
Not every computing task is performed
optimally by each hardware

85
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.460 
component, there are hardware
components that are fit very well to

86
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.590 
perform this type of
computation.

87
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.810 
There are other devices or components
that are much better suited to

88
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.830 
compute problems. So with
the Next-Gen data centers,

89
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.880 
we propose and and work,
and do research on this

90
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.530 
that such Next-Gen data centres host
heterogeneous hardware architectures.

91
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.080 
Chips, GPU's and others.

92
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.590 
So energy aware computing software
routes specific tasks to the optimal

93
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:44.500 
chip. That's needed so that automatically it
is recognized what component

94
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.160 
fits best for that
type of computation.

95
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.670 
Here is an example of our HPI operating
and middleware research group

96
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.470 
which shows that
weather model

97
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.760 
simulation can be carried out with
10 times less energy by using

98
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.420 
FPGA accelerators instead of
general purpose processors.

99
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.450 
Next example, a clean
data profiling

100
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.410 
is that data
engineering

101
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.980 
becomes more and
more important

102
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:27.360 
in the analytics of big data. So the
major task in the data engineering

103
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.130 
is to prepare large heterogenous
databases

104
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.450 
in a meaningful way by structuring,
normalizing and cleaning data.

105
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:43.400 
An important aspect of data profiling is the
discovery of unique column combinations,

106
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:51.160 
and the current approach can only find unique
column combinations on mid-sized databases

107
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.370 
with quite some
run-time fault.

108
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:02.450 
Here our HPI research group about information
systems, they developed the

109
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:10.220 
HPI valid algorithms which reduce the run-time
of such an unique column combinations

110
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.010 
discovery process by 5-100
times on mid-sized databases

111
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.890 
and saving in this way 20-99
percent of energy

112
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.710 
and makes it possible to apply this
approach also for large databases.

113
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.520 
But these examples are only the
beginning, so with our clean IT

114
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:39.730 
initiative, we will initiate more
thinking, more research, more

115
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:45.710 
activity in that area. So for example in
the Next-Gen data storage algorithms

116
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.060 
in data centers and cloud,
there is a lot of more

117
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:56.460 
possibilities to improve the
energy balance. Or if you think

118
00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.220 
of Next-Gen streaming algorithms,
streaming that becomes more and more

119
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.170 
attractive and popular

120
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.620 
causes more and
more traffic,

121
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.620 
costs on the internet,

122
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.270 
we have to think about new types
of such streaming algorithms

123
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:23.540 
which are much more energy saving. Same
is true for Blockchain technology.

124
00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.990 
So Blockchain cryptography provides
a lot of

125
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.760 
good new initiatives for organizing
not only financial interactions

126
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.330 
but also in many other
applications it would be great

127
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.570 
to have such blockchain components

128
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:50.930 
in use. But today blockchain technology
needs a huge amount of energy

129
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:58.010 
to form blocks and how it's organized
to form such blocks,

130
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.520 
it needs exhausting
energy resources.

131
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.120 
And there are much more
fields which provide

132
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.820 
the possibility to
think more carefully

133
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:15.260 
about energy saving
procedures and systems,

134
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:21.830 
particularly when we think about
new area the increasing area of

135
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.930 
the internet of things and the
ecosystem that's provided by it.

136
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:32.340 
Of course as a small scientific
institute in digital engineering

137
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.830 
we need partners, we need
partners in different spheres,

138
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:46.060 
for example, in the designing of huge
IT systems a company like SAP

139
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:52.920 
is willing to cooperate with
us and to push this initiative forward.

140
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.810 
We have an international partners,
universities, specially

141
00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:02.810 
University of Beijing of technology
and others to cooperate with us in

142
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.390 
developing new ideas and systems
and architectures. An idea

143
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:16.540 
for clean IT associations
like IEEE or the eco

144
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.880 
in Germany contribute to
the national academy

145
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.180 
of technology

146
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.190 
is with us and will
contribute. So

147
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.050 
if you would like to contribute, you
are invited here in our clean IT

148
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.920 
forum to introduce
your ideas.

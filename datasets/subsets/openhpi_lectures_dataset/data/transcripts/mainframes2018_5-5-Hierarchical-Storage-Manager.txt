00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.907 
Hello, folks, it's me again, Wolfram Greis

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.539 
from the European Union Academy, and in the next video clip, I

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.589 
want to tell you something about the hierarchical storage manager.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.912 
That's one of the components of the

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.639 
automatic storage management, the system managed storage,

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.829 
or what it's called in between storage management subsystem.

7
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.247 
So I'll leave you of the storage heirarchy, and

8
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.117 
the idea of the hierarchical storage manager is

9
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.466 
that's a movement between these levels within the storage hierarchy

10
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.579 
is done automatically, especially when it comes to the movement

11
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.467 
to DASD volumes or to tapes.

12
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.749 
The hierarchical stirage manager, HSM has two main functions.

13
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.799 
One is space management and the other is availability management.

14
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.389 
Let's start with the left side of this

15
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.699 
picture with the space management.

16
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.459 
When I think about the early days of

17
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.599 
mainframe computing, there was no space management, no automatic space management.

18
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.009 
So if the DASD volume was full, we had to do something about it.

19
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.959 
And the problem was on these

20
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.089 
DASD volumes we had data sets that we didn't use for

21
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.789 
weeks, something months.

22
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.139 
And it's no exaggeration, something for years.

23
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.459 
We had data sets on volumes that wasn't used for years.

24
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.139 
And the problem then was if we

25
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.449 
ran out of space, we had to move some data from

26
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.949 
DASD volumes to tapes, and that was done by

27
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.839 
hand and we had to copy them from DASD to tape

28
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.759 
and the tape was in the tape archive

29
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.519 
of the computer center, or some times we took the tapes

30
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.379 
out of the computer center and put them into the DASD

31
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.380 
in our office.

32
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
And if you need it, maybe we need to see the data again some

33
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.429 
times later. Then we had to again copy the data

34
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.049 
from tape to DASD, and then we could work again on these

35
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.910 
datasets, on the DASD.

36
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.029 
And with the hierarchical storage manager this management

37
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.839 
and movements on data is done automatically.

38
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.356 
And this is a really, really great relief compared

39
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.919 
to the early days of computing.

40
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.709 
Now, when we talk about the hierarchical storage manager, we have so-called primary

41
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.239 
volumes. We had these primary volumes also in the past, but

42
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.969 
they weren't called primary volumes.

43
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.609 
So it was just the volumes we used to work on and to

44
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.679 
distinguish them from other volumes they're called now primary volumes

45
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.629 
and the volumes that are managed by the heirarchical storage manager

46
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.619 
are called migration volumes.

47
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.239 
And the idea now is if certain

48
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.889 
datasets are not used for a certain time, let's say for some

49
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.769 
weeks or months, they are automatically

50
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.869 
migrated. Migration is a new term

51
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.369 
for moving data from primary volumes to migration

52
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.929 
volumes. And as you'll see on the picture, there's a term that's

53
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.207 
called compact, it means that data is compacted,

54
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.259 
think about compacted data similar to archives we use

55
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.208 
today. When we use zip files on the PC, we compact the data.

56
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.739 
It means that afterwards the data needs

57
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.689 
less space than before means the data with automatic

58
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.459 
space management is migrated from binary volumes to migration

59
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.229 
level one and level one meant that these data

60
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.189 
will hold on volumes but compacted.

61
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.659 
And in many cases, these volumes were slower, but with

62
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.329 
a with a bigger capacity.

63
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.979 
And if some data and these datasets are not accessed

64
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.779 
for even longer time, they are again

65
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.999 
migrated to a Level two.

66
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.769 
And level two In this case, meant to tape

67
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.959 
and tape in today's environments

68
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.479 
are no longer the big reels.

69
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.899 
Tape means in between cartridges and

70
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.179 
they are managed by tape robotics.

71
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.609 
And the idea again, is to do this all automatically

72
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.069 
means automatically migrate and move data

73
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.249 
from binary volumes to migration volumes.

74
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.779 
And if you need it again, you just access it,

75
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.958 
and the access means as example with TS or ISPF you

76
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.138 
access data that are migrated.

77
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.869 
And if they hold on migration level one

78
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.609 
on DASD, they are very fast getting back to primary volumes.

79
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.139 
If they are manage to or migrated to level

80
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.529 
two volumes, it takes a little longer.

81
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.059 
But as these are managed by

82
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.029 
robotics, it also is very fast.

83
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.829 
Very fast means maybe it takes one, two or three minutes

84
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.809 
no longer normally today and they are accessed.

85
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.909 
So you are automatically and the emphasis is on automatically,

86
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.529 
automatically record and put back on primary volumes and

87
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.189 
we can work on these datasets.

88
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.749 
Though the idea and the main important issue when

89
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.669 
we talk about space management is that it's all done automatically,

90
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.859 
means automatically migrated and we don't have to put them

91
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.259 
back before we use it.

92
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.789 
We just have to have to access it and

93
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.259 
when we access it so you are automatically record and

94
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.759 
the access means we can access it by TS or ISPF, or we

95
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.449 
can also access it by benchtops.

96
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.829 
And so the only difference between not migrated

97
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.379 
datasets is that the process takes a little longer.

98
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.539 
Now let's have a look on the other side of this picture,

99
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.579 
Availability Management.

100
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.229 
And again, when I look back to to the early days

101
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.969 
of computing, you know, each and every night means as example after

102
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.739 
10 o'clock in the evening, full volume dumps were taken from

103
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.419 
each and every disk in the computer center to have a copy

104
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.749 
of this disk on tape.

105
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.519 
So this is a big issue today because today we don't

106
00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.289 
talk about megabytes or gigabytes of data.

107
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.089 
We really talk about petabytes of data, and you can't

108
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.129 
do full volume dumps of petabytes each night because

109
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:15.769 
the time is not long enough to copy the

110
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.879 
data from DASD to tape.

111
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.409 
So with availability management, normally today we do a so-called

112
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.873 
incremental backup. Incremental backup means that, only

113
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.349 
the dataset was changed during the day shift is backed

114
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.908 
up and the data set wasn't changed during the last

115
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:46.159 
day don't need to be backed up because you have already

116
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.460 
a backup copy on the tape.

117
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.459 
And again, this process

118
00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.529 
is automatically done each and every night, and

119
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.859 
today you don't have to stop your applications.

120
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.520 
These back ups can be don during work

121
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.279 
with the datasets.

122
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.823 
And again, similar to space

123
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.249 
management part, the data is compacted.

124
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.899 
It means it needs less space on the back

125
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.609 
up volume, back up volumes can be DASD or back

126
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.529 
up volumes can be tape and in between in many cases,

127
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.969 
we use so-called virtual tape systems for these backups.

128
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.739 
Virtual tape systems means that you

129
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.951 
think you put the data to a tape,

130
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.309 
but if it's really on tape is managed by the virtual

131
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.779 
tape system. And this is done again

132
00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:02.149 
automatically and the users

133
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.859 
can count on that data is picked up each and every

134
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.299 
day. So if you, as example, accidentally destroy

135
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.012 
some data, you can get back with

136
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.475 
the restore process can back the data to binary

137
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.758 
volumes and you have recovered your data.

138
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:34.850 
And doing the recovery, also of course, the compaction is made.

139
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.999 
So there are a lot of space management functions that are really important today,

140
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.859 
as example automatic deletion of temporary data, automatic deletion

141
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.119 
of expired data, automatic free disk space means

142
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.840 
you can decide that if a disk space reaches a certain

143
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.349 
capacity, automatically migration starts

144
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:08.119 
and data is migrated from disk to tape to free some

145
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.339 
space on the disk.

146
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.929 
Automatic migration, I already talked about when I talked

147
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.849 
about the space management component of

148
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:25.219 
the hierarchical storage manager means that data is automatically migrated

149
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.840 
if it was not accessed a certain time.

150
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.629 
And automatic record of data is

151
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.459 
done, and space saving functions means compression, extent management

152
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.118 
and so on are also done.

153
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.749 
Availability functions means, copying data, back up of data

154
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.639 
is incremental, means only data is backed up that wasn't

155
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.149 
already backed up before that was changed in between.

156
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.759 
The restart of data on a dataset level is of course possible

157
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.989 
and reorganization is done with

158
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.210 
availability functions.

159
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.749 
OK, this was the video clip concerning hierarchical

160
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.750 
storage manager.

161
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.839 
And if you have any remarks or questions, use the

162
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.349 
discussion forum on the openHPI platform.

163
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.740 
Hope you enjoyed this video clip and

164
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.629 
maybe we see us in one of the next video clips.

165
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.819 
Thank you very much for attending.

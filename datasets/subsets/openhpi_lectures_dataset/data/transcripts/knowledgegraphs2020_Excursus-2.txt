00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.480 
This is knowledge graphs lecture three
querying rdfs which SPARQL.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.930 
Now I'm going to give you an excursion
into dbpedia knowledge graph.

3
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.540 
So here what you are seeing is
the whole linked open data cloud

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.970 
and then you can actually see that
dbpedia is the central hub of

5
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.810 
this whole web of data.

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.250 
So dbpedia was actually created
in two thousand and seven,

7
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.330 
here you can see the timeline of the
of the evolution of this dataset.

8
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.420 
So it was created in two thousand
seven and then at some point

9
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.310 
in time the dbpedia ontology was
introduced and so on and so forth.

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.710 
Similarly you have other datasets
other knowledge bases which

11
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.340 
were created from wikipedia, so we
had OpenCyc freebase, yago

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.440 
and so on and then finally we had
wikidata which was created

13
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.030 
in two thousand twelve and over
the course of time it also

14
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.390 
included some part of dbpedia
and now it also includes some

15
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.160 
part of other knowledge
bases such as europeana, linked

16
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.400 
open data and so on.

17
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.720 
So the statistics of dbpedia here
that you see are actually the

18
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.610 
were actually extracted in january
twenty twenty and it describes

19
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.870 
almost six million things and out
of which five million, almost

20
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.270 
five million things are
classified into an ontology.

21
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
It also includes several other information,
several more precise information

22
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.810 
which includes a one point five
million persons, species,

23
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.800 
places, creative works
and so on and so forth.

24
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.290 
If you want to have a look at
the data set of the wikipedia

25
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.860 
you can click on the link
on the right hand side.

26
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.970 
So here you see the infobox of
the wikipedia page of carbon dioxide.

27
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.970 
So from this info box the information
about the entity carbon

28
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.400 
dioxide is extracted and
represented in dbpedia.

29
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.970 
And here is the human readable form of
the dbpedia about carbon dioxide.

30
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.030 
So here you see that the link to
the wikipedia page in english

31
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.430 
of carbon dioxide and in dbpedia
it is represented in three ways.

32
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.980 
So first one is entity identifier
where you see dpdedia dot org

33
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.120 
and then there is a word resource,
and then we have carbon dioxide.

34
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.830 
And the second one is the
html version which is distinguished

35
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.320 
from the previous one by the word
page instead of the resource.

36
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.500 
Then we have the rdf xml version
with the word data instead

37
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.280 
of page or a resource. This way
there are different ways the

38
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.410 
data is represented
in dbpedia.

39
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.110 
So wikipedia actually contains
several already defines the

40
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.610 
types of the info boxes, for example
carbon dioxide is a gas,

41
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.890 
then we have persons, we have
places, we have creative works

42
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.700 
and then we have some events. So
this way wikipedia already

43
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.210 
gives an information about the
type of the information which is

44
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.030 
which is given there on a certain
page. So here for example

45
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.770 
from the info box it can be seen
that carbon dioxide, carbon

46
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.590 
dioxide is a chemical compound. And then
there we have a shallow ontology

47
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.880 
that is where which connects
chemical compound to chemical

48
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.370 
substance with the
relation rdfs subclassof, sorry

49
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.440 
the property rdf subclassof.
And then we everything is

50
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.610 
actually connected to owl:
Thing, so chemical substance

51
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.650 
is the subclass
of thing. And then

52
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.480 
on the wikipedia page, on the
bottom of each page you may have

53
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.280 
seen that it describes the
wikipedia categories, so here

54
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.380 
these wikipedia categories are also
described are also described

55
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.310 
in the dbpedia. So we have carbon dioxide
dct subject greenhouse gases,

56
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.060 
so dct subject is from
entity to the category relation.

57
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.600 
And then greenhouse gases are
connected to their broader classes

58
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.080 
such as greenhouse gases to
global warming with the help of

59
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.670 
the skos vocabulary skos
broader which

60
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.240 
is close to sub-class with the
semantics of skos broader

61
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
are close to subclassof but it
is a little bit more broad.

62
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.730 
So global warming is then further
connected to skos

63
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.110 
with the relation with the
property skos broader to

64
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.710 
climate change and then climate
change is connected to global

65
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.180 
environmental issues.

66
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.550 
So the dbpedia info box it is
used for extracting the

67
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:19.160 
triples for the dbpedia. So here we have the
entity that is an inconvenient truth

68
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.980 
and the relation is taken from, taken
from this info box like directed by,

69
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.940 
and then the object of the
triple is taken as the value

70
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
of that property that
is Davis Guggenheim.

71
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.740 
So in the next lecture you
will see more details on the

72
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.140 
other data set that is wiki
with data knowledge graph.

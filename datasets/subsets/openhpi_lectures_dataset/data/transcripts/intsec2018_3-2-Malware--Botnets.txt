1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.210 
Speaking of malware, now we
consider botnets in more detail.

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.940 
Botnets are a huge number of
remotely controlled computers.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.610 
These computers are called
bots. And typically

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.740 
these computers become
the bot, characteristic

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.140 
by an infection with malware,
by an infection without the

6
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.160 
knowledge of the owner
of the computer.

7
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.030 
The bots, hundred thousand
of bots are on the

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.170 
one side and there is one
special part in the botnets

9
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.800 
that is the command
and control server.

10
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.650 
This is central. This is
controlled by the attacker.

11
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.400 
and this by means of this
command and control server.

12
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.120 
The attacker is able to remotely
manage, to remotely coordinate,

13
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.270 
to remotely control all
the huge number of bots.

14
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.920 
The command and control
server takes the control

15
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.670 
remotely over the bots and
then he sends operating

16
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.580 
instruction which
then are performed

17
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.990 
independently on the many
bots of the botnets

18
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.390 
so this operation instruction
could for example be a

19
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.620 
command to start a
connection to a

20
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.630 
service, to an online service and
if many many bots belonging

21
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.050 
to the botnets and doing exactly
the same moment, such kind

22
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
of request. Then typically
the service is no abler

23
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.850 
to correct right away.
Exactly this is the idea

24
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.000 
of the attack the combination
of so many bots,

25
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.770 
so that a large number of attacks
with high computational

26
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.230 
power can be performed, can
be performed simply by

27
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.670 
by the same moment

28
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.510 
controlling and lettings
the bots work. Here is an

29
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.050 
illustration of what's going
on we have the attacker

30
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.170 
with his station we have the
command and control server

31
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.540 
and we have the
many clients

32
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.040 
whos systems are
infiltrated with malware

33
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.770 
that they became bots of such
botnets. So the first step to

34
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.470 
establish such a bot net
is to infiltrate malware

35
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.780 
to many many computers that
are connected to the

36
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.500 
internet. Often these are connected
not professionally configured.

37
00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.120 
Many of the clients are
schools or universities

38
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.150 
a computer. So this
infiltration with a malware

39
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.190 
makes this client systems
to become bots.

40
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.210 
This the first step. Then
the second step is

41
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.480 
that the command and control
server establish connection

42
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
to the bots established a
connection to the bot.

43
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.960 
And then in the third step
the attacker is able

44
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.370 
by over the command
and control server

45
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.430 
to send commands to all the
bots which later on can be

46
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.430 
performed for example, for an
attack. An attacker infects

47
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.440 
many clients with malware. Typically
it's performed by trojans

48
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.220 
which are used to
conceal real function.

49
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.270 
Worms are used to
infiltrate the

50
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.570 
systems with malware. Worms
allow fast automatic spreading

51
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.270 
as well and web browsers
vulnerabilities are also

52
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.320 
misused to serve as an entry
gate. So here you see

53
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.180 
is there the malware
combines different

54
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.040 
characteristic with
the idea to read, to

55
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.820 
establish such a
botnet. The malware,

56
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.990 
the idea of the malware is to
allow the communication with a

57
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.960 
command and control
server, with the central

58
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.110 
server, that's used by the attacker
to control all these bots.

59
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.220 
The clients that have become
bots, can then receive and

60
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.860 
execute the command of remotes,
the command, and control server.

61
00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.680 
They do what the attacker wants
them to do. An attacker can send

62
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.100 
his commands to the bots, via
the control and command

63
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.640 
and control server.
Then the bots work

64
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.750 
independently, so the bots execute
the commands they received from

65
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.980 
the c&amp;c server independently.
If we look to some attacks

66
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.020 
scenarios that are
performed by botnets,

67
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.350 
then we can see that
cybercriminals

68
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.520 
use such botnets. For
example, to perform

69
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.760 
distributed denial of service
attacks, distributed denial of

70
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.810 
service attack, the idea
of attack is simply

71
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.440 
to misuse, to overload a service
by sending, by sending

72
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.150 
commands, for example,
and to get connected,

73
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.440 
or to get access to the service. The
cybercriminals use the botnets

74
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.940 
for sending spam emails. The
idea and misuse of the botnets

75
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.470 
by the attacker and
the c&amp;c server,

76
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.370 
is that the attack sender
address is hidden.

77
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.130 
Because what the people see
is the address of the bot,

78
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.660 
the bot who send, for example,
the email, or the bot who

79
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.080 
sends the request to
the service. Another

80
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.250 
application of botnets is
to perform click frawd

81
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.300 
which is used in
advertisement industry

82
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.390 
to a measure the efficiency
and success rate

83
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.350 
of some web pages. The
cybercriminals can use botnets

84
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.930 
to read bots sensitive data, for
example, to spy out passwords

85
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.960 
or bank accounts or
other personal data.

86
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:56.210 
The botnets can be misused to
provide illegal information

87
00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.430 
and resources, for example,
to take a storage medium or

88
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.720 
perform an attack on
the service provider.

89
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.420 
Cryptocurrency (Bitcoins) can
be calculated can be created.

90
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.160 
For example, bitcoin mining
is something typically that

91
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.040 
can be done by botnets, can
be done by attackers via

92
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.060 
the c&amp;c server, and can
be formed on botnets.

93
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.720 
Because for the bitcoin mining,
a huge amount of performance

94
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.240 
is needed. Ransomware
can be used

95
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.410 
for example, to blackmail by
encrypting personal data and

96
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.660 
demand money to provides
is a decryption key,

97
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.280 
and many more attacks can be done.
Here are some famous examples

98
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.150 
of such botnets. First of all,
I want to mention Zeus,

99
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.390 
and this shows
is estimated

100
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.230 
botnet. Zeus is
estimated two consist

101
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:05.130 
of three million six hundred bots,
and these botnets was discovered

102
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.460 
in 2007.

103
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:19.360 
Conficker is another botnet. With estimated
nine million bots, it was discovered in

104
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.760 
2008. ZeroAccess
another botnet with

105
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.810 
nine million bots which
were discovered in 2011.

106
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.720 
Mirai which has one and
a half million bots

107
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.570 
was discovered in 2016.

108
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.570 
So you see these
botnets are really

109
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.130 
powerful, due to the
huge amount of bots

110
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.300 
which can be controlled
by an attacker

111
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.590 
over the attackers
command and control

112
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.890 
server. If we look at some
examples of botnet attacks.

113
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.210 
Let's start with an
attack to mine

114
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:08.000 
bitcoin. Thanks to the huge number
of bots, botnets are very

115
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.110 
well suited to accomplish tasks
which require extremely

116
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.720 
high but easily distributable
computing power.

117
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:22.160 
And if one looks to bitcoin mining,
this is exactly such a task.

118
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.530 
It needs a huge amount
of computational power

119
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.610 
and the tasks that need to be done
can easily parallelized and

120
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.350 
distributed performed. Bitcoin
mining consumes a lot of computing

121
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.220 
power, but can

122
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.820 
easily be distributed.
So it's good

123
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.210 
application case for such
botnets. A single PC

124
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.380 
is hardly able to do this,
but when an attacker

125
00:09:53.660 --> 00:10:00.580 
controls many PCs, many PCs
as bots, then this can be

126
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:06.750 
the crypto money the
bitcoin can be created

127
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:12.420 
quite easily. So the first prototype
was created in universities,

128
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.220 
where students or employees
used workstations

129
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.070 
to mine, so when the
bitcoin became

130
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:25.380 
popular. Students
try to mine such

131
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:30.750 
bitcoins, then
attackers

132
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.310 
took over and there was
discovered in December 2013

133
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:41.740 
that two German hackers which
had modified a trojan

134
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.830 
to mine, thus generate bitcoins
to the equivalent of

135
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:53.180 
almost one million us dollar
and both were caught and

136
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.590 
arrested. The Storm
botnet, this is another

137
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.310 
famous popular attack which
are performed by means of

138
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.830 
botnets. The storm botnets
were I already mentioned

139
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.070 
this first discovered
in 2007.

140
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.180 
And it was discovered because
of a high distribution

141
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:21.960 
of the so-called storm worms.
The storm worm was malware.

142
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:27.830 
This makes the pcs the clients
let them become bots

143
00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:33.300 
of the storm botnet. The distribution
came was organized via

144
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.560 
spam emails and then
subsequently in fact. It's

145
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:42.580 
infection of a window
system. It's not clear,

146
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.080 
how many pcs
are infected.

147
00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.430 
So the estimations run between
one and fifty million.

148
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:58.080 
The operators of the storm botnet
have so far remained undetected,

149
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:04.320 
so one does not know who
is doing this attacks,

150
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.450 
who is controlling the storm
botnet, so security experts

151
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.700 
and researchers underwent
massive attacks

152
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:18.170 
as soon as an investigation were
made. So if one tries to find

153
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.920 
out, then these people
became the victims

154
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:28.720 
of a very hard attacks. Anti virus
programs as countermeasures

155
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.480 
were switched off as remotely
this is one part of the attack

156
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.990 
so that the systems are
no more defended,

157
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.340 
and the user became
not aware of this.

158
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.370 
So the malware switched to
the antivirus program,

159
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.960 
but the users were believing that
the antivirus software works

160
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:59.720 
in a correct way. This
storm botnets are

161
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.200 
strong enough to disconnect
whole countries

162
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.670 
from the internet.
There was an example

163
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:15.930 
in the past. And, to a certain extent
and to a certain measurements,

164
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.220 
this storm botnet is
even more powerful

165
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:26.890 
then the famous supercomputers.
At the end of 2007,

166
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.710 
the operators of the storm botnet
began to split their organisation,

167
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.640 
possibly to sell parts of the
botnets. There is a huge

168
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.620 
black market for selling such
botnets, for taking orders

169
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.910 
for attacking for attacks
which are performed by means

170
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.850 
of that botnets. So the
storm that's in 2007

171
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.040 
began to split, so the data
traffic for communication with

172
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.900 
a botnet was encrypted
as an additional

173
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.020 
measure to hide what's going
on. The architecture

174
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.330 
is very complex with
very different

175
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.780 
components, so there are backdoor
or a downloader for malware

176
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.630 
where part of this
architecture is an SMTP,

177
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.800 
reply server to send emails
SMTP is an internet protocol

178
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.750 
for email the attack service
for stealing email addresses

179
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.760 
for example to perform to
perform spam attack.

180
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.200 
Attack software to speed
the malware via emails,

181
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.750 
for example, to
hide the malware

182
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.750 
in documents or in pictures that
are appended to the email.

183
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.250 
There are components which
are responsible to perform

184
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.830 
a distributed denial
of service attack.

185
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.270 
There are other components for
updated versions of malware

186
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.170 
installers. You
see it's a real

187
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:14.240 
fabric attack fabric which
comes with such a botnet.

188
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.300 
When we speak about botnets,
then the Stormfucker

189
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:26.130 
is something close to
the storm botnet.

190
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.590 
It was presented at
the chaos computer,

191
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.860 
chaos communication congress
in 2008 in Berlin.

192
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.360 
So that this Stormfucker
the stand-alone warm,

193
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.590 
that only infects systems which
are already infected with a

194
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:48.680 
storm worm. So it comes on
top to the storm worm

195
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.850 
and then this system
removes the storm malware

196
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.630 
via update mechanisms. But it's
not clear whether it depends

197
00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.510 
with conflicts in the
origin group to take over

198
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.340 
parts of the storm
botnet by others.

199
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.980 
The Stormfucker worm allows
to clean up to remove

200
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.460 
the parts of the storm botnets.
This is possible because of the

201
00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:23.890 
identification of the c&amp;c server
was inadequate. There was

202
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.210 
a mistake, so the
verification mechanisms

203
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.760 
could be cracked by
brute force attacks.

204
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.440 
and this enabled as them to send
a common, to send commands

205
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:43.250 
as a new c&amp;c server, so
in this way, it allows

206
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.910 
to take over the original
c&amp;c server. Then a prompt

207
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:56.890 
this storm fucker worm
prompt to update the storm

208
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:03.240 
application and replaced by
counterfeit applications.

209
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.890 
Then bots do no longer receives
the commands from the original

210
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.980 
command and conserver,
but now from the new

211
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.740 
control, command and
control server.

212
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.150 
This is the idea of the
Stormfucker you see

213
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:25.240 
the attackers fight
against each other.

214
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.720 
And also develop methods here
with the Stormfucker worm

215
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.220 
to take over the control over
parts of the storm botnet.

216
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.360 
I mentioned zeus botnet

217
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.290 
which was first
discovered in 2007.

218
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.340 
The targets here were
windows systems

219
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.930 
and it comes with a trojan that
contains additional software

220
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.450 
for spying our personal
data in the web browser.

221
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.850 
For example, logins for social
network or online banking

222
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:07.130 
and it's able to encrypt
sensitive data and subsequent

223
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.690 
extortion for paid
publication of the key.

224
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.690 
The captured data from
the Zeus botnet,

225
00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:24.650 
capture data from over
74,000 user accounts,

226
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.790 
from companies from different
companies like NSA

227
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.940 
bank of America, Oracle,
Amazon, Cisco.

228
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.150 
It is very difficult to detect
and it's very difficult

229
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:46.510 
to identify, to the
sophisticated concealment

230
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.990 
mechanisms the Zeus
botnet, the Zeus malware

231
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:58.070 
spread through phishing mails
and hidden downloads.

232
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.850 
In the U.S they count more than
three million six hundred

233
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:11.670 
thousand infected systems, so you can add
all the systems in other countries.

234
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:18.910 
The Zeus operators can finally
select the information,

235
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:23.340 
in which they are interested,
for example, they can get

236
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:29.020 
access to data, to specific services,
to special social networks,

237
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:35.000 
to online banking or others. And
here are some of the attacks

238
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.100 
which were performed
by Zeus botnet.

239
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:45.140 
In October 2010 the FBI
published that eastern

240
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:50.480 
european hackers, had succeed
infection systems with the

241
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.330 
zeus malware worldwide,
particularly online accounts

242
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.520 
were taken over and several
thousand dollars were transferred

243
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.610 
to middle-men. The
middleman had previously

244
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.500 
opened accounts with fake
identities and then

245
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.830 
they transferred the
stolen money on

246
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.000 
or they smuggled it
out of the country,

247
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.390 
so there is a
sophisticated way how to

248
00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.150 
earn money, how to get money,
how to transfer money.

249
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.330 
The Zeus bot caused a total
damage of approximately

250
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:35.420 
seventy million U,S. dollars and
more than a hundred people were

251
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.930 
found a in the to work with this
to do criminal activities with

252
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.910 
the Zeus botnet and were
meanwhile arrested.

253
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.390 
But have in mind every time
if such damage numbers are

254
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:55.570 
given many of the damages
are not seen and were not

255
00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.180 
become, people have not
become aware of this.

256
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.170 
Behind the Zeus botnet there
is a global organization

257
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:08.770 
of criminals which was very
smart and phenomenal

258
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:13.640 
organization. So the
cybercriminals attempted

259
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.500 
to steal in total two hundred
twenty million U.S. dollars.

260
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.970 
The FBI alone registered
almost four

261
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.440 
hundred fraud cases, and
the hacker came from

262
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:30.300 
this was identified
from eastern europe.

263
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.630 
The middleman where are from
America, Great Britain

264
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:40.210 
and eastern europ and the
victims came largely

265
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.270 
from the U.S. So you see
it's a huge organization.

266
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.650 
This picture shows us a
total FBI case with three

267
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.620 
hundred ninety fraud,
and the hackers.

268
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:59.340 
There is an organization
behind, which uses

269
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.490 
and uses a Zeus botnet for
their criminal activities.

270
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:12.160 
Gameover Zeus was discovered
at the end of 2013,

271
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.000 
this is a botnet. That's
particularly used for bank fraud,

272
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.280 
as well as for criminal
encryption of personal data,

273
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.810 
compared and unlike
older versions

274
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.940 
the connection to the c&amp;c
server is encrypted.

275
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.670 
The Gameover Zeus botnet
generate thousands

276
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.800 
of domain names used
for communication,

277
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.100 
and are valid only for a short
time only for one day.

278
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.350 
One variation target systems
in crime and Belarus

279
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.070 
another computer
in the U.S.,

280
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.500 
when they work with this
faked domains. In June

281
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.260 
2014 an international
organization

282
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:11.120 
an operation, Torvar, succeeded
in temporally disconnecting

283
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.530 
the connection between the
C&amp;C server and the bots.

284
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.840 
Perhaps this was also an idea to
take over parts of the bots

285
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.220 
or to use the botnets for own
purposes. You saw it is

286
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:29.400 
not fancy hacking activities
that are really

287
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:34.120 
dangerous activities, really
dangerous cyberattacks

288
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:38.460 
which are a huge amount of dimension
with many people involved,

289
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.410 
which are performed
by such botnets.

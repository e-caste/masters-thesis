1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.900 
You mentioned already two
dimensions... yes...

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.770 
can you share with us
another two dimensions?...

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.640 
So the next two dimensions are
called masculinity versus

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.310 
femininity and uncertainty
avoidance index let's start with

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.150 
the first one. So masculinity
versus femininity

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.840 
it's not actually about men
and women or the gender

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.940 
itself as it say it's about what
values are considered more

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.670 
important in society based on
the characters that come from

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.650 
male or female. So
usually like women have

10
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.980 
some collective characteristic
that were reflected in the

11
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.160 
society as a whole in
the femininity part,

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.800 
while were in the
masculine part it's

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.210 
it's the means characteristic which
is reflected in your country

14
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.260 
....that can be identified as
masculine or feminine not because

15
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.830 
of the gender.... yes exactly so
masculinity stands for society

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.200 
in which social gender rules,
are clearly distinct

17
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.490 
so in general men are
supposed to be assertive

18
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.340 
tough and focused on material
success. While women actually

19
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.560 
are supposed to be more
modest and tender

20
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.970 
a femininity stands for a society
in which social gender rules

21
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.170 
overlap, so both men and women
are supposed to be modest like

22
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.000 
woman's characters you know and
tender and also concerned usually

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
with the quality of life
not the material success.

24
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.300 
So in a masculine society you
will see people in general

25
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.300 
looking for achievement, heroiss,
assertiveness and as we said

26
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.520 
material rewards for
sexes....and not just men?...

27
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.640 
in general yes the
whole society will

28
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.930 
be more competitive.
Femininity on the other

29
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.070 
hand stands for cooperation,
modesty, caring for the weak as

30
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.470 
they care more about quality of
life. So the society at large

31
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.680 
is more consensus oriented. Like
in general also like birth

32
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.950 
rate in the feminine society
he is actually decided by

33
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.170 
a woman, so the woman decide how
many children she will get

34
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.650 
for example or the family will get....
But in the maskuline its the man?...

35
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.480 
...it's the man who decides
the number of kids or how

36
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.130 
families is big or small......actually
country identifies by masculinity

37
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.260 
information?.... yes absolutely
so let's talk about

38
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.980 
social norms in general in
masculine society the ego is the

39
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.650 
orient you know it's more
about ego orientation

40
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.970 
they care more about money and
things because these are important

41
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.900 
for them and they live
actually in order to work

42
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.620 
while in femininity they
work in order to live

43
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.730 
they try to be more relaxed enjoy
life more and it's more about

44
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.330 
relationship oriented not ego
oriented.......more quality of life

45
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.700 
....yes and because they're like
as we said like a money is

46
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.270 
important in the feminity actually
the quality of life and

47
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.100 
the people who are
the most important.

48
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.910 
In politics and economics
usually in a masculine society

49
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.800 
would see economic growth as a high
priority and conflict usually

50
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.760 
solved through
force aggression.

51
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.980 
And femininity the
environment protection

52
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.610 
comes as a higher priority, so
you would see them advocating

53
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.290 
towards like environmental issues
they care more about the

54
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.320 
poor people is more like
a humanitarian cause...

55
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.160 
I found this really interesting
because before joining

56
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.070 
your remote team that you
know a bit more of this

57
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.980 
other participant that you have
another side and you can expect

58
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.450 
which kind of reaction they
may have to what you say.

59
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.990 
.....Yes and this will actually
minimize the amount of conflict

60
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.950 
that might happen due
to misunderstanding.

61
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.090 
And they usually conflict
solved through negotiation

62
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.820 
in a feminine society.
At work if you would

63
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.930 
mainly see a large gender wage
gap between men and women

64
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.720 
in a masculine society and you
would find just a few women

65
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.250 
in management positions
and usually they prefer

66
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.390 
higher pay so they tend to like
to get paid more while in a

67
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.060 
feminine society they
prefer to work less.

68
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.890 
So they can enjoy
their life more,

69
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.330 
so it's not about the money it's
about the quality of life.

70
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.160 
And also you would see lots of
women in management positions in

71
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.370 
a feminine society...... i believe
this is also reflected in

72
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.210 
their families in this society it's
a no?.. yes sure, so in family

73
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.240 
usually the masculine society goes
for more traditional family

74
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.820 
structure and they have
the belief that girls

75
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.220 
cry and boys don't, voice fired
course girls don't and they treat

76
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.970 
failing as a big disaster
while in femininity

77
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.960 
they have very flexible
family structure

78
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.630 
they don't have this strict
hierarchy and they believe that

79
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.490 
both boys and girls can express
their feelings if they are

80
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.090 
sad and they can cry and
none of them should fight.

81
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.630 
And they treat felling as a
minor accident that you

82
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.620 
can actually learn from and
overcome easily by the support

83
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.240 
of your family and
recruiting perfectly.

84
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.460 
Let's move now to the next
dimension is called uncertainty

85
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.570 
avoidance, ike how many times you
found yourself in a situation

86
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.920 
where you are not certain
about what to do?...

87
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.880 
.....many times.......we all
encounter the same situations.

88
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.710 
This is how to avoid

89
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.050 
uncertainty. Sothis dimension
expressed the degree

90
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.210 
to which actually the members
of a society order system in

91
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.390 
a country treat uncertainty so
how people feel uncomfortable

92
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.010 
with uncertainty and
ambiguity in general.

93
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.210 
Because ambiguity could
cause extreme anxiety.

94
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.160 
Ambiguity is not good, stress
anxiety you don't know what will

95
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.520 
happen in the future. You don't
know what's waiting for you

96
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.200 
for some people or for some
countries people there

97
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.990 
are more comfortable in dealing
with ambiguity or uncertainty

98
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.420 
and usually this to control this
uncertainty starts from your

99
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.570 
home. Start with your family,
have the family, your family

100
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.230 
raise you and then in in school
how the state the country as

101
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.960 
the other all like they actually
handle this uncertainty situations.

102
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.850 
And some other ways to hunt them
could be low because low try

103
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.140 
to prevent uncertainties
a in the behavior

104
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.100 
of other people religion could
control like the spiritual or

105
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.590 
unknown forces that are
assumed to control

106
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.790 
our life and technology sometimes
can actually helps in avoiding

107
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.100 
some uncertainties goes
by naturalists...

108
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.670 
But ambiguity sounds quite abstract
is there any way to measure

109
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.670 
that can we really have
an index on that?....

110
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.430 
Yes we have an index that's
why it's called uncertainty

111
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.430 
avoidance index are usually
countries who come on the high

112
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.320 
level they are they have more
stability and more structural

113
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.000 
rules, more laws and they are less
comfortable taking risk because

114
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.280 
they don't want to be worried
about what will happen

115
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.860 
later and that's why you
will find them more

116
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.590 
aggressive more emotional
always busy and anxious.

117
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.780 
On the other hand countries who
come that come on the lower

118
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.580 
level because they like to take
risk you would find lots of

119
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.670 
interpreters in these countries....for
exampel creating companies...

120
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.290 
yes they like to take risks,
they are brave enough to take

121
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.250 
risks, they are comfortable with
ambiguity and uncertainty.

122
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.910 
So they try their chances and
the usually there are less

123
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.770 
clothes and the people there
they are less dependent on the

124
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.790 
structure laws and that's why
you will feel like ok they are

125
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.890 
quiet sometimes
lazy and dull.

126
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:37.480 
Happy people exist in both in
high and low, but where do

127
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.040 
you expect the most
unhappy people to be?

128
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.300 
....probably in the high?.....yes
of course in the high because

129
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.630 
of the stress and do you know
sometimes stress brings

130
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.260 
disease right? and usually
happy people live longer

131
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.270 
so the nations of countries who
come that come on the low UAI

132
00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.480 
they they live longer yes. If
we talk about the schools,

133
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:06.100 
like a school there a
on the high level

134
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.610 
they are like students
are more comfortable

135
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.910 
also by the teacher controlling them
and they believe the students

136
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.750 
believed like the teacher
should know all the answers

137
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.570 
and the relationship is very a
formal and that is are just

138
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.090 
tells the parent what
she wants or he wants

139
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.820 
from their kids what to expect
while in a low you early country

140
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.600 
a it's the other way around is like
a group work open discussion

141
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.380 
at teachers have this open
channels with their students

142
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.150 
and it's very common that if a
student as the teacher about

143
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.530 
something that he should say
i don't know the answer,

144
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.970 
that's normal and teachers
usually involve parents

145
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:57.490 
in the a in the learning
experience. Shopping for example

146
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.810 
on the High UAI countries
like they search for purity

147
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.040 
they care a lot about new
stuff so they tend to buy

148
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.440 
new houses, new cars they hire
experts to repair their homes

149
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.580 
while on the other hand they
actually care about enjoying

150
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:20.270 
quality of life, so they don't
care about material stuff

151
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.340 
and that's why you
would see them doing

152
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.940 
his duty yourself if you want
to repair something they have

153
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.640 
no problem by buying
a second hand car,

154
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.870 
so money is not an issue for
them, they don't like to show

155
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.500 
off and you would also
notice like a technology

156
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.640 
is accepted faster and
the new products

157
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.080 
are adopted faster in countries
come on the lower UAI

158
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.680 
while there they resist the high
you are in the country they

159
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.490 
resist the new product they
resist actually adopting a new

160
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.870 
technology......very interesting
Harry. How do you see society

161
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.510 
deal with uncertainties? i think
the community can join us in

162
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.960 
that and do you think your
countryside sits on the masculinity

163
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.080 
side or in the community
certain information?

164

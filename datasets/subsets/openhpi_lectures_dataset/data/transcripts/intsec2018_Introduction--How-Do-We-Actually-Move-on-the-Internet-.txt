00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.880 
When we speak about internet
security then we have to discuss

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.320 
how do we actually move
on the internet.

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.670 
When we use internet services
likes of world wide web

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.030 
when we use internet
services like openHPI

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.170 
we need to identify our
self to the service.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.660 
What's the reason? The reason is
the service should recognize

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.920 
us, should remember us, should
remember who we are and which

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.780 
of their resources we can use in
what terms. In the physical world

9
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.070 
this identification
is simple possible,

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.800 
we identify ourselves
through our appearance

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.820 
through our physical identity with the
hair with the face with the voice

12
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.140 
and with our appearance. But
how we can do identify

13
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.200 
ourselves in the internet, in
the internet we can of course

14
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
send a photo but it's clear
that it's our photo

15
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.270 
it's clear whether it's an
actual photo we can send

16
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.370 
voice messages but how it's clear
that the voice message is from us.

17
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.170 
In the digital world
this identification is

18
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.490 
much more difficult and in the
digital world of internet

19
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.250 
we can not identify our self
by physical appearance

20
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.340 
we can only ourselves through
a collection of electronic

21
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.990 
data. This collection
of electronic data

22
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.360 
compare it to the physical
identity it's so called

23
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.540 
digital identity. When we
ask how we connect how

24
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.620 
we are connected to
our digital identity

25
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.890 
then there is a question
how we can prove

26
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.180 
that this digital identity, this
intended data are connected

27
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.150 
to us. The proof of the digital
identity can be shown

28
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.830 
in various ways for
example with a password

29
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.700 
for example with a smart card. We
can do this with fingerprints,

30
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.920 
we can do this with facial recognition
you see there are different

31
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.420 
possibilities and when we look
what is the most common method

32
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.810 
of linking physical
to digital identity

33
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.310 
then it's the usage of
passwords, by the way

34
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.970 
the passwords originally the
password mechanisms were developed

35
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.470 
to identify ourselves against
our personal computer.

36
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.090 
They were not designed to
identify ourselves over the

37
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.840 
internet but they were in
place they were easy to

38
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.330 
use so most often today
we have to identify

39
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.090 
ourselves in the internet
by means of passwords.

40
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.410 
Reason is the method was in placem
it is easy to implement it's

41
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.940 
easy to implement via
this service provider

42
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.090 
there are not so much efforts
needed on side of the service

43
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.640 
user, he has only to design and remember
such a password so the password

44
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.460 
mechanism become very
popular in the internet

45
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.740 
but we have clearly to say that
this method is highly unsafe

46
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.520 
and when we speak about our
next week about the course

47
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.310 
week 2 when we speak about
digital identity and passwords

48
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.360 
we will see this in
more detail. In the

49
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.500 
following week we will
take a closer look

50
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.040 
at this password based
identification method

51
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.160 
and we will find out that passwords
are often unsafe if we see

52
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.790 
exactly in which point
they are unsafe

53
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.070 
and we also will see that the
humans the user themself

54
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.480 
play an important role
that this method is

55
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.170 
unsecure because they select
unsecure passwords.

56
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.990 
We also will study how
attackers make use

57
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.830 
of this lack of security how
attackers try to get access

58
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.020 
to passwords to find out passwords
to use the digital identity of

59
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.870 
another person for the purpose
of the cybercriminals.

60
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.810 
Password can not avoid
it in today's internet

61
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.550 
so we have to think
how we can use this

62
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.930 
in the best way, how best to
deal with the password and how

63
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.740 
to increase security of
passwords. This is what we

64
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.530 
want to discuss in the second
week of our openHPI course

65
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.070 
and beside of that we will of
course also discuss also more

66
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.510 
safe methods for user
identification

67
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.250 
where we speak of multi-factor
authentication but this

68
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.750 
will be done at the end
of our course week.

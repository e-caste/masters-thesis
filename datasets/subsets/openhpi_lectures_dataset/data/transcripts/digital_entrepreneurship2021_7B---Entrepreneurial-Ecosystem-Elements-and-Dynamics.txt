00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.900 
Thinking of entrepreneurship in terms of
ecosystems is key to understand why

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.120 
and how digital ventures
really can become successful.

3
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.470 
While we already have emphasized the role
and relevance of this perspective,

4
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.990 
in this video we look at the elements of
ecosystems, or to put it differently,

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.440 
which key actors are embedded
in entrepreneurial ecosystems,

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.710 
and what are the structures that
connect them? Further, we will

7
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.370 
address the question of dynamics,
meaning, how entrepreneurial

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.320 
ecosystems evolve over
time. So, let's dive in!

9
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
Welcome to this video on
"Entrepreneurial Ecosystems". My name

10
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.290 
is Katharina HÃ¶lzle and I will
introduce you to the building blocks

11
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.050 
that comprise entrepreneurial
ecosystems. Generally, management

12
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.310 
research concerned with business
ecosystems usually differentiates actors,

13
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.130 
activities and architectures that
contribute to joint value creation.

14
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.110 
Research in this matter has a
strong focus on theory, and if

15
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.240 
you like to learn more about this,
we display key definitions

16
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.640 
on the slide next to me.

17
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.300 
However, entrepreneurial ecosystems
are a bit different as the

18
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.040 
focus here is not so much on
joint focal offerings in terms

19
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.500 
of products or services, but
rather on the creation and the

20
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.440 
support of new ventures.

21
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.690 
We previously mentioned Eri Stan
from Utrecht University, who

22
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.150 
defined entrepreneurial ecosystems "as a set
of interdependent actors and factors

23
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.670 
coordinated in such a way that they
enable productive entrepreneurship".

24
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.010 
He and his colleagues Van de
Ven also developed a model of

25
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.790 
ten elements that shape
entrepreneurial ecosystems.

26
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.700 
These elements account for an
underlying structure and allow

27
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.220 
us to better understand the functioning of
entrepreneurial ecosystems in particular.

28
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.850 
It should be noted that entrepreneurial
ecosystems - while often

29
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.460 
focused in a particular region - are
not restricted to that region,

30
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.950 
especially when you think of
digital entrepreneurs. Obviously,

31
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.500 
for example, entrepreneurial
growth in Israel is distributed

32
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.990 
along a coast of many clusters
with Haifa and Tel Aviv being

33
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.950 
only two centres
among them.

34
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.900 
Now, the first three elements - culture,
social networks, and formal institutions -

35
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:47.440 
all relate to arrangements which "legitimate,
regulate and incentivize entrepreneurship".

36
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.130 
To put it more plainly, these
elements are about context.

37
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.290 
How much is entrepreneurship
valued in a culture, who knows

38
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.780 
whom in the ecosystem, and what
are the formal and informal

39
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.230 
rules of the game? As you can imagine,
these are crucial conditions

40
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.360 
for any entrepreneurial
activity to gain traction.

41
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.610 
We earlier discussed the
entrepreneurial mindset, which can

42
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.050 
substantially differ between
cultures, for example, with regard

43
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.990 
to a certain tolerance
for failure.

44
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.780 
The remaining seven elements all
relate to resources, and include,

45
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.050 
for instance, the physical infrastructure,
talent, finance, and intermediate services.

46
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.950 
Most notable examples would be a
broadband infrastructure, the

47
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.830 
presence of skilled individuals,
the accessibility of venture

48
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.950 
capital, as well as the availability
of technology transfer offices or

49
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.780 
start-up incubators. You hopefully
recall our input on entrepreneurship

50
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.260 
education, for which
universities are usually key.

51
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.780 
They represent focal actors in
entrepreneurial ecosystems as

52
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.670 
sources of talent
and knowledge.

53
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.160 
In perspective, by using this framework and
by differentiating these ten elements

54
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.180 
we can identify barriers and enablers and
learn about interdependencies. Further,

55
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.710 
we can also measure and compare
entrepreneur ecosystems to each other

56
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.030 
to which we come back
in another video.

57
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.890 
And certainly entrepreneurial ecosystems
are not static, they constantly evolve.

58
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.340 
The dynamic nature of entrepreneurial
ecosystems is a topic which has caught

59
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.110 
a lot of attention
over the last decade.

60
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.110 
Several models have been proposed to capture
the dynamic development and evolution

61
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.680 
of entrepreneurial ecosystems. An exemple,
so called "dynamic life cycle model"

62
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.620 
has been recently put forth by
Uve Cantner and his colleagues.

63
00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.040 
The authors argue that entrepreneurial
ecosystems, which are

64
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.700 
focused on new venture creation, over time
transition to more mature business ecosystems

65
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.130 
focused on commercialization. In
their conceptual framework,

66
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.980 
the authors outline the
following five phases.

67
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.780 
First, the birth of an entrepreneur
ecosystem is driven by a

68
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.110 
growing number of individuals and
teams that start to exploit

69
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.380 
novel ideas and opportunities
in a given region.

70
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.960 
For example, as a result of knowledge
spillovers from companies or universities.

71
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.330 
Second, in the growth phase, the elements we
just described become more specialized.

72
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.260 
For example, when supporting
institutions become aware of a

73
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.210 
buzzing entrepreneurial scene
and start to adapt accordingly.

74
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.500 
Also, the emergence of an entrepreneurial
culture further motivates

75
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.530 
new entries of start-ups into the
ecosystem. The third so-called

76
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.650 
maturity or stabilisation phase is
characterized by less new venture creation

77
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:09.190 
but rather mature ventures that
exit the market. For example,

78
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.440 
when they caught the attention
of established corporates and

79
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.860 
are being acquired. According to
Cantner and his colleagues, this

80
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.960 
phase marks the transition of an entrepreneurial
ecosystem to a business ecosystem.

81
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.090 
While the buzz is gone to some degree, innovations
are being increasingly commercialized.

82
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.730 
The following phase four sees
established companies as the

83
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.190 
more important drivers in the
entrepreneurial ecosystem, and this

84
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.590 
is where new future entrepreneurs start
to recognize untapped opportunities.

85
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.520 
This leads to the final phase five,
called reemergence in which

86
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.810 
the next life cycle starts from
the beginning, for example, with

87
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.080 
new spin-offs out of mature
adventures. In short,

88
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.790 
according to the authors,
entrepreneurial ecosystems follow a

89
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.590 
recurring, prototypical
life cycle.

90
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.130 
This framework also shows how elements
of an entrepreneurial ecosystem

91
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.450 
are relevant in
different phases.

92
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.050 
To conclude - for entrepreneurs,
policy-makers and researchers

93
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.490 
alike, it is essential to learn
how exactly entrepreneurial

94
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.230 
activities can be leveraged
to drive future innovations.

95
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.850 
Knowing about the key activities
among ecosystem actors and

96
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.880 
knowing how ecosystems evolve
over time provides research and

97
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.860 
practice with the means to systematically
assess entrepreneurial ecosystems

98
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:49.150 
and their success. Maybe you know of an
entrepreneurial ecosystem close to you -

99
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.490 
we would encourage you to look out
for the aspects we described, to gain

100
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.260 
an understanding on where it stands
within the element's framework

101
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.260 
and within the
life cycle.

102
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.690 
We are curious to hear from you in
the forum about entrepreneurial

103
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.910 
ecosystems close to you, might they
be small or large, old or young.

104
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.450 
For now, we thank you for your
attention and hope to see you

105
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.550 
again in a bit. Bye!

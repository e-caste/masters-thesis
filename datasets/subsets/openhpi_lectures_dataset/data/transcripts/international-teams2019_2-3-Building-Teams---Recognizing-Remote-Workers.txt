00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.810 
So, Salim, You talked to us about
workers who are geographically

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.380 
dispersed, How would you
recognize these remote workers?

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.210 
Well, before recognizing the
remote workers, we need to focus

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.510 
on which are the tasks that we
want to bring into a remote

5
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.510 
infrastructure, in a
remote environment.

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.250 
We rely heavily on the technology
as I said before and there

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.010 
are some conditions where you
cannot bring the technology that

8
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.260 
you have in an office or
in a manufacturer or an

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.240 
enterprise outside. You need to
go there you need to be there.

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.340 
Therefore there are some
conditions we can see on this

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.820 
slide. There are some tasks you
cannot be someone who is working

12
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
in an ambulance, sorry he can be
remote and also, a flight attendant

13
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.910 
or a firefighter. There are some
task that definitely is out

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.860 
of this scope and also there are
some others where you require

15
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.590 
face to face interaction. Where
you have to meet a customer

16
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.650 
When you need to go to receive
some document, do we

17
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.260 
need to exchange some money. I
don't know different things. When

18
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.660 
you have to have face to
face communication.

19
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.630 
It is something that, there
are some limitations.

20
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.290 
Currently, even in Germany, they
are starting some banks to make

21
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.590 
experiments to bring video
communication to customers.

22
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.850 
The acceptance is ok, but
it is not the same as the

23
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.180 
people want to go to the
bank and then to have the

24
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.620 
the experience of the bank. Even if it
is not because they are exchanging

25
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.270 
money is because they are
talking about money,

26
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.980 
and then they don't rely that
the video or the communication

27
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.250 
systems are perfect and no
one is listening to them.

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.380 
Therefore, face to face communication,
it will be something that

29
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.270 
you may not need exactly to bring
into the remote structure.

30
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.330 
Also, a fragmented task that
requires coordination with others.

31
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.230 
Whatever you are doing something
and you at the end you have

32
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.070 
a final product, then you
need to bring it to someone

33
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.610 
else, you need to give it over to
someone else, to continue to

34
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.290 
work in that case. Probably
the remote work will have a

35
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.520 
a bit more of stress because if
you're working in a city and

36
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.840 
you need to transport it
to a different city,

37
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.650 
it will take a bit more. This is
an airbus as you say before,

38
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.580 
airbus is a good example but we
are talking about a big, very

39
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
big dimension but when
you're manufacturing

40
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.270 
a small package and they will
need to go to the post and

41
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.580 
start making things difficult
it is possible but

42
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.680 
it requires a lot of
coordination in this regard.

43
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.000 
Whenever you need special equipment.
A surgery for instance,

44
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.320 
when you're in a hospital you
cannot bring a machine for making

45
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.080 
x rays into a remote place. Of
course, all these things can happen

46
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.350 
and with this I don't want to say
that eHealth is not possible

47
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.670 
it is a topic. eHealth
bringing a lot

48
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.150 
of success in
some countries.

49
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.420 
Where to find a doctor in the middle
of nowhere it's very difficult

50
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.770 
and the people
can have good

51
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.840 
experiences, when
doctors are

52
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.700 
giving information per video,
even talking via telephone.

53
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.980 
There are some regions in this
world where there are no doctors,

54
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.470 
i'm sorry for that. The doctors
are bringing themselves

55
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.840 
into the community and
giving this advises.

56
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.400 
This also remote work,
people are working from...

57
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400 
I have some experience from
people working from the UK.

58
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.180 
Some doctors working from the UK
and they are assisting people in

59
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.410 
south africa and they are almost
in the same time zone located.

60
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.200 
and it works perfectly. They
have already experience

61
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.510 
and even the people that are
working in the in the UK

62
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.940 
are already doctors that are retired,
they don't want to move out, they don't

63
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.740 
want to go to a hospital again
but they have the knowledge

64
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.600 
and they are bringing this
to an excellent point.

65
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.490 
Also, sometimes when you
manage information that is

66
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.090 
sensitive, there are also go again
in data protection, in whenever

67
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.730 
you have some documents
where is the don't know

68
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.880 
your history, of health
history. OK, it doesn't need

69
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.630 
going outside, and being
scanned, and all the stuff.

70
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.430 
There are some conditions with
this, all these things need

71
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.870 
to be considered...... OK, now that we
know like it may work for some workers

72
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.090 
it may not for others but for
those who work for them like,

73
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.530 
how would you build your
team of remote workers?

74
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.570 
OK, who is selectable for work.
There are some procedures really

75
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.960 
normally follow, people will jump
immediately, and say I want

76
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.140 
to work from home because they
want freedom because they

77
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.530 
want to not travel one half hour
daily, before making days in

78
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.160 
this organization. When you
say OK, there are some

79
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.140 
topics where you can bring something
outside. Then start selecting

80
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.770 
the people with more experience
at the moment that people that

81
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.860 
you don't need to train
again, re-train as well.

82
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.770 
Not the people that they
just started to job

83
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.540 
give it a try, let's train the
people before you bring them

84
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.760 
outside. Remote profiles we will
talk about it, about a personality

85
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.030 
if you are introverted
or extroverted both

86
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.560 
extremes are really dangerous.
You need to bring it into

87
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.480 
middle management, and also there
are some other conditions

88
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.290 
that may also impact, is
because of their personality.

89
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.060 
People need interaction,
people need the touch,

90
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.320 
the feeling that they are
important for the organization.

91
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.970 
When you bring someone
outside remotely working

92
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.790 
most of the time, they
are working alone

93
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.010 
and when they are working
alone, they get lost.

94
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.390 
They feel alone of course, but
they think the job is not

95
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.330 
important. If the organization is
missing to give this feedback,

96
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.630 
you're important for us, you're
working with another part of

97
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.030 
the team remotely. Remote-teamwork
is completely different from

98
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.940 
remote work, remote-teamwork
is that you are interacting.

99
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.070 
You have a team outside
and they are having...

100
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.290 
also, part of them, are having
exactly the same experience that

101
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.450 
you are having. This is the reason
also, why it's so important to

102
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.030 
have a team leader there, as well,
to manage this team externally

103
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.040 
and this team that is external
may have still contact with

104
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.920 
the central team which
is in the local office

105
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.240 
and this interaction must
continue to happen.

106
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.060 
There are no better
people, bad people. No,

107
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.750 
you need to make this chain,
that is changing as well.

108
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.360 
People that are working today remotely,
probably tomorrow, are working

109
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.030 
at the office. Or people that are
working today at the office.

110
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.120 
and this an extremely relevant.
and only in that way you

111
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.040 
will start finding out who
are the people that really

112
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.210 
will match to this dynamic...Sometimes
it depends also on

113
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.240 
the circumstances of the worker,
like for me for example, from

114
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.810 
my personal experience,
sometimes, I find it easier to

115
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.890 
focus when I'm working from
home if the office gets busy.

116
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.930 
Because you are not distracted. Yes. On
the other hand, sometimes, I said no,

117
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.470 
I need to focus on, actually by
surrounding myself with my colleagues.

118
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.620 
So, I'm forcing myself to focus.
Depending on what you are doing.

119
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.470 
Exactly, and this is something
extremely important because

120
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.390 
it leads to topics of
motivation, and motivation

121
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.910 
is a very important topic. This
motivation you will get only,

122
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.200 
if you really discuss those topics
with your leaders and with

123
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.880 
you are with your colleagues. Because
if for any reason, you need

124
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.780 
to work outside because
you will need to

125
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.840 
be more focused, then
talk to your team.

126
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.690 
The team finds by
themselves, they rhythm

127
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.450 
how to work. If at a
certain point, you see

128
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.380 
as a manager, things are not
performing bring them over here,

129
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.960 
talk about that, bring all out
there. Now with the experience we

130
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.930 
have let us redefine. No
single company is identical

131
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.610 
to another company. For company
A, things are going to work

132
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.160 
in one way and company
B, are gonna work in

133
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.070 
in another way because of the
services, because of the products,

134
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.670 
and because of the
people you have there.

135
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.110 
Probably a company will have
people extremely experienced

136
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.070 
and then ok for them to go outside
perfect, it will work. But for people

137
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.770 
that for a company that
is just starting,

138
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.410 
you may have some other difficulties.
I think it's also important

139
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.720 
to consider the trust factor when
talking about companies because

140
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.280 
I know some companies would like
to implement the remote work

141
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.210 
culture, but then, yet they still
don't trust their employees

142
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.560 
let me tell you one thing...
If there is no trust,

143
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:12.400 
don't implement this! This is
one of the basic elements

144
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.200 
on this working model. Trust! If
you don't trust an employee,

145
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.340 
or your employees don't trust the
managers, then don't start this

146
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.140 
game. It will be a waste
of time, waste of money,

147
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.430 
because this relies a lot
on trust, and we will

148
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.430 
talk about this later on.
But trust is probably

149
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.220 
with communication are the two
factors that they will definitely

150
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:38.440 
manage the process to go forward.
There are different tasks, there

151
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.990 
are different people,

152
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.730 
some of them they get crazy, some
of them, really they cannot.

153
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.930 
Believe me, with the experience we
have in the past, implemented

154
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.450 
during the last decade, work remotely,
there are people, they cannot.

155
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.950 
They say no, I'm sorry I need
interaction with people.

156
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.100 
OK, this is you can not
change it! and you can

157
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.900 
try a bit probably,
then just make once

158
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.970 
a week. There are others
that they go out,

159
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.650 
and they perform by far better
as they were performing

160
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.560 
before in the office. Therefore, please
consider, you have remote workers at

161
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.830 
the other side, there are humans
and at this condition they need

162
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.140 
to be considered. Thank
you so much, Salim.

163
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.440 
Now we would like to
hear from you. What

164
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.190 
additional aspects would you consider
as relevant to recognizing

165
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.760 
remote workers? Which task
probably you would not assign to

166
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.890 
your remote workers or
you as a remote worker

167
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.270 
would not like to be
assigned to such a task?

168
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.590 
If you have any experience, please
share it with us. If you have

169
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.920 
any questions about the topic,
also you are most welcome to

170
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.970 
join the discussion.
Thank you Hanadi.

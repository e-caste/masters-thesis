00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540 
In our openHPI course - A
Half Century of Internet

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.200 
we now want to discuss
video streaming

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.750 
Netflix and Co.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.330 
How annoying... Imagine

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.150 
you want to see
a TV show

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.710 
and the TV shows start soon but you have
to take out the trash and then enjoy

7
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.150 
the show while sitting on
the sofa but you meet

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.140 
neighbour and to discuss something
and the conversation takes

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.250 
a while and then you come
back to your apartment, you

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.460 
look to the TV and 25 minutes of
the program are already over.

11
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.500 
Maybe the show will be repeated, you
look at the TV magazine, you look

12
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.040 
around but it is not

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.510 
but of course, we have an idea, you
can look into the media store

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
of the TV center. So, what is with
the online media libraries? Can

15
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.510 
you find a recording of
the show there? So here

16
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.070 
figures are shown of the
users of the traditional TV

17
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.600 
and Internet streaming.

18
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.610 
So, here you see TV,
that red line is going

19
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.300 
slowly but constantly going
down over the last years

20
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.570 
and on the other sides
the usage of internet

21
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.090 
streaming of multimedia
content is

22
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.250 
faster increasing. So,
the number of minutes

23
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.840 
per day a user is
sitting in front of a

24
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.030 
TV and in front of a computer,
what can be seen is that

25
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.430 
people spent much more time on such
content than in the former years

26
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.270 
Here is a total share of internet traffic
for the different types of information

27
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.430 
that is transported over the
internet, it is a traffic share

28
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.940 
measured worldwide. 61% of
internet communication is Video,

29
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.770 
browsing is 13%,
gaming is 8%,

30
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.300 
usage of social media

31
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.480 
is 6%, file transfer is

32
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.480 
six percent
five transfer

33
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.870 
4% and messaging is 2%;
so the vast usage

34
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.480 
in the internet is used
for looking videos

35
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.700 
What is the motivation
for video streaming?

36
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.060 
The internet service presents so
far work according to the scheme

37
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.960 
a transferred data first and
then one can use the data

38
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.940 
this was what we saw when we discussed
about the web documents which are

39
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.160 
requested via the browser and
then they were displayed

40
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.780 
this was a principle also with
other services and data

41
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.000 
the problem with audio
and video information

42
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.290 
which when we would use
the same way first to

43
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.380 
transfer data and then to use
the data then we would have to

44
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.070 
wait a very long time reason is
that audio and video data are

45
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.190 
a huge amount of data

46
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.030 
and then a huge amount of data have to
be transferred first before playback

47
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.600 
can take place and the
time is interoperable

48
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.640 
in particular if you want to
take part a wire streaming on

49
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.970 
a football game
or others.

50
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.840 
So, continuous media playback during
the data transfer this is desirable

51
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.000 
continuously
media playback

52
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.360 
during the data transfer, and
this is exactly streaming that

53
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.170 
data are transferred and almost
simultaneously already displayed

54
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.870 
but this media streaming needs
some technical preparations

55
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.110 
before we discuss this, let's a
look at the different classes

56
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.880 
of streaming

57
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.930 
We can stream stored
audio and video files

58
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.040 
so the video you are now seeing this
was stored already before you

59
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.370 
opened it and everyone who wants
to see the video can access it.

60
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.230 
The data video is already
completely available

61
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.200 
and you for that reason can navigate in
the data, you can do a fast forward

62
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.130 
you can rewind, jump whatever
you want from the beginning to

63
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.530 
the end and back. Another class of
streaming is called live streaming

64
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.650 
of audio and video data

65
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.440 
so the data is transferred
while it is being recorded

66
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.840 
this is comparable to
a live TV broadcast

67
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.860 
and it is clear that you cannot easily
navigate you can navigate back

68
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.670 
but typically not in the future because
the data are not yet produced

69
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.720 
How does it work
technically?

70
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.460 
We discussed that the data are
broke down into data packages.

71
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.460 
Data packages are sent through the internet
and they are through different ways

72
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.800 
we need protocols like

73
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.910 
TCP or others to bring
them in the right order

74
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.170 


75
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.910 
to bring them in
the right order

76
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.080 
How it is possible to transfer
video without jittery?

77
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.130 
And what's needed
technically

78
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.560 
is a buffer. The buffer
is able to store

79
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.460 
certain time units, you can store this
on a disc or locally or whatever

80
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.330 
so buffer is able to
store "n" time units

81
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.690 
and here are the source, here are the server
which provides some video information

82
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.480 
and the client requested the
video information and then

83
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.500 
the data are sent
through the internet

84
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.290 
and this buffer is
close to the client

85
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.720 
so here over the internet, the
data come in a different order

86
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.540 
and are stored
in the buffer

87
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.570 
and then as soon as a buffer
is completely filled

88
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.030 
data are transmitted

89
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:23.210 
on a very regular pattern to
the client and are removed

90
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.220 
from the buffer

91
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.450 
so, irregularly the other data packets
arrive and are stored on the

92
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:37.430 
available space in the buffer
but here on this side of the

93
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.360 
user the data are very precisely
taken out of the buffer

94
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:49.450 
so they come in an irregular time
pattern in the buffer because

95
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:55.510 
the transport of the internet
is not very much in times

96
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.380 
packages can follow
different paths, can

97
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.900 
find different situations but
here and that's important

98
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.900 
so that the video is
not a jittering

99
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.850 
pieces have to be
taken out on a very

100
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.850 
timely on a very
regular basis

101
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.920 
so, as a buffer
helps to

102
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:27.150 
repair the problems that come
from the irregular received

103
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.600 
of the video data

104
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.880 
so, the buffer is now regularly
filled and read and the video

105
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.220 
runs smoothly

106
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:44.030 
but this buffer, the data are
stored, they do not arrive

107
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.740 
at the client side exactly in the
moment when something has happened

108
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:55.880 
so assume, that on the server, say, a
stream of football game just started

109
00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.500 
so this buffer if
it brings a delay

110
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.280 
and what is clear
the longer delay

111
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:11.140 
is more easy it is to take
out on a regular basis

112
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.660 
but when the buffer
is too short

113
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.520 
then it could happen that
the data are taken out

114
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:27.590 
are shown on the client side but the
new packages didn't arrive in time

115
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.920 
so as soon as a
buffer is empty

116
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.960 
there is no
playback possible

117
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.080 
so one has to wait up
to the next data

118
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.560 
so the length of the buffer is
very important, the longer

119
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.030 
the more a higher quality is
in the receipt of the data

120
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:56.510 
but the larger is a delay
between the event when it's

121
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.090 
a streaming of
a life event

122
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:06.840 
There are many media libraries
particularly each tv centre has such a

123
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.140 
media library meanwhile in
Germany are ARD, BBC, CNN, CBS

124
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:21.700 
TVNOW, Joyn and others.
So, social networks

125
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.520 
consume and produce a lot of
videos, for example, YouTube

126
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.180 
YouTube is the largest
video portal worldwide

127
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.760 
Vimeo, Dailymotion is another;
Vimeo we are using in openHPI

128
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.640 
full streaming of
the HPI videos

129
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.880 
Netflix is a paid
video stream offer

130
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.170 
it's the largest video
streaming portal

131
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:56.010 
with a huge amount of content. Meanwhile,
they also produce content by themselves

132
00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:02.370 
but also Amazon Video, Hulu,
Disney+ are other such portals

133
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:10.910 
If we look for the largest
video library, YouTube

134
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.860 
the domain was activated
in February in 2005 and

135
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:22.340 
the first upload of a YouTube video
was half a year later in August

136
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:29.240 
of that year, then Google
immediately realized the need and

137
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.050 
the possibilities of
business opportunities

138
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.740 
by owning such a platform, so,
Google buys YouTube in October

139
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:43.130 
2005 for 1.65
billion US Dollar

140
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.210 
not even 1 year after
founding of the portal

141
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.080 
the founder could make

142
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.470 
cash about 1.65 almost
2 billion US Dollar

143
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.060 
if you look to the statistics and
monthly there are more than 1 billion

144
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:11.190 
users. These 1 billion users
reached first in March 2013

145
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:19.250 
so after 8 years, 7-8 years, today
it's almost 2 billion users

146
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.780 
monthly users
of YouTube

147
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.690 
and 2 billion
views a day

148
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.380 
were first achieved already
10 years ago in May 2010

149
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:39.940 
Today the content that YouTube
is offering is in 80

150
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.090 
different languages, it's available
in 91 countries, 1 billion hours

151
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:53.310 
of video material and most
viewed was "Despacito"

152
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.450 
it was almost 7
billion views

153
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:05.960 
Uploads about 550 hours of
video material per minute

154
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:12.690 
so you see and understand that the vast
majority of traffic in the internet

155
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.450 
as the transport
of such video

156
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:23.670 
material; if we look to
Netflix, the most famous

157
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:23.670 
uh uh if we look to netflix
netflix the most the most famous

158
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:30.220 
paid video library, it was
found in August 1997

159
00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:38.520 
it was originally founded as a
video DVD rent and sales service

160
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:44.400 
then 10 years later, in 2007
they start a streaming service

161
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.520 
and

162
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:51.890 
in the first year it was only available
in the US but in September 2010

163
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.890 
was only available in the us but
in september two thousand seven

164
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:59.220 
they goes
internationally

165
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:05.380 
since 2012, there is an increasing
number of in-house production

166
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:11.910 
only produced for the
Netflix portal and in 2017

167
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:19.990 
around 140 million hours of films
and series were watched worldwide

168
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.470 
every day; although, people have to pay,
they are willing to pay for that content

169
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:31.200 
in the latest statistic,
we could access

170
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:39.440 
in late 2019, around 167
million users worldwide

171
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.190 
in over 190 countries and
the company itself Netflix

172
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.780 
has about 7000
employees

173
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:57.030 
so video streaming is a really
important phenomenon in the

174
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:02.030 
internet and the
main idea is

175
00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.770 
we cannot go into much details for
the streaming protocols, the main

176
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:17.550 
thing you have to understand that we need a
buffer to convert the irregularly incoming

177
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.850 
data packages with a video
content to take out on

178
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:28.590 
the other side in a very regular
basis so that a user can follow

179
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.840 
these videos, can see these, can
consume these videos without jitter

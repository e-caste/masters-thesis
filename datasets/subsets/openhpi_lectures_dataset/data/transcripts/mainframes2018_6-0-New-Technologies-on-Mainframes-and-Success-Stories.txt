00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.580 
Hello again and welcome to our last week of our mainframe MOOC.

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.820 
And during this last week, we want to talk about new technologies on mainframes

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.300 
and present some success stories and of course we do a summary.

4
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.570 
When we come to talk about new technology, some

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.510 
examples, where we talk about during this week in our MOOC

6
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.230 
is Linux on IBM Z. We already told something about linux during the last

7
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.810 
few weeks. We want to add some additional stuff concerning

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.220 
linux. LinuxOne is a special machine that is for IBM delivered

9
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.650 
really just for linux, and implementing linux on this hardware

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.300 
as an open mainframe project from the linux software foundation.

11
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.640 
And we want to present what the open mainframe project deals with and

12
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.110 
what is done in this open mainframe project.

13
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.090 
Then we summarize also virtualization.

14
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.590 
We talked about virtualization of course already before. There

15
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.410 
are some additional ideas with

16
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.420 
concerning virtualization. We want to compare our KVM- Kernel based Virtual Machine

17
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.420 
versus  z/VM. We want to talk about Application Virtualization with Docker.

18
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.920 
And there are some New Network Technologies we want to talk

19
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.570 
about. One is RDMA over converged to ethernet. We talk

20
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.270 
about shared memory communication and the very new technology implemented on the

21
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.060 
newest machines is Hyperlink.

22
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.060 
Then we summarize also an application development with new

23
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
technologies means especially talking about web services. We compare

24
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.890 
SOAP and RESTful interfaces, and how RESTful interfaces are supported

25
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.830 
on IBM mainframes. And there is a very special product called

26
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.020 
z/OS connect already available in the third version.

27
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.260 
And the idea is to give customers a very easy interface

28
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.970 
to web services to

29
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.790 
application environment we already talked about, to

30
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.350 
transaction management with CICS, to MQ, to IMS and so on.

31
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.560 
And in the the mainframe environment also in place

32
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:53.000 
the API community. And another big thing is Big Data and Analytics

33
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.380 
on IBM Z- a Hadoop, Spark is available a typical intelligence and mainframes

34
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.050 
and what really happens in this environment, we also want to talk about.

35
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.760 
And the last thing although I think we're interested in is block

36
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.490 
chain, block chain on mainframes and what special features are

37
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.360 
available on mainframes supporting block chain environments.

38
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.050 
We want to present some success stories we already talked about

39
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.300 
,if you remember the introduction to our MOOC about Walmart. And

40
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.280 
Walmart is not just a retail company in the United States.

41
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.940 
It's a technology company, has as example its own Walmart lab in the

42
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.790 
Silicon valley. And Walmart is a cloud

43
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.670 
service provider, they are developers. We want to present this

44
00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.580 
things and information about what Walmart is doing to reach these huge transaction

45
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.240 
rates we already talked in our introduction with up to one

46
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.780 
billion transactions a day. And it's really just possible with

47
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.720 
such a mainframe environment. We present some exciting links and a websites

48
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.960 
and a the last thing we do is summary and documentation, additional documentation

49
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.730 
concerning mainframe environments.

50
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.710 
This will be the last week of our MOOC. Have fun during this

51
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.160 
last week and we will present these things now during the next five days.

52
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.270 
Thank you very much.

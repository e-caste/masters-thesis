00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.850 
Hello I'm Jaafer Elmirghani from
University of Leeds in the UK

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.120 
and I'm going to talk about sustainable
cloud and fog networks. This work was

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.440 
sponsored by the UK Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
and co-chair of the IEEE
Sustainable ICT initiative.

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.850 
This is an outline of my talk. I'll
start with an introduction where I

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.190 
talk about sustainable cloud and
fog networks and I'll focus on

7
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.020 
a few areas following an
introduction talking about wireless

8
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.160 
and access networks, IoT networks,
core networks, data center networks

9
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.280 
and then I'll outline some test-bed
implementations, some relevant

10
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.350 
IEEE standards in the sustainable
ICT area and then finally

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.750 
I'll talk about sustainability
through ICT.

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.360 
So if we were
to look at

13
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.870 
the sources of energy in the
world and how they're used,

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.070 
this is one view of the US. This is
generated by the Lawrence Livermore

15
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.390 
National Laboratory in twenty
nineteen. On the left here you have

16
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.840 
the different sources of energy - solar, nuclear,
hydro, wind, geothermal, natural gas, coal,

17
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.210 
biomass and petroleum. On the right-hand
side you have the different

18
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.620 
ways in which we can use this energy in residential,
commercial, industrial and transportation.

19
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.790 
Now the thickness of the line shows
how much of that form of energy

20
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.120 
that goes to the particular area.
So a lot of petroleum is used

21
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.280 
for transportation, a little getting to
industrial and very little amounts

22
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.630 
go to commercial
and residential.

23
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.210 
On this side here we see the total
amount of energy that we use

24
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.430 
and on this side here we see the
total amount of energy that

25
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.850 
we lose, that we waste. And as you
can see for example in trying

26
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.750 
to start with a form of energy
and convert that to electricity

27
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.010 
a lot of that is wasted. And
effectively all over if you look

28
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.790 
at the global picture we actually
waste more than we save.

29
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.600 
So regardless of
the units here,

30
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.620 
you can see effectively that there
is a need for energy efficiency,

31
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.270 
that we need to really have been looking
carefully at energy efficiency.

32
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.220 
If we were to look at this in terms
of ICT and carbon footprint.

33
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.880 
then ICT has got a carbon
footprint that is comparable to

34
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.270 
the global aviation industry and
unlike global aviation it

35
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.550 
is growing at about thirty to
forty percent per year. That is

36
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.430 
the traffic in these communication
networks, on ICT networks.

37
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.310 
And if we look at a
breakdown of where this

38
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.080 
energy and the carbon footprint
comes from in the ICT area,

39
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.660 
then we see that about maybe forty
seven percent of the total

40
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.790 
is due to end devices - user end
devices, about twenty eight percent

41
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.060 
due to data centers and about twenty
four percent due to networks.

42
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.540 
So in this talk i'm going to be
focusing on the data centers

43
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.370 
and networks in particular and
ways whereby we can improve

44
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.660 
their energy efficiency
and look at

45
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.980 
overall the techniques that have
been adopted and hopefully

46
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.240 
this will lead to other kind
of detailed discussions on

47
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.290 
each of those areas. If we look at
communication networks in particular,

48
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.310 
then one of the
drivers for

49
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.290 
hyper-consumption is the increase
in traffic and also obviously

50
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.920 
the increase in processing needs
we have seen recently.

51
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.970 
So this is data that was generated
by the GreenTouch Consortium,

52
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.230 
which is a consortium of about
fifty member organizations

53
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.900 
that ran between twenty ten and
twenty sixteen roughly and

54
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.100 
was led by Nokia Bell Labs. So
we see just before the turn of

55
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.840 
the century, a traffic in the
internet was growing at three

56
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.680 
hundred percent people, expected it to grow
even higher. In effect what happened it

57
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.920 
it reduced in amount and
therefore we had the best of the

58
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.290 
bubble at that point. But if we continue
to look at how much it is growing

59
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.840 
rate at which traffic is growing
now then it is roughly at

60
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.940 
about thirty to forty
percent per year.

61
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.130 
What this means is if you have
forty percent growth in traffic

62
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.500 
per year then it doubles every
two years. It increases by a

63
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.320 
factor of thirty in ten years and by a
factor of one thousand in twenty years.

64
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.120 
So effectively if we are able to
find ways whereby we are able to

65
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.350 
improve the energy efficiency of those
networks by a factor of one thousand,

66
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.620 
then in twenty years we will
consume the same amount of energy

67
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.900 
as we do today but accommodate
one thousand x more traffic.

68
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.220 
And if we're to look at and hence started the
1000x energy efficiency challenge

69
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.320 
in communication networks which
was the goal of the GreenTouch

70
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.660 
Consortium and was delivered upon
by that Consortium which had

71
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.410 
almost an equal number of
universities and companies. If we

72
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.120 
were to look at the breakdown of the
traffic in different parts of the network,

73
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.950 
then the smallest by
volume is wireless voice,

74
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.680 
the fastest growing is wireless
data and the largest by volume

75
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.580 
is internet video and followed
by peer to peer. And therefore

76
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.720 
if you wanted to

77
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.460 
do something about energy efficiency
and reducing the carbon

78
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.580 
footprint of networks and the
internet and so on, then those

79
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.610 
are the areas that you need to
concentrate on video, wireless data

80
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.490 
and some forms of peer to peer.
This is the traffic in North

81
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.000 
America in terabits per
second versus year.

82
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.990 
So the GreenTouch Consortium had
this goal of improving energy

83
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.420 
efficiency by a factor of one
thousand. It published a number of

84
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.340 
white papers and I was a member
of this consortium and

85
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.670 
received an award for the energy efficiency
improvements that we introduced.

86
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.140 
So to give you an idea, in
the core network, in the central

87
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.590 
part of the network we achieved an
energy efficiency improvement

88
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.660 
of three hundred and fifteen x which is a
significant energy efficiency improvement.

89
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.220 
This is comparing the state of
what it was in twenty ten

90
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.170 
to improvements
in twenty twenty.

91
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.830 
Now the other important observation
here is that there isn't

92
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.560 
one magical thing that you can do
that improves energy efficiency

93
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.010 
overall by this very large amount.
In fact there are many small

94
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.590 
things that you can do and collectively
they amount to this larger

95
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.540 
amount of energy efficiency
improvement. So we have improvement

96
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.380 
due to business as usual due to Moore's
Law. We have improvements due to the

97
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.720 
innovations that were introduced by Green
Touch for example optical interconnects

98
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.520 
reducing the power consumption
on board to board and within

99
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.390 
the same board and within a router
or within big switching systems,

100
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.110 
by optimized packet processing
when you have small packets

101
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.750 
you end up reading many many headers and
therefore doing a lot of processing.

102
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:14.270 
If you have larger packets you have
fewer headers for a given volume of data

103
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.260 
and therefore you may need to
adjust the rate at which your

104
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.970 
processors are working to get
the best energy efficiency.

105
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.950 
We also optimize the signal
processing and transponders and

106
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.210 
this is a 4.73x. These
are improvements between

107
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.920 
twenty ten and twenty twenty.
Protection equipment many

108
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.910 
times is just switched on and left on all
the time and for every working path,

109
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.740 
there is a protection path and so
on on an average. Therefore

110
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.890 
if you are able to put them into
low-power modes you can get

111
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.270 
almost a factor of two.

112
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.680 
In terms of fruiting it turns out
that it is always more energy

113
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.720 
efficient to go in the optical
layer photonics is a lot more

114
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.340 
energy efficient compared to
electronics it doesn't have the

115
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.190 
sophistication of the electronics but
it is a lot more energy efficient

116
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.560 
if you are talking just about Joules
per bit and there by passing

117
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.160 
routers when you do not really
need the sophistication of the

118
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.540 
routers can give you a factor
of two dynamically allocating

119
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.170 
the line rates factor
of one point two

120
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.580 
meaning for any amount of data
that you want to send there is

121
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.810 
an optimum data rate at
which to communicate

122
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.270 
optimizing the network topology
and having distributed

123
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.710 
clouds and virtualisation,
essentially bringing the content

124
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.360 
closer to the user. So the user
does not have to go to a central

125
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.090 
city, a big city far away to get their
video content or to do the processing

126
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.190 
and that can end up reducing the journeys up
and down the network and therefore saving

127
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.990 
power. And we went from about three
hundred and sixty nJ/bit

128
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.390 
to about maybe one point
one four njoules/bit.

129
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.250 
There was a number of the innovations.
So some of the ideas were

130
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.730 
around how to use renewable energy
in an optimum way, although

131
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.170 
this was not officially part of the Green
Touch agenda but is very important.

132
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.570 
Renewable energy can help you reduce
your carbon footprint once you have

133
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.670 
improved the energy efficiency
to the best that you can do

134
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.870 
by replacing the non-renewable
energy sources with renewable

135
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.050 
energy sources can reduce your carbon
footprint. The challenge is that those

136
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.790 
energy sources are not available all
the time. So you may have to do

137
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.520 
follow the sun, follow the wind,
wherever the sun is shining

138
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.130 
or the wind is blowing, you move your
processing loads for example there

139
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.110 
where you do a lot of
routing in that way.

140
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.190 
We looked also at the network topology
and ways whereby it can be optimized

141
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.230 
so as to get the best energy
efficiency. It turns out that if the

142
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.670 
traffic is symmetric, everyone wants to
talk to everyone at the same rate.

143
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.540 
Then the optimal topology is a
full mesh and if there

144
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.710 
are some dominant nodes like very
big data centers, then looking

145
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.960 
at those data centers the optimum
network around them would

146
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.150 
be a form of a star.

147
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.340 
Content distribution, there
is a lot of that can be done

148
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.160 
to try to reduce power consumption
by bringing content closer

149
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.870 
to the user. So the question is
how many clouds of data centers

150
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.190 
should we build in the network,
where should they be

151
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.230 
placed, what content should be
placed in each share of those

152
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.280 
clouds depending on the content popularity
and also how do we route optimally.

153
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.030 
Content caching is very important about
ninety percent of the traffic by volume

154
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.370 
in the networks is a form of
video and therefore if you have

155
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.460 
a situation where there is a user
connected to a router here

156
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.190 
and they have to go down the network
all the way to a content server,

157
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.110 
get their video and come back
and consume it here, then that

158
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.110 
introduces a lot of power
consumption whereas if we were to

159
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.870 
cache some of the content locally
and consume it here locally,

160
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.610 
then that can reduce power
consumption quite a lot. But so by

161
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.530 
avoiding the journeys up and down
the network you cache content

162
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.760 
closer to the user. The downside
is that obviously you have

163
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.030 
more devices now in the network but
overall you can win by just caching

164
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.810 
the most popular content and this
is possible because content

165
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.830 
usually has got a kind of, as if
distribution. So there will be maybe

166
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:25.550 
a hundred videos or so in your library
in a youtube or that kind of library

167
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.680 
where if you were to
cache them you get

168
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.980 
approximately eighty
percent of the hits.

169
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.010 
Big data networks which are
writing a lot of big data but we

170
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.100 
are actually interested in the information
contained in the network but not

171
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.940 
in the data itself. We're interested
in the knowledge not the data.

172
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.270 
And therefore by reducing the
amount of data and sending the

173
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.290 
knowledge, we can save a lot of
power. To give you an example

174
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.840 
if you're doing a heart
rate monitor, then

175
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.130 
many times you're not interested
in the raw data itself, you're

176
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.310 
interested in incidents. So if
there is something abnormal then

177
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:05.320 
you want to report those incidents. So by
compressing the data and just looking

178
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.960 
at those incidents and transmitting
those incidents then you

179
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.750 
can reduce the traffic in the
network and you can do this at

180
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.910 
the edge of the network. Vehicular
networks are going to grow

181
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.990 
and the questions here are around
where do we place content,

182
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.410 
how do we route it to the
cervical networks and if the

183
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.570 
vehicular networks have got some
form of processing, how can

184
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.930 
we make best use of it.

185
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.590 
So I'm going to
go through just

186
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:36.190 
some case studies. Here is an example
of a core network as a metro network

187
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.470 
on both sides, here are some access
network and then some user devices.

188
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.230 
And those user devices have got
content to be processed and

189
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.810 
this can be processed in
a processing node

190
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.810 
attached to the access network.
So this is what we refer to

191
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.620 
here as access fog or alternatively
in the metro network what

192
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.890 
is referred to as metro fog or in
the central big data centres

193
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.450 
referred to as cloud. So the clouds
would be the big data centres, the fog

194
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.650 
would be the ones that are closer
to the user and smaller in size.

195
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.150 
Generally if you possess closer
to the user, then you'll have

196
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.260 
fewer journeys up and down the
network and therefore you save

197
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.490 
power assuming obviously that these
data processors here or servers are good

198
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:26.090 
and comparable in efficiency to
the ones in the central cloud.

199
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.210 
But you can take that into account if
they're not in your models with it.

200
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.920 
One of the key points is how good
is your computing hardware.

201
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.940 
So if the computing hardware is very
energy proportional, that means

202
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.140 
that the more load the more processing you
demand the power consumption increases linearly,

203
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:48.420 
then it turns out that it is a
very good idea to bring the

204
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.550 
processing closer to the user
because if you make more copies,

205
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.550 
you're not consuming more. The
more processing you have the

206
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.030 
the power consumption increases
to the amount of processing.

207
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.850 
On the other hand, you may have
the current kind of servers

208
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.360 
where there is a large idle power and if
you have this large idle power then

209
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.100 
as soon as you switch the computer
or the server you may end

210
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.720 
up with anything between fifty
to eighty percent of the total

211
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.440 
power consumption. If you put a
very small load, you still may

212
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.720 
be consuming fifty percent
of the peak power

213
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.640 
in which case it is not a good
idea to have them everywhere

214
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.900 
because you would be switching many of
them and maybe not using them to the

215
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:31.250 
full extent. So what we see here
is that if you have a situation

216
00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.750 
where it is a very linear profile,
then it is a very good idea

217
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:39.090 
to bring the processing all the way to
thee access fog, very close to the user.

218
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:45.480 
On the other extreme if you have
got very high idle powers and the

219
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.430 
power consumption does not increase a lot,
if you put more load on the service

220
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.320 
then it is better to consolidate
them and put them somewhere

221
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.920 
central in a
central cloud.

222
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.780 
Here is an example of virtualization.
Here is a network that

223
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.890 
covers a country for example. Here
are some virtual network requests.

224
00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.110 
So those are requests made by
enterprise enterprises for example

225
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.090 
or a smaller network operator,
that is a big network operator

226
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.360 
that operates the whole network
that runs over the country,

227
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:19.190 
that are small operators, there
are enterprises that want a

228
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.760 
network with this topology that connects
a string of their enterprise sites

229
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.920 
two of the enterprise sites here and
three here in these given topologies

230
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.330 
and at each node they don't want
only just a link a communication

231
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.240 
link between the two nodes but
also among a certain amount

232
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.260 
of processing in each node. And
therefore the act of moving

233
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.090 
this virtual network request to
a real network where the real

234
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.940 
network referred to as a
substrate network, this

235
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.300 
kind of translation from the
virtual network into the real

236
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.450 
network the substrate network is
referred to as embedding. So

237
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.920 
this is one way to embed the red
request this is another way

238
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.300 
to embed the blue request and this
is a potential way to embed

239
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.280 
the green request. As you can see
there will be many many choices

240
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:11.170 
in which you can do this embedding
and the request may be such

241
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:15.080 
that one node is in a given city because
this is where your headquarter is,

242
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.580 
we do not care where the other
two are or maybe you actually

243
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.720 
want them to be in particular
cities. Nevertheless there are

244
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.530 
many combinations in which you
can do this. The question is

245
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.130 
can we do it in a way that is
energy efficient. So this is here

246
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.840 
a network that has got a core
network, a kind of a fiber

247
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.710 
and some data centers processing
and we're doing the embedding.

248
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:44.080 
So for example this red request is
embedded here, here and here and it looks

249
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.050 
like that topology. The blue here
is an embedded in this node,

250
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.380 
in this node and in this node
and are connected in this way.

251
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:57.100 
So you get the delta. And if we do
this with energy efficiency in mind

252
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.710 
where you can get energy efficiency
improvements up to sixty

253
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.250 
percent compared to a case where
you just do the embedding

254
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.480 
in a way that this simply minimizes
at the total cost of the network.

255
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:13.610 
I'll talk a little bit about
a test-bed implementation. So

256
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:20.250 
this is a our lab where we have here a
a number of nodes, so three core nodes,

257
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.500 
each capable of doing hundred
gigabits per second per wavelength,

258
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.100 
about four hundred kilometers of
fiber. So this can be distributed

259
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.490 
to represent three cities. We have
got a number of servers here

260
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.860 
that can represent edge processing
so you may start with a video, we

261
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.240 
send it to one of these edge
processing and then maybe to another

262
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.690 
one and to a third one and then you
take it to a network, you enter a node

263
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.080 
and you go through other nodes
and you come at this end and

264
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.880 
you do again edge processing and
maybe you display a video somewhere.

265
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.220 
There are a number of references
in each of the slides for

266
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.140 
those who are interested in going
into a little bit more detail.

267
00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:02.640 
So here is an example where we have got
some vehicular networks, we have got

268
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:08.840 
people with devices, residential and
so on and we do have processing

269
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.530 
cells very close to the edge of
the network. We have got our

270
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.240 
core network and also data centers. We
implement many of the algorithms on

271
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.640 
FPGA network, field-programmable
gate arrays,

272
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.550 
and here is an example where
you company process the video

273
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.900 
at the edge of the network. You
come and you enter and you go

274
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.240 
through a core network and then
you come at this other end and

275
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.560 
maybe you do processing here again and
end up with to some user devices.

276
00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.810 
Now many times you have congestion
and therefore there may

277
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.040 
be a huge number of vehicles
attached to a certain number of

278
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.320 
towers or communicating with a
certain number of towers. What

279
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.820 
we can do here is we can actually
connect those said processing

280
00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.680 
cells to each other via the network,
either the access network

281
00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.090 
or the core network so that they
appear very close to each

282
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.970 
other. In other words we're able
to move the processing to where

283
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.430 
the demand is, not only move
bandwidths to where demand is but

284
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.350 
move processing to
where demand is.

285
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:13.010 
And there here is a kind of a
fuller implementation where we

286
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.690 
have the core network, we have
got the the access network, we

287
00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.510 
have got the service
and we are able to

288
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.580 
move processing and also try to satisfy
the demands, the routing demands.

289
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.980 
A lot of the activities that were
done within the GreenTouch

290
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.100 
and that we followed afterwards
ourselves were captured in

291
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.790 
the IEEE sustainable ICT initiative.
The initiative initiatives

292
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.390 
in IEEE. IEEE has got societies
like the communication society,

293
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:43.460 
the vehicular technology society
etcetera. And then initiatives are

294
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:49.140 
the ways in which the IEEE tries to
capture new and upcoming trends

295
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.640 
to ensure a currency but also to
introduce new products and services.

296
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.990 
So the mission of this IEEE
sustainable ICT initiative is

297
00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.640 
to build a holistic approach to
sustainability by incorporating

298
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.310 
green metrics throughout IEEE
domains. Now the actions that

299
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.560 
we have is to introduce standards in sustainability
conferences, publications and education.

300
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.690 
So for example we have
introduced nine standards.

301
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.110 
Starting from about twenty
seventeen we have a sustainable

302
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:23.360 
ICT summit and we had two versions
of that. We introduced or helped

303
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.380 
to introduce the IEEE transactions on
green communications and networking

304
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.510 
that there is
an ongoing

305
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.710 
work to introduce an IEEE magazine
on sustainability and ICT

306
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.370 
and we introduce a number
of short courses.

307
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.660 
So here are some standards that
are based on this work and

308
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.530 
I'll just go through them briefly. They
go from nineteen twenty two point one

309
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.740 
to nineteen twenty nine point one.
Each of those would be a family of

310
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:53.720 
standards. So the first one here
looks at anticipated emissions

311
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.860 
and virtual machine migration. This
is the idea that I mentioned

312
00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.470 
about migrating the processing
to where the sun is shining

313
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.520 
or maybe the wind is blowing in a way
that minimizes your carbon footprint.

314
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.610 
This is a standard to look at
near real time emissions and

315
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.740 
calculate the impact. So generally
people look at the fuel mix

316
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.400 
that was used to generate electricity
and say that this amount

317
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.070 
of power that you're using now has
actually got a carbon footprint

318
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.560 
of a certain amount. But that mix
changes with time and this

319
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.620 
is a standard that measures helps us and
advised the way in which we measure

320
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.100 
the energy mixture at any given
point and therefore determine

321
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.530 
the exact carbon
footprint.

322
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:42.360 
Energy efficient communications
and processing signal waveforms

323
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.810 
this looks at the best way in
which we can generate wireless

324
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.300 
signals in a way that

325
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.270 
improves their energy efficiency.
Nineteen twenty four point one looks

326
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:58.260 
at power proportional digital
architecture. So this is what I

327
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.670 
mentioned about having high idle power
usually. So the question here was

328
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.460 
can we do computing whereby the
power consumption increases

329
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.330 
linearly with the load the CPU
cycles that you actually have and

330
00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.350 
there are methods that are introducing
this standard and standardized that

331
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.890 
try to achieve that. Dynamic
line rate - I talked about this.

332
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:24.000 
This is using the correct combination
of line rates to go exactly fit

333
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:28.990 
and the amount of data that you need to
transmit to minimize power consumption.

334
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.890 
Energy efficient big data processing
try to send knowledge and not

335
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.830 
data and that way you minimize pot
consumption this looks at virtualizing

336
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.930 
the data centers and the networks
that interconnect them which

337
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:46.390 
is one area I just talked about.
Here we look at the energy

338
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.340 
efficiency of virtual machines
placement. Where do we place

339
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.420 
virtual machines in a way that minimizes
support consumption and this is

340
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.530 
standardizes nineteen twenty
nine dot one, standardizes the

341
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:02.270 
way in which we can do energy
efficient content distribution.

342
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:08.900 
I'll talk about the SMARTer2030
report very briefly.

343
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:15.490 
This was a report that was produced by GeSI,
the Global enabling Sustainability Initiative.

344
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:20.780 
Now there were different versions
of this report from

345
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.060 
two thousand and eight

346
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.670 
and then the last one was
twenty fifteen - twenty sixteen,

347
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:33.610 
looking at twenty thirty. And essentially
this looks at a different angle which is

348
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:38.290 
we can reduce the carbon
footprint of networks and maybe the

349
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.680 
ICT in general and ICT
totally data centres networks

350
00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.590 
peripheral devices and so on. It may
represent two to three percent

351
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.640 
of the world power consumption
and the carbon footprint. But

352
00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.670 
but do they have a
favorable impact and this

353
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.440 
work here looks at the
favorable impact that

354
00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.960 
ICT can have in other areas. In
transport, in manufacturing and so on

355
00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:05.020 
by making processes more efficient.
And effectively the latest

356
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.890 
of those figures shows that ICT
has got the ability to reduce the

357
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.940 
global carbon footprint by an
amount that is roughly about mine

358
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.370 
or almost ten times its own carbon
footprint. So started with

359
00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:23.240 
an estimate in two thousand and eight that
the ICT can actually make the world

360
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.360 
better reduce the carbon footprint
of many sectors by an amount

361
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.350 
that is five times its own carbon
footprint, this improved to seven

362
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.160 
and now the current estimate is
about ten. And the improvements

363
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.010 
here are because one we're making the
networks themselves more energy efficient

364
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.730 
and two because we're introducing
new technologies in ICT

365
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.790 
that enable us to access many more
sectors and try hopefully to make them

366
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:53.260 
more energy efficient. So here again this
is from the SMARTer 2030 report

367
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.740 
is a kind of reflection
on the number of areas

368
00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.250 
in mobility, in manufacturing, in
agriculture, in buildings, in

369
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.980 
energy and the total ICT enabled
savings which is a reflection

370
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.020 
of the figure that I have shown
before. So hopefully this would

371
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.840 
have given you an idea about the
carbon footprint of ICT networks.

372
00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.490 
It is about two to three percent
of the world carbon footprint,

373
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.410 
a comparable amount of energy
consumption. It is growing at

374
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.700 
thirty to forty percent per year.
We need to do something about

375
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.870 
it but there are many measures
that are being done. There are

376
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.540 
standards that are being introduced
and also there are many

377
00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.170 
technologies that hopefully
we'll talk about more

378
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.760 
in a future communication. So thank
you very much for this and I hope

379
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.450 
we can communicate. My email is at
the very beginning and please

380
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:48.010 
send me an email if you're interested
in looking at this further.

381
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.090 
Thank you very much.

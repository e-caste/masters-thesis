00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.810 
Welcome to knowledge graphs.
This is lecture number three

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.520 
queriying rdfs with SPARL. As always
we start with a lecture overview.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.980 
First of all we are asking ourselves
how can we query rdf and rdfs data

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.790 
and this is the point where SPARQL
as a query language comes into play.

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.590 
Usually what we are asking here or what
we are querying are generally available

6
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
popular database such as for
example dbpedia and wikidata.

7
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.070 
And all our examples are based here on
these two popular knowledge graphs.

8
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.010 
And then we will continue with
the complex queries with SPARQL

9
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.400 
and then we will have a bit more
complex SPARQL queries and to

10
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.920 
make things more complicated we
will continue with SPARQL

11
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
subqueries and
property parts.

12
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.230 
So now you know all about SPARQL
but what we haven't answered

13
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.000 
so far is how the stuff is really
stored in the end. And this

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.510 
is where we're going to
talk about rdf data bases.

15
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.120 
And after that of course you might
see that SPARQL is actually

16
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.780 
much more than only a plain query
language because there are

17
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.090 
other purposes that
SPARQL can be used for.

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.920 
So this is the content of this SPARQL
lecture. Let's start with how

19
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.720 
to query rdfs.

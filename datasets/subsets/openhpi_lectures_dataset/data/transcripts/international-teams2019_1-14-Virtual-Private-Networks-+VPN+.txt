00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.340 
Hello. So, today we have Christian
Willems here, Christian is

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.840 
the Chief Information Security Officer
of the Hasso Plattner Institute.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.090 
Right. And he will be talking
about virtual private networks

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.610 
and why we need them in the
area of remote teamwork.

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.570 
Yeah. thank you Tom you've
been talking about

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.460 
collaboration via the internet
and also about file sharing

7
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.050 
and stuff and i will shortly
remind you that sharing

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.000 
resources over the Internet like
files is inherently insecure!

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.470 
For example if you share files
via a cloud provider, lets say

10
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.280 
Dropbox, or Google Drive
or something like that,

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
you have to be aware that the
cloud provider always can access

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.160 
the data if he would
like to act malicious.

13
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.720 
You also have to trust him
that that he securely

14
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.190 
isolates your data from
the data of other

15
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.650 
users on that project. What
you could do is to encrypt

16
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.250 
all the files that you store in
that cloud storage, but that's

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.090 
really a little bit cumbersome,
especially if you

18
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.150 
want to share the data with
others. ...So everybody would

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.950 
need the credentials....You
need the same

20
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.750 
encryption stuff,
it's hard to

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.170 
changes, for example, comparing
files because they are always

22
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.710 
in that encrypted container.
It's a little bit difficult.

23
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
The same actually applies for
for sharing on self-hosted

24
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.510 
public services, for example,
if you have a local file

25
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.780 
server in your company network
and say "ok, we all always

26
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.940 
store the files there", or let's
say take a SharePoint or something

27
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.780 
like that. If we expose
that to the Internet,

28
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.730 
well, of course, there is
authentication you need to register

29
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.140 
with password or smart card
or something like that.

30
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.330 
But if it's on the Internet, in
principle, everybody could have

31
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.930 
access and could try
to sneak in somehow.

32
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.880 
Bypass authentication, steal
credentials, things like that.

33
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.710 
And, generally, we must say
transmitting over the Internet,

34
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.810 
is inherently dangerous, because
the internet is an open network,

35
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.030 
everybody can take part, and the
Internet is a network of networks.

36
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.660 
That's what defines the
term Internet and

37
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.620 
in consequence when you send
data over the Internet,

38
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.860 
it always passes, as
you can see here

39
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.440 
in the visualisation,
it always passes

40
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.220 
systems of others. You never
have a direct connection

41
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.240 
between two communication
peers.,let's say your

42
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.690 
remote workplace at home and the
server in your company that

43
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.540 
you want to access. The data
always passes systems that you

44
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.140 
cannot control ... You also don't
know which system these are? ...

45
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.860 
Right, right, completely right you
don't know which systems. It's

46
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.960 
not transparent. Yeah, so
you have to do something

47
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.470 
to protect that data
to ensure that you

48
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.980 
don't miss confidentiality
requirements, or that

49
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.920 
you don't lose the integrity,
someone can manipulate files

50
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.580 
while they are on transport
and that's what VPN are

51
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.240 
there for. Let's first have a
look at how data transfer

52
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.010 
without VPN and over the Internet
works. See, as i just said, there's

53
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.090 
a remote worker and you have
a connection to your office

54
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.680 
site to a server there. The
data goes over the Internet,

55
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.080 
very simplified. In
general, an attacker can

56
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.720 
sit somewhere, in the internet
on such an intermediate

57
00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.530 
system, and intercept your data.
It's not encrypted, it's

58
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.280 
readable for everyone. If you have
the chance to intercept the

59
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.030 
data somehow, and there are
numerous ways to do that,

60
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.610 
you can read them, you can steal
them, you can manipulate

61
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.820 
them. As the attacker.
What VPN do there,

62
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.040 
virtual private networks are a
client-server system, so there

63
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.150 
is this the server side that
is on your office site

64
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.330 
and the client software is on
your local laptop or ipad or

65
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.710 
something. They both
share a common secret,

66
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.600 
a key, an encryption key and
when you start communicating,

67
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.560 
you first a build up a
so called VPN tunnel

68
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.960 
from the remote worker to the office
site. You can really imagine

69
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.340 
that a as a tunnel... But
it's completely software

70
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.690 
you don't need to build any extra
cable system.... No, there's no

71
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.720 
dedicated connection,
which would

72
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.530 
also be possible to to have
a secure line, but it's

73
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.220 
a virtual encrypted tunnel
through the internet

74
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.940 
and what's inside this tunnel,
where the data is transmitted,

75
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.090 
none of the intermediate
systems that your data passes

76
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.400 
can decrypt because encryption
happens always on the endpoints.

77
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.640 
On the client and on the server,
encryption and decryption.

78
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.400 
So all the data you send
through that tunnel

79
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.780 
is securely protected and the
attacker, that we've seen

80
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.070 
last, cannot have a look
inside that tunnel.

81
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.820 
So that's basically how
VPNs work in general.

82
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.960 
So, that's a secure way to
connect a remote workplace

83
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.830 
to the local area network, to
the network that you have

84
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.950 
in the company site, in
the office site. It's

85
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.300 
really like you have access
to all the resources that

86
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.140 
you would have to if you were
sitting in the office: file

87
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.410 
shares, printers, internal network
services, like, for example,

88
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.720 
communication tools that you
have on site, on premise

89
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.730 
and things like that and everything
is usable like you were

90
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:25.230 
in the office. What
I want to point

91
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.430 
out is that VPN like this are
not to be confused with

92
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.510 
so called VPN-Proxies. Thats a
what many people know when they

93
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.090 
hear the term VPN, these
VPN-proxies are mainly used

94
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.870 
for anonymization, like when
you surf on the internet

95
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.800 
and for example you want to bypass
location based restrictions

96
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.590 
you might know that,
if you want to watch

97
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.060 
Netflix in the US, like the
US programme of Netflix

98
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.840 
you need to be in the US, but
there are ways, you can

99
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.320 
dial into such a VPN-Proxy
server that is in US and

100
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.750 
then Netflix thinks your
computer is in the

101
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.100 
US, because Netflix can only see
the VPN endpoint, cannot really

102
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.420 
know who you are and
where you are and

103
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.440 
would then offer you the
US program. The same is

104
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.240 
useful if you want to use Facebook
in China, for example...

105
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.970 
Or if you want to check if
your website works...

106
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.350 
from somewhere else, well yeah
that's what we just did

107
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.540 
recently, right.... So it's a legal
thing? It's not you know?...

108
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:50.950 
It's a totally legal thing that is not a problem,
but it can be used for for tweaking restrictions.

109
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.180 
... Sometimes, it's in a
grey zone.... Yeah right

110
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.970 
No, in general it's... like
anonymization on the internet

111
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.670 
is a good thing. There's
no need that everybody

112
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.560 
whose services you use, knows
where you are, and who

113
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.760 
you are. So at least
your technical details

114
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.690 
are shaded, let's say the IP address
is not yours that your computer

115
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.810 
actually has, and also the location
derived from the IP address

116
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.670 
is not not to
be catched.

117
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.100 
Summing up, it's basically
tunneling all the internet access

118
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.990 
through a commercial
VPN provider

119
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:40.470 
and that's a different thing
it's not suitable for

120
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.830 
extending a local network
as explained before.

121
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.950 
How to do that, the office
VPN, the remote VPN,

122
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.320 
it's like solutions come
in very different shapes

123
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.020 
and sizes. Let's say what
most of us know are these

124
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.670 
home WiFi routers and
stuff like that,

125
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.460 
most of them come with VPN
capabilities, can act as

126
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:10.150 
VPN client or as VPN server, to
be able to connect your home

127
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.830 
network to a company network or
to connect to home networks

128
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.280 
things like that. So they
have that built in,

129
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.530 
just need to be configured,
which is not that complicated.

130
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.880 
... But you need to know what you do
... yeah, yeah... it should be done

131
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.990 
by someone who is a professional? ...
Not necessarily, I think there are

132
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.060 
a lot of a tutorials on
youtube that explain

133
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.520 
fairly well enough
how to do that.

134
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.390 
Yeah, then most operating
systems include VPN clients

135
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.440 
so Windows does it, and MacOS,
does it, and Linux does it. They

136
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.100 
all have basic VPN client
capabilities on board.

137
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.070 
Then there is a things like
openVPN that we at HPI

138
00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.940 
use quite extensively for
accessing isolated networks.

139
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.740 
This is an open source
solution? Free of cost,

140
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.580 
clients for the different
operating systems are available

141
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:14.660 
and free of cost. But
at that point you

142
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.310 
really need to know what you
do and you need a specialist

143
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.260 
to install it and maintain it,
because they also have to

144
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.530 
maintain a certificate
authority that generates

145
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:31.270 
the cryptographic encryption
basics that you need

146
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.050 
for the secure logins.
It's free, but it's

147
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:40.610 
... not trivial ... right
and then there is a vast

148
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.430 
number of commercial
products even appliances.

149
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.710 
You can buy a VPN in a box, just
like you see on the screen.

150
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.960 
You buy a box, plug
it in your network,

151
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.340 
connect it to your router, connect
it to the internal network,

152
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.670 
a little bit of configuration,
and there you go.

153
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.650 
These also range from solutions
for small and medium

154
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:09.710 
enterprises to enterprise scale
appliances where you have

155
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.330 
ten thousands of possible client
connections ... That probably

156
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.230 
also differs in the price? ...
Definitely and in the complexity

157
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.110 
of configuring and maintaining
it, right. That's basically it.

158
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.460 
Thank you Christian ... You're
welcome. As always we would

159
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:32.020 
like you to contribute and if
you have any experience with

160
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.860 
any of these tools that we
presented, we are really happy to

161
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.720

00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.110 
In this video we look in more details about why we should care about the interaction

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.990 
of digitalisation and climate change.

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.190 
Simply put digitalisation transforms many areas in our society.

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.110 
Today it affects every single one of us in private, in business,

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.720 
and also it transforms our society as a whole

6
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.820 
already for many years and we expect for many more years to come.

7
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.730 
Due to its extensive impact, some call the digital transformation also a digital

8
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
revolution.

9
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.670 
And on the other hand, we have the climate change of which we

10
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.740 
have probably heard about. So similar to digitalisation that

11
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.320 
climate change affects not only some of us or some parts of the society,

12
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.120 
it affects everyone on this planet.

13
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.190 
It's one of the biggest challenges for us and the generations to come,

14
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.810 
so calling it a challenge might maybe a little bit be too optimistic, because in fact

15
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
if we fail at this challenge climate change might be a threat

16
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.660 
to our very own existence.

17
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.920 
In the Paris Agreement 2015, our leaders

18
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.380 
were agreeing that this is an emergency. So the goal is

19
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.700 
as agreed in the Paris Agreement to keep the increase of the

20
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.760 
global average temperature well below two degrees

21
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.730 
better one point five degrees. If this goal is met our existence

22
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.150 
is not at risk otherwise probably. There is not too much room

23
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.760 
for negotiations because with physics and nature it's not easy to negotiate.

24
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.700 
This Paris Agreement has been consulted or based on the recommendations

25
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.290 
of the scientists at the IPCC- the Intergovernmental Panel on

26
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.880 
Climate Change so it's based on a broad group of scientists

27
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.740 
all around the world.

28
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.350 
Let's take this

29
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.930 
policy in a personal translation, so if you look at ourselves

30
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.170 
in the status quo you would have the target of two tonnes of co two

31
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.110 
per year that every one of us could or should emit if you want to have the

32
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.950 
goal met of two degrees or better one point five degrees in the long run

33
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.590 
according to the Paris Agreement. The status quo is that every

34
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.020 
one of us in an average actually emits ten tonnes of co two.

35
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.830 
So we have to come from our status quo from the ten tonnes

36
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.240 
of co two actually to a consumption of two tonnes of co two per year.

37
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.950 
If you go from this personal perspective to a national perspective

38
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.280 
and take Germany for instance and if you translate this on this national level

39
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.790 
then Germany has to be net neutral by already

40
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.750 
two thousand thirty or two thousand thirty five, so in the next ten

41
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.990 
to fifteen years Germany has to be net neutral as well. So it's

42
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.330 
a challenge for everyone of us on a personal level and on a

43
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.500 
policy level.

44
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.950 
So digitalisation and

45
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.370 
climate change are the most important topics. That's the main

46
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.130 
message and we have to combine them, we have to think them together.

47
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.350 
They are not often

48
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.770 
taken like this. In many discussions they are seen as

49
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.120 
two topics that are kind of existing next to each other, but

50
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.070 
not very close and that's the goal of this course. Let's combine

51
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.030 
them. let's think them together and actually do sustainable

52
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.440 
software engineering.

53
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.360 
We're not the only ones thinking about this. So many groups

54
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.550 
in our society are uprising the number of groups is growing from

55
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.260 
the science as mentioned here on the bottom right but also

56
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.880 
on the national level like in China they are talking about

57
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.020 
this combination. Also the Bitcom,

58
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.840 
as the German largest organization representing the digital sector

59
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.850 
and publishing studies about about this combination topic and also

60
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.430 
Bits and Baueme as a quite popular movement meanwhile

61
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.570 
about the digitalisation and sustainability.

62
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.260 
Let's look for more reasons why this is important and there

63
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.090 
are some very obvious examples like the block chain at which

64
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.930 
we should have a look.

65
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.440 
Because it's important to always look at two sides of the coins

66
00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.290 
and with block-chain on the one side you see big promises because block-chain promises

67
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.620 
to remove the intermediary in transaction.

68
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.120 
If you look at bitcoin for instance for financial transactions, you could

69
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.110 
remove banks using it. So you only have the receiver and the sender

70
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.810 
of money. That's the big promise of block-chain or bitcoin and

71
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.520 
on the other side of the coin, you have a massive energy and

72
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.080 
therefore co two footprint. And if you look at this other side

73
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.350 
of the coin you see that it is so much energy footprint that it's questionable

74
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.940 
if bitcoin is actually at the bottom line actually good.

75
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.910 
And when you look at this energy consumption, then you actually see that it's

76
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.130 
quite recently skyrocketing. It is so much that you can even

77
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.150 
supply countries. In Europe with this amount of energy consumption

78
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.770 
more precisely you could cover about a third of Germany with

79
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.970 
the energy consumption of bitcoin and you can cover even half of Italy

80
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.470 
and United Kingdom with this energy consumption. So it's

81
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.590 
massive and it should question or you should rise the question

82
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.630 
if the overall benefit of bitcoin is then actually positive, if you

83
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.140 
take in account the two sides of the coin.

84
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.560 
As a second example, let's add hardware to software.

85
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.380 
Let's take a look at the example of ebooks

86
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.050 
and e-book readers. On the one side of the coin they come with promises again.

87
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.420 
They they also allow you to easily bring your books of course

88
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.010 
when you're travelling for instance, and quite a lot in a little device

89
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.870 
but on the other hand there's also a big co two consumption that comes with

90
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.700 
ebooks, and this is interesting to have a look at. So a

91
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.920 
e-book requires just for the protection of one device about

92
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.460 
fifteen kilograms of raw materials including rare earth metals,

93
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.420 
three hundred litres of water and one hundred and seven kilograms of co two.

94
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.330 
So that's the other side of the coin that this e-book reader

95
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.990 
comes at a cost of resource consumption and that is before

96
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.220 
the usage time. So even before you read your first book, there

97
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.070 
has been invested quite a bit of resources

98
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.370 
that you see in the graph that is the so called great energy before you even

99
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.840 
can read your first book.

100
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.240 
Then if you look at the graph of the e-book reader for any

101
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.140 
new book you download and read the graph is not rising too much.

102
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.710 
Because the co two footprint is not as big for every new book

103
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.750 
compared to the paper book there the co two footprint is higher

104
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.950 
because the production and the resource consumption for every

105
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.010 
paper book is higher.

106
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.170 
At some point you see that you see the crossing because the e-book reader

107
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.960 
is from a footprint point of view more beneficial ecologically,

108
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.180 
when you read at least thirty to sixty books. If you read less,

109
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.810 
then it's ecologically more

110
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.510 
better to read the paper books. So

111
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.990 
the message is if you read

112
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.170 
less than thirty to sixty books, then the e-book reader is really more

113
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.680 
ecologically better. Otherwise paper books are better. So

114
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:42.350 
if you look at examples like hardware and software combination, look at

115
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.190 
both sides of the coin, not only at the promises but in the features

116
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.100 
but also on the resource consumption, and they are also not

117
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:57.440 
only on the usage time or period of the life cycle, but also on how many

118
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.350 
resources had to be invested to actually produce these devices.

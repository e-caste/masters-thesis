1
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.559 
Now, let's talk about Internet surveillance.

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.099 
The Internet provides for today's society in integrative communication infrastructure

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.359 
and makes our world a global marketplace, nobody

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.315 
can imagine our modern life to work

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.899 
without the Internet. However, the Internet also also offers

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.089 
many ways to monitor people, to collect data about

7
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.950 
people's activities, about very personal data.

8
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.270 
We spoke also already about the health state and others.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.409 
Everyone leaves phrases on the Internet that others

10
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.870 
also undesirable ones can track, can track down and can

11
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.538 
evaluate. For example, emails, for example, the data

12
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.307 
in social networks, the browser profilers, browser cookies, web

13
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.889 
beacons, web cameras, IP addresses and many more.

14
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.340 
So, let's have a closer look to Email observations.

15
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.624 
Without special precautions, emails are sent and received in plain

16
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.215 
text. We discussed this already, the Internet

17
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.279 
protocols, the protocols, the application protocol

18
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.809 
for the email service sends emails

19
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.870 
and receive emails in plain text.

20
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.349 
But the question is who all has access to

21
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.769 
emails when underway from the sender to the receiver,

22
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.169 
who could monitor them, say email providers,

23
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.999 
since they have to store and they have to send emails, though, send those

24
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.530 
emails and if the emails are sent in plain text, they have access

25
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.019 
also to the content of emails.

26
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.053 
But not only the email providers, but anyone who has access to the registered

27
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.510 
computer or to the email account has access to the data.

28
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.488 
The operators of the Internet routers through which the email traffic is

29
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.260 
handled. They have access to the emails and the emails

30
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.219 
and the text to the content of an email at hackers who have taken

31
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.100 
over Internet routers. They have access to the emails.

32
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.610 
So in this sense, emails with

33
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.667 
a sender and receiver in the same country can also be

34
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.729 
transferred via foraging foreign routers,

35
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.729 
for example, via the US.

36
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.439 
If this enables a faster connexion, there is no guarantee that

37
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.558 
emails which are sent within a country are delivered

38
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.159 
within the country. So in this sense, the

39
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.159 
emails are something like postcards.

40
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.289 
Everyone who has access over the Internet has

41
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.019 
has also access to the context, to the content of an email.

42
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.121 
So everyone, even if the emails are sent to other

43
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.849 
countries, can access the emails.

44
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.849 
So large scale monitoring does not read all emails.

45
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.559 
What they do is emails are searched for specific words,

46
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.479 
for specific phrases in order to find, select or

47
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.880 
filter relevant emails.

48
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.252 
So for the security authorities, they look for something that are in connexion

49
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.819 
with a criminal activity.

50
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.159 
See, take for example, they look for phrases like passwords or others

51
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.120 
to get access to the passwords that are sent.

52
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.925 
So as a precaution to prevent this that third

53
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.959 
parties can seise the content of an email is to encrypt

54
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.969 
the email and see if there was a precaution

55
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.889 
that no one can manipulate an email under way or from the sender

56
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.949 
to the receiver is to sign an email.

57
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.489 
We discuss these techniques in this cause already with the encryption,

58
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.259 
the text, the the content can only be understood by

59
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.789 
the sender and the receiver.

60
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.230 
And the signature helps is as a kind of encryption or was

61
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.930 
it was a private, a key often user to

62
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.700 
guarantee integrity of an email.

63
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.239 
Some email providers include encryption with their service.

64
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.129 
So when you decide to do to take

65
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.959 
and provide for your email service, then

66
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.990 
you should look into service that provides.

67
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.509 
Is offering, but even

68
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.319 
if one provider provides encryption,

69
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.850 
that means to encrypt email before sending it over the Internet,

70
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.410 
but then the providers themselves could still read

71
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.343 
along the emails because this is they

72
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.970 
receive the email before they encrypted.

73
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.339 
Better way to prevent that the provider is able to see the content of the mail

74
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.619 
is to encrypt yourself.

75
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.019 
And there are systems in the case of email communication, it's for example,

76
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.599 
PXP or as Schepisi, we discussed such

77
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.669 
services already in other contact,

78
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.269 
even more difficult, the situation with social networks so people

79
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.040 
can also be monitored with the help of social networks,

80
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.260 
with the help of Facebook, with Twitter, with Google Plus and others.

81
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.480 
So many posts about everything happening to people

82
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.459 
every day. So it was our description, what they are doing, what they are interested

83
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.899 
in, with whom they spoke, with whom they

84
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.550 
meet, what they want to do.

85
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.440 
And all this information is available to

86
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.420 
operators, to the operators of the social network.

87
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.919 
It is it is available to friends

88
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.779 
or to members of the networks here as the friends are

89
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.189 
in quotation marks, also popular

90
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.185 
offers of log in with four other Internet services, for

91
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.699 
example, log in with Facebook or log in with Google.

92
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.060 
In this context, it is very convenient.

93
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.680 
It saves another registration or a new password, but

94
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.679 
it makes possible and it cannot be branded sits.

95
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.519 
The operator of the social network sees which other services

96
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.160 
you are using and when you add these other services are using.

97
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.879 
So there is a lot of information that can be received and

98
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.069 
can be received from your activity on social networks, analysing the

99
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.149 
content, but also analysing accessed data.

100
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.709 
Browsers produce profiles

101
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.309 
by means of your browser activity logs or by means

102
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.299 
of cookies so all the browsers can be used to get information

103
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.538 
about people so browsers save in the activity files.

104
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.310 
All the websites visited historic history of electronica

105
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.319 
or they help the user by storing that

106
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.517 
information to retrieve these websites more

107
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.829 
quickly. Even passwords are often stored in the browser.

108
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.930 
You get the offer. Should I remember your password and you should be careful

109
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.819 
to answer this offer was yes, because if you say yes, then

110
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.529 
your password is stored in the browser and anyone who has access

111
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.349 
to your browser has the consequence.

112
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.509 
Also access to your password.

113
00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:38.599 
By reading the history fire, you will know when the user

114
00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:43.309 
has called which pages and you will know how often

115
00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:48.260 
he or she does it and where he or she was locked on,

116
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.629 
for example, by means of the password manager.

117
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.869 
So this file features that we are designed

118
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.549 
to make it more comfortable for the user to serve in the Web and to

119
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:06.409 
the Web and to do some activities there and also

120
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:11.090 
have the backside set from this data profile.

121
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.769 
It can be produced.

122
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.000 
And this profiler's opens an opportunity for a tiger

123
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.644 
to look on under a false name and therefore to

124
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.273 
obtain passports to require

125
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.740 
ploughers access. So to prevent this as a precaution,

126
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.419 
Larry, you should delete history files.

127
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.950 
You should delete cookies from the browser traces

128
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.729 
when you finishing your activity on a browser.

129
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.149 
Another feature to collect information

130
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.849 
that can be used to profile a user.

131
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.169 
Our Web bacons counting pixels

132
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.919 
are tiny.

133
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.580 
So for the user, invisible one pixel

134
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.679 
one time is one pixel large pictures inserted on a website

135
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.924 
or in an email so nobody can see it.

136
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.539 
So it's invisible, but it gives information

137
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.469 
that can be as it can be investigated

138
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.259 
as soon as an email with such a so-called

139
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.650 
web bacon is opened.

140
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.980 
So image is loaded from the server and the sender of the email

141
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.029 
or its server knows that the email has been opened.

142
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.549 
So by means of such bacons, it can be controlled, it can be easily

143
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.929 
controlled. When a website is opened or followed

144
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.037 
from a from zero to where patients are used in online

145
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.970 
marketing, for example, for newsletters.

146
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.929 
So newsletters are distributed or offers for

147
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.990 
inviting you to use a new service.

148
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.555 
And in that, newsletters there are often such

149
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.319 
unmissable web beacons installed that gave

150
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.519 
information back to the sender offset marketing activity.

151
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.610 
So it is another form of reading confirmation.

152
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.980 
So the use of beacons on Web pages, the number of visits

153
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.509 
they charge, can be determined.

154
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.540 
The usage of these Web servers can be

155
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:44.059 
can be investigated to prevent this as

156
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.706 
a precaution. An email programme can block the loading

157
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.849 
of images of him and information.

158
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.919 
This blocking of images also blocks Zuch Web bacons

159
00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.169 
because this one one times, one pixel

160
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.809 
images. But of course, on the other side you has to pay that

161
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.210 
after its blocking of images.

162
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:16.299 
The image you cannot see images in that image

163
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.860 
to understand the functionality of this web bacons here.

164
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.599 
The idea if a customer goes to a shop and wants

165
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.609 
to see a page page, which includes

166
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:36.019 
such a beacon, then as a request is answered

167
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.230 
and the reply is a web page is delivered to the user.

168
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.029 
But this Web page includes a web bacon.

169
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.309 
So and the bacon. If the user want to see this Web page,

170
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.409 
then he needs the information about this web bacon.

171
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.700 
And this is requested from the server of this

172
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.009 
Analytica instance and the transparent

173
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.940 
pixels, which is nothing is sent back.

174
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.850 
And then here this is server

175
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.209 
knows that in that minute or in that second,

176
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.949 
the customer investigates and wants to see the

177
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.169 
Web page of the web shop.

178
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.150 
And of course, is data collected, the data collected to analyse

179
00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.019 
not only as the data from one customer, they can select

180
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:39.409 
and analyse the data from any customers to find out information

181
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.849 
about the interactivity of the Web shop and others.

182
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.569 
Let's discuss observations that's possible when you

183
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.320 
are using when your laptop or your

184
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.059 
iPad has a webcam, see webcams of calls enabled

185
00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.339 
many very useful functions.

186
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.919 
For that reason, they are so popular.

187
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.230 
They allow video chat.

188
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.753 
They allow video calling so that the people on the other side, they

189
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.344 
can see the person as a webcams and monitoring

190
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.329 
of their own house, for example, for seeing pets

191
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.209 
and check if everything is fine.

192
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.032 
But it is also possible that this data

193
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:33.320 
in the hand of a third party can be used to

194
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.000 
see what's going on in your house or other things so it can be used

195
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.859 
for spying out and monitoring your activity in your house.

196
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.110 
And what the attacker needs to be done is the attacker needs to

197
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.580 
hack this webcam and to

198
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.950 
become in the position to control the webcam functionality

199
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.480 
from another place so people could be

200
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.639 
monitored to buildings, houses, apartments by

201
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.610 
means of the webcam.

202
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.382 
When we speak about Internet surveillance, then all the IP

203
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.309 
addresses tell a lot about user.

204
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.858 
Even without browser, even without cookies, Internet movements

205
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.370 
can be traced by means of IP addresses.

206
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.629 
What's the technical reasons the tech has access to computers

207
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.799 
or the access to a smartphone?

208
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.960 
Why has the Internet so domain name?

209
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.309 
The IP address, domain name or IP address is used

210
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.240 
when one is visiting a website.

211
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:52.100 
The own IP address must be sent

212
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.396 
simply that the answer can be sent back to the correct

213
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.779 
computer. So a service provider Internet

214
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.849 
needs to know the IP address from which request

215
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.799 
was sent to be able to send back as the answer

216
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.830 
to this request.

217
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.090 
But what the service provider can do, he can store IP addresses.

218
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.610 
He can store this, for example, to find out a

219
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:29.539 
person from that Web browser come several times

220
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.340 
to the service or to analyse the time when the

221
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.970 
customers send request to the website.

222
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.039 
So recurring visits are recognised in this way, even

223
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:48.170 
without user login, even without registering simply

224
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.928 
by this technical mechanism that the that the server

225
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.649 
needs to know the IP address for every request, even

226
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.860 
without log in or register it,

227
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.309 
there are the old IP Internet

228
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.180 
protocols, the IP before when one Xeros

229
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.307 
with this old IP for protocol for websites.

230
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.168 
It's not easy to recognise such movements and assign them to a

231
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:24.079 
user because of the lack of addresses.

232
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.069 
So different users can come from

233
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.559 
typically sitting at home can use the same IP address.

234
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.390 
Auerswald, then many Internet service providers,

235
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.789 
they simply do not have enough IP addresses so that dynamically

236
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.559 
they hand over an IP address to users that just

237
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.912 
in that moment wants to go to the Internet later

238
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.269 
on. The same IP address can give it to another user.

239
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.859 
So with this old protocol, it's more tricky and more difficult to find

240
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.500 
out who exactly came with an address.

241
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:09.019 
The router redirects the response of this IP address

242
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.779 
to the correct user in the home network.

243
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.339 
So is there is a mechanism that remembers

244
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.900 
on side of the Internet service provider, this mechanism

245
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.825 
is in that computation that remembers what IP

246
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.619 
address was given to which user, though, and in

247
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.650 
which moment. Though if there is an answer, I come back.

248
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.100 
This router can redirect.

249
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:42.109 
See the answer to the correct

250
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:47.089 
user. The users themselves cannot be clearly

251
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:51.529 
identified from the outside world is the

252
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.119 
only one who is able to do this is the Internet service

253
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.120 
provider.

254
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.777 
And the reason why is, is is is this fracking is more

255
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.550 
difficult with this old IP for programme is that IP

256
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.539 
for has only a limited number of IP addresses

257
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.339 
which are already exhausted.

258
00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:19.179 
So the service provider needs to work

259
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.009 
with this IP addresses very carefully.

260
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.990 
And for example, appliances just describe mechanisms of

261
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.390 
dynamic assignment of such a.

262
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.339 
So is this dynamic IP address.

263
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.419 
This IP addresses are more difficult to

264
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.799 
track changes at specific time.

265
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.780 
Mobiles, for example, every 24 hours are involved.

266
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.059 
But the current successor protocol to IP for

267
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.319 
that's IPV six IP will become more and more carefully.

268
00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:02.229 
The main advantage is that there is an inexhaustible

269
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.789 
supply of IP addresses.

270
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.130 
The IP addresses have 32 bits of 32 bits long

271
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.210 
see IP six addresses are four times longer.

272
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:18.689 
They are 128 bits long and so two to the 128

273
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.640 
different IP addresses. IP addresses are possible.

274
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.170 
So for all this application in the Internet of Things, this a new

275
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:27.809 
protocol is needed.

276
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:33.579 
So it's no more a problem to assign each

277
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.049 
device and own IP address the computers, the laptops

278
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.489 
or smartphones or household applying refrigeration, washing machines

279
00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.900 
and others sends out cards. And so all these devices can get

280
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:52.059 
an own IP address which make it more efficient

281
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.489 
routine. So that's no competition therefore necessary, no remembering

282
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.220 
in which moment an IP address IP address was used by what?

283
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.000 
A customer. So it becomes much more efficient to

284
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.140 
this information. It's increasing the time.

285
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.330 
The efficiency of home routers are no longer necessary,

286
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.619 
but the outer configuration procedures such as the CCP

287
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.719 
are redundant. It's more easy to to mobily

288
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:34.029 
use the Internet, but if

289
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:38.519 
we look to security aspects, then all

290
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.609 
of this improved a lot. With April 6th, for example, there is

291
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.650 
an encryption done on the level of IP and the level of

292
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.680 
data crumb's which are transported through the Internet.

293
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.636 
So this security mechanisms are permanently integrated

294
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.990 
in the protocol in IP for you has to

295
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.779 
activate individually mobile IP.

296
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:12.759 
It's based on this and much easier on this new protocol

297
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.200 
IP you can fix. But but see, the Internet movements

298
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.849 
can be assigned directly to a device to a

299
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.540 
user where our own IP addresses.

300
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.891 
So this mechanism is dynamic.

301
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.219 
IP address, which was considered a security measure,

302
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.561 
is not really a security measure because the provider knows

303
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:43.210 
this assignment here with IP with six one needs additional

304
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.979 
security measures. It's much more secure from nature, from the standard,

305
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.020 
but they are also available anonymization, anonymization, factors and nuzzles.

306
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:59.369 
But Internet surveillance is not only done by companies,

307
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:04.560 
by tools that advisement, it's not only interesting for criminals,

308
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.569 
but it's also interesting for Ellerton Intelligence Services,

309
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.910 
a famous Internet surveillance programme is Sprinzen Prison,

310
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.269 
which is a system from us and shows an example of surveillance

311
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.599 
in a really big way.

312
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.250 
So prison programme was launched in 2005 and it's run

313
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.499 
by NSA. Prison has access to nine of the largest

314
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:39.539 
Internet corporations and services, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook,

315
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.874 
Yahoo, Apple and so far it

316
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.510 
is the at least largest known Internet surveillance

317
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.579 
programme. Perhaps something similar is in place

318
00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:58.079 
in China. So this affects not only Americans,

319
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:03.510 
not only the activities of Americans, of US citizens

320
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.559 
in the Internet are is supervised,

321
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.020 
controlled by people around the world who use such

322
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.150 
services located in the US are

323
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.039 
tracked. So in 2013, it was made

324
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.150 
public by whistleblower Edward Snowden,

325
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.187 
who published a lot of information about a prison and

326
00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.979 
others. Why our media like The Guardian and The Washington Post.

327
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:43.229 
So it was this programme became public, the PRISM programme,

328
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:48.209 
and it became public, for example, that the prison allows NSA

329
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.886 
access to emails, to videos, to whois Chad, also voice

330
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:58.200 
over IP, to photos, to data TransFair and details information

331
00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.700 
from social networks.

332
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.499 
These data are scanned for specific information,

333
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.829 
particularly in the context of terrorism,

334
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.914 
but also life communication could be monitored

335
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.720 
by that programme. So you see the downside of

336
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.489 
the many, many possibilities the digital world is

337
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.980 
providing to us. There are downsides.

338
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:31.890 
It's possible that our activity, our personal data

339
00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.810 
can be accessed by third parties for different purposes.

340
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.819 
So we cannot control who has access to our data

341
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.130 
for that reason. Again, we have to deal very carefully

342
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.989 
with our data. And I gave a number of tips how to do this.

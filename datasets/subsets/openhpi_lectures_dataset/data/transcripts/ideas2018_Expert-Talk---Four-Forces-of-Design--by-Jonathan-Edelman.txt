Hi, I am Jonathan Edelman. I'm a
product and service designer, a

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.410 
consultant, a teacher of design and
design thinking and an expert

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.920 
in design theory and methodology.
In this segment i'm going

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.720 
to introduce you to
several key concepts

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.860 
that will improve your understanding
of design thinking and

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.060 
your design work. As
designers we make change.

7
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.720 
We take what's there and we make
changes, extending and combining,

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.230 
making things better for new
users and new circumstances.

9
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.690 
And this leads me to the
first law of design:

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.780 
All design is redesign. There's
virtually nothing so new that

11
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.970 
it didn't start out as something
else. But as change makers

12
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.490 
just what are the things we
can do to make change?

13
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.960 
The four forces of design is a
framework for redesigning anything

14
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.720 
from products to services to
systems. When you want to redesign

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.410 
something, the first step is to
apply one or more of the forces

16
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430 
and discover what changes.
Here are the four forces:

17
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.040 
You can change the material,
you can change the form,

18
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.650 
you can change the process and
you can change the reason.

19
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.620 
This is: who is it for, where,
when and to what end.

20
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.050 
For example, let's redesign
a parchment scroll.

21
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.400 
If we were to take a parchment
scroll and change the material

22
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.990 
we can make it out of paper and
we would also have to change

23
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.360 
the process that we
would use to make it.

24
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.450 
Processing wood fibre or
cotton is very different

25
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.430 
from processing animal skin. We
could also change the form

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.500 
by making the scroll into a book.
There are several things that

27
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.660 
are easier to do with a
book than with a scroll,

28
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.940 
like flipping between passage
at the beginning and at the

29
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.550 
end. Another way we could change
the form would be to make the

30
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.280 
book very big and it'd be easy to
read and could have big images

31
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.860 
or very small. And it'd be easy to
carry in our pockets or bags,

32
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.980 
which would be a change in the reason.
If we were to change the process

33
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.290 
we would consider different
hand writing techniques.

34
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.000 
We could also explore different
printing techniques both analog

35
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.020 
and digital. Finally, we
could change the reason

36
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.060 
for a book. Is it for a child, is
it for an older person? And each

37
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.810 
of these users have different
needs. What if it was to read

38
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.430 
the bath? Design thinking
focuses on the reason:

39
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.880 
who is it for and what are their
needs? What are the circumstances

40
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.690 
and to what end? And that's key
to human centered design.

41
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
So, those are the four forces of
design: You can change the material,

42
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.690 
the form, the process or the
reason: who it's for, where,

43
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.010 
when and why. Remember the
first law of design is:

44
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.000 
All design is redesign.

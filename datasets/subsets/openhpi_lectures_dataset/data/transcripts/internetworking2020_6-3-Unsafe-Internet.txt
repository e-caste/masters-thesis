00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.570 
In our openHPI course - A
Half Century of Internet

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.010 
we continue to discuss the
insecurity of our digital world

3
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.990 
When we speak about
internet security

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.800 
a view or an aspect which
is very important -

5
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.400 
the question of whether a network is
closed or whether a network is open?

6
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.030 
So, various security aspects
play an essential role and in

7
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.800 
the use of computer
networks and when we

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.220 
work and use a closed network then the
network is independent of other networks

9
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.380 
it cannot be accessed from outside,
so, one is the responsible, one

10
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.280 
have to take care of those networks
and one can access the data

11
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.380 
processed in this network and stored
in that network only by a physical

12
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.340 
access. The situation is completely different
in an open network like the internet

13
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.350 
In an open network, the
systems are connected

14
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.060 
two other systems via the
internet and in this way also

15
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.530 
from outside it's possible
to access the systems

16
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.840 
To access the memory, the storage,
and other systems from the outside,

17
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.740 
far away from an attacker who is
far away and uses the internet

18
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.790 
to connect to our network and to
expose a variety of threats

19
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.570 
There are different types of threat
and let's have a short look on it

20
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.650 
So, we have our sender, we have our
receiver, we have a connection

21
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.920 
via the internet and one
famous attack possibility

22
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.830 
is to disturb the connection
here to the receiver

23
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.880 
This is possible, for example, by means
of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack

24
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.920 
An attack that uses all the resources
that are available so that the

25
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.170 
authorized people, sender
have no more chance

26
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.110 
to connect to the receiver because
the receiver system is no more

27
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.660 
available. So, Denial of Service (DoS) is a
famous attack method against the availability

28
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.590 
Another attack method
is that a forger

29
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.560 
manipulates the communication between
the sender and the receiver

30
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.420 
and modifies the
authenticity

31
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.260 
So, that the forger tries to connect to
the receiver, tries to use resources

32
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.000 
on the receiver side

33
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.380 
under a falsified
identity

34
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.380 
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
uh falsified identity

35
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.380 
Forger, cyber attackers can manipulate
what's going on, what's transferred

36
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.140 
through this internet
connection

37
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.390 
It is easy because it's an open network,
it runs over a series of networks

38
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.890 
so, the attackers can see the
packets that are transported from

39
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.550 
the sender to the receiver, for example,
in such an intermediate systems

40
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.150 
and they can take out the package and
manipulate the package before they

41
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.930 
continue trying
to transfer it

42
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:06.200 
The attacker can eavesdrop on
the information that is sent

43
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.690 
here over the internet; so,
Loss of Confidentiality is

44
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.730 
another famous
attack method

45
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.160 
The loss of liability can be
reached, so, as you see

46
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.600 
there are very different types of threats
and when we speak about internet security

47
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.220 
it's not a single point we have to consider,
we have to consider the wide range

48
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.890 
of attacks, we have to discuss a wide
range of interests of the attackers,

49
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.030 
the motivations of the attackers
which differ very much

50
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.130 
so when we discuss about internet
security and when we do something

51
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.850 
against such attack, we have
exactly to define what point

52
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.390 
we want to secure and these are
the so-called security goals

53
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.990 
The security goals which
the user wanted to reach

54
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.100 
and I already showed this in
our course but I remind you

55
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.210 
to different such security
goals and I mention a threat

56
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.040 
that's against this goal. So, when we speak
about confidentiality as a security

57
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.830 
goal then a possible
threat is eavesdropping

58
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.710 
When we speak as a security
goal about authenticity

59
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.220 
then a possible threat is spoofing.
Spoofing is sending a message

60
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.410 
with a fake sender address, it's
possible on different levels

61
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.610 
and is in very dangerous
attack method

62
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.150 
When we speak about internet
security goal - integrity

63
00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.710 
then, the possible threat against integrity
is data manipulation and corruption

64
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.870 
during the transmission
through the open internet

65
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.490 
The liability was another
important security goal

66
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.840 
so, non-disputable, the legally
binding data transmission

67
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.580 
so attacker tries to disturb
this, for example, make some

68
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.220 
order and later on in such
a way that it cannot be

69
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.550 
disputable or the availability -
Denial of Service as I mentioned

70
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.590 
This is an attack against availability so
when we speak about security goals we

71
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.300 
have to consider the threats
against the security goals

72
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:54.940 
and then we can try to find measures
to prevent and to protect

73
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.980 
our systems for such
kind of attacks

74
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:07.720 
When we a discus attacks we have to
differentiate between the active attacks

75
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:15.580 
so here the attacker actively falsifies
content, manipulates the authenticity

76
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.740 
overuses network
services

77
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.430 
and makes other
active intervention

78
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.760 
and

79
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.970 
on the other side, there
are also passive attacks

80
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.820 
Here, the attacker eavesdrops on
communication, spies out on

81
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.900 
the network, records communication
and others for a later misuse

82
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.420 
Of course, the active attacks
are easier to detect than

83
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.240 
passive one; in the case of a passive
one, the attacker only eavesdrops or

84
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:59.860 
records communication but does not
actively interact with the packages

85
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.750 
and the communications
that is run

86
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:08.760 
So, you see internet is unsafe,
internet is an open system, so we

87
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.060 
will see that we as a
user are responsible

88
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:20.040 
to protect our systems, to protect our
information because in the open internet

89
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:25.810 
there are many people with a
bad motivation as they try to

90
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.180 
get access to our resources,
to our data, and others.

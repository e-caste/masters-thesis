00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.940 
Dear learners. Welcome back to our openHPI
course "Confidential Communication in the Internet".

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.770 
Today we're going to have a deeper look
to the rotor ciphers and the Enigma.

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.170 
Let's shortly look into
the historical background.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.330 
So we know that during the first world war
they started encrypting radio messages

5
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.020 
and in particular they used improved
versions of the Vigenère cipher.

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.400 
We already talked about the Vigenère
cipher which is a polyalphabetic

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.350 
cipher where each

8
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.050 
letter in the cipher takes
gets encrypted, or each letter

9
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.370 
from the plaintext gets encrypted with
a different letter from the alphabet

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.500 
and so they used different improved
versions from the Vigenère cipher to

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.320 
start to encrypt radio messages
in the first world war.

12
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.060 
Then around nineteen
eighteen they started to

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.940 
implement or they started to construct
the so called Rotor ciphers.

14
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.410 
so the router ciphers they are a
new kind of encryption device

15
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.580 
and they have been like simultaneously
invented by these four different inventors.

16
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.520 
Most probably all the different
armies and each one built their

17
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.620 
own but at least four
different inventors.

18
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.180 
The most famous one is the Enigma
encryption machine which

19
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.850 
was used by the German Wehrmacht, then
in particular in the second world war.

20
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.390 
Let's look into the function
principle and how those

21
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.330 
machines actually work. So the basic idea is
that it is an electro-mechanical construction.

22
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.060 
So it's not something that
we just do on paper,

23
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.260 
it's not something that we just do in, or
that we would today just doing computers.

24
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.070 
It's something that is actually
electro mechanically constructed.

25
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.770 
So the idea is we have a so called
rotor and the rotor helps

26
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.180 
to match one letter from the plaintext
to one letter from the ciphertext

27
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.850 
and then after we encrypted one letter
we move the rotor one step further

28
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.010 
and then encrypt the next letter
with a different letter from

29
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.270 
the secret alphabet. And then once
we have moved this first rotor

30
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.740 
full turn, so usually twenty six
rotations then we will start

31
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.330 
moving the next rotor. So the first rotor
starts moves twenty six rotations,

32
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.240 
after it has completed the second
rotor moves to one rotation

33
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.780 
and then the first rotor starts to
move twenty six rotations again

34
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.910 
and then the encryption of the
final ciphertext goes through

35
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.850 
all the different rotors and therefore
there's a huge variety in the

36
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.870 
encryption keys used
for the ciphertext.

37
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.190 
So the rotor ciphers as already
said they're polyalphabetic

38
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.320 
substitution ciphers. So we take
one letter from the original

39
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.030 
text from the plaintext and substitute it
for another letter for the ciphertext

40
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.120 
and we do that with a
multitude of different

41
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.770 
encryption alphabets. This is
the polyalphabetic part.

42
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.500 
So exactly each letter is encoded
according to a different

43
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.960 
scheme until the last rotor has
completed its rotation because

44
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.520 
once the last rotor, so usually
the third or the fourth rotor

45
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.280 
has completed its rotation then
we will start at zero again,

46
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.080 
with the first rotor starting to rotate
and then the second one and so on.

47
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.270 
So then that means that the code
is only repeated after we have

48
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.060 
done twenty six to the power of n,
with n being the number of rotors,

49
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.950 
different encryptions. So twenty
six encryptions or twenty six

50
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.710 
to the power of n encryptions of
each time one letter and then

51
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.920 
we will start to
repeat the same code.

52
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.760 
How would we decrypt such
a thing? So as we learned

53
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.700 
with our encryption principles,
we need to have some sort of

54
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.570 
key to encrypt and to decrypt and
in particular for decryption,

55
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.820 
the key of the rotor ciphers, the
initial position of the rotors

56
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.230 
because having the initial position
of the rotor, somebody could

57
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.910 
do the same position in
their Enigma and thereby

58
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.820 
decrypt the cipher
that they received.

59
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.900 
So how many keys do
we have? We said

60
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.770 
twenty six to the power of n,
and for the first form of the

61
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.440 
Enigma this was twenty six to the
power of three because

62
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.140 
we had three rotors and each
rotor had twenty six different

63
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.020 
letters for twenty
six different

64
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.890 
encryptions of a single letter on it.
And that would be approximately

65
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.260 
seventeen thousand different keys
for this version of the Enigma.

66
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.420 
So seventeen thousand is
not yet so really much.

67
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.820 
So another idea was what if we just ship
this device which takes three rotors

68
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.980 
with more than three rotors and you
can just choose any number of

69
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.860 
any different rotors that
you want. So for example we give

70
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.380 
the people buying an Enigma, we
give them five rotors and they

71
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.170 
choose three of those five. So then the
number of keys would increase to

72
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.510 
more than one million

73
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.320 
and that is by
far a more

74
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.010 
secure number of keys that
cannot be so easily correct.

75
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.390 
So this is all about the basic
idea of the rotor ciphers. Let's

76
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.920 
look into the Enigma in particular.
Here you can see a picture of it.

77
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.050 
We can clearly see in the picture we
have the three rotors in the back

78
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.750 
plus we have all the,
we have a normal

79
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.710 
keyboard on it because we would
usually start typing the messages

80
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.670 
on the keyboard and while we
type it the rotors move in the

81
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.120 
background and produce
the encrypted message.

82
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.510 
The inventor of the
actual Enigma

83
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.910 
in nineteen eighteen was
called Arthur Scherbius and Enigma

84
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.140 
got patented in nineteen twenty six.
Enigma the name comes from

85
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.700 
the secret word Greek,

86
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.740 
the Greek word
"secret", excuse me.

87
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.740 
And at first it was equipped with
three rotors and later they

88
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.510 
even added a fourth rotor to the
Enigma itself. So at first it had

89
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.340 
three static rotors, later it
would have four static rotors

90
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.030 
to increase the number
of keys again

91
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.590 
and then behind the last rotor
there would still be another

92
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.740 
immovable rotor which
wouldn't itself rotate.

93
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.010 
This thing was called the Reflector.
The main use of the reflector

94
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.050 
was to make sure that not by accident
one letter from the original alphabet

95
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.940 
gets encrypted with the same
letter in the ciphertext because

96
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.270 
in theory it could happen that we
have a text to be encrypted

97
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.100 
and just by pure chance it happens
that the ciphertext is identical to

98
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.880 
the original text and we want to
make sure that this doesn't happen.

99
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.530 
And therefore they added the
reflector which made sure that one

100
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.390 
one character in the ciphertext could
not be identical to the same character

101
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.650 
in the plaintext.

102
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.060 
So let's go into a

103
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.750 
bit into the history of the
cryptanalysis of the Enigma.

104
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.740 
So this is a really exciting stories and
there's multiple movies covering the story.

105
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.120 
I think the latest one
called the imitation game

106
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.580 
which is pretty accurate
and pretty good view.

107
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.910 
And it is one story that is
of strategic importance

108
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.900 
for the course and the duration of
the second world war because

109
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.210 
we earlier said that the Enigma was used
as one of the central devices that

110
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.600 
the German Wehrmacht used during the second
world war to encrypt the radio messages

111
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:53.820 
and so this operation too about the story
of the cryptanalysis of the Enigma

112
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:59.470 
was operated under the strictest secrecy
even until nineteen seventy four

113
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.250 
and with industrial conditions.
So that mean there were like

114
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.310 
about seven thousand employees in
the shielded campus which was

115
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.500 
which was called Bletchley
park, it was near London and

116
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.010 
their whole job from the start
of the second world war until

117
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.020 
even nineteen seventy four was to
decode German radio messages.

118
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:26.870 
So how were they able to do this
because we said that dealing

119
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.880 
with the cryptanalysis of the
Enigma is very complicated and

120
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.840 
therefore the whole effort that
they did really helped to advance

121
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.640 
the development of the first computers
because they built some pretty

122
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.020 
big and pretty excessive
electromechanical constructions

123
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.130 
to decode the radio messages and
therefore it really helped

124
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.740 
the helped course for
the first computers then.

125
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.300 
So let's go look into what
actually helped them.

126
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.180 
So on the main part it was
errors on the German side

127
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.770 
during the world war
that helped the cryptanalysts

128
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.630 
because as we earlier learned some
attacks against cryptographic

129
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.440 
principles are for example you
know the ciphertext, or you know

130
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.720 
the plaintext and thereby you
can try to match it back and

131
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.890 
forth and try to derive some value
from the information you get.

132
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.700 
And in particular what the Germans
did was they consistently

133
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.370 
they consistently sent for example
news across the radio. So

134
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.450 
for example the troop movements
were always very similar messages

135
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.150 
which had very fixed formats for
the Germans which helped and

136
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.250 
made it easier to decode the
messages. In particular at the

137
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.990 
start of each day there was there
was a weather forecast, so

138
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:51.080 
how the weather looked today
for Germany. And this message

139
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.830 
they sent it a thousand times during
the course of the world war

140
00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.020 
and obviously as we know from today,
the weather forecast is not that

141
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.780 
there's not that many different
weather forecasts. So for example

142
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.690 
ok today it's going to be sunny,
today it's going to be cloudy,

143
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.310 
today it's going to rain and we
have that pretty identical

144
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.410 
message and we have it sent multiple
times but differently encrypted.

145
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:20.330 
And that really helped during
the decoding because it would

146
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.810 
help with like seeing the same message
encrypted by different rotor positions

147
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.020 
to see what might actually be the
original message or to understand

148
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.520 
how the encryption of
the Enigma worked

149
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.350 
or to understand how the keys
might actually look, so how the

150
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.610 
rotors might
actually look.

151
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.300 
Furthermore we had that the

152
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:48.030 
joint forces would have had the
availability to loot

153
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.320 
valid codebooks or even some rotors
and even a functioning Enigma.

154
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.990 
For example in nineteen
forty one they

155
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.020 
were able to capture submarine
where they could get the stuff

156
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.220 
in good condition, so that they
could basically re- engineer it.

157
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.030 
But as you recall even that we
know the encryption principle,

158
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.760 
so we know how the rotors look,
we know how the Enigma works,

159
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.250 
there's still the big secret as
to how were the rotors set when

160
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.630 
the message started to be encrypted
that we need to know. So

161
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.360 
we still need to know that key. Just
having one Enigma didn't enable

162
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.770 
the joint force by its own to be
able to decode the messages.

163
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.530 
They still needed to get hold of the key
and probably try out various different

164
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.720 
keys. And finally there was it's
called the design weakness.

165
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.540 
So the use of
the reflector.

166
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.280 
As we can imagine
we said that

167
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.840 
each letter in the alphabet can
be projected to potentially

168
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.280 
twenty six other letters. And
those twenty six other letters

169
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.500 
three times by the three different
rotors but now that we know that

170
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.960 
finally in the end it is not
allowed to be the same

171
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.870 
letters as in the front, so as in the
origin text. That is we could

172
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.270 
call it a design
weakness

173
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.890 
because that means that we
basically only have a key room of

174
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.910 
twenty five characters to encode
one character and not twenty six

175
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:21.260 
and therefore in particular with
a bit of human knowledge and

176
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.260 
seeing which messages could
mean what, based on okay

177
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.510 
there in the end we don't have
an a for example, so it cannot

178
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.080 
be this specific word.

179
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.150 
This really helped during the
decryption of the rotor ciphers

180
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.350 
on particular
the Enigma.

181
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:44.090 
And that way the joint forces were
able than to decrypt messages

182
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.870 
with the Enigma or encrypted with
the Enigma and were therefore

183
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.660 
able to gain more information into
for example troop movements

184
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.450 
of the German Wehrmacht and that
played a central part or played

185
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.690 
one part one role in

186
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.030 
their ability to end
the second world war.

187
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.790 
Thanks for your attention. That
sums it up for our excursus,

188
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.410 
in short a bit of historical
background on the rotor ciphers

189
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.220 
and the Enigma.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.050 
good morning everyone. it's a great honour for me to be here.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.160 
today my name is yassine. i'm from morocco i would like to present

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.910 
a work under the theme experimental design of learning analysis

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080 
dashboards for teachers and learners presented by myself under

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.270 
the direction of professor poirier frank from lab s t i c c university britannia assad.

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.100 
france and professor mansour e khalifa from lab s s d i a and set of multimedia

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
university hassan two of casablanca. in recent years e-learning

8
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.090 
has grown at an exponential rate according to several researches.

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.570 
distance learning has become the most dynamic and popular sector

10
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.530 
in the education and university field.
the advantages of e-learning are diverse available anywhere.

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.190 
and any time the learner is not constrained

12
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.840 
by either locations or schedules quality learning content structured

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.320 
and sequenced not forgetting that the learner can train at
his or her own pace.

14
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.710 
it is also a pedagogical solution that offers greater flexibility,

15
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.150 
because it is adapted to the types of learners and to all levels of competence

16
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.720 
low cost easy of implementation, no structural costs,
no travel expenses for trainers.

17
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.240 
finally encouraging sharing and interaction between teacher and learner

18
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.590 
as well as between pairs, however, even with these advantages.

19
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.420 
the absence of engagement and motivation can provide
a feeling of unsatisfied action.

20
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.280 
and thus leave a bad learning experience which could lead to

21
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.540 
a drop out of the learning process.
psand lower success rate than traditional education.

22
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.940 
this presentation aims to answer fundamental questions what

23
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.650 
factors influence the success rate of online learners.

24
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.640 
how can we measure and improve this rate?
in this regard we propose in this presentation

25
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.920 
a visual communication tool for teachers and learners facilitating

26
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.590 
the monitoring and control of the learning process.

27
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.610 
in order to answer the first question we identified and classified

28
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.450 
in our previous research.
several factors which allowed us to explain satisfaction

29
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.980 
self-regulation intention to continue using the system as well as learner success.

30
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.530 
five dimensions were proposed to make an initial classification of these factors.

31
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.690 
namely learner system teacher course and social factors.

32
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.940 
this model was validated and published in an american journal titled

33
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.290 
journal of information technology education research the result

34
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.140 
of our study shows that success is explained with a prediction

35
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.970 
rate of eighty point seven percent by twenty four percent self

36
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.480 
regulation and seventy five point five percent by intention

37
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.040 
to continue using the system.

38
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.700 
during interactions with lms learners leave several data in

39
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.070 
the form of user traces. in recent years there has been a growing

40
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.230 
interest in the automatic analysis of this data to support

41
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.810 
real time decision making.
and thus improve the learning experience.

42
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.950 
learning analytics is an emerging trend in morocco especially in higher education

43
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.520 
in two thousand. and eleven george siemens professor of psychology

44
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.290 
and also known for his theory of connectivism defined the term

45
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.810 
learning analytics at the first international conference dedicated

46
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.300 
to the subject as the measurement collection analysis and processing

47
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.720 
of data about learners and their environments in order to understand

48
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.970 
and optimize learning and the environments in which it occurs.

49
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
every action on the lms is logged in the database or in log files.

50
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.430 
so we have a very important source of data that we can leverage.

51
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.450 
these platforms provide a variety of built in reports. but they

52
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.550 
are mostly descriptive in nature they tell participants what happened

53
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.660 
but not why. and they do not predict outcomes or advise students

54
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.290 
on how to improve their results these tools are mostly plugin

55
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.590 
integrated and functional on a single platform the main challenge

56
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.130 
would be to have a tool. to analyze the learning data in a way

57
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.470 
that the meaning and representation of it is easily accessible.

58
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.310 
and can be translated into a comprehensible format. whatever

59
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.870 
the platform or technological environment used in order to

60
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.440 
answer the second question that guides our research. that is

61
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.060 
how can we measure and improve the success rate of online learners,

62
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.120 
we designed a visual communication tool based on learning traces

63
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.770 
functional with several online learning systems and facilitating

64
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.090 
the monitoring and control of the learning process.

65
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.090 
we named it tablet for tablet aboard the analyzed deze traces d apprentissage

66
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.470 
in franch. the tablet tool will allow to consult what happened in the course

67
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.570 
descriptive aspect which students will not succeed online predictive aspect

68
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.440 
for which reasons the students are declared as drop-outs diagnostic aspect.

69
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.120 
and finally what actions to take to improve their progress proactive aspect.

70
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.400 
the process consists of extracting the learning traces from the data sources.

71
00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.920 
student data choosing and calculating the evaluation indicators,

72
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.150 
generating j s o n files thus masking the provenance of data.

73
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.260 
and finally visualizing the results by two reports. in the form of a dashboard

74
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.030 
with also a notification system allowing to detect quickly

75
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.190 
the students in difficulty as well as to give to the students recommendations.

76
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.850 
the first phase of the tablet tool process

77
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.590 
is to determine the source of the data, choose the learning platform

78
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.520 
prepare and retrieve the data we use for our tool.

79
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.570 
the data can be located in a database my sql maria db
or poster sql in logstore tables or in log files.

80
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.860 
usually j s o n or both in this phase the user

81
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.580 
can choose the platform and editor configuration file containing

82
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.630 
the platform access link the database connection string the

83
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.630 
table prefix as well as the database access log-in and password

84
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.790 
in order to access the learning traces. in this second phase

85
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.640 
we create analysis algorithms based on the data prepared and

86
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.540 
retrieved from the previous phase. these algorithms aim to specify

87
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.350 
and create indicators as well as to analyze the student's activity traces.

88
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.120 
the indicators we use are divided into six different categories namely

89
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.620 
the category course. this category gives general information about the course

90
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.650 
the participation category. this category is more focused on

91
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.500 
the actions that can be performed on the course that make the

92
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.970 
student considered as active on it. a value representing the

93
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.480 
level of participation is also calculated. the section's category

94
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.670 
two types of actions are possible consultation actions and contribution actions.

95
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.960 
the indicators allow us to calculate the level of progress

96
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.760 
of the students in each section. the progression category,

97
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.490 
the progress of a student represents his or her progress within a course.

98
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.100 
these three indicators directly represent the students' progress

99
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.370 
through the course and therefore their personal progress. the social category,

100
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.990 
this category is more focused on the social interactions that

101
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.100 
can be done in the course that make the student socially active

102
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.240 
on the platform. the success category, gives an estimate of the

103
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.460 
level of success of a learner in an online course.
the level of successful progress

104
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.440 
meaning achievement of a grade above the average and tests quizzes

105
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.370 
assignments and less.
our dashboard design is based on our theoretical causal model

106
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:28.290 
that we developed earlier according to this model.
success is explained by self-regulation.

107
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.080 
represented in our case by the level of progress with success,

108
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.960 
and by continuity in using the system.
the latter is explained

109
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.570 
by the level of social interaction and by the level of participation
in the core.

110
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.570 
the third phase plays a main role in the process

111
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.990 
of the tablet tool it is a link between the analysis phase

112
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.440 
and the results presentation phase.
it is also an essential

113
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.390 
phase to guarantee the interoperability of our tool. the goal

114
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.460 
is to allow on the one hand to generate essential data for

115
00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.480 
our tool and j s o n files have standardized nomenclature. thus

116
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.710 
hiding their initial origins on the other hand to give the

117
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.970 
possibility to other developers to extend the use of the tool

118
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.750 
to other lms platforms.

119
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.240 
this phase is the main element that defines our tool the goal

120
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.840 
is to present reports in the form of various diagrams based

121
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.430 
on the data generated in the j s o n files. this is the visualization

122
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.360 
phase of the dashboard two aspects are presented independently.

123
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.190 
the teacher report and the student report. the first interface

124
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.540 
of our tool is the authentication page. this page asks the user

125
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.590 
to enter his username and password provided by the lms platform.

126
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.630 
after a valid authentication the tool proposes the course analysis interface.

127
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.440 
this interface is adapted according to the user's role teacher or student.

128
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.860 
the first page of the teacher report contains the dashboard

129
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.210 
which gives an overview of the particular course the progress

130
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.860 
page displays a table of course participants. with their date

131
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.460 
and duration of the last session as well as a percentage estimate

132
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.390 
of each participant's progress. the quiz analysis page includes

133
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:13.070 
a table that summarizes for each student. the list of quizzes taken or not

134
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.750 
the assignment analysis page summarizes for each student the

135
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.660 
assignments that have been turned in and those that have not.

136
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.120 
the drop out page presents a table that displays the list of

137
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.260 
students with an estimate of the total time spent on the course.

138
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.960 
a progress status with validation an indicator representing

139
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.590 
the level of success. this calculation is made based on the

140
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.930 
results of our theoretical model. a prediction state is also mentioned

141
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:42.410 
indicating in words the result of the prediction, either risk of dropping out

142
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.340 
minimal risk or success. finally a color coding is also programmed

143
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.990 
to indicate the state visually the first page of the student

144
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.310 
report contains the dashboard which gives an overview of the

145
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.090 
student's progress as well as his or her position in the class.

146
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.900 
the second page of the student report is the progress page,

147
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.180 
and this page the student can see the details of his progress

148
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.440 
in the course. the last page is the notifications page. this

149
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.990 
page displays the list of notifications or suggestions sent

150
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.160 
automatically by the system and not read by the student.

151
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.680 
the objective of this last phase is to have on the student

152
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.410 
side suggestions on a set of actions available for each finding.

153
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:29.020 
these notifications are classified into six categories. connection, resource,

154
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:34.420 
social lesson quiz assignment a linux script is also programmed

155
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.540 
to run ph p code to send notifications automatically twice a day.

156
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.450 
at eight o'clock in the morning and to twenty hundred

157
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.770 
hours in the evening. if the same notification has already been sent.

158
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.140 
and has not been read yet the sending is not done.

159
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.830 
to test the tablet tool and assess its impact on self-regulation

160
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.540 
and prediction of success, target class is divided into two

161
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.300 
groups of thirteen students eight female and eighteen male

162
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.230 
aged between eighteen and thirty five years old twenty four

163
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.860 
between eighteen and twenty five and two between twenty six and thirty five

164
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.650 
in terms of time spent using the internet and computer per day.

165
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.810 
six students reported using the internet between two and five hours

166
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.370 
eighteen between five and ten hours and two more than ten hours per day.

167
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.620 
one of the two groups had access to the experiment to use the tablet tool

168
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.760 
exposed group while the second group did not control group.

169
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.320 
we note at first that all students in the exposed group logged

170
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.070 
on to the online course while for the control group, two students

171
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.640 
did not take the online part of the course, the second remark

172
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.990 
concerns the total time spent doing the activities of the online course.

173
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.460 
students in the exposed group spent almost triple the amount

174
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.760 
of time that students in the control group took to complete the online course.

175
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.950 
this increase therefore reflects self-directed functioning

176
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.920 
and resistance to distractions, thus making work at home a particular

177
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.700 
form of self-regulated learning. the third remark concerns the

178
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.080 
performance of each group we notice a significant increase

179
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.890 
in the average progression score of the exposed group explained

180
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.990 
by the proactive actions done manually by the teacher or sent

181
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.810 
automatically by the tablet tool. proactive phase in order to remind students,

182
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.130 
if there are still resources not consulted.

183
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.700 
file to download or you are out of visit or activities not completed.

184
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.940 
lessons homework to return quizzes to do etcetera the fourth

185
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.040 
remark concerns the analysis of the assignments in fact the

186
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.810 
exposed group had a seventy one point one five percent return

187
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.510 
rate for assignments, while for the control group the same rate

188
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.130 
was twenty six point nine two percent. this result is due in

189
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.190 
particular to the notifications received the last remark concerns

190
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.260 
the success of the students. in this study the level of success

191
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.340 
calculated by the tabard tool is compared to that obtained

192
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.130 
after the final exam. the tablet was able to predict one hundred

193
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.230 
percent success for students in the exposed group and eighty

194
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.940 
percent. success for students in the control group this result

195
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.970 
shows that students' performance and success is partly due

196
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.840 
to their ability to provide effective work at home.

197
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.630 
better preparing them for the classroom tests.

198
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.340 
we have proposed in this presentation a new learning analysis

199
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.900 
dashboard able to visualize the learner's progression as well

200
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.430 
as the prediction of student drop out rates we can conclude

201
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.130 
after a first study that the tool has provided useful and clear

202
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.390 
information to motivate and regulate the student's effort,

203
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.010 
as well as helping the teacher to monitor the student's and detect drop-outs.

204
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.560 
this first study has two limitations, first of all this study

205
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.290 
is limited to one class the integration of several classes

206
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:52.010 
into the study would require more resources. finally due to

207
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:56.770 
the sample size limitation. more statistical analyses were not conducted

208
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.960 
these initial results are very encouraging and will need to

209
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.290 
be confirmed in a more extensive study.

210
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.860 
thank you and your questions are welcome.

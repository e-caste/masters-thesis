1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.450 
Now, let us consider smart home and smart metres and discuss

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.615 
privacy in that context.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.719 
What is smart home? Smart home is the management of

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.730 
a networked house.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.111 
Networked house technology by means of controllers

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.607 
and this is a picture showing a controller.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.082 
There are many different services lightning entertainment,

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.689 
electronics, heating or air conditioning, windows and doors, alarm

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.332 
systems, appliance and by means of a controller all

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.688 
these elements are connected to each other

11
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.749 
and can be electronically switched on,

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.399 
switched off, can be controlled, also automatically depending

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.020 
from different events, for example, heating could be

14
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.386 
closed or could be started, alarm could be raised, and

15
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.042 
others. The smart home solutions which

16
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.569 
come to the market also use cloud technology, use cloud technology

17
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.400 
to facilitate the management of this home technology for the user.

18
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.469 
So, the user needs not to run a big computer systems,

19
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.569 
to controllers this he/she has a controller and via connection over

20
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.899 
the Internet to the cloud this controls

21
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.689 
the information and time and situation and measurements

22
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.280 
from the sensors, they are processed, they are sent to the cloud,

23
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.689 
they are processed there and then certain actions are done.

24
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.860 
Typically the systems are offered by different manufacturers.

25
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.509 
So as a data of the systems are sent over the Internet to that many

26
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.220 
factors server, they do the computation and they

27
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.900 
do determine the next action and time of setting

28
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.782 
that action. And they send information

29
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.537 
to the user and then the things are running

30
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.699 
out of and the user has a shank's.

31
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.389 
The owner of this flat has to Shank's via a management device

32
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.100 
with a web interface to start activities

33
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.289 
to switch on a light switch of light, to install,

34
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.569 
to configure that. If a certain event happens, then automatically

35
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.129 
some actions are done. So smart home solutions use

36
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.870 
cloud technology.

37
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.059 
So the controllers of the smart home system are always connected

38
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.098 
to the manufacturer's server via the Internet and the user can

39
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.240 
manage the smart home system from any location, though he

40
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.770 
does not need to be at home to switch on lights there.

41
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.539 
He can do this by from any place, from

42
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.099 
any location using WI as the Internet and the

43
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.389 
server in the cloud of the provider.

44
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.740 
When we look, what does mean?

45
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.389 
What does what what are the consequences for privacy and security?

46
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.121 
Then of course the manufacturer has access to all

47
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.780 
the user data and the manufacturer can edit it.

48
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.759 
So for example, smart home controllers can also have

49
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.080 
finalities and we will see some examples that they have in Verity's

50
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.909 
so that the home Y-axis, when the abilities of the

51
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.650 
smart home systems of the smart home controllers can be attacked,

52
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.189 
for example, with a denial of service attack.

53
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.289 
So there was public publicly discussed case

54
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.240 
with my Kasar about a very light and

55
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.830 
there is a number of minorities' that can be misused for a number of

56
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.789 
vulnerabilities are found and that can be misused.

57
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.350 
By Enoteca, for example, there is a vulnerability

58
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.240 
detected 2013 four eight six one

59
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.029 
shows that the attacker can read any data, any data from

60
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.980 
the file system, including SHASH Password, the passwords

61
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.501 
that are needed to prevent access and also reside

62
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.769 
persons. Another vulnerability says

63
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.466 
that guest users can change firmware and can

64
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.889 
download all the settings of this devices.

65
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.500 
And of course, if they can change the firmware, they can use this

66
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.000 
as as a basis of an.

67
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.040 
Attack or they can download the settings to get inside

68
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.709 
about orses control mechanisms, for example, or the settings of an alert

69
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.730 
system. Another, in a short time,

70
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.410 
another minority of this allied product

71
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.170 
was published. There is no authentication necessary

72
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.487 
to run arbitrary, malicious code from land.

73
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.869 
As an administrator, as soon as an attacker can access

74
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.489 
the system, as with administrator rights, then

75
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.289 
he can install and run any kind of code, although

76
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.079 
malicious code, not enough.

77
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.240 
There is one more minority that makes it possible

78
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.980 
that attackers can apply this attack method,

79
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.809 
this cross-eyed request forgery.

80
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.959 
We discussed this in our calls.

81
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.380 
Finally, the manufacturer has not published any pitches

82
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.389 
for the device. So here all this minorities' typically

83
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.379 
as soon as they are as they are published,

84
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.477 
the vendor is forced to come with

85
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.726 
an update to prevent future users of is that

86
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.759 
of his system here. Is that case of the worldwide system

87
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.459 
to be not attackable?

88
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.520 
Why are these vulnerabilities?

89
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.040 
There are more weak spots considering this.

90
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.939 
My cards are rather very, very light.

91
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.139 
The software that is used to implement the

92
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.970 
services that is based on an absolute, absolute

93
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.779 
open w r t operating system.

94
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.050 
So open w r t a ten point three.

95
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.829 
So all vulnerabilities in that operating system

96
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.785 
are at the same time by Merete again, various

97
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.210 
components and libraries of the Linux systems and ISS,

98
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.259 
which are relevant for this system.

99
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.793 
So not only is a specific minorities', but also the vulnerabilities

100
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.369 
of the Baz's operating system.

101
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.740 
It can be misused by an attacker to attack as much of our allied solution.

102
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.607 
And attacking such a smart home solution is attacking

103
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.304 
the home of the user to take to take

104
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.561 
influence on the heating and the lighting and all

105
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.929 
the systems run ins at home.

106
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.309 
So a light is accessible. That's another very serious point,

107
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.819 
which is taken as a sample that needs to be very careful.

108
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.249 
Considering and implementing and installing such a smart

109
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.019 
home solution is where light is accessible through the manufacturer's server.

110
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.470 
So it's tidiest.

111
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.370 
Clearers and benefactor want to have the possibility for remote maintainance,

112
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.360 
but also as a

113
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.069 
gateway in other ways.

114
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.470 
Other people and also retiming can use this to attack a system

115
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.659 
for security, for remote maintainance.

116
00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.669 
Wire as age is the same for all devices and

117
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.119 
are stored on the device.

118
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.349 
So getting access to one device gives the attackers

119
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.890 
the possibility to get the security

120
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.649 
also for all which fits to all the other devices

121
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.900 
sewing. So in the moment, the attacker knows

122
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.190 
knows a valid device idea may also be a guest, for example,

123
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.899 
for example, out other numbers.

124
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.644 
Plus one attacker can gain full access to the smart home

125
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.279 
controller. And this is terrible.

126
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.450 
If you imagine it's your home and is from outside.

127
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.200 
So easy to to manipulate

128
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.160 
your home and the systems in your.

129
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.519 
If you look for such a smart home, then smart

130
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.627 
TVs are a component of the smart home, so a

131
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.729 
TV that it's not only used as a TV, but also

132
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.299 
provides the possibility to control other devices

133
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.723 
in a home. So not only a smart home controllers, but also

134
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.360 
smart devices have some problems with privacy and security.

135
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.760 
And I give two examples.

136
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.080 
One is the Samsung Smart TV.

137
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.179 
So Samsung Smart TV is able to listen to all conversation

138
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.909 
and other noises in the room.

139
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.230 
In the moment the voice control is activated.

140
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:25.039 
The voice control, which provides a service that can speak with

141
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.539 
the is Samsung Smart TV, for example, to change the

142
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.649 
programme or to look for something.

143
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.999 
But since this technique is to be working,

144
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.740 
that listens to all conversations, that

145
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.870 
happens in the world and the spoken words are

146
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.799 
then transmitted to third party.

147
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.940 
So all what's spoken in that room is also

148
00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.570 
accessible for people when do not know who people

149
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.159 
who can listen to what's going on or another smart TV,

150
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.341 
the LG TV sensitives, then various user

151
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.730 
data to the manufacturer in order to show smart ads

152
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.740 
as what they want to do. Of course they want to fulfil all the wishes

153
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.755 
of the user, so they want to get as

154
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.070 
much as possible the data of their user to

155
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.640 
exactly show them some

156
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.249 
ads which exactly seem to fit for that user.

157
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.739 
And of course, this is a targeted advertising activity.

158
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.758 
So the information is also transmitted when the corresponding setting is

159
00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.960 
disabled. This is even more scandalous.

160
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.359 
You have the possibility, you are informed that this this

161
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.091 
is possible to enter data and then there is the possibility

162
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.072 
to switch off. But the due to the user

163
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.819 
thinking have switched off. But in reality, it's not switched

164
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.399 
off. So there's a transmitted data.

165
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.809 
What others says are, for example, the TV channels that are watched,

166
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.839 
how long this TV programme has.

167
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.609 
Its channels are watched. They file a list of connected

168
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.908 
USB sticks of Hardwicke's that are used to

169
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.179 
use a screen to see something as search requests.

170
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.960 
All this is collected and transmitted to the

171
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.759 
producer, to the manufacturer of the smartie we say

172
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.573 
are more small devices in the future.

173
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.679 
Homes, smart metres, smart metres,

174
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.960 
our consumption metres with a network connexion for

175
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.149 
electricity or for gas or for water.

176
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.510 
So the idea is that it's more easy to get access

177
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.230 
to these metres that they provide us.

178
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.710 
Also able to provide different

179
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.740 
conditions, for example, in daytime, daytime and Night-Time.

180
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.971 
This is impossible or almost impossible with the analogue consumption

181
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:31.269 
metres. Typically they are read one or

182
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.149 
two times a year as smart metres.

183
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.059 
A smart metre is constantly connected with the energy supplier.

184
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:44.139 
And so even in the moment, for example, if a strong

185
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.198 
wind and wind generated power is available

186
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.470 
in a big amount, then the energy supplier can

187
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.849 
decrease the price to encourage people to make

188
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.549 
to consume more energy.

189
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.679 
So the supplier recognises exactly the energy

190
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.030 
supply in a timely manner and can optimise tariffs.

191
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.499 
This is the idea behind. But the back backside is

192
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:19.509 
that he also gets access to the activities of the people

193
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.099 
living in that flat.

194
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.139 
So they also is counting procedures for cost invoicing

195
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.670 
and typically the tariffs open up.

196
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:35.419 
And consumer saving opportunities, this is the attraction for

197
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.570 
the user, but if we look to the privacy aspects,

198
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.579 
if we look to the privacy aspects, then we will see that there is a backside.

199
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:49.320 
Here is an example of such a smart metre, which is

200
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:54.059 
connected to the Internet, which sends data to the energy supplier

201
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.370 
about the usage of the energy.

202
00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:01.590 
And as a supplier can send updates, for example,

203
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.720 
of the tariff tables.

204
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.610 
If we look to the privacy aspect, then we see

205
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.259 
a lot of problems around such

206
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.740 
smart metres.

207
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.898 
So detailed information on energy usage in

208
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.290 
the household says a lot about the residents of the flat.

209
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.349 
So which device is used in what time

210
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.409 
you are even? It's even possible to conclude

211
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.762 
not only from the data that TV is used, not only

212
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.352 
that the TV is used, but in our research project

213
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.279 
we find out that it's also could be recognised.

214
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.370 
What programme is it?

215
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.599 
One sees the sleeping hours of the residents washing

216
00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.249 
time. How many people are at home in a certain time

217
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:03.570 
when you can from outside sees the cooking time and

218
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:08.339 
many more information that can be easily concluded

219
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.679 
from the energy consumption?

220
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:16.799 
So, for example, Apple is in Texas in US use electricity

221
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.940 
data to detect marijuana planned

222
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.278 
stations. So it's used to find out whether

223
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:31.409 
it's a people doing some something criminal by observing

224
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.619 
the energy consumption or another example.

225
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:39.179 
In Australia, such data was passed to debt

226
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:43.679 
collection companies to get

227
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.320 
more information about certain people.

228
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.989 
Smart Metres also enable their energy provider to shut down power

229
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.279 
supply remotely. For example, if bills are not paid,

230
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.331 
this is not possible in a world with an analogue metre, but

231
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.749 
it's simply simply can be done in as soon

232
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.030 
as such smart metres are used.

233
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.079 
Was also side smart metres have a lot of a lot of advantages.

234
00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:20.099 
So there is a political will that

235
00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:25.289 
these smart metres are rolled out here, for example,

236
00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.909 
the statement and the expectation of the European Commission.

237
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.366 
European Commission says to date member states have committed to

238
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.529 
rolling out close to 200 million, two hundred million

239
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.833 
smart metres for electricity and 45 million for

240
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.440 
gas by 2020.

241
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.400 
So that's very, very close.

242
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.559 
Or a national statement of European Commission concerning the rollout of such

243
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:01.079 
metres is by 2020, it is expected that almost 72

244
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.873 
percent of European consumers will have a small metre for

245
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.420 
electricity, while 40 percent will have one for gas.

246
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.719 
So and this is going about all

247
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.269 
the European countries.

248
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:22.049 
So you see the different speed the people done.

249
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.731 
And of course, there are also some regulations, also some regulations

250
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.755 
in the different state member countries about the legal

251
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.228 
use of smart metres, about the way they can be used,

252
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.130 
about the data that they are allowed to analyse

253
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.509 
and the data that they are not allowed to analyse.

254
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.649 
But this shows that although this

255
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.430 
area provides a lot of question marks

256
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.589 
concerning privacy, how privacy, for example,

257
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.329 
needs to change in future to make more use of such

258
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.430 
technology, to discuss the boundaries of using such technologies

259
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.788 
and the risk concerning security and price

260
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.710 
of privacy, we have to say that this is a

261
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.319 
relatively early development, smart home, smart TV, smart devices,

262
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.271 
smart metre. So a lot of minorities' can be found

263
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:32.430 
around and we will see for sure many attacks,

264
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.940 
many misuse in the next time.

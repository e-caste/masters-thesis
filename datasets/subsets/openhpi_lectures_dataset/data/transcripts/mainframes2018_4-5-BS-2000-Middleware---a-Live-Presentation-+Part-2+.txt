00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.640 
Hello and welcome to this MOOC session.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.720 
My name is JÃ¼rgen Eckert and as product manager I'm in charge

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.010 
for BS2000 middleware products.

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.310 
I would like to show you in a live presentation

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.590 
some different ways how to operate a BS2000 UTM

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.970 
application. In the following session we will use several interfaces

7
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.430 
for UTM application.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.880 
This UTM application is a fictitious travel booking application

9
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.530 
called travel on the BS2000 platform

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.450 
created for testing and demonstration purposes.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.040 
With this application you can book golf holidays in different european countries.

12
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.120 
The golf course dates, the desired hotel and the selected flights

13
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.280 
are booked in a dialog tool.

14
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.180 
The presentation takes place in three steps-

15
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.870 
first the application is operated via the emulation of a BS2000

16
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.930 
terminal on the one hand.

17
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.620 
The second step- the identical UTM application

18
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.420 
is controlled via a web application.

19
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.910 
This web application was created using the middleware product web transactions.

20
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.250 
Here we see the interface style with the look and feel of a blocked terminal

21
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.580 
similar to the emulation.

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.060 
And third we will operate the identical wep to a web application

23
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.610 
via an enriched interface.

24
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.130 
Lets start with the emulation MT9750.

25
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.440 
After logging on to the application, we recognize the typical format

26
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.310 
for blocked terminals. This was created with utility programs in BS2000.

27
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.240 
A format consists of a header with the application name, format,

28
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.880 
name and date and so on.

29
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.240 
In the middle you see the editing part with description output and input fields.

30
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.310 
Acknowledgements and error messages are output in the lower foot section.

31
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.410 
In the following dialog we will book a trip initiated here

32
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.520 
by entering one.

33
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.950 
Here we have an additional command field what we want to do

34
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.060 
in this sub menu. Now we select the country we want to travel to.

35
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.040 
We select Germany by entering three.

36
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.570 
The following format offers the selection of the travel date,

37
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.390 
number of travellers, and the golf course.

38
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.500 
Here we want to conclude the handling of BS2000 formats

39
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.850 
and let the scene be sufficient as an example.

40
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.870 
Now we come to the second part

41
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.540 
in which the operation is already performed using a browser

42
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.630 
via web application.

43
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.840 
The web application runs under the control of web transactions-

44
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.200 
a product of the BS2000 middleware.

45
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.030 
A dynamic html text is sent to the browser for output.

46
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.330 
The html representation was generated from the already mentioned format definition.

47
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.540 
Input fields for filling are available.

48
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.080 
The function keys notes from the block terminal are implemented as buttons,

49
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.390 
for example DUE, K2 and so on.

50
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.390 
But the appearance still reminds very strongly of the previously

51
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.550 
seen layout of the emulation of a BS2000 data station.

52
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.830 
Due to the generically created interface, we are talking about

53
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.100 
the one to one representation here.

54
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.480 
We will play through the same dialog as before with emulation.

55
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.780 
The standard transfer key from BS2000

56
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.060 
is assigned to the enter key of the browser.

57
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.480 
We experience the same content and the same look and feel as in the emulation.

58
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.840 
But the control was done via browser using the middleware component web TA

59
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.960 
which is controlled via a web server.

60
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.830 
For a clock there was little that was new in operation.

61
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.420 
Essentially only the background color has changed.

62
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.810 
In the third part of presentation we see an extended style whose interface

63
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.420 
was implemented exclusively with web TA.

64
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.230 
However it's still the identical UTM application on BS2000.

65
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.780 
The UTM application is controlled as usually via an interface

66
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.310 
based on the UTM communication protocol.

67
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.560 
The wallpaper now already attunes to the theme of a golf course.

68
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.990 
The individual sub functions of the booking system are entered

69
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.690 
here via clickable images.

70
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.780 
The position selection is then converted into the function

71
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.660 
number in the web TA application.

72
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.550 
Reservation corresponds to one.

73
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.870 
The selection of the target country is also done by clicking

74
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.710 
on the corresponding place on the

75
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.310 
stylized map of Europe.

76
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.970 
A button has been implemented to board the sub function.

77
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.870 
To define the travel date, a calendar function is used, where

78
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.210 
the corresponding date can be selected conveniently

79
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.510 
and for the selection of the desired golf club,

80
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.390 
one uses the stylistic means of a radio button.

81
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.570 
The function can also be controlled

82
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.890 
by simply clicking on one of the following buttons.

83
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.420 
In conclusion, web transaction not only allows you to operate

84
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.860 
the identical BS2000 application

85
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.520 
using different style simultaneously to the native interface,

86
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.710 
but also allows you to combine dialog steps and even operate

87
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.270 
several different applications in one interface.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.900 
In the clip about a
popular malware attacks,

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.960 
you saw what kind of damage
can be reached there and

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.590 
for that reason, I hope you
are very much motivated

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.720 
to look to protective
measures

5
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.750 
against malware attacks. And
let's start with a very

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.130 
simple looking, but very
important protective measure

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.390 
that are regular
backups.

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.330 
You remember ransomware and
other malware attacks

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.970 
on the Internet.
They have the idea

10
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.540 
to take your data to make
your data unusable.

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.290 
To damage your data. And for
example with a ransomware, our

12
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.210 
idea was to encrypt data so
that users cannot work with

13
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.030 
their own data. So if data is
lost, due to viruses, ransomware

14
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.930 
or operating system damage. Data
can be restored from previously

15
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.680 
created back up copies. And this
is exactly the idea of regularly

16
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.330 
store all your data in
a so-called backup,

17
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.800 
and if something happened, then
one can receive restored

18
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
the data from the
backup and can clean

19
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.330 
the infiltrated system. So
important and personal data

20
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.460 
must, therefore, be secured
on a regular basis,

21
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.890 
not once a year. You should
find your reason for

22
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.060 
doing this. Because
when you restore

23
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.710 
your data from a backup,
youÂ´ll come back to the

24
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.450 
situation and to the data
where is in actually when

25
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.850 
the back up was done. Modern
systems offer automatic data

26
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.350 
pick up services in
predefined time intervals.

27
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.790 
So you can configure this. But
it's very important that

28
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.180 
the backup is not saved
on your computer.

29
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.650 
It's very important to save your
backup an external media.

30
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.280 
The reason is simple. When
your computer is infected,

31
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.710 
then also the backup is infected.
There is an important hint

32
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.590 
that also is the
external media

33
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.130 
should be physically separate
from the computer.

34
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.520 
So not connected only to
the computer, when you

35
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.360 
produce a backup or
when you restore data

36
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.380 
out of backup. Otherwise
disconnect your a external media

37
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.730 
with the computer. The reason is
that, if an attacker is able

38
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.870 
by means of a malware attack
to completely take over your

39
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.790 
computer, your system.
Then there is no way

40
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.080 
to get access to the back up. So
regular back up is an important hint.

41
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.050 
The backup can be done on
an external storage.

42
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.430 
For example, in your home, but
data can also be stored online.

43
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.910 
For example, in a cloud. This
requires a secure control

44
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.400 
of access to the personal data.
So you have to think about

45
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.480 
this. The back up
should be encrypted

46
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.470 
before It is stored online
so that also provides an

47
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.150 
cloud, of storage cloud, are not
able or anyone who's access to

48
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.100 
the cloud, is not able to
get inside your data.

49
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.360 
Also here you should not keep
a permanent connection

50
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.520 
to the online backup and
media, when local chains are

51
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.680 
directly transferred
to the online store.

52
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.420 
So do not have this continuously,
because otherwise

53
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.200 
also a malware text on
your computer could also

54
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.330 
in free trade your data
in the cloud. Then

55
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.670 
one has to say, if there are different
versions which are allow to undo

56
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.220 
specific changes if necessary. So
think about which kind of data you

57
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.450 
should update, in the which time,
which part of system should

58
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.230 
be updated, which parts
are connected or not.

59
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.610 
When we speak about updates of
data, we have also to speak about

60
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.890 
updates of programs. In the
idea of updating data is to

61
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.340 
be sure that an attacker is
not able to steal or damage

62
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.950 
data. If he or she is doing
this, you can data restore.

63
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.090 
With program updates, there is
another idea. The program

64
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.610 
updates are used to resolve known
vulnerability, vulnerability

65
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.110 
in the software, in the program
which is allow the attacker

66
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.210 
to attack your system. If you
remember all the attacks that we

67
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.350 
discussed, then in most cases
vulnerability of the system

68
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.960 
of special parts of systems are
exploited by the attackers.

69
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.040 
So it is to make this
impossible or to make the

70
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.790 
difficult. One should update the
program on a regular basis.

71
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.430 
One should you use a
software version,

72
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.400 
If it works with an old, not
updated software versions,

73
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.770 
then there is a high risk
that this software has

74
00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:00.580 
public known by vulnerabilities.
So as soon as a minority becomes

75
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.230 
public, the software vendors,
the software vendors

76
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.010 
produce an update which closes
one, which repairs closes one

77
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.620 
vulnerability, so that's normal possible
for an attacker to miss used to

78
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.210 
exploit this vulnerability.
So when you update

79
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.260 
program, then this type of
vulnerability can no more misused

80
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.990 
by the attacker. That
means to close this

81
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.860 
attack points as soon as possible,
That means always perform

82
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.170 
updates as soon as they
become available.

83
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.210 
So the vendors do not find all
bridges during the test phase

84
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.450 
of system. So many vulnerabilities
in programs are discovered

85
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.740 
later and are discovered
by users or others.

86
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.980 
And then they are published,
they're published, for example

87
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:05.000 
by a external as security
experts, by known attacks

88
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.190 
from analyze an attack
and here is minority

89
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.630 
that could be misused by the
attacker and then the vendors

90
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.560 
produce such an update.

91
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.950 
So known security breaches can
usually be closed by a small

92
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:28.450 
update packages, by a short
hot fix as our very early

93
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.530 
reaction to get security and then
from time to time, you get

94
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.580 
such update packages. For example
for an operating system.

95
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.860 
You can configure that operating
system is automatically

96
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.330 
updated as soon as such
an update is available.

97
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.970 
This is also possible with modern
programs which often automatically

98
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:57.530 
in a form, when such a new
update is published.

99
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.160 
This should be
seen as an

100
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.310 
reminder to update the program.
In the additions application

101
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.260 
that automatically we look for
updates for the installed software

102
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:18.530 
to give the user a hint as
soon as an update of one of

103
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.530 
a software is available which
is installed on the system of

104
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.680 
computer. Also, some anti-virus
programs check whether the installed

105
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.800 
software is up to date, or
whether there is an update

106
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:37.870 
available. But what are needs to
be clear, with all updates,

107
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:43.520 
so the falling applies, it is essential
to verify that updates come

108
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.190 
from the trustworthy
source that it's not

109
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.960 
an update which is
sent by an attacker,

110
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.650 
to get malware to be
loaded on your system.

111
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.950 
If you're not looking for whether the
update comes from a trustworthy party

112
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:08.510 
then the updates
themself

113
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.300 
can become a source
of a new attack,

114
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:17.480 
and can be enabled, since the
installation of malware which later

115
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.470 
on can be misused
by the attackers.

116
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.790 
virus scanners and specially
for antivirus software,

117
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.830 
virus scanners and anti-virus
software provide more methods

118
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.910 
for detecting malware. That's not
only for detecting the virus,

119
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.470 
the virus scanners can also detect
warms ,trojans and spyware

120
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.690 
and other malicious software.
Therefore this product should

121
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.640 
be better called antimalware
software, installed of a virus

122
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.510 
scanners or antivirus
software. Because then

123
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.110 
people think that it's
only to detect the virus

124
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.110 
malware. Some of the
antimalware software is

125
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.590 
also, monitor or
internet connections

126
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:13.020 
and warn the user to
against unsafe websites.

127
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.360 
Nowadays a compulsory element
of Internet-connected systems

128
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.790 
are integrated
into them.

129
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.480 
So to run antivirus
software on a system is

130
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:32.880 
a must. And Antimalware
software is based on

131
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:39.320 
two different detection methods.
So one detection method

132
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.430 
is so called signatures. And the idea
behind this is that a signature

133
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.350 
is obtained when the
malware is analyzed.

134
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.800 
Then the analysing
researchers

135
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.260 
are looking for a very
special characteristics

136
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:03.680 
of exactly that malware.
Characteristics that can be used

137
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.960 
to distinct to recognize the
special type of malware.

138
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.580 
And then later if
it is detected,

139
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:17.860 
then files are checked for such
kind of characteristics,

140
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.440 
and accordingly are classified
as infected online infected.

141
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:29.080 
So signatures are very
typical characteristics

142
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:34.660 
of malware type, of course, such
a software needs to investigate

143
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.890 
system for many types
of signatures,

144
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.990 
for many types and
sorts of malware,

145
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.850 
by means of signatures.
The other way

146
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:52.400 
to detect a
malware attack,

147
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:59.020 
is to analyze the normal or
benign state of a system.

148
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.060 
And then later on compare
constantly with the running

149
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:11.390 
system against the normal status.
And if there is a strong

150
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:17.050 
deviation from the normal status,
then the warning will be sent to

151
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:22.060 
the user. So signatures,
here one needs to know,

152
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.030 
the signatures are
based on a method for

153
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.560 
finding out its malware

154
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.470 
on system, needs that the
malware was already known

155
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.500 
before, because the characters are
needed, the characteristics are

156
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.530 
taking out of some malwares.
In case of anomalies,

157
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:48.720 
this absolute helps the
user, also to detect

158
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.640 
malware attacks, and
attacks that have some

159
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.070 
infects on your system, which
leaded work in a different way

160
00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.510 
as usual. So in the case
of Anomalies detection,

161
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:08.280 
it does not need to know the
attack measured in advance.

162
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:15.930 
So unknown malware can be
detected by means of such a

163
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:21.230 
anomaly based methods,
but on the other

164
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.980 
side, they are less accurate
sense of a signature.

165
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.840 
So model anti-virus system have
two based on two methods used to

166
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.850 
do something for their work.
Only Antimalware software

167
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.820 
needs also to be
kept up to date.

168
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:47.110 
As a continuously updating
antivirus software

169
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.880 
is important to get the latest
virus definitions, to get the

170
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.390 
latest signatures of malware, to
let the system be able also

171
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.960 
to detect new viruses
and new malwares.

172
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.180 
Ideally all data sources
must be searched

173
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:11.840 
for viruses. Hard disks, removable
media(CD, USB sticks...)

174
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:18.980 
and network connections and
others. So most antivirus

175
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.950 
most virus scanner

176
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:27.120 
automatically block and prevent
installation of a malware,

177
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:33.030 
say remove malware. But if the
virus is found more frequently,

178
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.600 
and many investigations of
the reason is important

179
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.840 
to find in which
way, for example,

180
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.380 
in which the way that malware is
able to infiltrate the system.

181
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:57.940 
So if users run the reasoned
anti-virus software, reasoned

182
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.170 
anti-malware software,
then there is a good

183
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:05.000 
level of protecting
their system.

184
00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.960 
So the infected systems
tend to be slow,

185
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.590 
unsafe and to drop out completely,
therefore the virus,

186
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.600 
malware warnings should be taken
seriously and the problem

187
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.360 
should be resolved as
quickly as possible,

188
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.900 
not in fact our partners
and in the communication

189
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.480 
or also other sources on
our computer system.

190
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.610 
Firewalls, and firewalls
are important components

191
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:43.450 
for securing the Internet
access of the computer.

192
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.980 
So firewalls monitor are all incoming
and all outgoing network connections.

193
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.300 
And also data
sets a path

194
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.750 
through, this data has the path
from the internet to the system.

195
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.260 
And the system which data
are sent from the system

196
00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:09.620 
to outside. So firewalls can
prevent, for that reason.

197
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.880 
And it also resize the connections
and also reside connection

198
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.480 
attempts. So firewalls provide
an additional protection

199
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.870 
against attacks, such
as vectors or botnets

200
00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.480 
which are characterized

201
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.330 
that they need a connection to
an outside party, in case of

202
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.510 
pot nets to come on the controls
or in case of pectorals the

203
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.160 
attacker ones to comes
from time to time

204
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.300 
to make something with
own system, and coming

205
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.290 
into the system
connecting

206
00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.170 
from the internet is a
system. This is a situation

207
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.330 
where firewalls can detect
this kind of connection.

208
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.530 
So each attack will create a
connection to the attacker

209
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.510 
or will connect a connection
from the attacker

210
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.100 
that has not been
approved by the user.

211
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.590 
And such a connection that are
not been approved by the user,

212
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.510 
can be detected or
can be even blocked

213
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:20.380 
by firewalls. So such a type of
connection needs to be reminded

214
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:26.440 
at least a completely automatically
or at least an alarm

215
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.780 
should be triggered.
So a local firewall

216
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.300 
acts only on the system
on which is installed.

217
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.230 
Here this week we provide
in an excursion.

218
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.950 
And I also want to speak more
about firewalls in the idea,

219
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.910 
how they work and also about
such powers on firewalls,

220
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:55.370 
such local firewalls, beside
of local firewalls they also

221
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.440 
can network firewalls. And
in the network firewalls,

222
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:06.370 
they check all network traffic
and usually, network firewalls

223
00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.290 
are installed on connection
nodes between local network

224
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.270 
and the internet. For
example, in routers.

225
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:20.470 
So the function of in a firewall is
controlled by so- callend rules.

226
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:25.940 
And the rules define which connections are
allowed and which connection are not.

227
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:32.600 
The roots can be
formulated specifically

228
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.330 
for the individual applications,
for the protocols that are

229
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:41.060 
use supports and addresses.
And they define exactly

230
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.560 
what is permitted and
what is not permitted

231
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:51.140 
for that particular
computer. Then when

232
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.430 
the traffic comes
in form of

233
00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:59.430 
network packages. Then the
packages are checked

234
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.200 
and compared against rules
and if the rules apply

235
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.960 
in a network package, then
action can be tricot.

236
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.910 
For example, a data
package can be modified.

237
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.030 
A data package can be completely
blocked, and warning could be

238
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.580 
displayed. This is what
exactly it can be

239
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:24.210 
described by means such rules.
So rules are checking all the

240
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.780 
in and outgoing network packages.
Then certain actions can

241
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.410 
be done. For example, if one sees
type a special type of address

242
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.060 
or special type of protocol
appalled any such information, it

243
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:43.990 
can trick a rule. In case of
windows systems, the windows

244
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.140 
firewall is active by default.
So if you run such a system,

245
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:55.210 
the fire wall is running, one can
install, one can add additional

246
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.990 
routes, but here kind of
knowledge is needed.

247
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:04.360 
If we look to GNU/Linux
systems, they also

248
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.770 
provide a fire wall.
For example iptables,

249
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.290 
if such a firewall.

250
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.970 
When we speak about
protection measures,

251
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.470 
then it's not only for technical
systems, but also for

252
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.550 
procedures we have to
take into account.

253
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:27.200 
We can also prevent
lot of attacks

254
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:33.720 
by healthy mistrust. And healthy
mistrust is the most effective

255
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.930 
protection against malware
infection, so the

256
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.130 
best warning and protection
mechanisms are

257
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.170 
invalid. If the users still
opens untrustworthy content,

258
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.540 
if the user gets an mail and
if this is from a certain

259
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.920 
kind of source, and if
there is an attachment

260
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.830 
an image or a new game or a text
or a document or something

261
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.150 
else ,and if one opens
is a attack attachment

262
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.050 
then the typical situation
is that malware

263
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.670 
could be installed. So if something
is sent from an unknown,

264
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:16.700 
from an untrustworthy content,
definitely do not open attachment.

265
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:23.710 
When we are going to install a new
software, check manufacturer and

266
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:29.170 
origin of set software, if you
install for example hidden

267
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:35.350 
in a game, or hidden in some
other fancy software.

268
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.100 
If you install the software
in your computer,

269
00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.870 
and you are not sure
that it comes from the

270
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.090 
right manufacturers and
there is a great chance

271
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:50.210 
to install malware on your computer.
So one has to verify its

272
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.390 
signature. software is signed
so that one can check

273
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.290 
the manufacturer and
origin of software.

274
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:04.980 
One should

275
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.160 
make updates for installed
software, then also one has to

276
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.200 
check the signature and the
original set of software,

277
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.630 
in case of warning and manual
verification is required.

278
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.870 
So that to find out what is the
source, what is the claimed source

279
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.430 
and what is the real
source of such a system.

280
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.870 
Only install software
that you really need

281
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.680 
with every software you
this particular to form

282
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:38.570 
for mobile devices with any app,
with any software you install

283
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.710 
and which you are not need. There's
a chance that by narrative

284
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:47.620 
of set software can be misused
to attack your system

285
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:52.030 
to infiltrate malware. So
unnecessary applications

286
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.320 
on your laptop on your
smartphone on your pet

287
00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.280 
and unnecessary applications,
add ons, additional features,

288
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.690 
optional plugins, they
provide unnecessary

289
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:10.020 
attack vectors for attack
us, so you should

290
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:15.890 
be sure that you delete
this and uninstall

291
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.700 
this is software. When we
speak about healthy mistrust

292
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.400 
also a it's important to
switch off active content,

293
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.540 
for example Flesh, java,
Active X in the web browser.

294
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.830 
Since if these
are content

295
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.930 
systems of our various and
vulnerability is various of attack

296
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.430 
and break-in options.

297
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.140 
You should use cookies
only for trusted page

298
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:50.880 
that someone is able to it
check your a it to use to

299
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.740 
miss your cookies a
foreign untrusted page.

300
00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:00.350 
Then only open email attachments
when you are sure,

301
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.610 
when you are knows, the center
and when you are sure

302
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.540 
that it's not fake that it comes
really from this sender.

303
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.440 
If you open it and

304
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.200 
the text can be assigned
to the center,

305
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:20.180 
it has something to do with a
usually you get and receive

306
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.880 
from the center, so open
the attachement only

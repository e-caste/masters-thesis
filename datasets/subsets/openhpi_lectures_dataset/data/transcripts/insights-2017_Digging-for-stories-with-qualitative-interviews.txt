00:00:01.031 --> 00:00:03.940 
Welcome! We want to introduce you to another tool

2
00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:07.040 
that is very powerful and useful in design research.

3
00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:14.420 
We'll talk about why

4
00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:17.070 
qualitative interviewing is a powerful tool

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.570 
and also how to conduct a good interview. Interviewing

6
00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:22.260 
people that we wish to design

7
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.210 
for will help us to understand their context

8
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:27.130 
and hopefully also to to learn more about their needs and challenges.

9
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.890 
A good interview is like an honest conversation.

10
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:34.930 
By asking open questions and listening carefully to what people say,

11
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:37.790 
you can learn more about their routines and behaviors

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:41.900 
and also about the motives behind what they do.

13
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:43.770 
Of course qualitative interviews are more labor-

14
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:45.880 
and time consuming than - for example - surveys

15
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:46.540 
or questionnaires

16
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:49.120 
and as a result you may end up

17
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:50.740 
talking to less people.

18
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.410 
But they are a great tool for spotting

19
00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:55.200 
new opportunities and making new discoveries.

20
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:58.780 
surveys imply that we actually already know

21
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:01.570 
the answers and now give people options to choose from.

22
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:05.720 
But our goal in design research is actually to find unexpected

23
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:07.620 
and new things that we couldn't find

24
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:09.510 
without going to the field and talking to people.

25
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:12.960 
Instead of using a set of questions with yes

26
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:14.670 
or no answers, in our research

27
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:16.780 
we take an ethnographic approach

28
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:19.060 
and we try to have a meaningful conversation

29
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:20.490 
using semi-structured interviews.

30
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:23.260 
It is very important to think about

31
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:25.620 
who you are going to interview ahead of time.

32
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:27.160 
Spending time with the right

33
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:29.770 
people can be very inspiring for your research.

34
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:32.440 
Instead of talking to those that are mainstream,

35
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:34.720 
we want to hear the stories of those that are

36
00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:36.830 
at both extremes of the bell curve.

37
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:38.030 
So for instance,

38
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.490 
if you think about a given product, experience or service,

39
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:43.980 
you might want to talk to those people that dislike

40
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:45.270 
that product or service,

41
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:46.980 
or could never use it,

42
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:49.390 
or also on the other extreme

43
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:50.240 
those that are very

44
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:52.610 
very engaged with a service or experience.

45
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:56.130 
These are very interesting subjects for interviews.

46
00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.500 
Why is that? Because their knowledge and needs a more pronounced

47
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.180 
in comparison to the average user,

48
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:04.370 
because they have a very extreme emotional

49
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:06.700 
relation to the product or the service.

50
00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:08.960 
Remember that our goal

51
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:12.220 
when talking to people is not to confirm our own assumptions,

52
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.320 
but rather to provoke stories

53
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.370 
or learn things that we wouldn't know

54
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:21.590 
otherwise. One personal example of how talking to people

55
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.490 
inspired a design solution was

56
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:26.230 
when I was taking part in a design competition,

57
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.620 
in a team from different backgrounds.

58
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:32.400 
So the city of Berlin was looking for creative ideas

59
00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:35.550 
for souvenirs that would reflect the vibrant

60
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:37.080 
and young spirit of the city.

61
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:42.100 
And instead of just starting to think about possible solutions

62
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.120 
and rendering some designs

63
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:48.240 
what we did was to go out to the city and look for inspirations.

64
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.260 
So we visited some typical touristic spots

65
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:55.090 
and apart from talking to people at souvenir shops

66
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:58.370 
we met a group of young Italians that where in Berlin

67
00:02:58.371 --> 00:02:59.070 
for a weekend.

68
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.600 
We ask them if they have been to souvenir shops

69
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.490 
and they told us that they would never go in Berlin

70
00:03:04.491 --> 00:03:06.290 
to a souvenir shop and buy something.

71
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:09.070 
And when we asked why, we realize that unlike

72
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:09.790 
in many cities

73
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.460 
they wanted to be seen as Berliners
74
00:03:12,491 --&gt; 00:03:13,750
in the city

74
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.660 
and they didn't want to do any typical touristic activity.

75
00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:18.620 
Throughout the conversation

76
00:03:18.621 --> 00:03:21.670 
we had we realized that they have been to

77
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.820 
one of these signature old photo booths in Berlin,

78
00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:27.410 
and they took multiple black

79
00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:29.060 
and white photos to take back home.

80
00:03:29.931 --> 00:03:31.060 
So we realized

81
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:33.840 
they wanted to have something from Berlin as a souvenir,

82
00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:34.930 
but not a typical thing.

83
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:37.420 
And these photos are something that

84
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:39.480 
sometimes the locals also take. So

85
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:40.770 
they wanted some things

86
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:42.570 
that the locals also

87
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:44.860 
have. This desire to be part of Berlin,

88
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:50.090 
as „do as the locals do“, became very strong in our research

89
00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:51.420 
with other people as well.

90
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:54.140 
And this was something that finally informed

91
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:55.210 
our design solution as well.

92
00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:58.980 
So these are the types of insights

93
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.220 
that you won't be able to hear

94
00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:04.290 
if you only do surveys

95
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:06.900 
or if you just ask closed questions with yes

96
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:07.660 
and no answers.

97
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:10.970 
Now let's talk about how to conduct a good interview

98
00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:12.320 
and we will give you some do's

99
00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:18.650 
and don'ts for that. Building trust

100
00:04:18.681 --> 00:04:21.520 
is extremely important to have a meaningful conversation.

101
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:22.900 
You want to make the people

102
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:25.120 
you're talking to feel comfortable around you.

103
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:28.520 
So maybe instead of asking questions right away,

104
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.880 
try to first introduce yourself

105
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:32.060 
and the project you're working.

106
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:34.640 
It's good to be prepared for interviews

107
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.090 
and have questions in mind,

108
00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:39.330 
but also be ready to follow up on interesting stories

109
00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:43.920 
that you hear. That's why we propose a semi-structured design

110
00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:45.090 
for this type of interview.

111
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:48.930 
Ask „why“ often! Don't let the hidden stories pass

112
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:51.490 
you by. Usually, by the fifth time that you ask

113
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.420 
„why are you doing this?“

114
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:55.560 
you will find out about the hidden motives

115
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:56.900 
or reasons behind

116
00:04:56.901 --> 00:05:00.380 
people's behavior. Start with general questions

117
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:01.660 
in the beginning of the interview.

118
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:04.610 
and then, as you move, on with more specific questions.

119
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:06.280 
Also try to avoid

120
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:07.540 
„yes or no“ questions

121
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:10.560 
or questions that lead your interviewee into a special

122
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:11.930 
or into a certain direction.

123
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:15.710 
Remember: You're not there to confirm your own assumptions,

124
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.000 
but to learn new things that you can only learn

125
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:19.740 
if you have this longer interview.

126
00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:22.280 
So try to stay open and curious.

127
00:05:22.761 --> 00:05:24.520 
Also don't be afraid of silence:

128
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:26.660 
Some people need a bit more time to open up

129
00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:27.900 
or think about things.

130
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:31.370 
So don't try to fill the silence by talking into it.

131
00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:35.230 
And finally don't forget to document your interviews.

132
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:37.880 
That's why we suggest to go with another person

133
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:39.540 
if it's possible. In this way,

134
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:41.680 
one person can be the lead interviewer

135
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:43.700 
and ask the questions

136
00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:45.680 
and the other person can take notes

137
00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:48.180 
and pay attention to body language and gestures.

138
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.190 
If you're new to interviewing

139
00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:52.020 
it seems a bit difficult in the beginning,

140
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.600 
but it gets better as you practice, so don’t worry.

141
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:56.590 
So in this session

142
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:59.040 
we talked about a powerful tool in design research

143
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:00.690 
namely qualitative interviewing.

144
00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:03.630 
And we also talked about how to conduct a good interview.

145
00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:06.830 
Next we have an example of a good and a bad interview

146
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:09.920 
coming up, and afterwards we would like you to also

147
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:12.370 
try to apply what you learned and conduct an interview.

148
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:13.210 
So have fun!

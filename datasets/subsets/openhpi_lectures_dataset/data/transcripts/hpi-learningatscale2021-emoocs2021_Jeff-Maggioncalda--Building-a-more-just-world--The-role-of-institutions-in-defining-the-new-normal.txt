00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030 
Our last keynote speaker has seen the need for online learning in this pandemic

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.890 
from a different perspective.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.340 
with millions of people working and learning from home excess

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.090 
and opportunity for high-quality online learning

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.050 
has never been more important.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.930 
a CEO of Coursera, he serves this need

7
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.310 
and he's going to give us his take on how institutions should collaborate

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.370 
to build skills needed for the future.

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.640 
so please welcome Jeff Maggioncalda.

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.050 
christiane, thank you very much. it's really a pleasure to be here

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.190 
let me see,  if I can go into screen share mode here, great well.

12
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.720 
it's a pleasure to be here and what an amazing time, I

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.460 
mean challenging for sure, but also as

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.390 
the doctor just mentioned at time where many are forced into

15
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.860 
new things and we're learning things very rapidly. i would love

16
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.210 
to talk a little bit about what we see at coursera as the role

17
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.430 
that institutions have to play

18
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.750 
coursera was founded by a couple of stanford professors and

19
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.590 
it was direct to consumers, but since then we have really added

20
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.650 
distribution institutions and to see what institutions are doing

21
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.380 
the role that they're playing and the way that they are collaborating with
each other

22
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.150 
has really been fairly extraordinary in my opinion.

23
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.840 
we saw definitely a huge increase in the divide between the

24
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.110 
haves and have nots driven by covid has become more important than ever

25
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.500 
just as the previous speaker said that we work on equity, we

26
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.760 
work on access, we work on creating more equal opportunity for

27
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.960 
everyone in the world and if we don't do this. we will see I

28
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.730 
believe an acceleration of the differences of opportunity available

29
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.020 
to people around the world.

30
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.010 
when you look at what has happened before the pandemic and

31
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.070 
this is really a chart from mckinsey

32
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.190 
that shows the risk of automation. you see what's happening

33
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.120 
is that people who have fewer skills are being impacted desperately

34
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.620 
by the risk of automation to their jobs.

35
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.690 
so this on the x-axis it shows the risk the job is automated,

36
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.420 
on the y-axis the average annual income and what you immediately

37
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.180 
notice are the big red bubbles in the lower right.

38
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.150 
these are people in jobs which are waiters and cashiers and other front

39
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.160 
line jobs making very low wages who typically have no formal education

40
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.110 
and whose job activities are most certainly going to be automated.

41
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.700 
on the other hand in the upper left you see the blue bubbles,

42
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.970 
and these are people making high wages people with college degrees,

43
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.050 
who have jobs that are not so predictable and repeatable and

44
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.410 
are not so vulnerable to automation.

45
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.780 
and almost every government that we talk with now and almost

46
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.030 
every business as well

47
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.460 
is deeply interested in how we can urgently and at scale

48
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.810 
create the knowledge and the digital skills and the credentials

49
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.710 
to help people whose jobs will be automated

50
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.270 
develop the skills in order to get the new jobs. because technology will

51
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.290 
of course automate jobs. it will of course create jobs, but the

52
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.780 
important factor to me is the people who are being displaced

53
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.030 
don't have the skills to do the new jobs. so it's not as easy as just saying

54
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.070 
a technology will take care of it. we must proactively make sure

55
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.670 
that the knowledge skills and credentials are available for

56
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.340 
people who are impacted to get those new job opportunities they're

57
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.860 
being created in this digital world. and when you see what's happened with
covid.

58
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.910 
this same jobs that have been most vulnerable to automation

59
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.980 
are those jobs most vulnerable to covid nineteen have been most impacted

60
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.910 
and when the world economic forum surveyed employers, eighty

61
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.840 
four percent of them said that one of their primary responses to covid nineteen

62
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.430 
is to accelerate even faster with the automation adoption of digital processes.

63
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.500 
and so the world is going faster and faster. it's a race to

64
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.610 
try to keep up. now covid nineteen has clearly been a tragedy

65
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.410 
and we are seeing around the world different experiences, different

66
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.500 
challenges. some i'm here in california right now are making good progress

67
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.020 
in terms of managing it with vaccinations.

68
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.900 
but it's not only a tragedy.

69
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.930 
as the secretary general of the united nations said it's also

70
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.330 
an opportunity, an opportunity to build back a more equal world.

71
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.870 
and the way that we can do that is by really looking at the drivers

72
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.510 
of social mobility and taking a look at how institutions can play a role

73
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.770 
in helping facilitate learning so that individuals all around

74
00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.930 
the world have  access to not only education, but also additional
work opportunities.

75
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.550 
you see we see a big opportunity at coursera and we've already

76
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.980 
embraced this as a company,

77
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.890 
to create not only more equal learning opportunities, but also

78
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.750 
more equal job opportunities with online learning on the one hand

79
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.840 
and remote work on the other hand. as it turns out many of the

80
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.480 
new jobs that will be available, will be digital jobs. the skills

81
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.410 
to do those jobs can be learned online and the actual performance

82
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.010 
of those jobs increasingly can be done remotely.

83
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.330 
this creates a much greater opportunity for equal access not

84
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.550 
only to learning, but to job.s and it's the role of institutions

85
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.620 
to make sure that the learning is available and the job opportunities are available

86
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.440 
as well, because without the job opportunities the return on

87
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.990 
the investment that individuals are making in learning is really limited

88
00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.090 
to those opportunities which exist in their own cities or their own states.

89
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.170 
now when you look at where the jobs are coming from, this is

90
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.380 
from the world economic forum on the left, as I mentioned many

91
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.260 
of the new job opportunities will be in digital fields

92
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.780 
on the right microsoft estimates that the job capacity the

93
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.160 
number of digital jobs will grow from forty one million in 2020

94
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.090 
by another hundred forty nine million over the next five years,

95
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.020 
to almost two hundred million jobs. and when you look at where these jobs are

96
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.490 
software development cloud data, cyber, privacy etcetera.

97
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.650 
these are digital jobs and the skills to do these jobs can be learned online

98
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.840 
and increasingly these jobs can be done remotely.

99
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.930 
so there is a very strong chance in my opinion

100
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.270 
that the opportunity to have jobs will be far extended far

101
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.980 
beyond the borders of where somebody lives.

102
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.010 
now we just published the coursera global skills report. it's our third edition

103
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
it's a report that's based on the learning behavior of tens

104
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.720 
of millions of people on coursera where we're actually observing

105
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.500 
which questions did they get right, which questions did they

106
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.630 
get wrong which skills are being assessed at which difficulty level.

107
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.220 
and then we ranked the countries based on the performance of the people

108
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.240 
on the learners in that country on coursera. what you can see

109
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.250 
probably not surprisingly is a very strong correlation between

110
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.260 
the rank of a country's learners performance on coursera courses

111
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.690 
and the gdp per capita in the top twenty fifth percentile the

112
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.980 
second the third and the fourth twenty fifth percentile.

113
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.080 
and when we think about the the real promise of online learning,

114
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:44.080 
we think about it as like I said not only an ability for our educator partners.

115
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.060 
this is one hundred and sixty universities and sixty industry partners

116
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.600 
to deliver learning to individuals directly. and today coursera

117
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.140 
has about eighty two million learners who are on coursera. but also increasingly

118
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.330 
coursera is working with institutions. and we launch coursera

119
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.460 
for business about six years ago. today we serve more than two thousand businesses

120
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.410 
or upskilling and re-skilling their employees a year later,

121
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.420 
we launch coursera for government. today we're working with

122
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.930 
more than one hundred governments who are basically providing online
learning opportunities

123
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.570 
to people who otherwise might not been able to have them and then finally

124
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.240 
we work with thousands of campuses with coursera for campus.

125
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.370 
and this is really to help schools and many of whom have been impacted by covid

126
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.980 
deliver online courses that are ready made over the last nine years universities

127
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.680 
and industry partners on coursera have been creating thousands of courses

128
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.540 
and that makes these online courses available to campuses around the world.

129
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.700 
now when we think about where the learners are on coursera.

130
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.470 
they're spread all over the world eighty percent of them are

131
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.760 
outside of the united states we have about fifteen million learners

132
00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.850 
in europe and in the last year we've seen an awful lot of people

133
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:06.010 
who have had their campuses closed and have their other offices closed

134
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.860 
come to coursera to take courses. so we really seen a dramatic growth

135
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.930 
globally in the demand for online learning.

136
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.940 
last year we brought on about twenty nine million new learners together
they have

137
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.870 
had about seventy seven million course enrolments, but we really

138
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.640 
have now achieved as have other online platforms a scale that really is serving

139
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.410 
a very large global audience.

140
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.910 
we have a number of partners including many partners in europe.

141
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.860 
so i mentioned a hundred and sixty university partners fifty

142
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.490 
four of those university partners are european business partners

143
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.630 
and some of the school's logos are listed here.

144
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.590 
we also have sixty industry partners these are often technology

145
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.190 
companies and businesses who are also offering on coursera

146
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.330 
and so when we think about the

147
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.480 
the real relationship here of what's happening in terms of

148
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.070 
industry collaboration and institutional collaboration. we see

149
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.570 
universities publishing, we see industry partners publishing

150
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.630 
and we actually see i'll show you in a second

151
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.990 
industry partners collaborating with universities and governments and businesses

152
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.830 
and campuses collectively to better serve learners.

153
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.900 
i mentioned that we serve businesses all around the world this includes
many businesses

154
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.470 
in europe of course europe has some of the largest companies

155
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.680 
in the world and there's a real dedication particularly in europe

156
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.960 
towards helping to re-skill as institutions towards helping to re-skill

157
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.060 
and upskill their employees and then in october of 2019,

158
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.180 
we launch coursera for campus and this is a version of coursera for universities

159
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.710 
and we now have thousands of universities using our partners

160
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:06.160 
courses these online courses to deliver online learning a synchronous
online learning

161
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:12.540 
to students pursuing degrees on campuses around the world including forty seven

162
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.930 
coursera courses for campus customers in europe. and so we are seeing

163
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:22.570 
a world where many institutions including businesses and governments and

164
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.070 
and universities in europe provide coursera.

165
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.720 
they offer the universities offer this in three ways, some of

166
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.010 
them do it standalone for credit sort of like independent study

167
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.870 
and a student will get credit towards their college degree

168
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.680 
by completing courses on coursera. many professors blend the

169
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.290 
courses on coursera as courseware into their on campus catalogue

170
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.370 
courses. so this is a way of supplementing the zoom lectures with

171
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.210 
high quality pre-made university courses to give a little bit

172
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.390 
of a different perspective and a little bit also a more flexibility

173
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.040 
to students and professors who have been on zoom a lot and

174
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.500 
then a number of campuses also are providing coursera as multi-disciplinary

175
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.700 
learning not for credit, but particularly for some of the industry courses

176
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.170 
that will help with job readyiness.

177
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.530 
i also mentioned we work with governments around the world including
many governments

178
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.860 
in europe and we're very excited to work with governments. because

179
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.790 
they have a particular access point and leverage to reaching

180
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.520 
large populations of people particularly those impacted by covid,

181
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:34.410 
who are looking for not only career opportunities, but also the
learning opportunities

182
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.860 
that build the skills to actually secure those types of economic opportunities.

183
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.930 
so here's an example of

184
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.790 
i think a brilliant model for collaboration  among institutions.

185
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.530 
it starts with learners we often say at coursera learner first.

186
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.550 
the learner can come to coursera for instance and take a course developed
by google

187
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:03.420 
called the google ity support professional certificate. it's actually a series

188
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:09.680 
of five courses that assumes no college degree. it assumes no background

189
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:15.210 
or prior experience in IT and it fully online fully self-paced

190
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:20.060 
teaches an individual person how to get the skills, how to develop the skills

191
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.410 
to be qualified to be an entry level IT support professional.

192
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.120 
and what we find with these kinds of entry level professional certificate
programs

193
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.270 
is it attracts the kind of learner who many of whom have not

194
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:39.040 
had formal education and are really looking for opportunity.

195
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.310 
so in this case you have a company like google creating online courses
on coursera

196
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.510 
for now about a million individuals around the world who have enrolled

197
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.480 
in the google career certificates. now some people say yeah but they

198
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.610 
the learners can't do all this themselves not all learners

199
00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:01.500 
can do all this themselves online we work with a lot of nonprofit institutions
and governments

200
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:06.300 
to provide on the ground face to face support on top of this

201
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.460 
online learning backbone so we work in the us with goodwill

202
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.340 
and merit america and community colleges who provide a face to face

203
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.270 
help and mentoring on top of these entry level professional certificates.

204
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.860 
another thing that we've done with google is we've actually worked with employers

205
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.090 
who create career pathways employers are looking for qualified IT
support professionals

206
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.390 
increasingly they're looking for more diverse talent .

207
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.120 
people who don't have college degrees or prior experience and

208
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.610 
they're finding a pool of candidates who do not come from traditional sources

209
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.080 
and this can be a more diverse talent pipeline into these entry level

210
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.040 
digital jobs. so here's an example of employers collaborating

211
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.570 
with a technology company who's published a set of courses on coursera

212
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.390 
and made available to learners around the world.

213
00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.540 
well we've also created degree pathways,

214
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.660 
so some of our university partners like the university of london

215
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.570 
and northeastern and university of north texas have decided

216
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:13.740 
to award academic credit to students who finish the google IT support certificate

217
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.660 
so the university of london offers a bachelor's degree of computer science

218
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:22.140 
fully online on coursera and they've decided to award twelve

219
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.140 
academic credits towards a bachelor's degree for anyone who has created

220
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.050 
who has finished the google it support certificate.

221
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.790 
so here's an example we have universities recognizing academic credit

222
00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.300 
for courses created by industry and taken by individuals who had

223
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.320 
no college degree and what this allows a lot of individuals

224
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.450 
to do is to get the micro credential and the career pathway

225
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:50.140 
to land an entry level digital job. and increasingly the abella

226
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.300 
believe jobs that are remotely offered will allow them to get

227
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.410 
job opportunities, even if they're not in their local neighborhood

228
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.390 
and then while they're working in a better paid online job,

229
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.460 
they can then earn an online college degree and they get academic

230
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.580 
credit for the prior work that they did in the industry certificate

231
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.210 
in that professional certificate. so we think this is a wonderful model

232
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.590 
where all these institutions are collaborating with each other

233
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:22.420 
to provide more access to not only learning opportunities, but also
economic opportunities.

234
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.500 
what google started in january 2018 has really become

235
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:33.220 
an incredible trend on courser. we now have eleven live

236
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.040 
professional certificate programs all of them had the pattern of

237
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.160 
training people to do entry level digital jobs with no requirement

238
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.620 
of a college degree or prior experience. and we're creating

239
00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.990 
career pathways and degree pathways for all these jobs in IT support

240
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.370 
in marketing and data science in cybersecurity project management ux design

241
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.410 
you name it there are many many roles and professional certificates being created

242
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.340 
and it's a wonderful example of industry helping to train people for jobs.

243
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.220 
and then those certificates also counting towards college degrees

244
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:16.990 
so what we've also noticed online is a greater access to learning

245
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:21.710 
between genders. and so if you look at the percentage of

246
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.220 
learners learning online. these is this is course enrolments

247
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.140 
by male and female what you can see from twenty eighteen to

248
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.550 
nineteen to 2020 is during the pandemic more women

249
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:39.210 
started taking online courses on coursera as a percentage of total
course enrollments

250
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.140 
up to forty five percent globally forty nine percent of all

251
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.210 
course enrolments in twenty twenty were from women in europe forty one percent

252
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.120 
in germany. but it was really good news although the covid

253
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.100 
impact has been felt greater on women leaving the work force

254
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:02.300 
often to take care of kids. we've seen a disproportionate rise in online course

255
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.440 
enrolments coming from women in 2020 and when you look at

256
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.160 
enrolments in stem related courses the increase is even greater

257
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.590 
from thirty one percent to thirty eight percent globally thirty

258
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.750 
four percent to forty percent in europe twenty nine percent

259
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.660 
to thirty three percent in germany. but it really does create

260
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.970 
a greater opportunity for everyone to be learner.

261
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.620 
and so we have seen a number of case studies and i won't read

262
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.160 
through all of these, but we see companies like novartis providing

263
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.410 
online learning not only to all of their employees, but also

264
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:41.430 
all the friends and family of their employees thirty two thousand course enrolments

265
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:47.010 
sorry employees enrolled in novartis alone. we see states like

266
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.630 
the state of new york in the us. the workforce development board

267
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.350 
has purchased courseware for all unemployed people in new york.

268
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.220 
they're working with cuny which is the university systems in

269
00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.150 
new york to provide these courses through the school systems.

270
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.230 
they're also working with businesses and business forums to

271
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.170 
make sure that the skills that are being taught in the colleges

272
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:12.680 
and to unemployed people match the skills needed by businesses  in manhattan

273
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.910 
and in upstate buffalo new york as well.

274
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.090 
we see universities like the university of SZEGED

275
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.850 
that are using coursera as part of their university teaching process to all

276
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.890 
their on on campus students getting a much wider range of curriculum available

277
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.510 
and now they're up to almost twenty thousand learning hours from students.

278
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.720 
I also will just say they were recently ranked the number one university

279
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.600 
in hungary and hungary, so congratulations to one of our partners

280
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.570 
in hitting that ranking. and we work with the commonwealth of

281
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.900 
learning during the pandemic, this is a nonprofit that serves commonwealth
countries

282
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:57.190 
they actually helped us distribute coursera to fifty four countries around
the world.

283
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.850 
we reached over one hundred and twenty thousand learners who together took

284
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.500 
more than a million course enrolments all online and then the

285
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:12.110 
republic of estonia also is another example of a country making coursera
available

286
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.850 
to their employees. so we're seeing wonderful movement from

287
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:20.420 
institutions who are rapidly adopting digital technologies to help reduce

288
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:26.900 
the  impact that covid has had on people and we also see promising indications

289
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:31.240 
that online learning can reduce gender skill gaps as well.

290
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:38.220 
so in summary, it's been a very very trying last eighteen months, but we

291
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:43.570 
see a promise that online learning and remote work together

292
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.860 
with institutions that make both available to individuals can really help create

293
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.860 
more accessible and more equitable opportunities for people around the world.

294
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.640 
thank you very much and i'm happy to take some Q and A.

295
00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.070 
thank you jeff for those insights and interesting corporations.

296
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.250 
so it sounds really great and promising actually,

297
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:15.420 
so good luck with the move towards more even european corporations.

298
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.190 
yes so we have some time left. so i'd like to take

299
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.810 
a questions in the q and a area or also in the chat.

300
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:34.170 
you're invited, so i would be interested in

301
00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:41.040 
what you are seeing as trends regarding the formats for online learning

302
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.440 
which kind of trends are you seeing there.

303
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.030 
the biggest trends that we're seeing are trends in terms of

304
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.080 
domain and skills, I mean what's very very clear

305
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:56.930 
is that the learning that most adults seek to do is a line

306
00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.060 
towards the ability to get better economic opportunity so we

307
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.700 
see most of the learning happening in data science courses

308
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.210 
technology courses and business courses, I mean we do have many

309
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.300 
courses from our university partners in arts in history and social science.

310
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.750 
but especially business technology data science and increasingly healthcare

311
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:21.270 
are courses that people are pursue we also see and this is

312
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.580 
important although some people i think

313
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:29.740 
miss miss this important point it's not just the learning on videos and assessments

314
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.470 
it's the credential that people get as well credential,  credentialized learning

315
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.810 
where someone can not only learn the skill, but they have something

316
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.510 
to show an employer that says i've learned the skill helps

317
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.550 
create a bit more economic mobility. so pursuing things that

318
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.560 
have a credential like a professional certificate from google

319
00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.880 
or from facebook or from IBM or a university degree from

320
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.350 
university of london or from imperial college of london

321
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.760 
we see a big focus on

322
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.370 
credentials learning and i guess the final thing i will say is

323
00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:07.230 
we are increasingly seeing our educator partners building hands on learning

324
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.860 
of digital labs where people can actually work on software

325
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.680 
projects and build things and use data to apply what they're

326
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.130 
learning in the lecture courses to do hands on learning

327
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.730 
that they can also be used to show an employer like look how

328
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.370 
i've used this tool to apply the knowledge to build this project.

329
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.230 
we're also seeing a big uptick in hands on learning.

330
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.190 
ok, i've got another question

331
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.450 
from stephanie schweiger, you mentioned that more women are

332
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.260 
learning online now, can you give more details

333
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.080 
for example are they especially interested in special courses

334
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.190 
or is it distributed equally over all areas?

335
00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.810 
it looks like, it's there is i just think it was forty nine

336
00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.810 
percent of women in two thousand and twenty of course enrolments

337
00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.250 
in two thousand and twenty were from women globally and that

338
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.070 
was up by about almost ten percentage points. so clearly there

339
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.020 
there has been a greater interest in women learning online.

340
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:11.150 
if you look at the increase in the frequency of women enrolling

341
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.410 
in courses versus not in stem the increase is greater, but still

342
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.690 
not to fifty fifty. so overall we're seeing a greater increase

343
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.810 
in women taking stem courses, but it's still below fifty fifty,

344
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.940 
but one of the things that you find especially this was highlighted during
the pandemic

345
00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.560 
and we have a number of women on the executive team at coursera

346
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.210 
and who have younger children

347
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:39.440 
is the impact on women has as really been much greater, because

348
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:41.790 
when the schools are closed and the kids are home,

349
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.020 
oftentimes a lot of the care duties fall on the women and so

350
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.570 
the on the one hand women have had to drop out of the work

351
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.770 
force or at least pull back from the work force.

352
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.990 
but I think the convenience and the access I mean anyone can

353
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.370 
do it at any time including after the kids go to bed and from

354
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:05.270 
anywhere including at home or on a mobile phone, if you are on the move,

355
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.390 
you can learn. i think that kind of flexibility and affordability does blend

356
00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:16.720 
in a way that  fits the needs of women who are maybe caring for kids

357
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.570 
that going to a physical place at a physical time.

358
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.630 
just doesn't work so well. so i think the flexibility of online learning

359
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.670 
holds a lot of promise for greater learning equity with women.

360
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.370 
another question in the q and a

361
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:38.720 
yeah. it's just a Heini

362
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.500 
from WHO commenting

363
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:50.810 
that they have on openwho the same findings on gender equalization of attendance

364
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.750 
and they have gone from forty percent of women before the pandemic to currently

365
00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.320 
women overtaking men slightly. so fifty percent plus.

366
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:08.420 
yeah, I mean I of course we have to recognise the negative impact

367
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.970 
that we have already experienced, but i really think there's

368
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.980 
a lot of promise certainly. we're seeing it with online learning.

369
00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:20.370 
I believe personally that this is going to translate into remote

370
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:24.880 
work as well that the job opportunities first of all the skill development

371
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.270 
is increasing accelerating more quickly with women and i think that the

372
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:34.440 
economic opportunity and the careers might also advance when

373
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.640 
employers like coursera offer more flexibility to do remote work.

374
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.920 
i think that will disproportionally

375
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.180 
help women who today

376
00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.480 
benefit from more flexibility, when they're often also facing

377
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.690 
a lot of household related duties. that's true.

378
00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.100 
and another question from,

379
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:01.500 
how are employers evaluating online credentials and comparison

380
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.190 
to traditional university degrees? some study studies suggest

381
00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:09.570 
they provide little advantage for getting higher, do you see evidence to

382
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:14.800 
suggest otherwise and how can employers better evaluate these credentials?

383
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.730 
yeah the best evidence that I see is eighty two million people

384
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.350 
of course are taking courses. I was I will say this,

385
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.610 
if it didn't help people they wouldn't all be taking these

386
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.940 
courses for sure I mean people. It takes a long time to

387
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.620 
learn these types of skills in cloud computing and data science

388
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:37.900 
and business practices. so i don't think that people are doing this

389
00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:45.170 
for no reason and what we're seeing is the universities often have a credential

390
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:49.170 
that signals a number of things it signals that someone got

391
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.010 
admitted to an institution as signals that they completed a

392
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:57.780 
course of study that often has a breadth that employers are looking for

393
00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.590 
as signals a level of persistence that they were able to achieve adequate grades

394
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.440 
and so when they graduate.  you know that that credential says

395
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.160 
a lot and i'm of course as you can imagine with one hundred

396
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.930 
sixty university partners, i feel that the college degree is

397
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.920 
in very good shape and will be increasingly demanded globally.

398
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.390 
and one of the reasons i also say that is because colleges

399
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.390 
all around the world are integrating online learning like coursera

400
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.910 
into their degree programs. so if you look at mms university

401
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.660 
in india, you can get a bachelors of technology, a college degree

402
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:38.570 
purely with on on campus courses. but if you complete twenty

403
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.080 
courses on coursera and certain learning tracks. you can get

404
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.740 
a b tech with honors in data science or a b tech in honors

405
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:51.650 
in business. and so many universities are now supplementing or enhancing

406
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:57.030 
their college degree with a micro credential that comes from

407
00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.450 
a student taking courses on coursera. so college degrees

408
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.030 
are evolving rapidly and i think they will hold the best of both worlds,

409
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.870 
but many students will start with something like a professional

410
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.940 
certificate, because they're faster and they're cheaper to get into the workplace

411
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.700 
and i think once you're working the ability to earn a college degree online

412
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.680 
will often be more affordable, because you have to quit your job

413
00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.740 
and will also be more accessible, because you don't need to

414
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.640 
be near the campus to earn that degree.

415
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.210 
thank you very much!

416
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.970 
in case or I see there are more questions coming in.

417
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:43.080 
from DT, what is the distribution of

418
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.120 
courses being taken, tech, non tech design?

419
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.470 
so yeah when we think about business technology and data science

420
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.300 
in terms of course enrolments,  those account for

421
00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.170 
you know well over seventy five percent of the course enrollments

422
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.830 
are in these three those three domains, the fourth is

423
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.860 
actually social science. there's a lot of folks who have been taking

424
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.920 
courses like learning how to learn the science of well being

425
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.910 
is a very very popular course on coursera. there are also many

426
00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.880 
english language courses georgia tech has a course called improving

427
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.410 
your english language communications for business. so it's kind

428
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.190 
of a business related course. but it's language learning

429
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.640 
but again the vast majority of the course enrolments are being taken in courses

430
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:33.690 
that are generally career relevant courses and more aligned

431
00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:37.180 
toward learning a skill that will have some kind of

432
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.950 
relevance and currency in the job market.

433
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:50.550 
thank you i would say that with coursera for campus what we see is many

434
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:55.260 
liberal arts majors lots of students taking liberal arts degrees on campus

435
00:30:55.450 --> 00:31:00.780 
where that campus uses corsair for campus, those students are using coursera

436
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:06.780 
to almost add a technical minor to their degree or a concentration or like a

437
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:11.300 
diploma certificate to their degree. so I think that the ability for these

438
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.760 
more stem courses on coursera to complement a liberal arts

439
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.770 
undergraduate college degree. I think we're seeing a lot of

440
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:23.100 
that a lot of liberal arts students are supplementing their college degree

441
00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.120 
with more business and tech related courses on course or.

442
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:31.050 
ok and the another question when the colleges offer degrees

443
00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.910 
based on micro credentials, do they do the assessment themselves then? a

444
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.610 
very good question. so all of the court we have about five thousand

445
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.190 
one hundred courses from our educator partners,

446
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.210 
and all of those courses have assessments built into the courses

447
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:51.210 
and so there's something like four hundred and fifty thousand assessment questions

448
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.130 
embedded in all these courses, because it's not only a way of

449
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.540 
evaluating whether somebody knows something but actually facilitates

450
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.340 
the learning process when you have to recall and apply

451
00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.650 
what you've learned in course assessments. what we typically

452
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:10.160 
see with course or for campus is that universities will often use the assessments

453
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.540 
in the courses that are on coursera. but one of the things we've

454
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.590 
done for course or for campus is we've allowed

455
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.900 
our customers to author courses and author assessments or parts

456
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.570 
of courses video lectures or assessments or full courses

457
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.840 
to supplement the catalog that they can license from coursera. so

458
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.210 
universities can for instance take five hundred courses and

459
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.570 
make that on coursera or make those available to students.

460
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.480 
they can then author five courses, if they want to at no cost

461
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.460 
they can author five courses for their students that are private

462
00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.600 
just for their students and increasingly what universities

463
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.590 
are doing is saying i don't want to author a whole whole course,

464
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.190 
i want to take this course from say stanford but i want to

465
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:57.310 
author my own assessment for that course so that my students

466
00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.960 
get assessed on my learning objectives and so that assessment

467
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.790 
is not available to anybody else outside the university, so

468
00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.440 
it's sort of a hybrid between the course lecture material coming from one university

469
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.280 
and the assessment questions being authored privately by one

470
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.300 
of our campus customers who are licensing that course

471
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.530 
interesting. thank you. one less question we have time for one

472
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:24.100 
less question in the session from peter scott he is complimenting

473
00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.290 
your on your excellent presentation.

474
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:31.180 
do you feel the pandemic will lead to sustained change in your

475
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:36.350 
relationship with the universities or do you think the universities will
pivot back

476
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:42.480 
to the old normal as soon as they can?  yeah, i think they will

477
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.220 
not pivot back to the old normal. we see

478
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.660 
hundreds of universities who are now actually licensing courseware for campus

479
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.700 
integrating it into the curriculum.

480
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.840 
and you know not in every single case I would

481
00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:00.280 
but but the number of professors who say

482
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:06.640 
it's very effective to not have to create all the online content

483
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.960 
my first. well the first thing they say is my students want

484
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.930 
the flexibility of online learning they don't want to sit and

485
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:16.040 
listen to zoom lectures. the faculty are realizing that the

486
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.550 
quality and flexibility of having ready made content that i

487
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.890 
can mix in with my own is not unlike textbooks a long time ago. i mean

488
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.700 
professors are not in the current practice of writing all their

489
00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:31.090 
own course material and relying on no one else to help them

490
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.590 
they're actually there they're curated content from many different places
i think

491
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:39.120 
because the students are looking for it because the professors

492
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.710 
are wanting to mix in a synchronous high quality university content

493
00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.650 
into their courses and also many of the university administrators

494
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.830 
are realizing that students are looking often for advanced

495
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.830 
courses in internet of things and cybersecurity and block-chain and

496
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:59.110 
and other data science practices and other business practices in cloud computing

497
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.550 
many the faculty are

498
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:05.500 
many the schools don't have the faculty to teach those advanced topics

499
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.970 
and so rather than building out or trying to hire a much larger

500
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:13.940 
faculty, they're supplementing their curriculum with courses taught by

501
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.230 
other universities that have been created online over the last

502
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.960 
nine years. and so we're not well some might try to go back.

503
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.820 
but i think what we're going to see in a world where students

504
00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.430 
can choose which university they go to without having to go there,

505
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.120 
i think you're going to find that the learners will demand a blend

506
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.980 
of excellent live teaching and excellent asynchronous

507
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:39.790 
online learning and so i'm  fairly certain we're not going back.

508
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.170 
well, thank you thank you very much for joining

509

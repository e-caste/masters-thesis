00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.230 
This week, we want to speak about HTML document about the hypertext markup language

2
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.340 
documents. We already saw that the World Wide Web

3
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.940 
thrives on its contents- the linked hypermedia documents. And the hypermedia documents-

4
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.680 
they are designed with the special language and the special language is HTML-

5
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.060 
The Hypertext Markup Language.

6
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.510 
This is historical name if we would have to name it today we would

7
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.690 
speak about hypermedia markup language because not only text that's designed but

8
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.430 
it's HTML. And html its a simple markup language

9
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.880 
for the description of hypermedia documents.

10
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.820 
Hypermedia documents which are characterized by hyperlinks and which

11
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.820 
provide the content of the world wide web.

12
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.940 
In this sense, the HTML language is the third basic component

13
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.930 
of the World Wide Web.

14
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.790 
A basic component beside the URI,

15
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.020 
a scheme for identifying the documents in the World Wide Web

16
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and the http protocol- the Hypertext Transfer Protocol

17
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
which is used to provide the document from the server to the

18
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.150 
client and to send the request from the client to the server.

19
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.170 
HTML does not indicate a format or layout related description/

20
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.330 
HTML follows the idea that content description and layout description

21
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.110 
have to be separated.

22
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.410 
HTML into separation is responsible for describing the structure

23
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.640 
of the content.

24
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.110 
HTML is very simple and the simplicity is a major reason for the

25
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.830 
large popularity as the web has gained in the past.

26
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.570 
HTML language was originally based on SGML and the Standard Generalized Markup Language

27
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.830 
and to understand

28
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.340 
the HTML, we need to have a look at

29
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.770 
SGML language. SGML was developed in the 1960s.

30
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.240 
It was in a time when

31
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.190 
different computers came with different format

32
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.660 
and different formats for their documents.

33
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.110 
And people learned that it's important to have a format, that it's independent

34
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.850 
from computers, it's independent from the vendor of that computer.

35
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.950 
And in that time SGML was developed and SGML

36
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.480 
was a language describing various formats. We speak in case of SGML

37
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.950 
of a meta language, because if we look very exact to the SGML, we see

38
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.600 
it's not one simple language,

39
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.830 
but SGML is a possibility to define

40
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.140 
different languages and formats. So for every text,

41
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.080 
for every type of text document independent from the manufacturers,

42
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.320 
independent from the devices, independent from the application.

43
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.650 
By means of SGML, it's possible to describe such document. And the basic idea

44
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.960 
of SGML is the separation- separation of description of the document structure.

45
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.980 
The document structure, the logical division and the independency

46
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.220 
of the individual document parts of the paragraphs, the headlines and other things.

47
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.260 
And the presentation of the document and the presentation that formatting

48
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.740 
how it appears when we are printed, how it appears on a desktop.

49
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.630 
The advantage of this separation is that from

50
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.460 
a single SGML document,

51
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.410 
many different layout variants of this document can be created very easily.

52
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.430 
Why one needs this, of course you need a printed version of a document,

53
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.450 
you want to have it as a genre

54
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.700 
article, you want to have it as a book chapter,

55
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.010 
the other side you want to display it on a smartphone or you want

56
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.420 
to display it on a large desktop of a PC.

57
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:51.250 
So one single document, one single SGML document can be

58
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.860 
provided in different layout variants, and to describe the layout variants,

59
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.980 
there are different possibilities, there are different language means

60
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.100 
in place. So we have a document, a document consists of structure, chapter, paragraphs

61
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.690 
the headings, the figures, the table and other things. And a document

62
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.080 
is displayed on the layout, it's presented and it's important

63
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.280 
what font size, what typeface are used, what line spacing and others.

64
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.230 
And the basic idea of SGML and later HTML is to separate this two

65
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.650 
structure and the layout.

66
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.390 
SGML is a markup language and the reason to call it markup language is

67
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.320 
that the structural elements are characterized by so called

68
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.160 
markups. Markups are distinguished from the combination, are distinguished

69
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.420 
by a combination of special symbols, and such markups

70
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.610 
are stored inside the document file.

71
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.860 
So in between the text of the document, and to realize what is

72
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.760 
the text, what's the content, and what is the mark up,

73
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.530 
such mark up delimiters are used in case of SGML and HTML.

74
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.900 
These are two symbols. So for example, is the mark up which characterize that now

75
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:28.120 
a new chapter start is chapter mark up and then at the end of the chapter

76
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:35.430 
we can see this on this slash symbol, there is the mark up which display, which shows

77
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.220 
that this is the end of the chapter.

78
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.450 
In this way it becomes easier for the automatic processing of

79
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.900 
the document. The interpreter can easily distinguish between a command

80
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.090 
given by a mark up to interpret the next part of the document as a chapter,

81
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.390 
and the content of the chapter.

82
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.280 
The relations between the structural elements of an SGML document

83
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.680 
are described by the SGML documentary. We will see such a documentary

84
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.580 
is important for the

85
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.740 
document object model. So here there is a combination of what

86
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.280 
is the headline of a chapter, what is the text of the chapter, the

87
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.190 
footline, and the relation between the different chapters. They

88
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.620 
can be described by means of such documentaries.

89
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:40.300 
By means of SGML, it is also possible to define document classes,

90
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.360 
to give an example the document class of a book.

91
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.370 
So all the books are similar structure. They start

92
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.810 
with the title, then there are the authors,

93
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.050 
and content tables and the different chapters,

94
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.860 
then an index at the end, and

95
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.840 
not to give it as a task to each

96
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.120 
designer of a book, one

97
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.190 
SGML provides the possibility to define such a document class book.

98
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:18.830 
And then, if one also starts to write a book, he can use this

99
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.930 
definition. It's so called document type definition which characterize

100
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.760 
the general structure of a book and then he only needs to

101
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:35.590 
fill up the special markups, and special characteristic structural elements

102
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.090 
to design his own book.

103
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.230 
So let's come back to HTML.

104
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.330 
HTML is also a markup language and it's a

105
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.790 
markup language that's

106
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.830 
designed by means of SGML.

107
00:08:52.970 --> 00:09:00.480 
And when we have a more detailed look, we see that HTML is much simpler than SGML,

108
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.870 
because html is not a meta markup language.

109
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.810 
HTML can be considered as one special document type.

110
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:18.290 
So in HTML, only those language elements are used that are important to describe

111
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.370 
web documents.

112
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.270 
And the important thing in the web document characteristic

113
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:31.270 
is the hyperlink concept. So by HTML as hyperlinks

114
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.030 
may be characterized.

115
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.900 
An html document is displayed by a browser.

116
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.430 
If you want to have a link to it, you use your browser and your browser

117
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.900 
interprets your HTML.

118
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:53.280 
To be able to display an HTML document, the browser needs to understand

119
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.180 
the structure of this document.

120
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.890 
The browser needs an HTML interpreter

121
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.420 
to be able to identify the individual structural elements

122
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:10.150 
and then to assign them from the cascading stylesheets to assign

123
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.880 
them certain formats properties.

124
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.820 
For some historical reason, HTML does not

125
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:25.470 
consequently follow the strict separation between structure and presentation

126
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.720 
like it was given in SGML. SGML is a reasonable and the very beginning

127
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.370 
as a text where not including graphics and others it was only alphanumeric

128
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.990 
symbols. It was only considered as a technical

129
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.420 
mean to provide information. So in the very first

130
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.910 
version of HTML, there are also some

131
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.150 
formatting instructions.

132
00:10:54.590 --> 00:11:01.190 
But if you write a document, even if it also writes today an argument, it should

133
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.410 
follow the strict separation between the

134
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.390 
structure definition by means of HTML and formatting instructions that

135
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.760 
are given by so called cascading

136
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.760 
style sheets.

137
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.410 
Cascading style sheets, that is a language that provides format

138
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:31.360 
controls, which are assigned to the markups and helps the interpreter, helps the browser

139
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:37.610 
to understand in which way a structure element described by HTML

140
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.980 
is displayed, for example on the screen.

141
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:50.090 
If we look to the structure of an HTML document, then such HTML documents always starts

142
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.870 
with the HTML version information.

143
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.370 
For specialists, for you is its version information is the SGML document type definition

144
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.940 
from HTML.

145
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.360 
HTML document always consists of two parts: of a header

146
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.140 
and of a body. The header

147
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.740 
contains information about the

148
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.430 
HTML document. We speak here of meta-information

149
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.760 
and does not belong to the content, to the actual content of the document.

150
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.460 
It tells, for example who was the author of this document, what is the title,

151
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.870 
what are some keywords characterized in the text, which kind of coding

152
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.550 
or language is used. And the second part,

153
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.430 
of course, a very important part of the document is a so-called

154
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:52.440 
body. The HTML document body and this document body contains the actual content

155
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.300 
of the HTML document.

156
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:01.720 
Basic elements of the HTML body which describes the structure of the

157
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:07.380 
content is headings, are paragraphs, lists, tables, forms. Body

158
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.380 
takes special characteristics. This images, this hyperlinks,

159
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:16.990 
this is the special elements of the body of an HTML document.

160
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:26.410 
Like in SGML, the elements, HTML elements are identified by markups.

161
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.660 
The reason to call it a markup language,

162
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.520 
to call it a markup language. The markups are composed of a mark up

163
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:42.760 
identifier, the so called "tag". And are framed by the mark up delimiters, and we

164
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.690 
already showed that like in SGML, these are

165
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.450 
HTML markup delimiters.

166
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:56.150 
Structural elements are framed by a start tag

167
00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.910 
and by an end tag. So for example this is a start tag

168
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:07.980 
for a paragraph. It includes in this mark up delimiters

169
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:14.490 
is a 'p', which stands for paragraph and this is the end tag of a paragraph.

170
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.320 
It's the same, like the starting tag. The only difference is

171
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.870 
that it starts with a slash.

172
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.010 
In HTML, the end tags can be left out if

173
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.190 
there is no

174
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.390 
lost in clarity of interpretation of the document.

175
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:44.530 
Tags can also contain additional information, so called attributes.

176
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.680 
They can contain information, and attributes provide additional information,

177
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:58.520 
provide control, specifications and explain what to do with the structural element.

178
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:05.700 
If we look to one of the recent HTML versions, that's version 4.0.

179
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.970 
There are approximately eighty different tags specified.

180
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.560 
And if we look for the successor of HTML

181
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.740 
version 5, then the number of such tags was

182
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:25.080 
increased a lot, so there are approximately 120 tags.

183
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.810 
But it is backward compatible.

184
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.510 
To give an example for the use of an attribute,

185
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.390 
here we have

186
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.080 
chapter often of a document. The chapter

187
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.330 
is characterized by

188
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.950 
the id CSS, and then this chapter starts with the headline. And the headline,

189
00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.630 
you see here h1. The headline is a Cascading Style Sheet. So

190
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.250 
for example in a book about the World Wide Web,

191
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.810 
this is the headline of the chapter that

192
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.610 
explains cascading style sheet.

193
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.020 
And then inside the chapter we have different paragraphs.

194
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.560 
Paragraphs start with a starting tag, then we have the text

195
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.010 
of this paragraph, and then we have an end tag and of course

196
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.570 
in the chapter, we have different

197
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.810 
such paragraphs.

198
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.350 
There can be of course more

199
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.180 
parts in it but I want to hold it very simple.

200
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.660 
And here is another chapter. It is a chapter with id XML. You see in the

201
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.810 
mark up tag, there is an ID,

202
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:51.880 
identification added. We have a new headline. Everything is possible with

203
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.330 
XML. You see it's the next chapter in our

204
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.670 
book about the World Wide Web.

205
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:03.490 
This is the end of the headline same mark up like in the beginning, but

206
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.190 
shown as an end tag

207
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.340 
by means of the slash, and then we have the internal

208
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.740 
structure of this chapter as the different paragraphs and here

209
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.600 
is the chapter is finishing.

210
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:25.220 
This shows, gives you a feeling about the use of HTML and how

211
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.590 
documents are described by means of HTML.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.060 
Welcome to knowledge graphs. This is lecture number
six Advanced Knowledge Graph Applications.

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.570 
As always we start with
the lecture overview.

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.240 
So what we are going to do in
this lecture is of course we

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.440 
want to look at more advanced
applications. First of all we

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.620 
want to look deeper into knowledge
graphs and to understand you know

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.510 
how to characterize a knowledge graph.
So how can we make differences,

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.290 
how can we say this knowledge graph
should be preferred above another.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.510 
And there the first thing we look
into it is the graph of the

9
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.610 
knowledge graph. This means we are
looking for structural properties

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.110 
of that and try to compare. So this
graph in the knowledge graphs

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.740 
can actually be of huge size. In
order to approximate that we

12
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.680 
will start looking at the
knowledge graph embeddings.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.580 
And then we are going to use this
knowledge graph embeddings

14
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.500 
for knowledge graph completion
because it is not necessary that

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.900 
knowledge graphs can capture all the information,
all the knowledge in the universe.

16
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.380 
So in these two lectures you will
only deal with one knowledge

17
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.110 
graph but what if we have more
than one knowledge graph where

18
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.650 
which is depicting the
similar information?

19
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.240 
However it is complementary to
each other. So in order to deal

20
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.940 
with such kind of problems we will talk about
knowledge graph mappings and alignment.

21
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.270 
And in the last sections of the
lecture we will talk about

22
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.950 
information systems and how
knowledge graph can support these

23
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.720 
kind of information systems. As
first we are going to talk about

24
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.460 
semantic search. This is the
extension of traditional search

25
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.110 
with knowledge graph. So you know
this already, nowadays search

26
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.910 
engines always are based on
knowledge graphs and in semantic

27
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.240 
search you will see how this
works under the hood.

28
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.790 
And then we come up in the very
last chapter with something

29
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
which is still ongoing research and this
is so called exploratory research and

30
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.610 
then of course recommender systems.
You all know recommender

31
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.170 
systems. But exploratory search is a generalization
of pure recommendation. This means

32
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
what if I not exactly know,
if I don't exactly know how

33
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.880 
to phrase my search? If I try to
search in a complete unknown domain

34
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.610 
where I had first to gather knowledge
to be able to search? Then

35
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.580 
often I want to be guided
through the search space and

36
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.850 
this kind of exploration then is
referred to often as exploratory

37
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
search and we will talk about that
in the last part of the lecture.

38
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.980 
But first let's talk about the
graph in knowledge graphs.

Hi everyone! In this video we will
showcase the different types

2
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.700 
of data that a design researcher
might bring back from

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.150 
the fieldwork. First of all, let
me explain what we mean when

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.640 
we say "data" in design research.
We're talking about qualitative data.

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.130 
Data that is often gathered
in a very explorative way.

6
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.100 
If you took part in
our first MOOC

7
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.540 
you might remember that we asked
you to collect two types of

8
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.000 
data: notes from observing
and interviewing people

9
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.080 
and photos from an observation.
And there are a lot of different

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.820 
methods that you can use during
your empathy field work

11
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.250 
and a lot of different data points
that you might bring back

12
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.630 
from these methods. So we decided
on four method categories that

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.810 
we're going to show you in this
video: Qualitative interviewing,

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.660 
observation, immersion
,and cultural probes.

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.430 
When you conduct an interview
make sure that you capture what

16
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.920 
you hear. Write little notes,
because written notes will

17
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.810 
help you once you come back,
to remember what you heard.

18
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.330 
It's also very unobtrusive way
to talk to your interviewee.

19
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.810 
They might feel less nervous and
more comfortable in the situation

20
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.700 
because not everything they
say is set in stone.

21
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.330 
But you can also use audio
or video recordings.

22
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.750 
Design researchers
like to use these

23
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.960 
in case they want to replay them and
look for a very small details.

24
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.310 
When you observe a user behavior
you basically shadow someone.

25
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.400 
So for example you might want to
follow a user through the experience

26
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.580 
of commuting in a very busy
city or shopping in a mall.

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.920 
You often would like to write down
what you observe in written

28
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.460 
notes. Design researchers sometimes
also take pictures of surprising

29
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.350 
situations or behavior.
Sometimes they also take audio

30
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.050 
or video recording so they
can replay the scene later.

31
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.800 
And we might use templates to
visualize the observation we made.

32
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.770 
So for example: user journey
templates. Here, in a user journey

33
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.760 
template, we would draw the path
of a user through their day or

34
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.950 
through a certain
experience.

35
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.420 
Immersion is the attempt to put
yourself into the situation

36
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.660 
of your user. So for example, there
was a D-School team working

37
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.460 
on the challenge to redesign
the butcher business.

38
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.850 
And what they did to
immerse themselves

39
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.580 
was to spend a full day working
in a butchery like a real

40
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.980 
employee. They were
wearing their uniforms,

41
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.700 
they were doing their tasks and
they were experiencing the whole

42
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.890 
location. What you would bring
back from an immersion scenario

43
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.380 
as a data output are for example
notes of your feelings

44
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.260 
or you could also take pictures,
do audio or video recordings.

45
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.500 
Cultural probes are objects with
an instruction that you hand

46
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.550 
out to participants so they can
record their experience with

47
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.590 
a certain service or task. You
basically let the user do the work

48
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.430 
here. They document their thoughts,
their attitudes, their feelings,

49
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.840 
their behaviors and you try to look
at their personal perspective

50
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.270 
and build empathy for them. We
often use cultural probes over

51
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.540 
a certain amount of time so for
example over the course of several

52
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.900 
days or weeks or several events
so we can see some temporal

53
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.120 
changes or temporal patterns.
Cultural probes can be different

54
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.020 
things they can be disposable
cameras for example or diary

55
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.260 
entries or even sketches. I
once worked on a design

56
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.000 
project about the "listening to
the radio experience" and we

57
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.390 
asked users to write letters to
the radio to understand about

58
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.730 
their feelings for the radio. So
these could be love letters

59
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.750 
or eulogies. And these kind of things
can also be cultural probes.

60
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.780 
So in an in-depth design
research project you might

61
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
come back with a lot of notes,
objects, pictures that you take,

62
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.770 
so it's actually a huge
pile of qualitative data.

63
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.470 
And synthesis is all about
making sense of this data.

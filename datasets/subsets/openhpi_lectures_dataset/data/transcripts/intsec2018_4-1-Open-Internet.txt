1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.270 
The Internet it is an open
network. The internet consists

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.450 
of different components.
We already mentioned,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.880 
and often recorded that the
internet is a network

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.600 
of network. It consists of the
following components, of course,

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.940 
the devices, which
in this context

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.030 
are called as hosts. Maybe computers,
maybe laptops, smartphones

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.070 
maybe tablets or
printers or

8
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.570 
IOT devices. The second group of
component are the infrastructure

9
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.330 
components and intermediate
systems, which are used

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.970 
to connect devices to the network,
which ensures a network

11
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.920 
operation. For example,
the intermediate systems

12
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.030 
for connecting, networks, the
routers switches gateways.

13
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.030 
And, of course, a connection
medium is needed. The physical

14
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.340 
connection median. It can be a cabling,
it can be wireless connections,

15
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.560 
a radio and others. So this is
the components the internet

16
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.350 
is created of. The
important thing is,

17
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.160 
that the internet is an interconnection
of different networks.

18
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.460 
Here is an example, the routers
typically are interconnecting

19
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.050 
components. They interconnect
different networks.

20
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.540 
For example, here we have a network
of different users, which

21
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.800 
use computers and laptops
which are by means of

22
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.330 
a switch interconnected
to a network,

23
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.750 
which is connected
by this router,

24
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.110 
to another network. The network
here it is a wireless router,

25
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.340 
and some devices in this
case by a list of

26
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.270 
like the smartphones around.
Or here is another network.

27
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.030 
So it is a different
networks. Here, here, here

28
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.400 
are interconnected by routers
and the routers themselves are

29
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.900 
interconnected by
backbone systems.

30
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.880 
The different intermediate
systems have different tasks.

31
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.040 
So let's start with so called
gateways. The gateways

32
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.110 
make it possible, that
different applications

33
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.810 
are in the different
applications. The applications

34
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.230 
which run in a distributed ways
can communicate to each other.

35
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.640 
So the gateways helps the
application protocols

36
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.470 
are interconnected.
Here this is for

37
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.840 
those who knows
protocol stack

38
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.690 
is the placement of
these application.

39
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.360 
The routers, they interconnects
the standalone networks.

40
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.720 
You remember last a picture,
they are working on

41
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.200 
the internet and on
the transport layer.

42
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.410 
So switches, they are
need to connect devices

43
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.520 
to a network. So they are
acting on the network level

44
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.650 
and then they are
also devices

45
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.190 
called repeater in
place, which amplified

46
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.650 
the signals, so that
it's possible to

47
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.100 
transport the signals
over quite a distance

48
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.810 
on the hardware level.

49
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.320 
Now the problem is how
one can a address

50
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.150 
the data packages? How
the package reach

51
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.670 
his destination. There are
different levels of addresses.

52
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.250 
So, we have the DNS address,
domain name servers.

53
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.820 
The is the address you know, for
example, www.internet.com.

54
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.090 
Or www.openhpi.de.

55
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.540 
These are textual
addresses.

56
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.470 
The hostname and for a device,
for a computer or a smartphone,

57
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.840 
or printer or others.
So this addresses,

58
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.330 
are typically on the level of the
application. They are used on

59
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.860 
the application level.
Then we have Port.

60
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.130 
It's also addresses. For
example, the Port eighty,

61
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.660 
for the world wide
web servers. They

62
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.380 
make it possible, that the
communication between applications

63
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.170 
on end devices. It
comes with the host,

64
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:18.830 
host can access a web server.
Then we have the IP addresses.

65
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.650 
For example here
is, 192.168.0.1.

66
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.730 
this is needed for
the communication

67
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.490 
between devices across
network boundaries.

68
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.680 
So remember, the network was
a network of networks.

69
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.950 
So in this interconnected net.
In this interconnection

70
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.520 
of networks, device
needs unique address.

71
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.490 
So for example, to send an email.
One needs to know the computer

72
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.710 
of the address. And then,
at the lowest level,

73
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.160 
we have hardware addresses. This
are from this type here. To

74
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.620 
give an example, they
identify a device inside

75
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:14.530 
the network. So to go up this, here
is this kind of machine address.

76
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.220 
then with IP address, the different
device which have hardware

77
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.100 
address, get an additional
address to be

78
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.100 
identified in the
interconnection of all

79
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.410 
this networks. Then under
different devises,

80
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.140 
they run applications, which
are characterized by the

81
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.370 
port. So one has, if i want
to use an application

82
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.750 
on a remote a computer, one
has to know its ip address.

83
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.820 
And one that has to knows
the port of that device,

84
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.530 
and to have textual
addresses

85
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.010 
domain name service
its have for.

86
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.990 
Next point to repeat how
information are transported

87
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.910 
through the internet. The technique
is called packet switching

88
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.330 
and the idea is that the
messages which is to be sent

89
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.430 
through the internet
are distributed and

90
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.670 
and send in form
of data packets.

91
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.150 
Data packets which run independently
through the Internet.

92
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.500 
They use to come from the
sender to the receiver.

93
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:37.330 
They are transported as long
as so-called route from

94
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.260 
the sender to the receiver. This
is the way the individual

95
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:48.100 
data packets are transmitted.
So on their way from this to

96
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.350 
the receiver, they may pass
through different intermediate

97
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.730 
stations, and may pass
through intermediate

98
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.440 
and networks.

99
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.840 
It is not defined from the start. So
there is no one who may compute

100
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.770 
for each data package what is the
a route through the internet.

101
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.320 
No. Each intermediate station
only makes a decision how to

102
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.840 
forward the data package to the
next right switching station.

103
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.300 
This technique is a very
efficient and called

104
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.480 
"Next Hop". Of course a special
routing procedures are

105
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.060 
place into routers and
ensure that the best route

106
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.530 
is find for the data package
from the sender to

107
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.320 
the receiver. Coming back
to this packet switching.

108
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:50.940 
The message may be disputed
in different data packets

109
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.700 
to have special size and also
to fulfil other requirements.

110
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.000 
And it's possible that
the different packets

111
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.440 
use different routes through the
internet. For example, if the

112
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.490 
are traffic situation is changed
and another route is faster,

113
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:13.380 
then in this decision mechanisms
that for each device in each

114
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.550 
intermediate station
the decision is taken

115
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.110 
to which neighbour station
the packets sent,

116
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:26.880 
helps to provide it and to
guarantee is efficient working in

117
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.750 
a situation of the internet. If
a packet is very large and

118
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.890 
it have to pass through
networks who are not able

119
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:41.270 
to deal such large packets.
Then the package, the large

120
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:47.140 
packages need to be
fragmented. Fragmented

121
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:52.860 
means the information
of the package

122
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.090 
is distributed into
smaller packets.

123
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.600 
Of course, each of these
packages will be in

124
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:04.040 
the number of those that
is possible for the

125
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.270 
receiver to defragment the
smaller package in order to

126
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.330 
at the end to get the integrated
massage from the receiver.

127
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.550 
These are the basics of packet
switching and in this

128
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.580 
way is packet switching technology
called as store and forward

129
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.620 
switching. Store in the
intermediate system and forward

130
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.280 
to the neighbour
intermediate system,

131
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.760 
which lies on the parts of the
data package to the receiver.

132
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.990 
To transfer their of packets
from intermediate station

133
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.740 
to the intermediate stations
is store and forward.

134
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.520 
The data in this way are temporary.
The data is temporarily

135
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.290 
stored on intermediate systems,
on a switch, on a router

136
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.990 
then the router
makes the decision

137
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.000 
by means of his routing
protocols a decision

138
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:04.160 
to whom the package
will be send and then

139
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:11.770 
the router takes the information
and places it rapid with

140
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.420 
a data package which is
valid in the next network

141
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:22.230 
that has to be past. So we have
our sender which sends a package

142
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.320 
and these are the intermediate
stations, and here in between

143
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:32.760 
they are different networks. Perhaps
with a completely different

144
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.680 
technologies. But here is the
systems they know what is the

145
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.780 
technology of system network,
what is a technology of set

146
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.350 
work, those they are
able to translate the

147
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.450 
package from one technology
to another one.

148
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:54.760 
and this is done up the data
are reach the receiver and

149
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.360 
the receiver is able
to reconstruct the

150
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.340 
data, which are sent by
means of the packages.

151
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.080 
Here small animation. Now,
let's speak about network

152
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.980 
vulnerability on the internet. Many
of the security risks of the

153
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.520 
Internet and of the
Inter-networking technology

154
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.050 
can be explained by the history of the
Internet. They had their reasons.

155
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.690 
Because the internet is
started as a research

156
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:31.060 
project. So the internet
protocols, the

157
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:36.110 
network operating system, this was
developed in a research project.

158
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.270 
And the question which the
researchers want to answer

159
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.090 
was the following: does it
possible to transmit data

160
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.420 
from one network technology to
another network technology?

161
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.740 
And so they are very much concentrated
because the networks from

162
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.030 
which are run by different
technologies. For example, Ethernet

163
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.440 
or ATM that cannot
directly connected.

164
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.990 
So they need to be developed a technique,
which was as internetworking

165
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.820 
technique to make it
possible, that even if the

166
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.760 
neighbor network are run with
different technologies,

167
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.490 
data could be transmitted. Nobody
was thinking of that from

168
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:26.840 
this research project
a world wide new

169
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.700 
network came up. And it is a
network that connects billions

170
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.640 
of users. This
was completely

171
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.370 
unimaginable. So the
original assumption was:

172
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.560 
it's a small number of users
that one to interconnect and

173
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.470 
of course also as users are
trustworthy persons as well as

174
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.060 
colleagues from other
research groups.

175
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.280 
So in this research
project, security did not

176
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:58.090 
feature or had only is
subordinate role.

177
00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:03.640 
In the development, people said let's
first start with the functionality

178
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.880 
agenda. And the challenges is,
that the functionality works

179
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.240 
correct way and later on
if we have understood

180
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:17.670 
this, we can think about security.
But the internet protocols

181
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.130 
had become so
famous that

182
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.460 
the popularity of the internet
was increasing so much. So that

183
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.430 
the protocols from the
origin research project

184
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.380 
and now are used to run the
internet. There is one

185
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.400 
particular problem with the
internet protocols that we

186
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:44.500 
have in place is, that there
are no mechanism, almost no

187
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.570 
mechanisms for reliable
authentication and authorization.

188
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:53.000 
The authentication
is to identify

189
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:58.330 
who is it, who wants to send the
message, and who wants to use

190
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:04.160 
the service. And is he or she, the
authorisation, allows to do this?

191
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.020 
So is there are no mechanisms.
So that's easy to impersonate

192
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:14.450 
someone else internet, both for the
internet and for the transport

193
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.940 
protocols, as well as for
the application protocols.

194
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.690 
HTTP protocol for the world wide
web, SMTP protocol for email,

195
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.360 
and POP3 for email, the internet
protocol for the transport,

196
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.440 
the ICMP protocols and the
TCP protocol and others.

197
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.880 
So in this problem, allows
the following attacks.

198
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.980 
Allows the counterfeiting of
addresses.. What is called

199
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.170 
Spoofing. This allows to
interpose connections

200
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:52.500 
to run such men in the middle
attacks. This allows to bypassing

201
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.380 
authentication. So it is
privilege escalation.

202
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.690 
You see these are very
different types of

203
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.750 
attacks, which have
the same background,

204
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.240 
that in the protocols,
internet protocols

205
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.560 
authentication authority
mechanisms are missing.

206
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:17.190 
Also connections are not secure.
Based on the original assumptions

207
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.700 
that the internet is used
only by trust versus users.

208
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.470 
The messages and the data packages
are sent in plain text.

209
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.730 
And when there's an
plain text, everyone

210
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:34.450 
who has access to the internet can
read this the data packets and even

211
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:40.480 
he or she can modify the
data that are transported.

212
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.990 
And this allows all the
number of other attacks.

213
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.090 
So the interpose connections, the
"Man-in-the-Middle" attack.

214
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.750 
Listening, Eavesdropping, as sniffing
the data that are transported

215
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.400 
through the internet. So those
are the mechanisms, those

216
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.240 
are the tech families we will
discuss with more details

217
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.860 
in the next course.

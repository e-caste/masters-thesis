00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.240 
Welcome to video clip 3 in which we
introduce decision requirements diagrams.

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.900 
So looking at the elements of
decision requirements diagrams

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.540 
first of all we of course have
the decision and the decision

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.000 
determines the from a set of
input values typically one

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.630 
output value. So DMN also allows
more than one output value but

6
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.780 
in most cases one output
value suffices.

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.550 
A decision is assigned a decision
logic but a decision can

8
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.830 
also invoke something called
a business knowledge.

9
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.770 
A business knowledge you
see here in the lower

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.650 
right part a slightly different
symbol than the decision.

11
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.850 
Business knowledge contains knowledge
on how a decision should be taken.

12
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.350 
If you want business
knowledge captures decision

13
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.980 
logic that can be reused
by different decisions.

14
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.760 
Therefore business knowledges
are invoked by decisions and

15
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.450 
this invocation works as follows
though in order to take the decision

16
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.350 
the input data of the decision is
transferred to the business knowledge,

17
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.330 
the business knowledge computes
the output of the decision

18
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.920 
and provides the output
back to the decision

19
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.070 
that called the business knowledge.
We have that in an example

20
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.090 
a bit later in
this video clip.

21
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.400 
We also learned we also have
seen examples of input data.

22
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.590 
So input data is another important element
in decision requirements diagrams.

23
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.610 
Obviously input data for decisions can
be represented using this shape.

24
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.650 
This data is used during
decision making.

25
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.480 
It can be linked to a process
model also by labels. So a label

26
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.940 
of an input data object can be
the same label that is found

27
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.210 
as a data object in
a BPMN diagram.

28
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.680 
But as we also seen before input
data can also use attributes

29
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.850 
that are not provided
on the BPMN level.

30
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.020 
Knowledge sources are a way to
represent reasons for decisions

31
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.640 
and that's mainly for documentation
purposes. So we can specify

32
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.070 
for instance certain legal
regulations that have an impact

33
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.760 
on how a certain decision is taken.
We can also represent business

34
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.210 
policies that we run in
order for a decision to

35
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.880 
be taken in a certain way that is
specified by that business policy.

36
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.890 
And we can also represent human
experts when we have a decision

37
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.760 
and we have a knowledge source
that can be human expert and we

38
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.240 
can represent this human expert also
in decision requirements diagrams.

39
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.640 
Here's an abstract example of a decision
requirements graph that basically

40
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.280 
is used two show the different
types of dependencies.

41
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.070 
So here we have
a decision one

42
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.070 
and decision one uses the output
provided by decision two. So decision

43
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.310 
two is a sub-decision
to decision one.

44
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.490 
The output of decision two is not
immediately used by the process

45
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.180 
or by some invoking environment
but the output of decision

46
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.010 
two travels along this and that is
called information requirements edge

47
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.500 
to decision one that is one
input to decision one and

48
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.260 
is treated as a normal
input to a decision one.

49
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.310 
Decision one also is associated to
the to this knowledge source one

50
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.000 
and the association between a
knowledge source and a decision

51
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.500 
is called authority requirement.
You need a certain authority

52
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.560 
to take that decision.

53
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.760 
We see that decision tool has
an input data here so input

54
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.140 
data to decision two is represented again
by these information requirements edge

55
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.280 
and we also see that decision
two is related to a business

56
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.600 
knowledge that
we see here.

57
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.300 
So whenever decision two needs
to be taken, the input data

58
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.450 
of that decision is transferred
to the business knowledge.

59
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.130 
The business knowledge takes
the decision and returns

60
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.470 
the output of the decision
back to decision two.

61
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.440 
That output in this example travels
along the information requirements

62
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.480 
edge to be used by decision one
to take the final decision.

63
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.930 
So that's basically how the
relationship between decisions and

64
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.980 
and business knowledges are and how
the invocation in principle works.

65
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.680 
So I like to return to the
credit card example that we

66
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.640 
discussed a
bit earlier.

67
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.740 
And the decision we can express
that the decision uses

68
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.240 
applicant age and employment
status as input

69
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.450 
and the decision is based on
eligibility policy of the institution

70
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.940 
and the legal document. And we
can represent this setting of

71
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.270 
this environment if you want and
have the decision using the

72
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.460 
decision requirements
diagram that we see here.

73
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.570 
So here again we have the same our
decision is determined basic

74
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.150 
credit card eligibility, we have the
two inputs that we've seen before.

75
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.930 
But here also we can add knowledge
sources talking about the

76
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.320 
eligibility policy that is
used to take the decision

77
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.550 
and also a certain legal document
that guides us on how the decision

78
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.680 
should be taken.

79
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.590 
To extend on that example that is the
decision invokes the business knowledge

80
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.510 
eligibility rules and so that
is another example of how

81
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.910 
the invocation works here. Again
the structures or the let's say

82
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.090 
procedure is the same as just
indicated before. So whenever

83
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.290 
the determine basic credit card
eligibility activity needs

84
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.770 
to be executed the input is taken, is
transferred to the eligibility rules

85
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.370 
business knowledge where the eligibility
policy and the legal documentation are

86
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.250 
legal the legal
document are used

87
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.480 
to guide the decision taking here.
After the decision has been taken

88
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.500 
the output value is transferred
back along this edge,

89
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.260 
and well we have executed
then this determine basic

90
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.040 
credit card eligibility
decision.

91
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.680 
One of the questions we wanted
to ask is, or wanted to answer

92
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.450 
with DMN is who is actually responsible
for taking a certain decision.

93
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.700 
So we want to look at
organizational aspects as well.

94
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:28.260 
DMN provides attributes for
decisions that allow us

95
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.150 
to specify decision maker and also
decision owner. So very similar

96
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.520 
to what we have seen in DMN, you get
more than what you see normally.

97
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.840 
So there are attributes associated
to some of the modeling

98
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.130 
or to modeling elements and you
can use these elements to

99
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.910 
enrich the model and these attributes
are also part of the DMN standard.

100
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.740 
So here we have in the lower part
we have a screenshot. I hope

101
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.600 
that it's that you
can also read it.

102
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:07.290 
That's a screenshot from the signavio
system which you can use to

103
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.190 
model DMN or to model
in DMN decisions.

104
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:17.100 
Here you have an attribute called decision
maker and an attribute decision owner.

105
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.680 
A decision maker is a member
of the credit card checking

106
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.300 
department and decisions owner is the head
of the credit card checking department.

107
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.560 
So he can represent also on the
DMN level you can represent

108
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.970 
who is a decision maker and who
is the decision owner and the

109
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.650 
decision maker is the person
or role that actually takes

110
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.550 
the decision operationally take
the decision and the decision

111
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.630 
owner is the person or the role
that is responsible for the

112
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.990 
decision that is made the head
of the department or the head

113
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.440 
of some organizational
entity responsible

114
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.770 
for taking the decision therefore
somehow owning that decision.

115
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.450 
I'd like to conclude this video
clip with a sample scenario where

116
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.950 
we have withdrawals of funds at
a bank. So a client expresses

117
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.130 
the wish to withdraw nine thousand
euros from his bank account,

118
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.690 
the bank needs to take decisions
or the bank needs to take

119
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.720 
the decision whether or not
the funds can be provided.

120
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:25.960 
So we start with a decision defining
decisions and sub decisions.

121
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.150 
So the decision is called
check withdrawal request

122
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.690 
that is based on two sub decisions.
Well we need to have sufficient

123
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.960 
funds in the account

124
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:43.000 
and we also need a valid identification
of the person who wants to

125
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.890 
to retrieve the money.

126
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.820 
We can extend the decision
requirements diagram with additional

127
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:57.000 
information so we need
data to analyze to check

128
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.010 
whether there are sufficient funds and so
we need one data object called amount.

129
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.070 
We have another data object
called funds and the funds is

130
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.030 
the current let's say the current
money that is on the account.

131
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.050 
So and the activity or the
decision sufficient funds takes

132
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.920 
the amount and the funds and
decides whether or not the

133
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.500 
well the funds are exceed the
amount that is that has been

134
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.930 
withdrawn in the easiest case.
And the output is then

135
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.770 
of course used by the cheque
withdrawal request decision.

136
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.600 
We said that we also need to check the
identification and we have here three

137
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:45.710 
input data. So the customer the
customer data age, customer

138
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.600 
data nationality and the
identification documents. So these

139
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.990 
three data objects need to be provided in
order to check the valid identification

140
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:59.100 
and the output again of the decision
travels to this check withdrawal

141
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.170 
request decision.

142
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.370 
We can define a additional
knowledge sources as just too

143
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.130 
to extend that example a little bit.
So we have knowledge sources that

144
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.520 
here we have a say some legal
regulation that is used for

145
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.500 
checking the valid identification
for documentation purposes

146
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.870 
and that gives again valuable
information for the designer

147
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.260 
of such a system so which
legal regulations is used by

148
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.130 
which decision.

149
00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.290 
Finally and that's of course not
part of a decision requirements

150
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.320 
diagram and also not part of
this of this video clip

151
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.570 
that is a decision logic and the
decision logic will then be

152
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.600 
covered in the
next video clip.

153
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.560 
To conclude videoclip three in which we
discussed decision requirements diagram.

154
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.800 
We looked at the structure of
the decision and if you want

155
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.680 
their context so what is the input
data, which knowledge sources

156
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.900 
are there, which reusable parts
which reusable decisions

157
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.820 
and formal business knowledges are
available to my organization.

158
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.970 
We talked about the modernization
of decisions, so a decision

159
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.760 
can be used by another decision and
that can give rise to hierarchical

160
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:23.600 
structure in which some high level
decision is then refined by serious

161
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.000 
of more low level
decisions.

WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520 
okay, so perhaps we can

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.970 
start the session. we're going to have for the second session

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.310 
of the international track

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.240 
representations the two first ones are papers accepted papers.

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.110 
and the third one is a writing talk.

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.540 
the format that we're gonna follow with. we're gonna have

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.210 
each one of the presentations followed by a direct,
question to this presenter.

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.790 
and at the end of the session we'll have a sort of our own

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.320 
table which you can read these are questions to
the all the participants.

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.950 
more general not particularly or nearly related to the talk

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.850 
and more general about the international track topic whatever you want.

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
as we start with the talk manifestation changes and completion rates.

13
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.790 
our learners from conscious of different development is
statistically affected.

14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.240 
and it will be sarkar her shown the one percent in a

15
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.980 
flourish or says. thank you Jose.

16
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.820 
so i share my scream,

17
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.960 
came i can begin.

18
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.240 
so hello may be silent, i'm happy to be here with you and thank

19
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
you all for coming to my presentation.

20
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.540 
today I will present the research during my postdoctoral fellowship

21
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.770 
as a member of the research group cased

22
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.210 
just MOOC case played by doctor will alexander one.

23
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.350 
together with my colleagues for sent the other we investigated

24
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.630 
the effect of magnetisation changes on completion rates in

25
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.980 
a massive open online learning environment

26
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.250 
on a set of MIT MOOCs.

27
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.090 
the MOOC movement holds a great promise to the world facilitating

28
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.690 
quality education for free to anyone with access to the internet.

29
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.040 
on the top right map, we see internet user rates from the country

30
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.340 
population by column coding.
and that blow means a higher penetration rate,

31
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.180 
more read towards brown means lower penetration rate.

32
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.520 
In the bottom right map is the level of the united nations.

33
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.990 
human development index of the various countries when that green

34
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.030 
indicates small development.

35
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.570 
we think that there is an association between
the top and the bottom map.

36
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.990 
this is a positive correlation between penetration rates
and development status

37
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.210 
though not really equal access.

38
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.790 
MOOCs were initially free.

39
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.310 
it took a couple of years for the big learning platforms to

40
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.570 
realise the need in monetizing their content,

41
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.230 
as we delve into the background and data to set a point in

42
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.340 
time as a reference change point.

43
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.150 
the pivot of our analysis is January 1st 2016.

44
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.050 
anyone with internet access include many more learners
from the developing countries.

45
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.630 
these learners are less likely to complete the MOOC.

46
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.510 
more completion is the standard measured learning goal in MOOC research.

47
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.310 
the verified and paid for certificates offered after the change point

48
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.050 
appeal to vocational training, yet its effect on completion

49
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.630 
rates. and engagement is at most moderately poverty.

50
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.780 
the effect can go in any direction theoretically,

51
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.260 
it can be positive for example due to thinking cost fallacy

52
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.650 
or directly negative by motivating learners that are financially weaker.

53
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.530 
we use the standard conventions for the definitions
of developed and developing world.

54
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.180 
we define two sub-populations of

55
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.810 
learners from the majority world

56
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.590 
and the minority world that are the developing and developed countries.

57
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.730 
the english native speakers walt is part of
the minority developed world.

58
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.780 
more specifically in this research, the native english speakers

59
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.840 
are defined as entering the MOOC

60
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.850 
from an ip maxx to one of the countries listed in the yellow box.

61
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.610 
these learners are excluded from the study and allowed to focus

62
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.080 
on development beyond the effects of language as most MOOCs

63
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.370 
instruction language is english.

64
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.480 
we looked at one hundred and thirty five runs of sessions
of eighty three MOOCs.

65
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.790 
the blue table is a presentation of the population of non native

66
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.180 
english speaking learners of the MOOC id.

67
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.050 
it illustrates for each move the input of the learning analytics to use

68
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.530 
which are based on proportions.

69
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.350 
the symbol a represents the amount of learners who completed the mooc.

70
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.240 
and used an ip address mapped to a high HDI country,

71
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.310 
instead of the completion rate a/a fifty representing
completion ratio.

72
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.120 
we observe the completion odds a/b.

73
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.550 
odds carrying more desirable statistical properties and more

74
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.820 
specifically proportions of the odds the odds ratio.

75
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.830 
we define completion by us as the lesser odds of learners from

76
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.310 
developing countries to complete the MOOC.

77
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.610 
this is the characteristic we calculate for each MOOC individually.

78
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.340 
we examine it over a set of moocs. and the results

79
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.830 
are fixed to research questions are designed to demonstrate

80
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.960 
the change point with respect to completion by us and its effect

81
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.410 
on learning in the two groups.

82
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.710 
the last question takes a deeper look on completion by us in

83
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.750 
a selection of individual MOOCs and its behavior
along different sessions.

84
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.470 
strengthening known results on inequality in moocs we showed

85
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.390 
that on the set of thirteen moves offered before the change

86
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.250 
learners from developing countries are having lesser
odds to completing MOOC.

87
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.070 
the distribution of the completion by us in different MOOCs sessions,

88
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.520 
revealed that the change has worsened the situation and the

89
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.500 
completion by us after the change indicates that
learners from developing countries

90
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.960 
are even less successful after the change.

91
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.500 
and observe their no effect,

92
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.190 
now distribution here which represents a situation where no

93
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.890 
completion bias exists.

94
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.980 
each line in the plot is an individual MOOC and the points

95
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.380 
on each line represent sessions of data.

96
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.470 
we can see different behaviors of the completion bias dynamics

97
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.790 
in different sessions,

98
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.750 
comparing the mean values for each MOOC before and after the change,

99
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.160 
we see the significant effect of the change point.

100
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.990 
significance was established in a two way anova analysis,

101
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.370 
and the effect is positive.

102
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.990 
we found that payment was has worsened the learning experience

103
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.120 
of learners from developing countries.

104
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:04.900 
we concluded that more inclusivity in marks.
A globally important goal

105
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.850 
might be achieved by directly addressing the needs of those

106
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.100 
learners who face a more difficult learning experience in the MOOC.

107
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.030 
MOOCs are widely used in various contexts for diverse purposes.

108
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.660 
our methodologies can be used for reproduction research action research

109
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.120 
or in collaboration with other reliable data on the learners
and the MOOCs.

110
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.460 
if anyone is interested in collaboration please do not hesitate

111
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.910 
to contact me, or my colleagues directly.

112
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.070 
thank you to anyone who helped in making this research possible.

113
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:53.320 
and thank you all for listening.

114
00:08:54.850 --> 00:09:00.440 
thank you. thank you sir. congratulations on this talk

115
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.340 
that you've been able to simplify a complex research in

116
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.070 
a very monotone representation with clear take aways.

117
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.510 
I want to open the floor for questions, feel free to either

118
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.650 
write them in the chat, raise your hand or yes open your mic.

119
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.610 
we have a question for another thing.

120
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.080 
the study was done with moocs from addicks

121
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.470 
right? do you know whether this would be there will be a similar

122
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.610 
trend with MOOCs from other

123
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.290 
offerings, lycosa or also in europe,

124
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.450 
i don't know whether studies or similar studies have been done there,

125
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.350 
do you have any guess?

126
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:04.180 
and so i'm currently involved in a research that is asking
this exact question.

127
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.390 
and i have data from other providers as well.

128
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:16.350 
and the research is still being done.
so i don't have a clear answer yet.

129
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.980 
but my intuition would say that

130
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.570 
yes, this trend will be reproducible

131
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.790 
on other platforms. and because

132
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:33.430 
it's a global phenomena. i don't think there's anything particularly

133
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.700 
special about fedex or

134
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.890 
smokes except for being exceptional in both

135
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.580 
that them that can explain this kind of effect.

136
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.330 
thank you.

137
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.860 
thank you.

138
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.760 
well, i have a question.

139
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.350 
geo based pricing.

140
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.780 
could have an impact on these numbers have you explored
this question specifically.

141
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.550 
and have you come to a conclusion whether that would be appropriate

142
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.890 
or the solution needs to be found somewhere else?

143
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.770 
so i'm thank you for the question, i'm really happy for this question.

144
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.740 
because that's exactly the direction i'm pointing at.

145
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.350 
and it's a great question because they don't have an answer.

146
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.330 
but it's a worthwhile research.

147
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.660 
so yeah i think, it's a great thing to look at next.

148
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.350 
thank you.

149
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.360 
there was part of the question that i had as well as that we

150
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.910 
see a clear effect of

151
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.910 
policy decisions on the gaps.

152
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.250 
and yesterday actually matt was also with me in the room.

153
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.540 
i think Mike was discussing the fact that.

154
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.940 
this kind of policy reduction based on g is hattem future lab.

155
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.250 
perhaps you can bring that question back into the table Matt.

156
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.610 
if he's here, put him on the spot.

157
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.690 
that's gone well.

158
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.840 
for what i remember just today. Matt was discussing that the

159
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.340 
implemented in future land

160
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.310 
adapting the price based on the when the geo.

161
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:44.740 
but since usually happens in these things, then you see people

162
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.900 
coming from affluent countries and connecting via vpns to get

163
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.580 
the discount that the courses and so on. they get the discount

164
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.270 
and then they reconnect from their normal ip.

165
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.380 
i'm sorry, i was having a technical problem i can clarify

166
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.410 
that we saw in our geo pricing experiment that it wasn't quite that way.

167
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.300 
it was that we were still not reaching the right socio-economic

168
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:17.540 
levels that we're hoping for by effectively making
the price of the course more suitable.

169
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.580 
normally lower is probably the direction.
it was going in,

170
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.790 
but we found we still attracted english-speaking professionals

171
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.440 
that tended to still have educational qualifications. and while

172
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.860 
that's absolutely fine obviously one of the hopes is with reducing

173
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.240 
price or increasing access, and typically professionals who

174
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.010 
are somewhat already educated. they've already got something

175
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.160 
out of the education system. we were hoping that reducing the

176
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.310 
price would enable those that feel cut out from the education system.

177
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.390 
predominantly due to price that would help resolve that issue.

178
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.680 
but we took some good learnings from that exercise we've actually

179
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.340 
run it three times. and so i think while price is such a major

180
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.520 
concern and issue for lots of things in the world.
it's not the only one.

181
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.800 
so you have to match it up with other complicated factors.

182
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.130 
yes i completely agree,

183
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.740 
so it's something i thought about.

184
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:25.770 
and i have some ideas about ways to implement.

185
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.520 
this kind of a policy that is geo-location sensitive

186
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:39.620 
in a way that can a line goals of learners from

187
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:44.110 
high hd countries.  In such a way that

188
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.110 
maybe they can choose to. i don't know.

189
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.330 
support a learner from low hd country in such a way that

190
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.970 
might give everyone

191
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:04.670 
a social value in a way that is like synergetic.

192
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:12.620 
and also a financially sustainable.

193
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.340 
but it's a good question.

194
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.260 
i don't really and i haven't done the research yet,

195
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.010 
so i don't have anything more

196
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.720 
clever to say about this issue.

197
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.460 
but it's one direction that is applicable from this research.

198
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.690 
and i'm happy to provide this stepping stone

199
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.950 
from looking on actual learning patterns

200
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.900 
over the last couple of years.

201
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:54.060 
and they're looking at them from this perspective combining policy

202
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.440 
and it's effect on learning behaviors on the platform.

203
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.390 
thank you for the comments or any other question.

204
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.790 
okay. so let's then move to the second second talk. thank you.

205
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.510 
sorry, so much for your presentation. and your work.

206
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.830 
for the second talk we have hybrid MOOCs enabled enabling global

207
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.870 
collaboration which will be presented by Johana.

208
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.160 
hello everyone here, let me just start by sharing my screen.

209
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.210 
can you now see it well. and here miss. ok great.

210
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.650 
first of all thank you so much for having us today.

211
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.860 
it's a real pleasure to comment and present our paper.

212
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.820 
my name is Johana Hoskin. and I come from haga university of

213
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.660 
applied sciences in finland.
and i'm here today with my colleague Maya Suonpää.

214
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:05.120 
she will also help to answer to any questions you might have

215
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.260 
after this session. but i'll shortly present our paper.

216
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:15.450 
I'm also Anette Kairikko has been working with us on this. and our

217
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.670 
topic is the hybrid mix enabling global collaboration between learners.

218
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:30.350 
first, i'm sorry, i'm just going to hide your screens,

219
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.020 
because otherwise i don't see the text.

220
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.290 
there we go. the aim of our paper was to study through action research.

221
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.960 
so it's a qualitative research that we did on how does the hybrid

222
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.880 
moke design enable global collaboration between learners.

223
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.700 
in our paper we define hybrid

224
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.470 
MOOCs as purely online MOOCs which combine elements from both

225
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:58.570 
x mooc and the c mooc designs.
so this is not hybrid in the sense that

226
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:03.250 
something would happen in the classroom as well as online.
it's purely online and

227
00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.650 
it just has these two elements combined.

228
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:15.170 
well the MOOC of our research was a part of an eu-funded project

229
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.460 
called the core ship. and the MOOC was called koen innovation

230
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.660 
journey for startups and corporates. and we held that last spring

231
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.180 
and twenty twenty right when corona hit. so that might have

232
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.390 
impacted a little bit the number of participants that we had,

233
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.450 
because we were quite surprised we got so many.

234
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.190 
it was jointly designed and created and implemented

235
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.160 
by the consortium of this project which was seven european

236
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.500 
partners representing universities corporate start-ups
and innovation networks.

237
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.810 
and the target audience was startup entrepreneurs corporate

238
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.720 
managers and higher education students. and it was a six week course.

239
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.770 
four weeks was the x MOOC part and two weeks was the c MOOC part.

240
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:07.840 
and learners had to individually sign up for both.

241
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.320 
so first they completed the x mooc part,
then they had the option of signing

242
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.120 
separately to the c mooc part, so part of our learners did both

243
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:22.060 
of these parts and just shortly about the design.

244
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:28.030 
the x mooc part was really like focused on giving theory.

245
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:33.660 
and the main concepts about the topic to our learners.
and it was completely individual learning.

246
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.810 
we did have discussion forums open, but it was quite limited.

247
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.150 
how much discussion was going on. of course. they asked questions

248
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:47.410 
about how to do the topics and they did share ideas
and in that sense collaborate.

249
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.280 
but there was no like online sessions or anything in this part.

250
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:59.030 
and the c MOOC part which then continued was all about
like applying that

251
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.610 
theory and those concepts in a simulated case study.

252
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.920 
and they, the learners worked in teams on those cases.

253
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.720 
and in this case they had their own collaboration space.

254
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.710 
this was in the MOOC house platform which where we have the conference.

255
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.830 
so there was like collapse space that they used there.

256
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.900 
also they worked outside of the platform, so they were open

257
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.790 
to using other things like whatsapp, zoom and so forth.

258
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.790 
well about the amount of learners that  we had almost

259
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.240 
2,500 enrolled for the expo part,

260
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.480 
and 66%  of these were actually active in the expo

261
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.680 
part of the course, and 30% out of those completed the course.

262
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.500 
so that the course part the expo course part, and that was quite high,

263
00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.540 
then out of those roughly around 200

264
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.700 
and roll'd for the sema part and 65% of those were active

265
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.710 
and 58 completed the c MOOC course.

266
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.570 
so we had quite high completion rates. but as i said earlier

267
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.920 
one thing that could have impacted was corona because people

268
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.380 
were you know stayed at home and had a little bit more time

269
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.840 
to put on this course.

270
00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.820 
just shortly about the profiles of the one hundred thirty five

271
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.680 
learners who actively took part in both of the MOOC parts.

272
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.220 
the average age was 37， and it ranged from 21 to 60.

273
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.720 
so it was quite a high age compared to typical university courses.

274
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:50.470 
65% were male only 3% were purely students,

275
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.280 
the majority were employed the majority had relevant work experience

276
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.250 
working in start-ups, or corporates and 96% had

277
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.370 
prior experience working remotely. only a few said that they

278
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.610 
had to now learn, how to work remotely because of corona.

279
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:12.600 
the majority came from germany and all overall they came from 25 countries.

280
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.660 
here you can actually see all of the nationalities of the people
who took part

281
00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.230 
in  both of the core course

282
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:27.370 
parts. so as you as i said from germany was the majority.

283
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.150 
and probably one reason for this is of course we have the HPI as

284
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:36.730 
a partner. and we use their platform,
so the marketing was done through the platform

285
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.130 
as well as through social media and other places.

286
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:46.260 
but overall we had quite a lot from europe,
but also around around the world.

287
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.340 
so it was a global course,

288
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.450 
then about the methods and data. so we did qualitative research

289
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.050 
with an action research approach and we collected data before

290
00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.960 
during and after the MOOC and the type of doctor that we collected

291
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.940 
were reports meeting notes discussion forum posts. we did some surveys,

292
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.850 
learners reflected on their learning.
so they had reflection tasks during

293
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.370 
the c MOOC part, then we also looked at posts and comments

294
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:22.320 
in social media as well. and the main focus was on learners actions.

295
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.080 
now shortly about the main results.

296
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.830 
first of all, the first result is that we had high completion rates.

297
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.650 
and as i said, of course the corona might have impacted

298
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:42.480 
strongly. but also we believe that the hybrid design impacted a lot.

299
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:47.780 
because a lot of the dropouts happened in the c mooc phase
and that didn't then jeopardize ,

300
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.190 
the teamwork for other. you know learners that they would have

301
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.690 
dropped out during the teamwork phase. so this really impacted

302
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.930 
the design how we had. it was like a funnel, you know,

303
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.360 
they started with the x mooc part which was independent.
and it slowly went into a smaller

304
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.010 
and for the c MOOC part.

305
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.500 
also at the fact that  design helped for learners to first

306
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.570 
build their shared knowledge base and really have that shared language.

307
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.160 
so this enhanced the collaborative learning in  the second

308
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.370 
part of the course. so they knew the same concepts and theories and

309
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.910 
that helped out also something that came up with the importance

310
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.110 
of building a learning community for collaborative learning.

311
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:40.520 
actually our learners initiated putting up their own linkedin page

312
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.960 
to sort of share ideas and collaborate even more strongly.

313
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.280 
and this is really important, because this will help in the

314
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.940 
sustainability of the project, so we will try to keep this up.

315
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:58.780 
of course after the project ends and really keep
that collaboration going on globally

316
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.840 
there, as well. then just shortly about the challenges of this type of
a design.

317
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:13.030 
it's not so easily scalable because the see mooc part requires educators

318
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:18.780 
to act to be active during the implementation more than the x mooc part.

319
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:24.190 
so it also requires more time and resources to build it and

320
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.490 
keep it going on. so it's not as easily scalable

321
00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:33.720 
and it also requires learners to take more responsibility
for their own learning.

322
00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:39.610 
in this case our demographic was a bit older, so it worked very well.

323
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.100 
but maybe for younger learners, it might be harder when they

324
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.380 
need to take responsibility of their own learning to a larger

325
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.760 
degree than in a typical university course.

326
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.990 
and that was all of the main points now discussed and we're

327
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:02.060 
open now for any questions that you may have and Maya is here also to

328
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:08.850 
help answer. thank you. thank you so much johanna
for these nice presentation.

329
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.780 
do we have questions from the audience.

330
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.270 
i can start while the audience

331
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.110 
think other questions. i had a question regarding.

332
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.170 
i have a couple question.
but i'll do one and then we can wait on the other.

333
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.750 
i was so surprised to see

334
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.520 
one of the things. i just say that there were high completion

335
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.030 
rate in the smoke part.

336
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:46.790 
but then in the more active learning part of the course the connected

337
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.930 
mooc at 42% of the learners dropped.

338
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.520 
and i was surprised to see that you only i think that you only enroll

339
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.100 
those learners that were active or passed the initial part.

340
00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.140 
but then based on those another forty two percent

341
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.260 
dropped their course in the simile. and i was wondering if it

342
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.140 
can be related perhaps to learners are not that comfortable

343
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.820 
with active learning and active learning pedagogies.

344
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.910 
and you know project-based learning with people that don't know you

345
00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:18.490 
have any vision to it. it could be that i'm something that we

346
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.160 
would have wanted to research even further

347
00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:26.820 
was that we actually made like when we built the teams.

348
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.680 
we actually did some of the teams in the sense

349
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.280 
we made them up on the basis of them not doing. so well on the

350
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.320 
x- mooc part, because we did it. we tried to take that into

351
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.680 
consideration if they would like jeopardize.

352
00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.660 
the teamwork so that would have been something that would

353
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.840 
have been nice to look at as well, but i think one aspect is

354
00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.270 
that the c mooc part really like you had to be online more.

355
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.700 
you had to be synchronously with the other learners. so i think that

356
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:59.110 
is something that might have impacted to quite a degree because

357
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.490 
these people are working they're professionals.

358
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.790 
it's not always easy for them to be there synchronously.

359
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.750 
so yes that's one of the main challenges that the synchronous

360
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.190 
nature change to a synchronous nature.

361
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.300 
we have a question from Marie in the chat,

362
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.670 
just at the sema straight after x moocs.

363
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.500 
and i'm also wondering as a follow up if they're actually two

364
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.100 
actual different moocs, or is just different chapters of the MOOC.

365
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.960 
yeah so basically it was like one mark on the platform,

366
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.070 
and it was two credit points and it was just divided into two

367
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:42.010 
parts. and learners had the option of either doing the only

368
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.480 
the first part which was the x mooc part. but they couldn't

369
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.660 
do it individually only the c mooc part, because they needed

370
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.710 
to know that those theories and concepts in order to do that team work

371
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.280 
in the second part of the course. so they could do one credit

372
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.540 
or then two credits. they had the option to choose and they

373
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:03.860 
registered separately for both parts. so that's why we had a

374
00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.770 
smaller amount on the c mooc part registered as i showed in the image.

375
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.910 
and mary had a second question regarding

376
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.980 
the information how did you build the teams.

377
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.210 
and this is something that has been a plenty of research in mooc

378
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.670 
information. the second question yeah one was a time commitment,

379
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:29.620 
how much time these people were committed to put into the teamwork ?

380
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:35.310 
then they had to also take different roles, so in the

381
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.530 
simulated case study, they either had to sort of

382
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:43.130 
take the role of a start-up or corporate, so we really looked

383
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.820 
at like what type of roles they want to take, also we looked

384
00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.210 
at who wanted to be like a leading role and who wanted to sort

385
00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:56.180 
of step back. so we looked at that and also to have like

386
00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.220 
females and males. and

387
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:03.380 
those still sort of elements maybe
there was even more my do you remember even

388
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.340 
more elements that we looked at. no,

389
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.490 
i think there were quite many as

390
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.470 
the two men said yeah exactly.

391
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.750 
we had another question from Martina.

392
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.520 
was there any feedback given by the participants about how

393
00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.670 
comfortable they were with the x and the c parts?  so do you

394
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.700 
have surveys regarding satisfaction with these two parts ?

395
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.750 
yeah we did surveys and the majority  were satisfied with

396
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.000 
the course. now i don't have the numbers

397
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.990 
right now, because we were more focused on the collaboration

398
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.950 
part than their actual like satisfaction.

399
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:53.560 
but overall it was a success i think you can see it from

400
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.130 
the quite high completion rates as well to sort of support that.

401
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.670 
thank you we have a question from lisa.

402
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.220 
thank you one question regarding their core innovation

403
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.760 
group and linked. and so i think you said
the students are found at this group.

404
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.320 
were you also invited and did you do some moderation and so

405
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.990 
what's happening now assists in some activity in the group.

406
00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.450 
yeah that's a really good question, yeah so one of our learners

407
00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.410 
like initiated they put it up, then they invited us and they

408
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.740 
talked about the course about the site and they like shared

409
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.830 
it in the various discussion forums that we had available.

410
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.950 
and after week we joined the group. we're now also administrators

411
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:44.020 
of the group as well, so we are strongly there. and actually this

412
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:50.130 
spring we did a master class for 42 selected learners

413
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.860 
from the MOOCs. so it was like a continuation even further from this.

414
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.920 
and we used the lincoln insight a lot in that course

415
00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.350 
to promote and to show demonstrate the results of the learners,

416
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:06.590 
and to really like actively share ideas and collaboration opportunities.

417
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:10.810 
so we're really trying to keep that going on even further when

418
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.840 
our project is over， it will hopefully still be alive, and at

419
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.420 
least i'll do my part to keep the active. thank you.

420
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:27.080 
so maybe i can just add one more comment on that. i think we were a bit

421
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.370 
surprised how active they were. and i think one main element

422
00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.670 
is that they had this like sort of shared goal they wanted

423
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.750 
to learn about co- innovation. and there weren't a lot of courses

424
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:42.990 
out there on this topic. so i think in that sort of also impacted

425
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.260 
that they really wanted to share share a lot and

426
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.740 
hence the link inside as well.

427
00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.190 
another question from Sara regarding, if you have any design

428
00:32:55.190 --> 00:33:00.620 
tips or perhaps lesson learned in terms of designing
this blend of learning experiences.

429
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.960 
yeah, so it wasn't like blended in the sense that

430
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.580 
something would have been in the classroom. it was completely

431
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.410 
online, but the design i think it worked well.

432
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.610 
like if you're going to plan a course that has independent learning

433
00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:21.050 
as well as group learning,
i would recommend doing it like first independent part.

434
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.090 
because then you get a lot of those drop outs
that happen in the beginning.

435
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.430 
and then it doesn't sort of impact as strongly on the group

436
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.400 
work. because it's like a funnel they go through, so if it's

437
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.760 
the other way around then people get frustrated because people

438
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:41.250 
you know are dropping out from the group. group work phase
and that really jeopardizes

439
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.120 
everyone's work. so i think that structure really worked well

440
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.470 
in our case at least.

441
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.850 
I could add something on that the same  c MOOC part.

442
00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.880 
it's very important that you keep the instructions very very clear we

443
00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:02.760 
spend a lot of hours in making sure the flow.

444
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.340 
we needed to create the contents beforehand and

445
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:12.240 
that was important.

446
00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.550 
and also keep in mind the workload that you're giving to the students.

447
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.020 
so that they  are on their own time.

448
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.440 
and the interaction is important to let them interact.

449
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.570 
and that's all. yeah exactly, so maybe just a small thing to

450
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:38.390 
add their know your target group for us. the majority were you

451
00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:42.480 
know working, so you really need to take that into consideration

452
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.580 
and we try to be active on the discussion forums as much

453
00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.160 
as possible to sort of keep it alive that there's actually

454
00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:55.660 
people behind the course. and they're interested in what
you're doing.

455
00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.060 
so we tried to motivate them during the time as much as possible.

456
00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.240 
Manuel i believe that you have a question as well.

457
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.520 
yes you mentioned earlier

458
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.030 
that moving to the cymbal part immediately introduced a lot

459
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.060 
of synchronicity or at least synchronicity that wasn't present

460
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.910 
in the x mark part, and that in my experience

461
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:22.030 
immediately represents an overhead in terms of workload for learners

462
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.790 
were there aspects of the x mark part that made up or that compensated

463
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:33.270 
for that increased workload due to synchronicity in the cymbal part,

464
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:38.270 
or put differently how were assessments distributed across

465
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.870 
both parts and were they comparable in terms of workload?

466
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.890 
maybe you or you can answer more about assessment part, or ?

467
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:55.040 
i'm actually i don't know.

468
00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:02.090 
i think we if i remember correctly, it's been a year here since we

469
00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.580 
in terms of assessment.

470
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.030 
yes, they did this traditional

471
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.590 
peer assessment assessing.

472
00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.590 
its others teams they produced videos for us in it. so you know they

473
00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:28.870 
produced, then we had those typical.

474
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.220 
we call structured feedback forms,

475
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:42.900 
as i said we have a clear objective and which also assist or they

476
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.850 
created the the assessment criteria the

477
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.400 
objective and assessment needs to be in line

478
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:57.890 
with each other. and struct the feedback a teams were assessing

479
00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:03.260 
its teams and i believe also the members were assessing it

480
00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:07.710 
within the team. so this was assistant parte.

481
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:13.850 
yeah and under ex parte they did like a final exam there,

482
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.870 
so that was like automated answering to questions.

483
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:20.790 
so it was quite quite different and we really like let the

484
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.730 
teams themselves decide how and when they're going to work.

485
00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:29.610 
so we like provided the framework and sort of like the end dates,

486
00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.990 
but then they could decide when they're working on each part.

487
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:37.310 
and we did some recommended scheduling for them so like smaller

488
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.860 
deadlines in between. but they weren't fixed in the way that

489
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.800 
we would be watching over if they had done a certain amount

490
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.760 
of work by then. but we just looked at the end result,

491
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:55.460 
but as something maybe that impacted us well,
why there were so many people active

492
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:59.930 
was that it was two weeks the seem apart. so it was not like too long

493
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:05.770 
to really try to like sort of handle it with your work

494
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.150 
and everything on the side.

495
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.890 
and thank you.

496
00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.090 
there was another question from Merry,

497
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.220 
but i'm not sure if it was also related to assessment as yes.

498
00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.670 
what was the evaluated outcome of the similar,

499
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.190 
sorry human assessed assessment fact as well

500
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.270 
can you shortly, yes emend assessment.

501
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.280 
so perhaps it's ok, i think this is assessment.

502
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.100 
yes that's all like gonna answer that one.

503
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.660 
yeah yeah and we were like looking at how they apply the theory

504
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:51.070 
and how they collaborate yes there were different like things

505
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.680 
that we had in the assessment. but now i don't remember exactly

506
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.430 
what were all of the points,

507
00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:00.440 
but we were like looking at how they apply that theory in the simulated

508
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:07.060 
case study. so but as it as educators like i am an educator also,

509
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:13.930 
it was my first experience in MOOCs and it was quite strange

510
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:19.640 
when you have to you cannot really intervene or facilitate the teamwork.

511
00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:25.850 
you only way to go to support learners is to send messages

512
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.430 
through collapse pace and bx in that part,

513
00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.760 
so that was quite an experience

514
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:41.810 
and maybe this sort of a format will work a little bit older.

515
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:46.710 
people who are more self directive in that sense

516
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.360 
that they can complete the work together.

517
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.830 
also taking that into consideration all of like
the instructions as maya said

518
00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:03.060 
have to be super clear so we did various rounds of like having

519
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:06.250 
other people read it through who weren't part of the process of

520
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.820 
writing them or building the course to just make sure that

521
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.260 
is this like clear to everyone,
because easily there can be misunderstandings and

522
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.750 
that can cause frustration. so have those rounds of getting

523
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:22.660 
feedback from external viewers as well as important.

524
00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.690 
well, thank you for these very interactive

525
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:34.520 
question and answer time. let's move to the last talk.

526
00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.440 
I had more questions, but i'm doing in the last part.

527
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:40.560 
okay, thank you, thank you johana, maia.

528
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.470 
we'll move to the last talk call delivering washed

529
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.330 
disco evidence from the global series which will be presented

530
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.120 
by Fabian Suter.

531
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:10.960 
Hello everybody, can you hear me?  i think i just lost the connectivity.

532
00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:15.610 
we see  as lives and we hear you, okay.

533
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.280 
a stop sign.

534
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.290 
yes, sorry I just lost the

535
00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.620 
internet seems to have an issue

536
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:48.990 
absorbed in the perfect moment as you said okay, yeah.

537
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:52.280 
yes.

538
00:41:56.290 --> 00:42:00.390 
yes, super sorry for that. so a welcome to the presentation on

539
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:05.760 
our MOOC experience most glad to present some insights about our

540
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:11.570 
MOOC adventure on wash which stands for water sanitation and hygiene.

541
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.380 
so before we go into

542
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.020 
actually the MOOC, I would like to give you some context information

543
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.250 
about the global situation on water and sanitation

544
00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.520 
with a few pictures.

545
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:29.380 
and the first one is as many sectors in our world today.

546
00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:34.080 
the water and sanitation sector is characterized by huge inequalities

547
00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:39.050 
across the globe also within countries mainly rural and urban areas.

548
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.890 
but then also even within cities where you see neighborhoods

549
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.680 
just next to each other, one with really good access to drinking water,

550
00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.260 
others with really lack of basic services.

551
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.710 
next one is to illustrate one of our topics which is fecal sludge

552
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:59.100 
management, so it's a smelly topic highly fascinating one.

553
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.680 
just to give you some insight about the topic. you see colorful trucks

554
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.560 
which are used in areas where there are no sewer connections
actually destruct an

555
00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.780 
come pump out the clutch. and then bring it to a deposit

556
00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:19.950 
for treatment. you can also see that the sludge colors go from dark

557
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:25.420 
to more brownish which also indicates that
they are different in characteristics.

558
00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.810 
of course they're causing the challenges for the treatment.

559
00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:33.330 
just to give you a short insight,
i no time to go into further detail. just think

560
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.010 
it's a really fascinating topic and would like to share one

561
00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:41.580 
last impression which is an informal settlement in african kenya

562
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:47.740 
actually, where you see a lot of solid waste management
also a latrine where excreta.

563
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.810 
and then actually, also urine

564
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:54.630 
is disposed directly to the water body, at the same time you

565
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:56.900 
can see a man in the forefront with a smartphone.

566
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.340 
so it's also characteristic for our world today that often

567
00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:04.280 
we have a lack of basic service just next actually to access

568
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.910 
to really state- of- the- art modern digital technologies with that.

569
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.600 
i would like to

570
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.580 
share a few figures just to actually to underline the visualization.

571
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:21.040 
so by twenty thirty the goal is actually to have universal coverage of

572
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.870 
clean water and sanitation for everyone.

573
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:30.270 
nowadays still millions are actually lacking access
to basic drinking water service.

574
00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.740 
even worse for sanitation where two billion

575
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:37.010 
are actually lacking access to basic sanitation services.

576
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:42.030 
just to figures. if you would like to read more,

577
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.750 
there is really excellent data, also more recent data on certain

578
00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:51.900 
geographic locations on wash data come from unicef.

579
00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.610 
and the WHO. without i would like to jump into our MOOC experience.

580
00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:00.990 
on the left side you see our four courses started to build

581
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:06.070 
in two thousand fourteen on already mentioned topic
water treatment sanitation planning

582
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:10.490 
followed by solid waste management.
and then fecal sludge management

583
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.840 
and then what you can see in the figure

584
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:16.180 
is probably for most of us is a well known figure,

585
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.340 
where you can see really

586
00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:25.760 
the difference between enrollment active students and course computers.

587
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.590 
so we're talking about a series of two hundred
and sixty thousand enrolled students.

588
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.130 
and around fifteen percent are actually course computers.

589
00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.900 
so all the courses they're on hosted on coursara are available for free.

590
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.990 
all course materials are available for free

591
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:47.460 
plus they're running continuously since
the second half of two thousand fifteen.

592
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.480 
what you can also seen in twenty twenty is this a steep price.

593
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:55.690 
well i would like to zoom in just in the next

594
00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.310 
figure to actually visualize the impact of the pandemic.

595
00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:02.850 
and we've heard it in the previous talks and also throughout the

596
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.770 
conference actually on the massive impact that the pandemic had

597
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.300 
on MOOCs or e-learning in general.

598
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.760 
so to share with you in our series we have an average of three

599
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.560 
thousand five hundred new learners

600
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:19.380 
per months in pre pandemic times. and then the steep price

601
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.940 
at the beginning of 2020.

602
00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:26.340 
and now we are going back to normal slowly,

603
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:30.450 
even if the pandemic is not yet over.

604
00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:36.160 
so i just wanted to highlight is to really show the strength

605
00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.540 
of the MOOC actually to cope with this massive

606
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:42.120 
increase of learners in a short period of time.

607
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.520 
so who are our learners.

608
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:51.870 
so when we started our mooc adventure the literature said ok,

609
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:54.550 
this is coming from the us we had all these successful

610
00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.850 
pilot. and first courses from stanford etcetera.

611
00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:04.540 
mainly the audience is young, is male, is well educated, is employed,

612
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.560 
is from a high income country.

613
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.090 
so of course this was a challenge for us, because actually where

614
00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:14.970 
we have challenges in our sector, is mainly in low and
middle income countries.

615
00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.900 
so we anyway we took the risk and started to MOOC.

616
00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.620 
and what we can say after

617
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:24.390 
five six years actually that the majority yes is young

618
00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:26.450 
below 34 years old

619
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.500 
is male, so in our courses is between 26

620
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.760 
and 39 percent meaning

621
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:37.380 
yeah there is really some male dominated

622
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:42.010 
learning experience unfortunately. two reasons,

623
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.040 
first of all coursera in general has more male learners,
i think on average

624
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.580 
is thirty nine percent of female learners on all coursera courses.

625
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.340 
and also our courses are having an engineering focus which is

626
00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.940 
also unfortunately still a male dominated field.

627
00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.320 
it's about to change, but will take some time

628
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:06.660 
a well educated absolutely.
so over eighty percent have completed the bachelor,

629
00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:08.580 
master's, or even phd.

630
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.010 
a similar to what Johanna mentioned before,

631
00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:16.260 
same for our courses majority are professionals.

632
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.400 
only about one third are really full time students.

633
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:24.860 
and we were really happy to see that actually we managed that's

634
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:30.080 
one of the main results of our MOOC experience.
so it's really possible to attract

635
00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:35.660 
with the global monk series hosted on a us-based platform
such as coursera,

636
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.150 
a high percentage of low and middle income country

637
00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.540 
based students, so in our case it's roughly 60 percent.

638
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:48.190 
and you can see in this example from one of our courses which

639
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.520 
is the solid waste MOOC,

640
00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.230 
top countries india and announcing the top ten.

641
00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.030 
we have countries such as mexico, peru, colombia, philippines, nigeria.

642
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:03.010 
so that's one of the of our main outcomes actually

643
00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:08.420 
to reach those learns that will actually make a huge difference
in the future

644
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:10.790 
and even today in our sector.

645
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.160 
another important topic, it has been mentioned yesterday also

646
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:22.150 
in an interesting a panel discussion on local MOOC initiatives.

647
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.630 
local platforms is actually so. how can we convert the mooc

648
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:29.760 
also into more contextualized learning initiatives,

649
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:34.090 
because we provide generic content global content of course
with some case studies.

650
00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:40.360 
but it is not really a contextualised learning initiative.

651
00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.710 
so here i would like to quote theresa steel andrew who said

652
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.140 
higher education in the twenty-first century faces the challenge

653
00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.660 
of providing cost effective high-quality learning experiences,

654
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.340 
appropriate to the needs of an ever increasing,

655
00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.410 
cultural diverse student population, and to meet the competency

656
00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.520 
demands of a digital knowledge driven society.

657
00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.750 
so we believe that MOOCs are a really good in offering cost

658
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.990 
effective, also high quality

659
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:15.320 
learning experience, also of course really strong for
an ever increasing demand.

660
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:20.870 
but there's a problem with reaching a diverse student population.

661
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:25.680 
and we have three approaches actually which i would like
to share with you.

662
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:31.840 
to find solutions first of all is all our materials are

663
00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.780 
available for free for educational purposes.

664
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.700 
so you can see is the first approach from nigeria.

665
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:42.880 
it's just that a professor who approached us actually then embedding

666
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.970 
the videos in her lecture.

667
00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:46.940 
so she introduces the video

668
00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:51.590 
watches together with her students and then which is
followed by discussion.

669
00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:53.830 
so this one is straightforward.

670
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:58.770 
what's important, so it was demand-driven and she's completely

671
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.770 
free to use the material  and then interact with her students

672
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:04.940 
as is one way of offering

673
00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:09.120 
in our opinion good contextualized learning initiatives.

674
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.910 
the second one is fully contextualized an online course which

675
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.410 
was done for example in the case of the solway mooc,

676
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:21.160 
where the university initial said ok content is useful.
but it's too generic.

677
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:27.030 
they translated the whole course plus then added a whole week
in additional modules.

678
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:31.090 
a specific to their context.

679
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:36.440 
also important so they had to lead because they actually know

680
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.150 
best what's good for their learners.

681
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:47.140 
and the last one is an example from mozambique.
it's a programme called somatzi

682
00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.330 
where actually the programme

683
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:55.640 
took the whole series uploaded it to a local moodle platform.

684
00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:59.950 
and then enriched the learning experience with field
with its a group works

685
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:03.150 
to create really this kind of blended learning

686
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:06.310 
experience for their students.

687
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:12.520 
so those are three practical examples which so with which i

688
00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.940 
would already like to conclude and also saying that
we have more information

689
00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:22.250 
in an article. so if you're interested also more information

690
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:26.540 
on our webpage. and of course most happy to exchange by email

691
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:31.720 
for any questions exchange experience etcetera. thank you.

692
00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:38.280 
thank you. so much for sharing this very interesting topic.

693
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:43.240 
this very dealing with important problems in international problems.

694
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.350 
let me see, if we have any questions from the audience are ready.

695
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:07.290 
for a start by making the first question an.

696
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.250 
i thought it was i was actually writing as my question

697
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:18.150 
how can you work on localizing a bit the content not so much

698
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:21.550 
for the cultural aspect, but more on the actual

699
00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:26.410 
content that. they might need based on the different years and the

700
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:31.370 
sanitary situation of each country. and you are actually talk

701
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:35.820 
a bit about that, but i was now thinking,

702
00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:39.320 
if i can now that you are developing content that is more

703
00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:44.760 
localized to each one of the geos. how can we embed these in

704
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:49.280 
MOOCs, how can we operationalize these in MOOC platforms that are more

705
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:53.920 
you know less flexible that we would like them to be

706
00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.030 
and so have you thought of any potential approaches.

707
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:01.330 
yeah, so first of all i think what i didn't mention is that also

708
00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:05.430 
experts from asia, latin america, africa. they're part of our

709
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.510 
MOOC series. so we have guest lecturers we have partner professors,

710
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.700 
so they're already in there. so it's not like a one way

711
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.030 
street where it's just we are providing content, and then it's

712
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:19.640 
contextualised. so that's the first one, second one.

713
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.990 
so we're working with all these partners and we're interested

714
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:25.190 
actually in setting up their own MOOC

715
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:30.040 
programs. so where they can use our materials or not,

716
00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:32.130 
but then often sometimes it's like technical

717
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:36.970 
infrastructure which is missing how to set up,
let's say a recording studio.

718
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.340 
so then we're working with them actually that
they can produce their own MOOCs.

719
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.400 
don't need to be on coursera maybe. it's in better honor on

720
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.580 
a more regional platform,

721
00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.890 
as i mentioned really interestingly in the talk yesterday
in the conferenc.

722
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.440 
i believe that Manual has a question,

723
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.090 
yes, i was wondering,

724
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:02.960 
if this idea of producing the content and then this content being

725
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.690 
taken being leveraged by different

726
00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.420 
institutions, different nations, different organizations.

727
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:14.750 
and customized for a local context was that's the intention

728
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:18.060 
from the get- go or is this serendipity something that happened

729
00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:21.470 
along the way that proved beneficial and that then you started

730
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.470 
designing with also that goal in mind.

731
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:27.480 
yeah, so it was the intention from the beginning.

732
00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:31.880 
but i must admit before we did the MOOCs we were not sure if

733
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.080 
it will really work.
so what is really the potential

734
00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:38.780 
of MOOCs to kick off or to complement local initiatives.

735
00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:42.980 
and this is really one of our lessons learned is really useful

736
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:46.760 
as long as then as the local partners they take the lead.

737
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:50.900 
so there is often a better risk than that we start from our

738
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:54.880 
position in switzerland to dominate the content, even for a regional
learning offer.

739
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:59.750 
so then it's really important to switch leadership roles.

740
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:03.970 
and then we're just here based on demand to support their initiatives.

741
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:09.020 
thank you horst. we have a question in the comments.

742
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.820 
yes we have a question in the shop for Martina.

743
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:17.160 
are there any other reasons for where women in MOOCs
set for lacking engineering background ?

744
00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.370 
did you get to know other factors as well as such as social constraints?

745
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:28.980 
you mentioned this is lacked engineering background.

746
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.030 
one is just learning in general.

747
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:34.460 
this is more used by men today.

748
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:39.130 
so this is to do also with with access to technology.

749
00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.930 
maybe also than with

750
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.690 
the amount of

751
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.650 
female versus male learners studying that is also changing.

752
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.410 
so let's say also here in switzerland dth so.

753
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.410 
for example, which is a technical university

754
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:59.470 
male learners or now the majority?  so this will take some time

755
00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:03.520 
to become the majority in professors which was sometime ?

756
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:09.020 
and also take into account the main goes of these courses,
but the gender gaps

757
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:12.140 
in countries might also affect.

758
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:18.830 
ok my internet connection was a bit unstable.

759
00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:21.890 
so i couldn't hear you, sorry for that.
yes i said that taking into account

760
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:25.790 
that you're the geos that you are mainly attracting the gender

761
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:29.580 
gap is more approved in this year's than in other european

762
00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:30.890 
countries or US.

763
00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:37.570 
so yeah absolutely no more questions?

764
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:45.330 
well i was wondering you made it clear that the course was

765
00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.770 
intended that has been leverage in a wider number of countries and regions.

766
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.280 
but i was wondering if you could quantify those a bit.

767
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.010 
was there a particular country say that

768
00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.160 
used the course more than others too.
for instance, was africa your primary target

769
00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.140 
or developing world in general.

770
00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:15.780 
yeah, so it's in general. so but the main language of our courses is english.

771
00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:19.860 
so then we produce subtitles for all the courses in

772
00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.320 
spanish. and then also in french. and then now we started with

773
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:28.320 
hindi with arabic. so a lot of subtitles, but is the really the

774
00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:32.220 
also the voice over is in english. so it's a of course we have

775
00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.190 
a higher enrollment from english-speaking countries. so number

776
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:39.530 
one country in all the course is india, and then it depends

777
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:42.590 
a bit on the topic. so let's say solid waste management is

778
00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:44.470 
hugely popular in latin America,

779
00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:47.090 
whereas for example sanitation MOOC

780
00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:50.420 
is more popular in africa.

781
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:56.760 
and then it also  comes  with social networks.

782
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.410 
so let's say if you have strong partnerships with a professor in uganda

783
00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:02.520 
and is part of our sanitation.

784
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.080 
then of course we see a pic from uganda learned in that course.

785
00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:11.100 
and would you say that you see a very clear mapping between

786
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.710 
the subjects of the course that it has that has been successful

787
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:19.920 
in a particular region. and the known issues
or challenges in those particular regions,

788
00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.940 
is there a reason why this particular course will do well in

789
00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.760 
latin america say and that other course will do well in india or

790
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.660 
is that just a consequence of these partnerships
that you've mentioned your

791
00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:33.420 
access to certain instructors certain institutions.

792
00:59:38.410 --> 00:59:40.500 
it's driven by demand and local interest excellent question?

793
00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.760 
so uh absolutely yes, and for example in latin America

794
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:47.470 
a lot of people already have access to really

795
00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:54.370 
at least basic sanitation and drinking-water services.
however solid waste management is a huge challenge,

796
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:59.150 
so then it's demanding and topic driven,

797
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.120 
whereas for example in africa

798
01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:06.550 
often the lack of basic sanitation. and clean water is an issue

799
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:14.190 
very great, i think that.

800
01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.520 
when we have one last question that we can take, but after this

801
01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.810 
question, we can open the  global discussion. so if you want to make

802
01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.010 
questions for all of the participants at the same time more

803
01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:29.440 
open questions not strictly related to the topic of the talk

804
01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:34.050 
feel free to do so. but we'll have this last question for now

805
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:38.650 
what proportion of your targeted follow the MOOC on the mobile app.

806
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.250 
did you notice any difference between countries regarding mobile access,

807
01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.060 
i cannot give you the exact figure. so i don't know exactly,

808
01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:51.460 
so we did some service,

809
01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.630 
but with a limited number of students where it was about fifty fifty.

810
01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.650 
but i cannot really give you i don't have really clear data on

811
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:01.930 
that the question.

812
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:11.980 
lack of data will catch up with and presented in the next conference.

813
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.620 
questions from the entire panels for the three of the speakers.

814
01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.170 
for the four of the speakers?

815
01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:34.990 
well, i can't start the discussion with one.

816
01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:40.030 
and this one is for all speakers. but admittedly i was looking

817
01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.610 
forward to fabians answers

818
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:46.410 
where next do you have plans to continue developing

819
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.520 
these a MOOC series in the future. and what direction are you taking ?

820
01:01:57.450 --> 01:02:02.220 
sabian can you hear us?  yes ok yeah. thank you. so it was actually

821
01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.480 
really interesting also to hear both of the previous talks, and

822
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:10.280 
especially also to joanna's explanation about their experience with

823
01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:13.390 
x mooc and c MOOC since the direction where we would like to

824
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:15.040 
head with it some pilot tests

825
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.730 
faced the challenge with just with the workload of
the of the smoke part.

826
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.580 
because to which extent we're really able to

827
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:27.810 
handle. let's say a cohort and suddenly with
ten thousand twenty thousand

828
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:30.850 
learners who would like to join as a MOOC.

829
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.130 
but that would be our direction actually to offer more practical,

830
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:38.400 
also more maybe lab based project works in addition to the MOOCs.

831
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.060 
so that's again. thanks for the insights,

832
01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:47.090 
yeah, i can maybe also add a comment there on the insights.

833
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.450 
for the smoke part really like and actually the whole MOOC that we did

834
01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:57.420 
just to like sort of be clear. we did have a very big and an

835
01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:01.320 
a good team behind it. so it really needs like good teamwork

836
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:06.120 
to actually organize it. and we even took certain times when

837
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.200 
we were just going through discussion forums and answering

838
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.390 
to any questions. so really like keep in mind that you need

839
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:16.140 
a bit more maybe resources, then if you only

840
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.760 
do like an x MOOC design,

841
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:20.490 
when it's implemented. that's what i mean.

842
01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.350 
thank you, thank you.

843
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:35.360 
I had a question for Johanna

844
01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:42.490 
gardin, if you think that this methodology, because i really

845
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:44.940 
like the idea of having the two

846
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:50.620 
types of activities having both content,
but having no summer active learning in

847
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:54.080 
the more active learning part. and i was going if you think

848
01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.380 
this methodology can scale to be actively implemented

849
01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.390 
systematically in more platforms.

850
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:04.590 
what's the effort told us, these are for a scale with a number of students.

851
01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:10.600 
well first of all our research of course is based on one MOOC.

852
01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:16.310 
so i can't like say that it would work everywhere,
but at least in our case

853
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:23.560 
the structure the design, it did work well. and we of course had

854
01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:28.760 
like i see Toms name here solve it's from HPI.

855
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.730 
we had other people as well who are very experienced in MOOCs
and really like

856
01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:40.690 
knew when the drop-outs happened how to sort of tackle that. and so

857
01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:47.150 
for us it worked and i could see that it would work

858
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:50.510 
in the future, as well. i would i see as an experience that

859
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.250 
it makes more sense than having first a c MOOC and then an

860
01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.690 
x MOOC, if you're trying to blend in both types of models.

861
01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:01.530 
so at least the order of it works maybe better.

862
01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:08.770 
maybe i can add a little bit of if you write it.

863
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.870 
we did on our blood from several MOOCs with the

864
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.540 
that included such a teamwork part.

865
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.660 
and the experience is basically the same in all of them.

866
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.960 
so you have a only a subset of the participants
who actually participate in a steamer.

867
01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.620 
because it is more and it has more

868
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:40.900 
a higher higher workload than if you just like watch videos.

869
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:45.450 
and do a couple of multiple choices so if you really have to

870
01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:51.760 
start working hands on a project something that definitely is a
lot more.

871
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:55.970 
and we see the same in all of these courses

872
01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:02.510 
that only a sub-set only a those that are actually
already performing quite well

873
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.360 
in the rest of the course that they are also participating.

874
01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.350 
in these teamwork parts and then

875
01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.210 
we always see that there is a

876
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:16.880 
quite large drop-out rate in this team. so none of the teams gonna

877
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:21.390 
make it through to the end. so i'm the best the exercise is

878
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:23.080 
designed that you can do it with

879
01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:27.540 
one or two persons as well.

880
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:36.670 
so we tried to in my research and at least

881
01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.250 
differentiated between successful teams that were two

882
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:46.420 
then with teams that ended up with two and more participants in the end

883
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:50.820 
still working on the part and only

884
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:54.990 
disfunctional teams which ended up with at least one person.

885
01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:58.890 
because that's not really a team anymore and then the completely

886
01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:01.780 
failed team which didn't happen anything at all.

887
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:07.140 
and we can see that in on a team level. it's basically not as bad.

888
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:10.910 
if you look at the individuals, you have you really have a hydra.

889
01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.880 
but there's always teams that go through to the end.

890
01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:17.430 
yeah and i think tom something that you brought up.

891
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:20.770 
when we were designing is just to have like bigger teams.

892
01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.590 
because like of course there's going to be robots. so if you're going

893
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:27.820 
to do this don't make teams of two or three people make them
at least like five to six.

894
01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.610 
and think about it that at least maybe like
two three people would drop out.

895
01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:37.220 
but then it won't like you know jeopardize the whole teamwork.

896
01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:41.610 
so the amount of people is also important protein not to have

897
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:45.880 
just a few people there yes but there's also an upper limit,

898
01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.030 
so if you design teams too large in the beginning you you kind

899
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.060 
of descend a self-fulfilling prophecy,

900
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.190 
because you design the teams for

901
01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:57.570 
people to drop out. and then there's so many people in the team

902
01:07:57.570 --> 01:08:01.320 
that they kind of think. there's so many others that can do it.

903
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.160 
i can kind of electrometer back and watch what is happening.

904
01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:08.220 
the bed also does work so you really need to connect

905
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:13.250 
nailed down to the exactly right teams us.

906
01:08:17.230 --> 01:08:21.510 
thank you Tom. i know that you work a lot  in all the part

907
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:24.980 
of peer activities. and so on that was lessons learned are valuable

908
01:08:26.650 --> 01:08:32.720 
i'm more questions. yeah i have a question for her sahara's it.

909
01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:39.060 
and you've mentioned this before one of the directions,

910
01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:45.210 
you might take next is exploring the question of geo based uprisings.

911
01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.010 
and their potential impact. but i don't know if you've done any

912
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:49.740 
preliminary research in this.

913
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:53.290 
i have for once a little bit of context.

914
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:58.590 
i could provide a we presented a paper this year at learning

915
01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:01.840 
scale that unfortunately was not accepted you had a tidbit

916
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:05.640 
in that that might be useful. so the uni platform.

917
01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:11.120 
so perhaps not as much of an academic platform as the big names

918
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.020 
like with terror attacks. But nonetheless a platform with one

919
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:18.090 
hundred and sixty thousand courses so a big player.

920
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:25.150 
and that we with we've scraped their catalogue
across three world regions.

921
01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.320 
we did it in the west in europe we used france as reference.

922
01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:32.990 
and we did it in india and we found that their pricing

923
01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:41.080 
varied by about twenty per cent from india to us and from us to europe.

924
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:45.940 
so these twenty per cent increments are rather significant overall,

925
01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:50.960 
and have you in your preliminary steps
you're taking in this direction

926
01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:55.750 
quantified some of the difference that currently exists between

927
01:09:55.750 --> 01:10:00.290 
regions and perhaps within regions themselves?
and do they look that

928
01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.140 
large that significant because we were a little bit surprised,

929
01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:07.810 
when we found those numbers?  yes.

930
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:10.940 
thank you for the question,

931
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:16.200 
though i am my initial division of the world

932
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:23.750 
was to two groups. and they didn't do any finer

933
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:32.850 
divisions of the sub-groups within the developed,

934
01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:34.460 
and developing except for a language.

935
01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:40.590 
but the other facet of my answer

936
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:45.100 
would be that the way you are looking at the bias

937
01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:51.710 
is also important especially, if you want to quantify the effect of

938
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:53.710 
a policy change.

939
01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:58.900 
and so the odds ratio that

940
01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:03.510 
i'm suggesting to use as a measure of fair,

941
01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.170 
of the level of fair of the sande

942
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:15.170 
in inclusivity in the MOOC or the measure of the gap between

943
01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:18.350 
different groups of learners within the MOOC.

944
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:25.710 
so that can help you maybe quantify the effect
and say something about the

945
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:34.990 
motivation that would be created in this kind of discount that you have

946
01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.710 
over different regions of the world.

947
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:44.830 
and that this measure was proven in this research and also

948
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:49.930 
in other research we need to be quite sensitive, too.

949
01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:57.010 
to model this kind of delicate behavioral differences.

950
01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.630 
so yeah that would be a good

951
01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.350 
point to start with to quantify this.

952
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.070 
and to start asking these questions.

953
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:10.340 
but now i haven't done it yet.

954
01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:14.050 
maybe thank you, thank you for your answer.

955
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:22.760 
thank you. so do we have any last question for closing decision

956
01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:36.760 
much to the speakers' of this session.

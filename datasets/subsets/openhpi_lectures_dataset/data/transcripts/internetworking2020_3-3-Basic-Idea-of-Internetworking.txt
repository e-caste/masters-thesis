00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360 
In our openhpi course "A
Half Century of Internet"

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.240 
now I want to explain the basic
idea of internetworking.

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.870 
You remember the internet
consists of different networks.

4
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.280 
Yeah for example
ethernet.

5
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.130 
Here wifi network.

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.400 
These are other technologies. And this
different networks are interconnected

7
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.630 
by means of routers.

8
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.490 
So router are a small part of
this network as well as part of

9
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.660 
that network a part of that network.
So this router understands

10
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.690 
all the languages that are spoken
inside this network. And

11
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.090 
here is an connection with another
router to another network.

12
00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.150 
Now assume that a host here in
the ethernet wants to send

13
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.620 
in the internet a message to
a host in that network.

14
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.140 
This is a message

15
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.110 
that should be sent and
transported to this user.

16
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.260 
So to make clear

17
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.130 
that this message should
be sent to this user

18
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.070 
the host needs to know the ip
address of this computer

19
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
and then it can

20
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.750 
form a data package

21
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.570 
with this message with an ip
address here in that field.

22
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.670 
Our internet layer,
this is okay.

23
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.580 
But this message has
to be sent first

24
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.230 
to this router

25
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.980 
inside the ethernet network.
And in the ethernet network

26
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.780 
IP addresses are
not understood.

27
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.220 
So what needs
to be done is

28
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.290 
this message has to be packed
inside an ethernet package.

29
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.800 
And then this ethernet package can
be sent inside the ethernet,

30
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.800 
you remember the broadcast
network, and reach this

31
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.570 
reach this router.

32
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.260 
So this router
gets this

33
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:40.490 
ethernet package with the IP package
as the content as the use data

34
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.090 
and inside this
IP package

35
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.090 
IP package

36
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.090 
IP package

37
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.750 
there is the message

38
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.410 
that should be sent.

39
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.190 
Now the router has
to check to which

40
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.570 
network, neighbour
network,

41
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.750 
it has to transmit
this message.

42
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.880 
And what it has
to do - first

43
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.970 
the router understands ethernet language
because it is part of this network.

44
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.650 
So it has to first
to analyze what

45
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.680 
what to do with
this message.

46
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:28.950 
This IP package needs to be
analyzed and then the router, IP,

47
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.260 
so this needs
to be black,

48
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.870 
IP, the router analyze
the IP address.

49
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.980 
Then the router is
able to realize that

50
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.470 
this package has to be sent
via this wifi network,

51
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.170 
so to this router.

52
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.020 
This is the next hop and then this router
behaves in the same way like that router.

53
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.160 
To forward this package
over this wifi network

54
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.140 
a new package has to be created
and in this time a wifi

55
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.200 
package with this
IP package as

56
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.460 
the use data and with an original
message that should be sent.

57
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.890 
And now this package

58
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.160 
can be sent via this
network to that router.

59
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.950 
And this router has to
work in the same way.

60
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.150 
We will discuss the details, the things
in more detail in the next clips

61
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.020 
but what is important
message? Important messages

62
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.910 
there is no IP package

63
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.800 
nowhere in the
interconnected network.

64
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.080 
The IP package is every time content, the
content, the use data of the package

65
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.720 
and the packets are the package
inside this networks and this

66
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.790 
network technologies that are
interconnected, ethernet or wi-fi

67
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.730 
or FDDI or whatever.

68
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.040 
And the task of the router
is this translation task.

69
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.320 
The translation task to understand
this ethernet package,

70
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.490 
to see ok there is a content is an
IP package, to analyze IP address,

71
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.260 
and then to find out that this
IP package needs to present

72
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.050 
into that direction, not into that
direction, into that direction

73
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:45.150 
and then the router's task is to create wifi
package with this content and transmit it

74
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.490 
and addresses to the router
which interconnects

75
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.960 
this network on
that network.

76
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.100 
This shows the basic idea of
transmitting data to the internet.

77
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.270 
We will look in more details in
the next clips about this.

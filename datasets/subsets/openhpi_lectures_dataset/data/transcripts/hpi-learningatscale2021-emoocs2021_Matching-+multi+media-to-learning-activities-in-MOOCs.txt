1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.870 
who are we today. so i've already said that

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.410 
hey my clicking isn't working.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.820 
that we are a part of the MOOC team

4
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.380 
of the kuleuven. and so the mooc team actually consists of

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.420 
different people from from different departments.

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.060 
and yet my computer is reacting a little bit slow.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.140 
and so the three different departments are lamellae which is the

8
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.500 
liver institute for media and learning. so they are media experts

9
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.230 
there's edu the educational development unit they're an education

10
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.840 
specialists. and then there's

11
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.220 
gds which is the i d service.

12
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.560 
so i am from the i d department from the carryover. so we are

13
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.010 
mostly responsible for the technical support

14
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.100 
of the MOOC creation process.

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.940 
then you can also see my two colleagues lene and elka.

16
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.640 
they are from the educational development unit. and then we also have

17
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.460 
remco and rune from lima.

18
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
so they are our media experts.

19
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
but of course we don't only want to know who we are. we already

20
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.420 
know who we are. we also want to know who you are.

21
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.510 
so if you could we are already going to use the chats.

22
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.100 
both in the chat who you are. so your name your affiliation

23
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.270 
or maybe something that identifies you more. and most importantly

24
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.860 
what are MOOCs to you that way we have an idea who is a bit

25
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.470 
in our session are you familiar with MOOCs.

26
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.150 
do you support making MOOCs. do you like following moocs feel free to

27
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.780 
post anything how you feel

28
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.020 
on MOOCs in the chat.

29
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.250 
ok and i see that there is quite a lot of people who are either

30
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.940 
researching MOOCs or supporting MOOCs.

31
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.350 
so that's really nice. so today it's not only about us.

32
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.990 
we will we will take you to the workflow that we use with our course teams.

33
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.670 
but we are also very eager to learn from your side what you are doing.

34
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.710 
so we do hope that this also can be a bit of an exchange of

35
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.020 
ideas and methods.

36
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.520 
okay thank you all for answering feel free to keep
on posting in the chat

37
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.180 
and then for some reason.

38
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.100 
can one of my colleagues, yeah ok. so maybe a little with

39
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.710 
about our MOOCs. so we are on the ethics platform.

40
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.060 
so that's where our experience lies although for

41
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.160 
the design of moocs. it doesn't really matter what platform.

42
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.860 
you're on we already have twenty two movies there

43
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.700 
ranging from a variety of subjects. so we don't focus on

44
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.880 
a specific subject. we really let it come from our teachers.

45
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.790 
so it ranges from philosophy medicine,

46
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.300 
cyber security soil science. it's a pretty

47
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.120 
wide array of subjects,
so we have twenty two moocs and in total already sixty one

48
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.060 
runs on our platform.

49
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.050 
i'm going to ask you right away to say something more in chat.

50
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.880 
because we have another question for you.

51
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.150 
so we want to start with this question,

52
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.690 
and we want you to think back to whenever you were a student
or an adult.

53
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.390 
it could be high school university any type of lifelong learning

54
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.610 
and think back to like the one teacher that you really still

55
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.190 
remember that you learned the most from

56
00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.290 
what made her or him.
so great what made the lessons so memorable.

57
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.030 
the love and teaching to others.
so feel free to post the answers in chat.

58
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.960 
yeah so i think definitely

59
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.040 
passion is a big one authenticity.

60
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.180 
i think for me personally we had a teacher who was

61
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.900 
also very authentic which wasn't a very great feat.

62
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.350 
because he was very rude. but he was the

63
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.500 
he gave literature and he was so good at really

64
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.390 
taking you into the story.
yeah and i see lisa also has great storytelling.

65
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.460 
it was fun to listen to

66
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.910 
a passionate.

67
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.880 
yeah learning to practice okay.

68
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.480 
and i'm very happy to see

69
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.340 
the answers in chat.

70
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.590 
because one thing that i do see i'm

71
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.840 
coming back is storytelling and that's actually the first thing.

72
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.520 
we're going to start and i'm going to pass on the word

73
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.540 
to one of my colleagues and he will to hanko and he will tell

74
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.920 
you something more about storytelling in MOOCs.

75
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.490 
so i'm going to take it away. yeah thanks a lot to annalisa.

76
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.080 
and i'm going to try and move over to the next slide.

77
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.960 
i think one of the things that i'm also seeing that in the czech

78
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.910 
is exciting teachers and great storytelling,

79
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.170 
is popping up so people who are enthusiastic about their of course,

80
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.160 
enthusiastic about teaching loving teaching. and

81
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.320 
those are really important things and those are things that

82
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.430 
you can achieve in person it. it takes a room and it

83
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.890 
takes a teacher, and then you can make a sort of atmosphere

84
00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.420 
where you can have great learning happening.

85
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.500 
but we are currently not really able to do that and of course in

86
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.490 
moocs. this has been a factor for much longer.

87
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.900 
it's part of what moocs are,

88
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:19.410 
and so there's sort of a need to recreate this excitement that you have

89
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.390 
that you can create offline and how do we bring this online.

90
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.960 
MOOCs by their nature consisting of lots of videos

91
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:35.790 
aren't really per se very interactive.
so we have a quote here and

92
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.360 
we're curious what you think about it. and it's more about we

93
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.130 
use technology in online education.
we're more important the humanizing factor becomes

94
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.690 
and of course i mean you might agree or disagree with this.

95
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.290 
but i think we can agree on it that the humanizing factor can be quite challenging.

96
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.510 
now one of the things we think we can aid in this is by the use of

97
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.850 
storytelling.

98
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.730 
and i'll move over i hope you're seeing the next slide as well.

99
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.560 
and the reason is that good stories are remembered longer by

100
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.530 
students than lessons that lack them.
so there's something about storytelling

101
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:27.860 
in education that helps retention. but also and i think more

102
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.170 
importantly in online course.
it helps to keep them excited

103
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.850 
and it helps to keep them motivated i think.

104
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.030 
but the knowledge and the knowledge transfer per se in moocs

105
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.430 
isn't necessarily the biggest problem. the biggest problem is dropout

106
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:50.700 
people who for one reason or another do not have a motivation over time

107
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:57.240 
to finish a mooc. so this is where storytelling kind of comes in.

108
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.080 
and it is also

109
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.890 
what we find is that these facts are remembered better,

110
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.300 
if they're in a part of a story.

111
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.290 
you could also argue the other way around is where storytelling

112
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.550 
sort of becomes more important member content.

113
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.420 
and because it's a powered powerful device is you can basically

114
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.050 
convince people of a lot of things even conspiracy theories

115
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.460 
which are often very exciting stories as long as you tell them right.

116
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:41.960 
so very plusses and drawbacks to storytelling. so it's a powerful device

117
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.800 
and we should use it carefully to enhance our learning.

118
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.720 
so that's some of the things that story-telling can offer you.

119
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.610 
of course a lot of us aren't really trained in storytelling

120
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.550 
per se we're training in teaching and storytelling.

121
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.680 
they're really good teachers. they know this, they know that

122
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.680 
storytelling is important and they incorporated in their lessons.

123
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.170 
but we most of us aren't really formally trained in how to

124
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:20.480 
structure a story, how to use it and that word structure.
i think is important for us,

125
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:27.090 
because we can use storytelling as a structuring method

126
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:33.480 
to organize our course in such a way that we can keep students excited,

127
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.860 
keep them curious for what's coming next.

128
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.660 
and in time use things like causality to in
to introduce different topics.

129
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.440 
so what we have next for you is sort of a

130
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.410 
a bit of a brainstorm to try and think about what this can

131
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.680 
how you can apply this.

132
00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.850 
and we're going to have a case or a and we're going to have

133
00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.580 
sort of a brainstorm about it between us moderators

134
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.330 
on what kind of struck storytelling structures.
we could use

135
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:18.400 
to make sense of a content and how to excite students to go through it.

136
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.020 
so how do we do it first. there's a couple of things

137
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.590 
that we can do. so keeping people excited we can do that through.

138
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.800 
the use of teasers we can also do cliffhangers

139
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.230 
where we sort of introduce teasers and cliffhangers our are

140
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.520 
similar in a way where we introduce
what we are going to talk about next.

141
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.730 
and then we save that for next week or for the next module,

142
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:56.110 
or i'm cliffhangers our are a better way than teasers a lot of times.

143
00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:00.370 
because we can introduce a question into the students minds

144
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.390 
that they are now really interested in finding out the answer to

145
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.770 
and of course the answer will only come in the next module.

146
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.520 
so i've sort of cliffhanger,

147
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:16.630 
only kind of works if there is a something more to it.

148
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.500 
there's a red friend as we like to call it in the dutch speaking areas

149
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:27.570 
or a story line an overarching story line.

150
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.250 
and we kind of need that because if we want to

151
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.730 
keep people exciting over a longer period of time. we can't just use

152
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.180 
the smaller or cheap tricks such as teasers and cliffhangers.

153
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.260 
we need to be a little bit more in-depth.

154
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.830 
and this goes hand in hand with using empathy and emotions,

155
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:56.170 
and if you want to build empathy with a person or character

156
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.650 
that does take some time.

157
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.420 
and so this is something to think,

158
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.380 
not just on a module level, but on a whole course level.

159
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.180 
one of characters and this can this can be the presenter even,

160
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.840 
or the host of a movie then itself can be a character.

161
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.480 
so what can we do to make sure that
students form a sort of a poor with the presenter

162
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.220 
get some emotions going and fuel empathy for the presenter.

163
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.460 
that's gonna help them to connect to your story.

164
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:35.390 
and that in turn is going to help them keep them excited about the mooc

165
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.900 
curious to see when aren't really caring about the characters,

166
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.550 
see what is going on after its cliffhanger.

167
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:47.940 
so that is what storytelling in general could offer you.

168
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:56.740 
so of course in order to use storytelling you have to think of the story

169
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.980 
and that can be the hard part.

170
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.480 
so what we've done here

171
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.460 
is create a case and sort of showcase how we would think about.

172
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.500 
this if we were introduced to this case.

173
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.480 
we would sort of do a brainstorm of different ideas of different

174
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.940 
ways of approaching this that we could use. so i'm going to

175
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.910 
read it out loud. it's a small case and the topic

176
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.570 
is something that should be a little bit familiar to you.

177
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.180 
so here we go we have a programme director from a small engineering

178
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.610 
faculty in a medium sized european university and tasked to

179
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.680 
introduce moocs to the faculty staff.
now the director has a good grasp of fundamentals.

180
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.420 
but he lacks knowledge on design principles and

181
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.580 
experience in creating moocs.
so the biggest challenge is

182
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:56.350 
to introduce the concept of a mooc and spark enthusiasm
among staff and professors.

183
00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.690 
so to do this the director has enlisted us and you as part

184
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.180 
of a small team two to three teachers and supporting staff.

185
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:10.070 
so together they decide that the best way would be to create a mooc

186
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.040 
themselves and call it creating MOOCs for engineering.

187
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.810 
this can be helpful because creating a mooc

188
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.680 
teaches you a lot about what it takes to make a work now.

189
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.790 
their existing belief around mooc revolves about lots of video

190
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.750 
mainly in the form of talking heads animation seems interesting as well.

191
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.030 
but they could use some inspiration to think

192
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.350 
beyond that see what else is possible.
so they already know

193
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:47.170 
the content and the overall learning goals of his mooc.

194
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.780 
but it is up to you to help them structure remove to make it,

195
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.690 
as exciting as possible to inspire faculty

196
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.520 
to take up the work of creating these moocs.

197
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.520 
so that's our brief, and so now we're going to think about like ok.

198
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.710 
what could we do to make sense of all this content,

199
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.170 
because there's a lot that goes into moocs.

200
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:22.230 
and so very very there's design.
there's an assessment and all

201
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.150 
of these things can come back into the storytelling.

202
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.280 
so now the session is going to be somewhat interactive in the sense

203
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.620 
that all our monitors. we're going to think along

204
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.990 
and we're going to pitch some some storytelling ideas.

205
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.580 
so does anybody want to kick it off.

206
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.030 
yeah. i'm going to switch to a whiteboard,

207
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.790 
and then let's see, if i can pull it up.

208
00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.790 
i think i might need to yeah.

209
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.290 
there we go perfect so.

210
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:08.620 
let's start. i'll give us first idea,

211
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.850 
what if we are slaying a dragon.

212
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.910 
the idea is that a mooc is a multi-headed dragon. it's sort

213
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.950 
of a hydra thing there are so many different things to think about.

214
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.850 
and if you want to avoid being eaten by the dragon you have

215
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.990 
to cut off its heads one by one,

216
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.170 
or indeed put a mark next to an idea that you like.

217
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.430 
i see a couple of exciting ideas as well.

218
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.490 
we have a professor going on a journey. i'm thinking somewhere

219
00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.720 
along the way of a hobbit

220
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.440 
imagining a village that seems exciting as well.

221
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.990 
and a team of professors who enters the new world of mooc.

222
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:40.250 
sort of inspires me have a truong kind of a digital world where

223
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.340 
we're exploring.

224
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.130 
and i think when we're brainstorming this.
it's great not to

225
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:52.210 
limit yourself to things that are feasible or financially

226
00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:57.730 
possible and within the budget you can think big you can think wild.

227
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.440 
i'm seeing a lot of

228
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.690 
awesome ideas.

229
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.640 
the movie is stolen and we have to remake it.

230
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:19.160 
yeah good idea yeah yeah. it's my

231
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:25.350 
brainstorming with a lot of people really helps.

232
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.100 
yeah the movie is better.

233
00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.360 
and somebody says we should slay the dragon using only a fork yeah.

234
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.170 
well there's a challenge.

235
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.010 
you can build up a lot of

236
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.900 
quirky things around this it. and i think that is

237
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.950 
one of the things is that when we talk about content.

238
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.950 
we're usually quite serious you know it. there are learning goals

239
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.990 
and students have to achieve them.

240
00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:00.290 
but storytelling sort of gets a pass on that we can make jokes,

241
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.070 
because it is not necessarily the core content of course can be.

242
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.610 
but it doesn't have to be and that means you can make jokes.

243
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:12.930 
you can have side kicks here a sidekick companion to researchers well.

244
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.170 
you know that could be a very funny person

245
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:21.220 
who makes jokes who makes mistakes even and we you know.

246
00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:26.440 
can you can build things that people losing a moog or getting.

247
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.480 
it stolen and trying to recovering it

248
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:33.720 
that works a universe a professor caught in a university trying

249
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.890 
to solve all of the puzzles i like that as well.

250
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:43.110 
and having it a medieval theme.
i'm saying here a forum is a tavern.

251
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.820 
i like that you could have sort of a medieval theme like

252
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.830 
say people are stuck in the middle evil ages. and they have

253
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.900 
a problem and they could not solve it with the technology at

254
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.460 
the time. but maybe you know something if you're a traveler from the future

255
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.120 
and you can you have to explain it to them.

256
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.850 
i mean, but that's always if you go back in time.
we always think that we would be extremely wise and knowledgeable,

257
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.490 
if we went back in time， but i think the real challenge.

258
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.210 
if you go back in time is finding a way to explain it to them

259
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.140 
and of course if you can explain it then you really know your

260
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.660 
stuff when you really know a topic.

261
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.090 
well, i think we're almost running out of space here.
this is going great.

262
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.600 
we need a dragon yeah.

263
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.350 
and you have to choose your sidekick.

264
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.930 
i like it cooking in chemistry, cooking in chemistry definitely

265
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:46.080 
could work. i'm really surprised we don't see that more.

266
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.090 
i'm  writing an article as if a book was already successful and

267
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.830 
then you know tracing your steps back like what made it work.

268
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.230 
they're going to be a really good exercise.

269
00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.350 
if you think about your teacher when we are in the beginning

270
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.350 
what made it work, what were all the things that come together.

271
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.530 
because it wasn't probably wasn't just storytelling.

272
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.420 
there was something else about him or her

273
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.900 
and our work's charisma and that's a good way of thinking about right.

274
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.400 
so you know,

275
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.230 
so i think what is the nice thing about this little exercise

276
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.820 
is that you don't have to be an expert in story telling to

277
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:38.710 
come up with a story.
a storytelling is so innate in humans. it's so important

278
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.240 
that everybody has a little bit of a storytelling,

279
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.450 
then you can train it and you can try it out.

280
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.080 
so oh okay now this is the fun part.
this is where we're how

281
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.330 
we can spout the ideas

282
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.120 
imagine ourselves at the olympic games of moocs

283
00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.560 
which is also a great idea.

284
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.050 
it becomes very relevant every four years so that helps.

285
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:09.640 
but the next step of course is okay now we have.

286
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.010 
this idea we have this idea of how to

287
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.020 
approach it. what is going to be the driving thing behind our

288
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.530 
mooc. but now we need to make it work on module level

289
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:28.160 
and we have some tools that can can help you do that

290
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.140 
tell everybody. thanks a lot for for all your input.

291
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.370 
there's too much to read.

292
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.010 
but definitely a lot of good ideas,

293
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.830 
if we could switch back to the presentation.

294
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.270 
so i think.

295
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.990 
we have a certain system to design things,

296
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:55.370 
and there we like to say the devil is in the design.

297
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:01.250 
me and my colleague are an expert on storytelling.

298
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:09.770 
but our next colleague knows a lot more about the design aspect.

299
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.460 
so i think this one is for llyn yes indeed. thank you

300
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.110 
and indeed what i am would i like to say when i have a course

301
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.760 
theme like the one from our piece before us

302
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.780 
is that well，it always comes back to design, so after we kind

303
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.470 
of brainstormed with them and we kind of have an idea on the

304
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.180 
storytelling line. what we're going to do is

305
00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.950 
we're going to make a blueprint of the movie with them. and

306
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.830 
we're going to think everything carnot through.

307
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.590 
and what we use k eleven is what we call the a-b-c design methods

308
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:48.190 
for k eleven moocs. but before i kind of elaborate on that and

309
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.080 
take you through that i would like to know

310
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.280 
which design metric do you use. it could be in moocs. but it

311
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.540 
could also be in online courses or at your university. so

312
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.590 
that we can know what people are working with to design courses

313
00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.500 
you can push the digit

314
00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.760 
constructive alignment.

315
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.090 
we use we can use elements from that

316
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.630 
in our mind in the back of our mind backwards planning indeed.

317
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.450 
we have other design methods

318
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.240 
of design that i don't know yet. cool.

319
00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:53.860 
quite a lot of constructive alignment

320
00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.160 
ah another a b c fellow cool.

321
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.280 
cognitive at blending learning.

322
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.800 
okay so some

323
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:17.100 
different design techniques that school.

324
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.670 
i'll take you through our k eleven a b c design for MOOCs.

325
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.250 
and what is it all about. it mainly evolves around these six cards

326
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.180 
and what are these six cards? these six cards represent a six

327
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.630 
types of learning activities.
so we have acquisition discussion

328
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.440 
production practice inquiry and collaboration.

329
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.990 
and as you can see the learner has to do different

330
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.890 
things in all of these types, for example the first one

331
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.410 
your learner is quite passive in that case, because

332
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.090 
they're listening to something.
they're reading something or watching something.

333
00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:00.190 
but for example in a production learning activity.

334
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.160 
they create something there or something touchable at the end.

335
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.920 
for example if they would write an

336
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:10.770 
essay or on a research proposal,
then we would be talking about production.

337
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:15.060 
so what we do with these cards is after we came up with the

338
00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.330 
storyline and with like the overall learning goals of the smoke.

339
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:24.450 
we then think of how can we create learning paths with these

340
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.720 
six kinds arm of learning activities.

341
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.200 
and how does that look ?

342
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.250 
it looks like this, if it's online so as you can see we create

343
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:38.530 
these learning paths with these cards and then the course teams are right down.

344
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.930 
okay we're going to have an acquisition and in that acquisition.

345
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.140 
we're going to explain a certain concepts, and then the next one is

346
00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:52.050 
a practice where they have to apply the definition and so on and so on.

347
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.660 
and then you get these colorful designs.

348
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.560 
in real life it used to look like this really with the cards

349
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.120 
physically and then we would map them.

350
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:07.180 
an so well we have a case of our professor and

351
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.900 
we already came up with the storyline. but now of course we

352
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.460 
would like to think with you about the a-b-c design.

353
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.760 
we already have some ideas, so no worries. but we still have some

354
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.350 
open cards where we kind of didn't know what we could propose.

355
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.510 
so we would like to have your inputs what will happen is

356
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.960 
that analysts will divide us into break-out groups. we will

357
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.340 
be there as well, and you'll receive a link to a google sheets

358
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.790 
and depending on who you are with in the group.

359
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.250 
you can choose a different tab, and then

360
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.710 
we will think what you about the a b c elements.

361
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:53.300 
so i hope you made up a good design with some nice storytelling elements

362
00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:58.660 
in it. and now we chose our learning activities. we can take the next

363
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:04.220 
step and the next step is the multimedia design what kind of multimedia

364
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.310 
will we use in our mooc.

365
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.880 
and how can we select and developed in such a way that the

366
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.510 
multimedia continues to meet the design and the learning objectives.

367
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.860 
first a question we start again with the question.

368
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:30.830 
which multimedia concepts do you know and or use in your moocs.

369
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.780 
the moocs that you made in your institution or the moocs that you

370
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:41.620 
followed yourself.
so you can post it in a jette which multimedia concepts you know

371
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.200 
or the multimedia concepts you already used.

372
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.660 


373
00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:24.980 
i see some recognisable and some interesting and multimedia concepts

374
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:30.540 
and podcasts are kind of popular i think.

375
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.790 
directed videos nice

376
00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.140 
animations story drawing

377
00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.650 
was at kuleuven.

378
00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:03.200 
we have a lot of different kind of multimedia concepts.

379
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.190 
actually you have two main categories of concepts we have

380
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.100 
the d i y concepts. these are the concepts that

381
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.860 
are the core steams.

382
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:19.710 
the professor can make themselves and next to that we also have

383
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:26.060 
a professional production team. but we try to a guide and support

384
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:30.530 
the teachers and the core seems to make concepts themselves.

385
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.870 
and in on this slide you see some of

386
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.160 
the most used concepts actually we have of course a lot more.

387
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.360 
so we have a talking heads demonstrate demonstration showing something

388
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:52.240 
during an interview. i'm making a screen cars. so recording your screen

389
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:59.140 
animation animation can be moving images.
but also like infographic or a figure.

390
00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:04.170 
so to be clear multimedia doesn't have to be about

391
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:10.580 
video only or about moving images it can also be a liking for graphics.

392
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:17.570 
and we also have  in the czech podcast.

393
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.640 
also at k live is becoming more and more a popular

394
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.480 
podcast or audio recording

395
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.200 
something else.

396
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:38.760 
we have at KULEVEN is a knowledge clip studio
for a dear i why recordings.

397
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:43.560 
so course teams go to this knowledge a clip studio themselves

398
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.010 
you see on the right and you see a powerpoint.

399
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.320 
so they use a powerpoints

400
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.870 
to put in their scripts.

401
00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:03.550 
and in this powerpoint is a pre recorded different camera angles.

402
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:08.590 
so they think about before and what will i say. but also how

403
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.590 
will the camera angles be an automatically.

404
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:19.090 
if you load up this powerpoint in the knowledge clip studio.

405
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.930 
it's all just pushing one button and everything is recorded in one short

406
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:29.690 
with different camera angles.
so this is our diving knowledge clip studio,

407
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:37.450 
if there is there are more criteria,

408
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:44.410 
or if there is a more difficult concept. then of course we have

409
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.310 
our professional production team like we have here an interview.

410
00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.460 
it was for one of our psychology moocs about

411
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:58.720 
existential being an emotion grasping the emotion and different

412
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.740 
camera angles at the same time was very important here.

413
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.180 
so then we call in our professional professional production team and

414
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.360 
you can see here, the sky is the limits in what kirstie wants.

415
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.350 
but of course within restrictions of

416
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:21.720 
the budget they have or practical restrictions.

417
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.610 
but how do we make the match? how do we choose

418
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.780 
a multimedia concept? and match them with what we did before

419
00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.170 
in the break-out room the learning activities.

420
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:41.340 
it's not a simple answer. it's actually a multi-factor decision.

421
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.960 
we believe that  you can choose a right

422
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:52.280 
multimedia concept for one learning activity.
but not only the learning activity

423
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.540 
is the only factor also the learning goals of the MOOC as

424
00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.230 
a whole are importance. the learning goals of the module.

425
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.570 
we think about with the course ing before and what

426
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.330 
do you want to reach with your move with,
what do you want to reach specifically

427
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:13.300 
with this module, this chapter of the mooc.

428
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.700 
what is the content that you want to put in this multimedia.

429
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.870 
and what is the experience that you have as a course theme

430
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.490 
and what are your preferences what do you like do you like animation,

431
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.690 
or do you like speaking up for the camera or do you have a

432
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:38.100 
lot of experience for the camera. so we put all this on a scale

433
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.740 
and then together with the course team and the

434
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.380 
mooc team that are we form together a design team.

435
00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:51.180 
and we think together we put this all on a scale

436
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.680 
and then we choose the right multimedia concept.

437
00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:03.110 
let's go to the next exercise.
and i will give the floor to annalee she will

438
00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.320 
explain what we will do next.

439
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.830 
but i have just switched the exercise around a bit.

440
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:16.900 
so of course as i explained a lot of the decisions depend on

441
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.140 
the course on the people on the learning goals.

442
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.210 
but we wanted to do this exercise with you today

443
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.960 
in a more way. it's a little bit more abstract,

444
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.140 
because we don't have a very specific setting,

445
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.950 
but i wanted so i shared this image with you and you can again

446
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.740 
write on the image itself.

447
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:43.080 
and think about different multimedia types and what their strengths are.

448
00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.490 
but also what the weaknesses are,
so where what are they good for what situations

449
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.590 
would a podcast be perfect for why the podcast may be better than

450
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.420 
some of the other types.

451
00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.360 
when is a podcast not such a good idea.

452
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.690 
so feel free to start typing.
i'm also going to encourage my own colleagues

453
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.840 
to start typing somethings.

454
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.460 
so i'll just quickly go over what that's very small.

455
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:18.110 
over the different types. so there's

456
00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.190 
podcasts which you know. there's text and image.

457
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:23.540 
it's an often forgotten.

458
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:27.560 
but it's not very often explicitly used.

459
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.340 
but it still can be very important one

460
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:37.080 
talking head is a video where you see a person talking
there could be words

461
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:41.690 
appearing next to them animation. it's an animation

462
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.820 
maybe a screencast is where something,

463
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.410 
where not a person is talking, but where you see

464
00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.760 
something designed moving a interview is

465
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:56.810 
with two people.
it can be that the the interviewer is not in the image.

466
00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.480 
it can be that they are in the image.

467
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:04.930 
and then i also put documentary which is a bit more labor intensive

468
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:12.160 
and it could be it's a pretty broad category where you

469
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:18.480 
film in the field basically or in a real life example.

470
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.990 
so i already see a lot of things appearing.

471
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:30.770 
ok

472
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:37.230 
so feel free to keep on noting.
but i'm going to go over the different things.

473
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.700 
i see appearing and i'm going to start with podcasts. and i

474
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.790 
already saw that a lot of you guys have experience with podcast.

475
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:45.940 
or that's really interesting.

476
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:52.220 
so i see for the strengths. it can be long and short.

477
00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.010 
that's definitely true.

478
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:01.540 
and it's nice because very often for video we like to keep it short.

479
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:06.520 
but with podcast you can be a longer. it can be used on the go.

480
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.130 
that's also one of the reasons. it can be longer

481
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:16.130 
people often listen to podcasts while they are doing something else driving or

482
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.240 
doing dishes or cooking or whatever.

483
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.220 
i see something the imagination effect,

484
00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.740 
because people have to and i think this is what it means.

485
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:31.710 
if i say something that you wrote down,
and i'm not explaining it correctly please

486
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:36.500 
feel free to interrupt me or either via chat or just put on your microphone.

487
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.920 
but i think with the imagination effect.

488
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:44.880 
you mean that because you have to imagine it yourself. you learn

489
00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:48.460 
better, because you have to make this effort of imagining it

490
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.310 
yourself rather than just seeing it.

491
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:52.610 
thankfully.

492
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:59.480 
it can be repeated.
it can deliver light background information i think definitely

493
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.700 
podcasts are a place.

494
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:08.210 
that is a place that's ideal for nuanceing for discussion

495
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.900 
very often when we use video.
it's really explaining one core concept

496
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:18.250 
while in podcasts there's usually more time and more space for

497
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:23.230 
elaborating going deeper or maybe being a bit more fun being

498
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.300 
a bit more frivolous.

499
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.100 
i see also someone discovered how to turn text.

500
00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.980 
but there's also weaknesses, so definitely a

501
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.460 
podcasts are not always the best idea. um there's no visuals.

502
00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:41.760 
so i think that's definitely the big thing to keep in mind.

503
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:47.110 
visuals can be very supportive.
and with a podcast it's only

504
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.440 
audio and that makes it sometimes

505
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:54.810 
hard to keep interesting of course not suitable for visual learners.

506
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.190 
numbers and figures are very hard. if you don't have visual support

507
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.700 
yeah like explaining an atmosphere in words would

508
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.610 
also be very hard or

509
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:10.570 
very like a demonstration of a chemical experiment

510
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:14.210 
in a podcast that wouldn't work and i think we all feel this.

511
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:15.770 
but of course there's a grey zone

512
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.110 
where where it might work maybe not.

513
00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.980 
i also see not good, not good for very factual knowledge.

514
00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.240 
i also think it would become a bit boring, then if you don't have

515
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.570 
this visual support or

516
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.790 
if it's just summing up numbers yeah that would be a very very

517
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.740 
boring podcast unless you're maybe very good.

518
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.240 
i'm not saying. it's completely

519
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.780 
impossible of course.

520
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:49.920 
then we go to text.

521
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:55.970 
i'm always a bit a big advocate of of text, because i do

522
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.680 
believe it has a lot of strengths and i do see a lot of strengths here.

523
00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.110 
it's cheap to produce that's definitely true.

524
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.110 
you can put it in different languages. it's a straightforward

525
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.230 
you can do it from everywhere. so it's a very

526
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:17.830 
efficient and effective way you can lay out it nice and functional.

527
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.810 
so i mean i guess i'm a very visual learner.
and that's why

528
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:23.440 
i like text and image so much.

529
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.140 
i feel it gives you right away a very good overview.

530
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:33.010 
so i also see like easy to recap.
you don't have to scroll through a video

531
00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:38.110 
especially for key concepts complicated concepts.

532
00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.440 
and it can be visually very nice,

533
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.480 
then it does require some more effort.

534
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.900 
but it definitely pays off, but yeah you could

535
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.120 
also style it as a wiki and make it very easy for things to

536
00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.170 
look up. for example or you can also choose to offer some content

537
00:41:56.170 --> 00:42:01.240 
in two ways making it a video and also making it text an image

538
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.770 
for different purposes.

539
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:06.730 
the weaknesses,

540
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:10.990 
yes if it's done all the time. it's a bit old fashioned. i would

541
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:15.090 
definitely not recommend making a MOOC entirely out of text.

542
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:16.950 
it's also a bit

543
00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.550 
a pity because you have a digital medium, and then you would

544
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.440 
only offer text yeah

545
00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:30.540 
that would be said it can be boring.

546
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.530 
that's true especially, if it's very long text without layout.

547
00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.730 
it can be very discouraging for learners to go through it

548
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.030 
text distracts from voiceover, so if you would use text in a video.

549
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.070 
then it can also be very distracting, so usually people

550
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.620 
read what they see even if they are hearing something else.

551
00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.390 
so as soon as text appears and it's not the same thing as what is being said

552
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.670 
people will start reading and will stop listening.

553
00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:09.630 
of course text is missing body language. it misses

554
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.130 
a feeling interaction the humanizing factor

555
00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:15.700 
which we said before.

556
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:21.110 
yeah that's not so easy to do to text.

557
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.460 
but still don't forget about it.

558
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:26.940 
we have talking heads.

559
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.190 
talking heads of course there's direct audio

560
00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.030 
direct connection with the audience,

561
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:38.020 
especially if you have a good speaker a talking head can be very very

562
00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.920 
powerful.

563
00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:47.230 
it sets the scene. it also allows you to connect

564
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:50.970 
with the person who's there and it gives a face

565
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:54.440 
to the entire course. so very often in

566
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.430 
our MOOC. we will have a host and that will

567
00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:01.490 
be a talking heads just a person introducing things introducing

568
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.980 
modules introducing the course.

569
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.530 
it's just nice to put a face behind

570
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:11.450 
everything, or i just see some things appearing.

571
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.850 
it puts a face behind the MOOC.

572
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:18.960 
i also see that somebody wrote down meyer's principles.

573
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.650 
so when you are making talking heads. it's like what i said before,

574
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.620 
when you choose to also show text or images while the person

575
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:34.540 
is talking make sure it connects a mirror.
myer's principles are about

576
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:39.020 
not having cognitive overload feel free to correct me, if i'm wrong.

577
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.100 
but i think so.

578
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:44.690 
and those are very different to keep in the back of your mind,

579
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.840 
when you're making talking heads maybe one of my colleagues can

580
00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.670 
post a link in the chats

581
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.200 
on myer's principles. weaknesses,

582
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.990 
it can become boring very fast.

583
00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:02.780 
and i think definitely i also see not all professors can talk well.

584
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.970 
it depends a lot on the speaker.

585
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.090 
it can go can get rather lengthy if unscripted,

586
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.160 
and then you really have to

587
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.120 
shorten the speaker.

588
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.300 
and yeah the ability of the instructor to say in camera yeah.

589
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:24.920 
so a lot of depends on the person talking.
i think that's the main message

590
00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:30.280 
and it's very hard when you're giving course teams feedback

591
00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.990 
to tell them. like yeah actually

592
00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.230 
you're not a very good speaker.

593
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.590 
so it's sometimes a bit of a difficult message.

594
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.110 
but of course,

595
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.110 
yeah if you just give some helpful tips you can work together.

596
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:47.980 
do a good talking head together,

597
00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.780 
maybe another strength of talking head, i feel like talking.

598
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:59.040 
head is also a very good place to very shortly introduce

599
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.720 
key concepts. it's usually

600
00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.420 
you're as a learner you really have to focus

601
00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.110 
on the person. and if it's short and concise and very to the point

602
00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.750 
a talking head can be very very powerful

603
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.220 
to deliver factual knowledge.

604
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.230 
then we have animation.

605
00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.570 
so strengths of animation. they're good for complex issues for

606
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.980 
storytelling, they're visually appealing.

607
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.760 
they're easier to relate,

608
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.430 
especially if it's yeah with the complex

609
00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:39.280 
problems or processes you can build up you can really give

610
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.170 
a lot of visual support

611
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.910 
to the message you are bringing.

612
00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:49.220 
there's some weaknesses as well, it's usually very costly to produce,

613
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:55.990 
because it takes a lot of creating of the drawings or of the assets

614
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.810 
you have to film the whole thing i mean from experience. yeah it does

615
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:08.140 
take more time and it takes more effort also before hand

616
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:10.400 
to really come up with a good script.

617
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:17.420 
it could be too artificial. it could be too playful um yeah. there's

618
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:20.710 
there's some dangers to that so choosing, i mean there's a lot

619
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:22.890 
of choices to make when you make animation,

620
00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:28.340 
like what style would we use what type of animation is

621
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:29.700 
a talking head is a pretty

622
00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.240 
clear concept. but with animation you can go

623
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:38.890 
anyway. so also a bit of a wrong way. but definitely it could

624
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:43.400 
also be very strong. so usually because most course teams are

625
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.480 
on a limited budget.

626
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:51.390 
we usually really make them think like where is animation very very useful.

627
00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.790 
so that they can put in their budget in the most effective way.

628
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.220 
i'm interviews,

629
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:05.720 
they're very nice because they're authentic. it's a very

630
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:10.230 
it's a very humanizing way. there's a lot of atmosphere

631
00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:16.700 
people can express opinions you can bring in external experts.

632
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.080 
i feel that interviews

633
00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:24.470 
are usually very a very nice enrichment of a MOOC.

634
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:30.420 
but of course of course also interviews and the

635
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:34.490 
quality of interviews depends on the people speaking. i have

636
00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:38.480 
seen some very bad interviews already.

637
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:40.250 
it needs to have content.

638
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.630 
you have to find the right interview partner and you have to

639
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.370 
be a good interviewer people have to be

640
00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.240 
at ease. i see only one direction with a normal interview.

641
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:56.490 
yes it's only one direction it could also be a panel discussion
for example

642
00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:00.410 
that would actually be a very interesting way of bringing in

643
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:03.770 
more information or also external experts.

644
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.720 
and then we go to documentary slash demonstration.

645
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.540 
so it can it's very powerful, if it's done well.

646
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:19.990 
and i think the strongest point is yes you put

647
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.190 
the audience in the situation.

648
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.170 
a lot of things are very hard to explain with words,

649
00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.040 
also with talking head you only see the face of the speaker.

650
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:37.780 
but if you can really bring people into reality.

651
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:43.080 
that's very very strong, because we pick up so much more.

652
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:46.700 
you know we say an image is worth a thousand words. we pick

653
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.130 
up so much more from things that we see than just what is explained.

654
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.330 
but also here it needs to be done properly of course.

655
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.480 
and it's very expensive although.

656
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:06.060 
if you're willing to cut some corners you can make a documentary.

657
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.310 
but if you want to do it properly yeah then definitely.

658
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:14.790 
because you have to go on location you need a camera crew often,

659
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:18.720 
then you have to edit the whole thing. so usually it's very

660
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.660 
expensive. but also here, if it really adds to the message.

661
00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:28.830 
i would say and you do have budget. i would say go for it. i'm

662
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.870 
in the meantime i saw a lot of things appearing in shot.

663
00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:40.130 
so maybe one of my colleagues can take over, because they have been

664
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.570 
yes i will take over.

665
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:47.810 
thank you. so we are almost at the end of decision.

666
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.690 
i will shortly go back to the google sheet

667
00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:04.910 
in a moment. okay so we go back to our google sheet. i'm

668
00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:11.550 
just to inform you how we do this with our course team.
so it our course seems

669
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:17.850 
to a b c design very link learning activities to our contents.

670
00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:24.510 
and then we do something what we did with you we do a multimedia session

671
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:29.670 
where we give some information about what kind of multimedia

672
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.220 
do there exist what are the

673
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:38.490 
pros and the cons of different types or different concepts of multimedia

674
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.100 
and then we go back to the designing table. and

675
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:49.620 
with all this information we think together also with the story line in our

676
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.060 
heads we go and fill in

677
00:51:55.250 --> 00:52:02.940 
the form, in actually  what is the multimedia concepts

678
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:08.790 
that we will use in these different cards. can be multimedia

679
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:12.850 
saving out multimedia. but it can also be for us.

680
00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:17.530 
this is not multimedia, but it's a form. it also can be

681
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:22.210 
alike drag and rock drop exercise or can be multiple choice.

682
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.540 
and in these different sessions at the end of all these sessions,
we have a

683
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:33.840 
very good blueprints of our MOOC very very exactly know what

684
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.460 
we will are going to do,

685
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:41.080 
what we have to make and also thanks to the learning activities,

686
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.280 
what the student will do and how the student

687
00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:45.990 
is activated.

688
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:55.710 
i'm before i end the session and want to thank you and my colleagues.
i want

689
00:52:56.110 --> 00:53:01.490 
to ask if there are any questions, or you can put your questions

690
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:05.700 
in the chat or you can raise your hands and speak up,

691
00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.920 
or you can choose. so i'll give you some

692
00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:13.670 
minutes to see if there are any questions about

693
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:19.950 
what we explained, what our approach in making a MOOC is and our approach in

694
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:25.960 
selecting multimedia and connecting them to the content
and learning activities.

695
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:30.450 
actually thinking of one.

696
00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:36.440 
so thanks a lot for kind of the input and the resources
here research with

697
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.190 
i open some of those and i will have a look closer on these

698
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:45.700 
later on as well, but regarding the google sheet that you shared

699
00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:49.710 
with us what is still unclear to me is whether

700
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:55.470 
kind of you used this as a blueprint to actually kind of plan the

701
00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.510 
creation process with the creators,

702
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:04.920 
or whether there are kind of some parts that are somewhat already and now

703
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:09.590 
fixed such as for example the first one regarding the production

704
00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:14.030 
process, because i would assume that there are very similar steps that

705
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.110 
are included in the creation of a mooc at the institution,

706
00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:21.290 
such as for example time planning the

707
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:26.930 
kind of activities that are available to the MOOC platform

708
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:31.940 
or kind of the other outline like creating a press release or making

709
00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:36.190 
marketing materials for that course and how you kind of include

710
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.530 
those in the first steps before actually creating the MOOC.

711
00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.240 
that's my question.

712
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.960 
who have the colleagues want to answer.

713
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:52.690 
i'll be happy to take this one.

714
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.340 
i think the a b c design is really

715
00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:00.500 
it's both a place where we bloop the entire course

716
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:06.380 
and also a place where you try out different ideas. so it's a

717
00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:11.920 
way of use it especially in these a b c design sessions.
we sometimes do.

718
00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:16.920 
is that you discuss what sort of learning activities should go were

719
00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:22.950 
shifting modules around. so we like to do initial session with

720
00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:29.450 
with a course to do one module. for example then ask them to

721
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:34.890 
on their own do the other modules.

722
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:37.340 
so i think it's we don't have a fixed form.

723
00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:41.690 
so we start out with a blank sheet basically

724
00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:47.500 
and then together with them we discuss how you should could could build this.

725
00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:51.090 
and then we always refer back to it. so i don't know if anybody

726
00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:52.790 
has anything to add to that.

727
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:01.010 
it maybe shot a question on that.

728
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.980 
sorry you can you can see it.

729
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:13.480 
okay i'm are you going to kind of use the x platform for like.

730
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:18.080 
this very first initial a kind of brainstorming sessions as

731
00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.570 
well as you kind of have that form

732
00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:26.750 
road in your spreadsheet are these kind of in a different settings.

733
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:30.740 
and then later on for the kind of course you switch to tedx .

734
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:36.280 
yeah so usually we will start just with the empty google sheets.

735
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:39.650 
we do have an inspiration session

736
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:42.980 
where we show the different possibilities of the ethics platform.

737
00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.310 
because sometimes we feel that course teams

738
00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:50.380 
don't even know what a mooc looks like or can look like.

739
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:53.960 
and then it becomes too abstract. so we have an inspiration

740
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.740 
session which is a recorded video where we show different possibilities

741
00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.470 
and then we start working with the excel.

742
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:04.990 
and it makes it a lot more tangible for them so that they have

743
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.720 
some idea of what is possible.

744
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.640 
but then we make the entire blue blueprints in the google sheets
and then

745
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.490 
only then we take the step back to the platform.

746
00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:23.080 
okay thanks a lot in ideal situations in reality the flows a bit

747
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:25.870 
more to each other.

748
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:28.770 
server all know that yeah.

749
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:36.760 
ok i see a question in this in the sheds from lisa. it's not

750
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:40.440 
a specific question for the a b c design but one regarding

751
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:45.040 
storytelling also ok of course when creating an adaptive mooc

752
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.380 
which is adaptive to the prior knowledge of the learner's. do

753
00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.750 
we have any advice how to follow the storyline and make it

754
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:57.840 
fit even if learners are seeing or working on different contents.

755
00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:05.950 
no, if you're rune or remco and anser are experts
in storytelling on this.

756
00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:18.480 
yeah sure um well i think it's a good question and it's also

757
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:24.490 
about branching story lines.
but actually if you're christian maybe somewhere.

758
00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:28.520 
i'm not some per se branching as a meeting one thing you could

759
00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.330 
consider is that you have different learners with different

760
00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:36.090 
characters basically. so you could envision a character and

761
00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:37.500 
this can also help you in

762
00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:43.220 
visualizing the kind of background your learners may have especially if you're considering

763
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:44.320 
different backgrounds.

764
00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:49.370 
and when you have a character around that you could set up

765
00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:52.500 
a story line where they they meet where they interact

766
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:55.440 
and that could bring them together and

767
00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:00.520 
yeah a character could be a persona yeah um that could help.

768
00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:06.040 
but answers your question a little bit.

769
00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.210 
there yes

770
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:20.160 
you're welcome maybe too to add to that sometimes. we also

771
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:24.260 
if there is different prior knowledge we sometimes also make

772
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.920 
some more introductory modules that are optional.

773
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:31.360 
of course that's not very from a storytelling

774
00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:34.600 
perspective. but it could be that

775
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.150 
they're like more the initial part of the story. but that people

776
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.610 
who are already or familiar with the subject actually don't

777
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:41.890 
need that part of the story

778
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:43.860 
to follow the rest.

779
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.310 
yeah yeah and you could also think in terms of a flash word a flashback

780
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:54.680 
or perhaps some learners who are lacking some some knowledge

781
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.380 
may get a flashback too to some other point which may not

782
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:05.490 
directly tie into the main storyline.
but could be sort of like an optional scene

783
01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.530 
if you think of it in a way as a movie.

784
01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.650 
okay i saw one more question in the chat. but it was about

785
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:25.990 
a mobile MOOCs and i saw on lean and only already answered tease.

786
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.210 
so if there are no further questions.

787
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.970 
i will share for the last time our

788
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.220 
presentation. because we have a question for you, then

789
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:46.970 
we are at the end of this workshop

790
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:50.520 
for us. it was very interesting to see all your inputs.

791
01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:56.450 
but how was it for you do you have one take- away message.

792
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.490 
from this workshop and what is it you can share it in the chats

793
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.930 
thank you a lot for your nice take- away messages nice to see that you

794
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.350 
took something from this workshop.

795
01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.600 
you can still post your take away message, if you didn't

796
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:26.240 
do it yet i'm on the lease i already posted it in the chats.

797
01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.540 
but it's also on the slides and we are always interested

798
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:35.110 
in exchanging exchanging practices with you

799
01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.190 
or hearing from you what you thought about this workshop or

800
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:43.900 
getting some inputs or giving an inputs or answering questions.

801
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:47.080 
you can mail everything to MOOCS at k eleven

802
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:53.900 
dot b e when you come in our mailbox you can also have a look

803
01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:01.170 
on our websites, and on this website's is also a
small book on making mousse.

804
01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:04.290 
we are currently redesigning, it's

805
01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:11.550 
actually the subsection in the breakouts in the glow sheet

806
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:15.560 
is a subsection of this little mooc we are making.

807
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.750 
so it will in the next i don't know

808
01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.030 
six months there will be a new

809
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.110 
course on this website. but you can also have a look to our

810
01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.990 
previous course of making looks.

811
01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:37.190 
and then we have some reference here and then i can always

812
01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:43.710 
only say thank you a lots for being in this workshop a for doing

813
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:49.480 
a long for giving your input.
it was very nice for us i also want to thank

814
01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:50.920 
my colleagues.

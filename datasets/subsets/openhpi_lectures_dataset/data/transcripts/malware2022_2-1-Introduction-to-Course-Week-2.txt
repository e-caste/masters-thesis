00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.750 
Welcome to the second week of our open
HPI course Cyberthreats by Malware.

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.580 
A short recap
of course week one:

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.940 
in course week one we provided a general
overview about cyber attacks

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.910 
by malware - malicious
software.

5
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
We discussed why the internet
at all and each single user

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.560 
is such an interesting target point
for cybercriminals that attack

7
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.580 
the systems by
means of malware.

8
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.830 
We discussed who are the attackers on
the internet, what are their motives,

9
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.640 
why they attack the users. We discussed
how one can get infected by malware.

10
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.550 
This is a very
important

11
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.460 
topic when we now in this week
will speak about different

12
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.420 
types of malware attacks. We
discussed what are the reasons

13
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.770 
for malware infections, we distinguished
between the human factors

14
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.780 
and the technical
failures.

15
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.530 
So what we want to do this week is
that we will consider the different

16
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.040 
types of malware.

17
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.860 
One differentiation of malware
types is by the way they spread.

18
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.230 
So we distinguish virus, we
distinguish malware which

19
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.220 
belongs to the category
of worms or of trojans.

20
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.610 
It can also be differentiated
by the actions it takes -

21
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.620 
exfiltrate data, manipulate
systems and others.

22
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.240 
So what we will consider is the
most common types of malware.

23
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.730 
We will speak about Botnets, we will
consider Rootkits and Backdoors, we

24
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.700 
discuss Adware
and Spyware,

25
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.270 
Scareware and
Rougeware,

26
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.440 
Ransomware attacks
and Keyloggers.

27
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.320 
And of course, what we in addition
will do - we will highlight

28
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.660 
some interesting malware examples. So for example
"Emotet" - "The Social-Engineering Malware",

29
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.390 
or "Carberp" - "The Phishing Malware".

30
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.790 
And then, this is a very important part
of what we want to discuss this week,

31
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.280 
is how we can protect our machines,
how we can protect our devices

32
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.980 
against malware attacks.

33
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.670 
And then finally for those
which are more technically

34
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.930 
interested, we offer two
excursus about firewalls -

35
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.770 
how they are working,

36
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.140 
what is their task and we
discuss anti-virus scanners

37
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.770 
and their objectives. So we hope
it's an interesting programme

38
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.090 
and are happy that
you are with us.

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.489 
Hello, it's me again Wolfram Greis the European Mainframe Academy,

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.019 
and in the next video clip, I want to talk about Eclipse and RDz.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.299 
RDz stands for rational developer for C.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.019 
C means, of course, System C, the IBM mainframe and especially

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.539 
the z/OS operating system.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.950 
In the last video clip, we talked about ISPF, ISPF

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.204 
the character oriented editor interface.

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.339 
I said already in the last video clip, that's the developers

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.729 
normally don't use ISPF anymore.

10
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.439 
So you have a so-called integrated development environment and in

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.299 
many cases in, especially when it comes to

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.799 
the interface to a z/OS system, it's eclipse based.

13
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.479 
Eclipse, what is eclipse? Eclipse is an IDE, an integrated development

14
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.769 
environment written in Java, means for

15
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.411 
the eclipse tool to be installed

16
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.229 
Java must be in place because the the

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.010 
tool is written in Java.

18
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.360 
The good integrated development environment is essential for higher productivity.

19
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.299 
Eclipse was developed at IBM, it was a former

20
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.889 
WebSphere workbench within the especially

21
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.809 
IBM environments.

22
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.819 
IBM invested around 30 million dollars in Eclipse

23
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.589 
and donated this investment in

24
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.209 
November 2001 as an open source software and named

25
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.210 
it Eclipse.

26
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.809 
In 2004 the Eclipse Foundation was established with

27
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.370 
some founding members, you can read them here, Borland, IBM, MERANT,

28
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.369 
Rational, Red Hat, SuSE and so on.

29
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.709 
In between, Eclipse Foundation has more than 100 members

30
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.179 
and to its serves, one of

31
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.219 
the most important open source frameworks today for software development.

32
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.259 
It's a core component.

33
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.939 
Eclipse has a core component and can be extended with many so-called

34
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.179 
plugins and now dependent.

35
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.179 
What you want to do with Eclipse.

36
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.199 
You can extend it with plugins as as example

37
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.169 
with source control interface such as kit with

38
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.969 
memory and CPU profiles, and especially in the IBM mainframe

39
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.389 
environment. We have a lot of explorers to IBM

40
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.879 
C to subcomponents like modules as an MQ

41
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.499 
Explore, thers's a CICS Explore, there is

42
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.139 
an IMS explorer and so on.

43
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.599 
So these are all our plug ins extending the core product

44
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.860 
and eclipse.

45
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.019 
The sets a hierarchy.

46
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.609 
It begins with a rock space, so if you stop eclipse, you

47
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.049 
specify or it's already defined by default, you specify a

48
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.239 
workspace. And within this workspace, you can have different projects.

49
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.709 
Projects can be as example and special application you want

50
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.149 
to develop and in your within your projects, you

51
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.809 
have different perspectives and perspective again,

52
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.769 
is a combination of Fuze and editors.

53
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.839 
Let's have a look on these components.

54
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.609 
Workspace is a collection of portraits, settings, preferences.

55
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.469 
It's essentially a directory for hosting that projects,

56
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.119 
but cause it is more the object in objects in this directory

57
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.189 
are managed and maintained to with meta information that is included.

58
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.469 
And that's why you never should delete files in such a directory

59
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.899 
directly without the eclipse interface, because the meta information

60
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.339 
center is not updated and it

61
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.750 
causes problems, of course.

62
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.709 
Projects are essential in eclipse, they in many cases

63
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.359 
each project is a different enterprise application, especially

64
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.029 
when we talk about, as example, Java enterprise

65
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.619 
environments. The files should only be accessed via

66
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.059 
projects because they are managed by is such an

67
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.589 
environment, and the project involves Mason normally is

68
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.200 
managed via ExxonMobil.

69
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.469 
We kind of have different perspectives, perspectives are collections of different

70
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.089 
windows, these different windows are called Fuze, and

71
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.159 
most windows in Eclipse can be classified as an editor

72
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.749 
or special fuel and doing your development status.

73
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.189 
You normally need different perspectives as example for the

74
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.139 
editing phase where you design your project,

75
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.859 
you have a different perspective as example when you

76
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.219 
when you test your environment or when you park your environment, you can switch

77
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.979 
between these perspectives very easily.

78
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.109 
And editor is something where you can change the information displays

79
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.169 
displayed in it. You can have different editors in place.

80
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.059 
And as example, especially in the mean time environment, you can also

81
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.279 
include an ISPF editor.

82
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.319 
It's the same editors that is used.

83
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.819 
It will see a character based interface ISPF I showed you in

84
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.820 
the last video clip.

85
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.049 
You just displays the information and does normally not

86
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.149 
allow to change it. An example

87
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.319 
is CAC editing, not the editing

88
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.909 
to develop a few. And another example can be a deep, dark view and

89
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.910 
so on.

90
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.099 
With open perspective, it's a special

91
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.539 
possibility. In the navigation bar you can select, you can select

92
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.309 
which task oriented perspective, depending on what you want to do,

93
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.999 
will open. And with so few, you can

94
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.899 
check which views are available within your selected

95
00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.900 
perspective.

96
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.109 
It gives environments are available for many languages, so when you go to

97
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.729 
the Eclipse website, you have a lot of possibilities

98
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.049 
to choose from as examples as a base Java

99
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.619 
interface, it follows each Java standard edition.

100
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.229 
There is a special environment for Java

101
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.819 
EE stands for Enterprise Edition, you can

102
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.479 
work with a special version.

103
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.239 
Concerning this JavaScript, C, C++, PHP and

104
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.279 
so on, really a lot of different possibilities available and

105
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.199 
sees the difference between these different environments

106
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.939 
is normally see a number and see kind of plug ins

107
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.860 
that are already included in these environments.

108
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.189 
Odyssey now is a space special commercial product

109
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:11.079 
from IBM means its eclipse based and especially

110
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.759 
it's really very useful to get in contact with the eclipse environment,

111
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.889 
not just for the developers, although for the administration

112
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.899 
people, because in future, many interfaces, graphical interfaces,

113
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.399 
also management interfaces into z/OS environment are based

114
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.959 
on eclipse. Some maybe some knowabout see see you ask him if

115
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.759 
there's a IS management facility and these are graphical user

116
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.859 
interface that are used today to work with an IBM

117
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.499 
mainframe see US system and IBM goes

118
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.969 
further and falls onto also include such graphical user

119
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.769 
interfaces and the all these interfaces are based on eclipse.

120
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.239 
And that's why I recommend for all users of a zero

121
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.129 
system to get in contact with Eclipse and know how the basic ideas

122
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.569 
I showed you before these workspaces, perspectives, views and so on,

123
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:18.309 
and how they relate to each other and how they are managed.

124
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:23.409 
So RDz is the eclipse based commercial

125
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.389 
environment from IBM, with focus on different languages and

126
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.859 
with Odyssey, you can very easily define

127
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.359 
and and create your COBOL

128
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.859 
programs, Pier one program, see assembler and so on, and you have a lot

129
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.449 
of tools and interfaces

130
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.949 
to access very easily. DeVita I am, as I am as

131
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:55.809 
hierarchical database from IBM, see ISIS

132
00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.279 
as a transaction monitor message, queuing as a message queuing interface

133
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.639 
and so on. So it's a really good idea.

134
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.649 
Of course, it's a commercial product.

135
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.209 
It costs money, but in many cases it's worth the money because you have a lot

136
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.769 
of things that are included

137
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.889 
in an odyssey environment so that I'm not included in the basic

138
00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.549 
eclipse environment.

139
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:29.189 
Some ideas, sir, you have different editors with

140
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.059 
different preferences. You can choose the editor I just mentioned.

141
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.709 
You can choose between Emacs, you can use SPF, you can use VI,

142
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.049 
which editors you want to use.

143
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.679 
There are different compilers behind them.

144
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.139 
You have an interface to the linkage editor.

145
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.789 
Linkage editor is a tool to make from an

146
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.370 
object code and and

147
00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.089 
files that can be executed. You have a Parker environment, you have a version control

148
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.399 
system. A lot of tools are available and some more features

149
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.499 
you can connect to see us.

150
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.099 
You can have access to data sets and files.

151
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.319 
Difference between datasets and files.

152
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.789 
Datasets Aussie national datasets that are available in a

153
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.229 
classical z/OS environment and files are structures in

154
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.659 
the Unix systems services environment.

155
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.309 
Unix systems are always, in fact uses his article file system system

156
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.779 
as we are accustomed to it in Unix on Linux.

157
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.399 
It really is the same. The same idea of hierarchical file system is that

158
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.539 
a system is set up in Unix systems offices.

159
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.099 
You can allocate new datasets without knowing each and every detail

160
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.609 
you can create and submit patch without having to create a

161
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.909 
tree. You can use the SD.

162
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:59.459 
As I mentioned SDF already for having a look into the spool

163
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.379 
volumes you can use of as, oh come on, tell a lot of interfaces are available

164
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.689 
with Odyssey.

165
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.899 
You can use Telnet 3270 emulation.

166
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.609 
I mentioned when I talked about DSL and here you see you really

167
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.889 
have a lot of perspectives available in such an odyssey environment,

168
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:25.319 
depending on what you want to do and depending on which

169
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.330 
languages you want to work with.

170
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.489 
I already talked about the explosions.

171
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.649 
You can also extend a basic eclipse environment

172
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.599 
here, you have already integrated all these explorers for

173

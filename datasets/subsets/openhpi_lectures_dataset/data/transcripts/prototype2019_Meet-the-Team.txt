00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.370 
Hi, my name is Karen! - I'm
Lena.- And I'm Mana.

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.710 
We are your instructors for this
MOOC. We are researchers at

3
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.280 
the HPI-Stanford Design Thinking
Research Program and Design Thinking

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.590 
coaches. - This week we want to
start with a little introduction

5
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.890 
game to get to know each other.
The game is called Protobot

6
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.480 
and is designed by Molly Wilson.
You might remember her from

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.080 
our earlier online courses.
So this is how the Protobot

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.730 
game works: it gives you a random
prototyping task and you build

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.860 
it as quickly as possible with the
material that you find lying

10
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.340 
around you. So your
prototype in the end

11
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
is a quick resemblance of the
idea. - With this game we really

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.210 
want to get you in the mood of
building things quickly without

13
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.140 
overthinking them. The tasks that
the Protobot gives you may

14
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.100 
sometimes sound random or even
funny, but that's the whole point

15
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.230 
of the game. It's a playful way to
build physical representations

16
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.320 
of different ideas. We hope that
by the end of the course you

17
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.780 
also develop this prototyping
mindset. So now we will also

18
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.450 
play the Protobot game to demonstrate
how it works. And to do

19
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.080 
so, I click the 'randomize'
button on the website

20
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.330 
and I get my task. My task is:
'Design a pencil that you wear

21
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.750 
on your head'. Now, Mana of
course also gets her task.

22
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.290 
Mana's task is: - 'Design a stapler
that you need an appointment

23
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.090 
to use.' Wow, interesting. - And
now for Lena. - Mine is: 'Design

24
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.220 
a vehicle that causes
social awkwardness.'

25
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.830 
Okay, now we have three
minutes to build these

26
00:01:48.520 --> 00:02:28.770 
tasks and then we will show
you what we came up with!

27
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.550 
So my task was to 'Design a stapler
that you need an appointment

28
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.830 
to use'. So this is
what I've designed.

29
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.690 
When I wanted to use the stapler, it
told me that 'sorry, it doesn't

30
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.930 
have any time for you', but you can
check the availability calendar

31
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.900 
to see when you can book this
stapler, and this is where I can

32
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.050 
get an overview and I can
book it and use it.

33
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.890 
Very busy stapler. Okay, Lena? - I had
to 'Design a vehicle that causes

34
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.470 
social awkwardness'. So what I
have here is a vehicle, and you

35
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.240 
already see one person
sitting in the vehicle

36
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.960 
and it says that every spot needs
to be used by two people, so

37
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.050 
you always have someone
sitting on your lap.

38
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.580 
And at the same time there is
a mirror so you have someone

39
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.300 
sitting on your lap and you
constantly see yourself in the

40
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.120 
mirror. I hope this is a double
awkward moment for you.

41
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.550 
Super awkward. Okay my task was to
'Design a pencil that you can

42
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.070 
wear on your head', and if you are
an extremely fashionable person

43
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.600 
you can now wear your pencil
on your head, looks great.

44
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.400 
But on top of that you can also
write your notes with it.

45
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.080 
Here you go. So very useful new prototype.
And here are all our prototypes

46
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.330 
again. - In the next tab, you
will find all the instructions

47
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.230 
on where and how to play this
game. We recommend that you also

48
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.120 
give yourself a short amount
of time for prototyping

49
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.880 
because this time pressure really
prevents you from overthinking

50
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.420 
and also it helps you to get
into the building mode.

51
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.710 
And try to go for the very first
task that you get already,

52
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.770 
although it might sound challenging
like the ones that we had

53
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.260 
for instance. This will get your
imagination going and it will

54
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.160 
be a lot of fun. - We want to share a
recommendation for the assignment

55
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.230 
in this course with you. In one
part of the assignment you will

56
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.370 
have to test your prototype
with at least two users.

57
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.170 
So already ask some friends,
family or colleagues now

58
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.820 
if they're willing to test with
you. It's also helpful if you

59
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.310 
already set up a place
and the date for this.

60
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.900 
So now we're very excited to see
your prototypes and also excited

61
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.950 
to see you in
the course!

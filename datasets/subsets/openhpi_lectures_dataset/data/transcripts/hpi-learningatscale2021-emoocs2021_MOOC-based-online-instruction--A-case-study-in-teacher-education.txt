00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.220 
hello my name is doors danish, and i will present to you our research on mooc

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.150 
based flipped learning.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.610 
mooc based online flipped learning a case study in teacher

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.600 
education, that's the title of our paper. this is our research

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.340 
team. we're all colleagues at math university.
i am educational technology coordinator

6
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.860 
caroline is the director of south and zaha is the associate dean

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.930 
for the faculty of education and livia is a student at math and

8
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.330 
a research assistant and she helped us conduct the interviews

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.390 
for the qualitative data.

10
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
so the research started with the digital platform electives

11
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.430 
at math the micro credential program. and basically the program

12
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.250 
is that students can use moocs for their elective courses. and

13
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.250 
the aim behind the program was to embrace the digital age paradigm shift

14
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.870 
to integrate micro credentials into our curriculums to recognize no formal learning

15
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.370 
and to give our learners more choice and autonomy. and the program

16
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.290 
was launched in the spring semester of 2020 before covid-19.

17
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.040 
so how does the micro credential program work? students choose a mooc.

18
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.150 
they inform their faculties and then an instructor is allocated to the course.

19
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.860 
and based on the MOOC the instructor has to design

20
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.300 
the following. learning outcomes an end of the semester performance task,

21
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.610 
and a course curriculum which has to include at least two sequence

22
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.130 
lessons and can also include other learning tasks which the instructor

23
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.620 
deems necessary for the students to reach to the learning outcomes.

24
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.940 
you can find a detailed description of the program on our website.

25
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.690 
so what was the purpose of the research? the purpose was to

26
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.880 
investigate the efficacy of the design and implementation of the course

27
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.910 
from the perspective of the students and instructor flipped

28
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.360 
learning in education elective course. this was the first course

29
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.530 
of the micro credentials program at math.

30
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.110 
and we wanted to see how effective it was and what changes

31
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.500 
we need to make moving forward with the program. so this course

32
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.780 
was requested by faculty of education students.

33
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.120 
the mooc course was based on his flipped learning three point o level one.

34
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.410 
rapid transition to online learning which is a minimal was integrated

35
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.920 
into the course after the course nineteen hit as it was relevant.

36
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.950 
and the course was designed by caroline who is also one of

37
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.040 
the researchers.

38
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.540 
investigating best practices for course design.

39
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.360 
the instructor realized that she was dealing with a bMOOC from an existing

40
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.900 
xMOOC. so she drew on suggestions from the bMOOC literature

41
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.790 
to guide her course design and MEF is a flip university. so

42
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.550 
she used her experience with flipped learning

43
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.480 
specifically global elements of effective flipped learning which

44
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.670 
described best practices for flipped learning.

45
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.450 
the instructor looked at the course overview of the MOOC and

46
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.530 
reflected on local needs.

47
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.680 
basically she conducted a mini instructional analysis here.

48
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.440 
and then she developed learning outcomes based on the content

49
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.060 
following bloom's taxonomy and with a focus on higher levels of thinking

50
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.500 
as terminal outcomes.

51
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.190 
stage two assessment. so there were four different assessments in the course.

52
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.060 
the MOOC certification participation in one synchronous online lesson.

53
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.460 
our first lesson was not great it. an end of the course performance

54
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.790 
task which was designed with a back course design approach.

55
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.950 
this end of the course performance task specifically tested

56
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.270 
the terminal outcomes of the course.

57
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
it was supported by a rubric which was provided to the students.

58
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.890 
and it mirrored a real life task.

59
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.070 
the students had to choose a skill like playing chess making

60
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.570 
origami. they had to write a flipped lesson plan to teach it,

61
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.280 
and then teach it. and peer and self evaluations were integrated

62
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.270 
into the curriculum to increase dialogue interaction and better cognition.

63
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.090 
this is a summary of the learning outcomes and how they match with assessments

64
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.230 
in the course moving on to course design stage three units.

65
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.730 
so the instructor followed a simple logical workflow

66
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.590 
paced learning and involved active learning tasks.

67
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.370 
stage four IT infrastructure. so after design the pedagogy

68
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.430 
instructor moved on to the technology side of things.

69
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.190 
so she chose appropriate systems and tools

70
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.410 
to support active learning strategies. learning management system

71
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.270 
blackboard learn was used. blackboard collaborate was used as

72
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.650 
a virtual meeting space, and google tools were used for communication and

73
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.120 
collaboration. this is the course page.

74
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.650 
research methodology the course ran with forty students over

75
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.620 
thirteen weeks from february to may two thousand and twenty case study methodology

76
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.970 
mixed methods was used. and our research question was how effective

77
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.790 
was foote learning in education course regarding student achievement of learning outcomes

78
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.300 
engagement with only systems tools and materials and satisfaction.

79
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.920 
this is how we tested for the three indicators for achievement of learning outcomes.

80
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.810 
we analyze the grades from the great center,

81
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.080 
for engagement with only systems tools and materials. we collected

82
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.750 
data from learning management system. and for satisfaction we

83
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.850 
sent out an anonymous questionnaire containing twenty two questions.

84
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.450 
using a four point scale which we sent out via google forms

85
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.840 
and eight students in total completed it.

86
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.720 
qualitative data. so we interviewed four students the interview

87
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.240 
was done by a research assistant. the data collection method was thirty minute

88
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.510 
individual semi-structured interviews with open questions, then

89
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.460 
following brown and clark we conducted thematic analysis for

90
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.370 
the interviews. blackboard collaborate was used to support the thematic analysis,

91
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.710 
liquid text software was used.

92
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.550 
and these interviews were used to discern the quantitative

93
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.070 
data on the indicators. also the course instructor was interviewed

94
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.500 
by one of the authors in order to support the quantitative

95
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.560 
data on the indicators, as well as the student interviews.

96
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.820 
this is an example of themes development using liquid text.

97
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.920 
the software helps you color code testimonials cluster the men

98
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.830 
links them together.

99
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.770 
so results and findings indicator one achievement of learning outcomes.

100
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:50.070 
here on the left you can see each of the learning outcomes.

101
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.460 
and then here you can see their total way

102
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.330 
and average cross grade.

103
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.040 
indicator two engagement with online systems tools and materials.

104
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.140 
the two MOOCs for learning three point o and the rapid

105
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.810 
transition to online learning were completed by all of the

106
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.150 
students or forty students.

107
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.440 
thirty seven announcements were made by the instructor in fourteen weeks.

108
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.380 
discussion board which was left open for the students to ask

109
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.230 
questions and help each other was not used at all.

110
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:32.520 
online quiz which was given as a pre-class quiz before the graded

111
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.330 
online lesson was completed by thirty six students.

112
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.380 
with keys which the students used to give each other feedback

113
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.590 
had seventy five entries. the virtual office which the students

114
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:50.410 
could use to request to meet at with the instructor was not used,

115
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.440 
or requested by the students.

116
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:59.270 
as student chat room which again was left open during the course for students untracked

117
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:05.130 
was not used. and lastly e-mails there were about two hundred e-mails

118
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.660 
between the students and instructor over the semester. indicator

119
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.900 
three satisfaction. these are the results from the satisfaction survey.

120
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.410 
so the combined data analysis of the quantitative and the qualitative data revealed three overarching themes.

121
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:27.190 
these were quality and quantity of communication and collaboration,

122
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.790 
significance for career development and suitability of the MOOC.

123
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.460 
quality and quantity of communication and collaboration.

124
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:44.750 
so in terms of means of communication,
there were a lot of announcements thirty seventy total.

125
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.310 
other means of communication discussion board virtual office

126
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.800 
and virtual check room,

127
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.970 
which were not graded or mandatory to use were not used, and

128
00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.090 
based on the interviews students said that they chose to use

129
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:05.010 
whatsapp to communicate with their close friends and if they had questions that

130
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.350 
they would ask in those whatsapp groups.

131
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.750 
regarding the online lesson this shakhter said

132
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.530 
that it was successful compared to the first meeting as it

133
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:22.550 
had a specific task and objective and was graded in terms of the amount of

134
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.920 
asynchronous, synchronous work. eighty seven percent said that

135
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.340 
working in a fully asynchronous environment at my old pace was effective,

136
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:36.090 
and seventy five percent said that they did not want an increase
in synchronous lessons.

137
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.290 
producing an effective pre-class video was one of the outcomes

138
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:45.080 
and it had a very low average grade compared to the other outcomes.

139
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.130 
the low average grades was due to three students receiving zero.

140
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.940 
at two did not create a video at all,

141
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.480 
and one uploaded a youtube video.

142
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.990 
more on quality and quantity of communication collaboration,

143
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.920 
feedback on performance tasks all of the students in satisfaction

144
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.410 
surveys had feedback on my lesson plan from my instructor was effective and timely.

145
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:15.610 
and the importance of this was emphasized in the interviews as well.

146
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.960 
the example lesson plan and template for the performance task,

147
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.580 
so the students were provided both an example lesson plan and

148
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.390 
a lesson plan template

149
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.930 
to guide them with their performance task and all of the students

150
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.010 
in service said the example lesson plan was useful and eighty

151
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.300 
seven dot five indicated that the lesson plan template was also useful.

152
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.180 
the instructor said that she believes that this gave the students

153
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:46.590 
the structured required to make an effective flip lesson.

154
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.490 
peer evaluation for the performance task seventy five percent of

155
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:54.120 
the participated indicated satisfaction with peer feedback

156
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.030 
and this was supported in the interviews.

157
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.730 
significance for career development. thirty six out of forty

158
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.370 
students passed the course.
but all completed the MOOCs to obtain their certificates.

159
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.690 
all interviewed students said that they were motivated to get the certificate,

160
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.590 
eighty seven point five of the students indicated that the end of

161
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.380 
course performance task was meaningful. and all of the interviewed

162
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:23.890 
students refer to how the course can assist them in their future careers.

163
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.460 
and lastly suitability of the milk paste learning was deemed

164
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.730 
important as some students did not pace learning in line with
the suggested deadlines.

165
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.990 
the instructor said the least successful students did not complete

166
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.150 
their felt job moocs before writing lesson plans,

167
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.410 
and related to this marks grading system for providing evidence

168
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.790 
of learning was also deemed important different books have different

169
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.830 
grading systems for their end of unit quizzes as you know. and

170
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.940 
some are more flexible than others and the mooc that we used

171
00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.590 
was very flexible students could go through

172
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.140 
the quizzes to get the correct answers, and then do them on

173
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:11.360 
as much as they like to and this was pointed out to us by one of the students

174
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.220 
as well in the interviews.

175
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.830 
so from the findings and drawing on the three teams we developed this framework and

176
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.320 
guiding questions for the design of an effective mooc based

177
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:33.160 
online flip course especially for micro credentials program.

178
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.810 
conclusion. so based on the results the foot learning in education course

179
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.700 
was effective regarding student achievement learning outcomes and satisfaction,

180
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.870 
however there is room for improvement regarding engagement

181
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.900 
with all my systems tools and materials which requires a lot

182
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.570 
of attention and effort when creating bmooc from an xmooc.

183
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.990 
this research provides a framework and guiding questions for

184
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.040 
creating effective MOOC based flipped online courses especially

185
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.810 
like i said for the micro credentials program.

186
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.490 
we believe that such a course designed for our cities can benefit their students'

187
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.930 
career development by integrating my credentials into the curriculum fostering learner

188
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.610 
choice and autonomy and bringing flexibility delivering quality

189
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.250 
instruction in times of uncertainty like the covid-19

190
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.180 
pandemic that we just had. thank you very much for listening.

WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.910 
ok so let's take the next
step on one of the ideas

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.320 
on that we get that we had when
we implemented this model you

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.230 
controller was that we can catch
multiple use to the same model

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.630 
and all of them
automatically get updated

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.470 
through z observatiton
through the observer so

6
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.580 
now we're going to yeah use the
benefits of the observer pattern

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.750 
to implement this
behavior exactly so

8
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
you still i hope so at least
you remember the account

9
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.770 
of you that that we had and we
didn't change anything here

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.030 
so we have this strike at
that's what we add that

11
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.650 
was the last thing that we added
because we we do this on

12
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.170 
typecasting here which could go
wrong because no objects this

13
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.100 
typecasting explicit occurs which
could go wrong because the

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.710 
object doesn't always need
to be something that

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.360 
can be cast into an integer and
arm so what we do know as we

16
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.080 
just add a couple of new use so we
had the tiny little rectangle

17
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.930 
which moves along the screen yet
and now we want to move have

18
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.560 
another rectangle for example
that change the color exactly

19
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
and we prepared a
little bit here so on

20
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
you don't have to wait until he
slowly tried everything in

21
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.280 
the exact so it does
basically the same so it

22
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.960 
register as the if you
with the subject

23
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.570 
so calls the on the observed
that the super the

24
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.100 
construct of the superclass
the of the observe

25
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.500 
extend also extends the observer
on and then we just kind of

26
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.820 
have a new array of colors here
and then we cast again because

27
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.940 
the value into an end and
then we just go through

28
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.020 
the array is or not be
we define and use

29
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.150 
we define a new color
for for each element

30
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.500 
and then on we kind of an and use
them as the the the red green

31
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.290 
and blue all factors and feel
direct ending with these

32
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.670 
countries cobb that kind of this
created from these three components

33
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.890 
and then we we draw we
re draw the same thing

34
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.620 
as before nothing new in
and then another third

35
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.510 
one which is displayed a number
of arm and in this case it's

36
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.960 
little different because
here for example

37
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.550 
we can use a string
there because

38
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.040 
we need a string in the end
to display the number

39
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.600 
so we need also to kind of make
this object that we pass in

40
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.820 
into a string and the easiest way
to make something to string

41
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.060 
is to chose at an empty space
again with what we will know

42
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.630 
we'll call internally to
string on the object

43
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.780 
and then add an empty
in active string and

44
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.280 
which does nothing
and yeah and in

45
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.490 
line number ten we update was a
string already given doesn't

46
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.250 
that interview
with the other

47
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.570 
methods like in kind of
color all condom you

48
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.740 
know i mean because this update
method is an object object

49
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.260 
is fine and the only place
where it would cause

50
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.030 
problem is where we do the
typecasting and we don't do attack

51
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.180 
us in the same as of
this date only cords

52
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.090 
this update in this class so
therefore and basically it

53
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.410 
might also be would
also work like this

54
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.600 
because then the the integer
would be turned to string in

55
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.220 
the same way than
any other so

56
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.020 
what do we need to do we
need to say that first

57
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.370 
then we need to consecrate
or them use and

58
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.540 
here we need to register
them was our model

59
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.290 
but this is
automatically done

60
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.390 
more or less and less so let's
start with the so we create

61
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.150 
the references first
opened of you cum and

62
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.450 
continue number and all of
these are still observance

63
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.240 
and now we fifty clear or
references now we need to assigns

64
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.610 
values so we need to court
constructors and this is also kind

65
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.320 
of a basic concept in
using these design that

66
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.390 
answers try to use the
interface wherever possible

67
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.520 
because polymorphism
is going to

68
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.080 
ok so that's that now

69
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.570 
we can control a good so
you can digital use

70
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.080 
so cooking pasting is
normally hedley discouraged

71
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.510 
but as well
but you know

72
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.910 
and now we need to we
need to for the correct

73
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.760 
constructions
so lower case

74
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.430 
and please do recall that the
court has a constructor already

75
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.720 
registers the object with the
model exactly so the model is

76
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.660 
fast here the car this past year
so that the can you use get

77
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.410 
registered with the model so that
should modest speed is sufficient

78
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.450 
so let's riots

79
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.720 
and there is nothing to
see it there's a counter

80
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.810 
onto with where the slow that's
normally in the beginning so

81
00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.830 
nodes and warm up well the
other things are missing

82
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.110 
yes your crash no and
in there must be

83
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.520 
let's try to try one so
within here at the number

84
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.590 
yeah let let's let's that
stretches to two species wrong

85
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:26.610 
and is color or what we see here
yeah still going up yes here

86
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.910 
we go on color or causes
where numbers are

87
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.230 
the numbers are gone let's
have a look in two

88
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.690 
to use yeah you see

89
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.690 
it's this line so when the crawl
method or when this is read

90
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.440 
from it does was
yeah methods

91
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.560 
he acted method has a quarter
background tended not only draws

92
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.610 
the number or the rectangular but
also the complete background

93
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.230 
all over and so yet first thing
that had this everything is

94
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.330 
painted great and then the
moving on after rectangle

95
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.940 
all the number although
call-ups rectangle storm

96
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.020 
on top of that and then everything
is kind of trade again and

97
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.960 
only the nothing sorites so so
how do we have that we remove

98
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.790 
that here but we will
need to have its own so

99
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.680 
we that's let's just see what
happens if removed everywhere

100
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.960 
and we have not probably
know back on the movement

101
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.290 
so that maybe i didn't
like that great

102
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.730 
you pick sometimes
ok what happens

103
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.840 
yeah i would like to know
all along with great

104
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.320 
for her paine's everything all
over again and that's a moving

105
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.990 
on this moving on and look it kind
of leaves a trail pheromone

106
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.980 
so i'm going to
stop you know

107
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.140 
yeah we need as a we need to
background that's what we want

108
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.530 
to show the and we needed
just once for every frame

109
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.670 
yeah so we do that in
the most clicked

110
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.680 
and of course that this
big project would be we

111
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.080 
in the in the key had this
so you have that so

112
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.860 
we can just quite background
because this is where we are

113
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.780 
ok now let's try it
again but we haven't

114
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.700 
all over each other
still but now

115
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.190 
yeah i mean that's that's problem
if you put everything in

116
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.770 
the same place that it's
a little each other but

117
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.090 
it is actually const
correctly so that is

118
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.040 
covered by first number was cover
and there's also the little

119
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.250 
rectangle moving the little moving
rectangle you see it doesn't

120
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.970 
leave trail anymore so basically
you're still trying to get

121
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.250 
into the and variety

1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.420 
Let's start with a short
view on the internet.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.080 
The internet - this global phenomenon
which interconnects all

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.620 
parts of the world. People in
all parts with internet of

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.950 
things also machines and
objects. How does it work?

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.990 
I already mentioned that the
internet is a network of networks.

6
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.850 
There are local networks in the
responsibility of a university,

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.200 
like the Hasso
Plattner Institute,

8
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.490 
a local network at your
home, a local network in

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.990 
an enterprise and all these
networks can be interconnected.

10
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.380 
They can be interconnected
by means of so called

11
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.510 
internet providers which
connect the local network

12
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.650 
to the internet. This is

13
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.390 
a local network, there are computers
and if the local network

14
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.340 
is connected to the
network of the provider,

15
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.890 
then the computers here can
interact, the people working

16
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.150 
on computers here can interact
with people anywhere

17
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.570 
else in the world working on
a computer in a network

18
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.480 
that is connected to the
internet. The connection

19
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.260 
to the internet can be by wires,
one can use telephone connection

20
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.240 
typical in such PCs
at home, there are

21
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.120 
computers and then a
modem is used which

22
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.680 
helps to connect this computers
via the telephone connection

23
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.770 
to an internet provider that
connects these home computers

24
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.300 
also to the rest of the internet.
These internet service

25
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.230 
providers are seen here with the
different local area networks

26
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.390 
that are connected to them. So the
different internet service

27
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.110 
providers help different owners
of such local networks

28
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.600 
to get interconnected,
there are stronger

29
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.340 
wires for higher
speed and higher

30
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.730 
bandwidth, this is
often called backbone

31
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.910 
thats the connection, the internet
connection between the different

32
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.300 
internet service providers
and to the local networks

33
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.680 
there are belonging several
computers that are

34
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.450 
connected for example by a
leased line or here also by a

35
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.190 
dial-up connection. If we look for
example to the infrastructure

36
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.020 
of Germany, then you
see the different

37
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.160 
internet providers that are
connected to each other

38
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.430 
and that have a huge
number of customers

39
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.260 
and if we look worldwide then
the internet as a network of

40
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.530 
networks, you can see here
in this illustration

41
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.010 
where we have
the different

42
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.930 
important places which
play a role

43
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.670 
for interconnecting the networks
on the different parts

44
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.000 
of the world. Now how
it works? When we send,

45
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.490 
for example, an email from one
computer in one network

46
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.490 
to another computer belonging
to another a computer

47
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.470 
at the end of the
world. The idea is

48
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.590 
that the internet because it doesn't
have an homogeneous structure

49
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.030 
the communication is
organised through different

50
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.080 
incompatible physical
networks which all

51
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.390 
have their own communication
protocols. The idea is

52
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.180 
that every computers that is
connected to the internet

53
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.410 
via such a local
network gets a

54
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.930 
local address in the network
and it needs an address

55
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.420 
in the internet. This is so
called IP protocol address.

56
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.840 
In the local networks the
computer has an address, so that

57
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.010 
inside the local network one
can send messages and receive

58
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.980 
message from them but when we
connect this different local

59
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.750 
networks, when we interconnect
them to the internet

60
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.800 
then on this interconnection
level a new address is needed.

61
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.530 
This is the so called IP address.
When a message is sent

62
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.060 
over the internet to a computer
connected to the internet

63
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.620 
then the message get the address
of exactly the IP address of

64
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.070 
computer. The network address
is far away not known.

65
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.050 
In detail this message is
sent in the following way -

66
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.090 
in a first step the
message is divided and

67
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.840 
packaged into so called
internet data packets

68
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.580 
and these packets are sent
independent from each other through

69
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.470 
the internet. So in this way if
we have a long message, like

70
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.900 
if you want to send a video
and this video is fragmented

71
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.340 
into different internet packages,
the packages they get

72
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.010 
an address, they get the
address of the receiver

73
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.790 
of this message and then
the packages are sent

74
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.560 
through the internet from the
local network of the sender

75
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.580 
over different intermediate
networks to the target system.

76
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.190 
This is not easy to organize and the
organization of this transport

77
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.240 
is realized by the
internet protocols.

78
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.600 
I remind you that the
transport goes to different

79
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.150 
local networks and
these local networks

80
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.720 
are independent from each other.
sometimes are they are not

81
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.700 
compatible to each other. The
packets, the internet packets

82
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.760 
needs to be wrapped
around by a

83
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.460 
network of
the local network

84
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.670 
has used as a payload in such
a network specific data pack

85
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.110 
and then it has to send
through the network up

86
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.360 
to the border to
a next network.

87
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.220 
Inside this local network only
the network specific addresses

88
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.650 
can be used, only the
network specific

89
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.750 
packet format can be used so
inside the network the internet

90
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.010 
is only inside the
payload of the packages

91
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.280 
and the organization. But when
the package reaches the border

92
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.170 
to another local network,
then the internet address

93
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.770 
comes into the
function.

94
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.190 
Because then the router, this is a
system that's placed in between

95
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:14.240 
the different networks,
receives this network package,

96
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.320 
then it looks to
the payload

97
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.250 
and the payload is the IP packet.
And from the IP packet there

98
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.280 
is of course the
important part,the IP address

99
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.700 
and then the router - these are
the intermediate systems -

100
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.860 
that analyze what is the
next step, what is the next

101
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.710 
neighbour network the package
has to send through.

102
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.950 
All this work is done by
the network operating

103
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.200 
system, the so called internet
protocol stack that is installed on

104
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.980 
each of the routers. At
the individual network interface

105
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.440 
the router first has to decide
to which of the connected networks

106
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.860 
the internet data
package has to be set

107
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.050 
and to reach its
destination.

108
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.440 
And accordingly then the format
of the network package

109
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.370 
must be converted into a
network package format

110
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.980 
that's valid in this
neighboring network.

111
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.690 
So the network package

112
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.760 
is analyzed, then the payload
is packed into a new

113
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:42.210 
network packet
which follows the format

114
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.050 
of the neighbouring
network

115
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.650 
and then this
packet is sent

116
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.330 
through the neighboured network
up to the moment it reaches the

117
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.160 
next boundary to a new
network, then a new router

118
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.450 
comes into place and does the

119
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:07.830 
same way to analyze and to make
decision how to continue

120
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.750 
to transport the internet
package. In this way you see

121
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.910 
this network of networks

122
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.340 
can be used to transport
internet packages

123
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.000 
from sender to receiver.

124
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.370 
It's quite complicated and
the internet protocols

125
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:35.140 
they organize this transport. Of
course the internet has a purpose

126
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.620 
to make network applications
available anywhere.

127
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.210 
And the popularity of
the internet of course

128
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.120 
comes from the popularity of the
network applications. Network

129
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.430 
applications like electronic post,
e-mail network applications

130
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:57.550 
like world wide web the WWW,
audio or video streaming are

131
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.800 
very popular internet
applications, peer to peer networks.

132
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.850 
There is a huge variety
of social media

133
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.550 
facebook, twitter, whatsapp,
openHPI, there is a huge cosmos

134
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.830 
of internet services
and applications

135
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.220 
that make it so popular on

136
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.720 
the internet. To offer
applications over the internet

137
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.000 
distinct communication protocols
must be integrated into the

138
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.040 
network operating system so
that each of the services

139
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.910 
can use the internet as
a transport media.

140
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.920 
If we look to the internet today
there are a few characteristic

141
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.370 
that make it clear
what a huge progress

142
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.800 
it provides. There is a faster
access to all kind of information

143
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.810 
from all areas, from all places in
the world and there are quite

144
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.200 
low communication costs. Internet
makes it possible to integrate

145
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.890 
very different media data
for example text, audio,

146
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.340 
video and use internet to
transport this media.

147
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.840 
There are a huge number of
innovative business applications,

148
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.860 
of new business models
making use of the internet.

149
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.180 
If you think of online banking,
if you think of all the

150
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.820 
services and all the
offers in e-commerce,

151
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.820 
e-government. The emerging
internet changes

152
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.300 
all parts of our life by
means of these applications

153
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.660 
but also by bringing the users
of the different places of the

154
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.280 
world much closer to each other.
An e-mail can be sent and

155
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.130 
received within a second and
reach another part of the

156
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.600 
world. So the internet has
changed how we communicate,

157
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.990 
how we process information
and how we perform

158
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:08.760 
business and this general change
often mentioned and often

159
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.540 
called as the digital
transformation.

160
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.670 
This is what characterizes
our time and work.

161
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.500 
What we also learn and see when we
use the internet, the national

162
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.800 
borders, all the different
cultures do not matter.

163
00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.270 
We can bridge them and this has
a lot of good aspects but

164
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.260 
there are also some

165
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.290 
difficulties. When we come to
the point of cybercrime,

166
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.120 
so we see all the national

167
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.200 
regulations are done on
the national level

168
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.820 
but the internet is a
global phenomenon

169
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.650 
and it can not be ruled with
national regulations.

170
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.000 
Also the number of people
that is using the internet

171
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:03.970 
is increasing in the
number and also in the

172
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:09.730 
variety of knowledge. So non technical
users can use the internet

173
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.320 
for example can
use worldwide

174
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.620 
web simply by clicking
on a link. So no

175
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.240 
complicated comments
need to be remembered.

176
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.790 
Slick and then this information
or the services start.

177
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.600 
One can use the internet
in a personal network.

178
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.920 
There are a huge number of public
access points in libraries,

179
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.430 
in cafes, in airports
and other places.

180
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.090 
So internet is everywhere, you
know this from your smartphone,

181
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.980 
from your radio, you
can see TVs,

182
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.730 
even household devices can be
controlled via the internet.

183
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.530 
Besides the internet intranet
play an important role.

184
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.300 
Intranets are very
similar to internet

185
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.690 
but the difference is that the
intranet is used inside a company,

186
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:11.450 
inside an organization.
There are borders

187
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.100 
which are controlled for the
information exchange with external

188
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:20.750 
world but they use for these
internal applications, they use the

189
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:25.150 
internet protocols. They use a
technique of internetworking.

190
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.710 
This usage of course for
individual for isolated

191
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.480 
company networks make
it possible that

192
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.380 
techniques attacking
internet technology

193
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.190 
also can be applied against such
intranets and inside of such intranets.

194
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:49.800 
We see a huge increase in the
popularity of mobile applications

195
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:55.090 
of the internet - a police
car, medical services,

196
00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:02.410 
the humans themselves all
are connected by means

197
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.910 
of the mobile internet

198
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.880 
by means of more and more
powerful smartphones

199
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.580 
that make it possible
to use computational

200
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:20.370 
processing power to use services
and which are forward.

201
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.120 
Of course there is a risk of loss
of confidential information

202
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:32.210 
because this internet is very
attractive for cybercriminals,

203
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.690 
it's very attractive for
hackers, it's very

204
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.390 
interesting for secret
service, for competitors

205
00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.830 
to get access to the
information, to get access

206
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.340 
to the computer station
inside local networks.

207
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.660 
So the huge advantage
of the internet also

208
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:57.630 
invites cybercriminals for
attacking and misusing

209
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.590 
this global network.

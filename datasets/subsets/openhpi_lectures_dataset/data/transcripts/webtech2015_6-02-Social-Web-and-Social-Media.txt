1
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.710 
Let's have a closer look to the social web and let's discuss

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.890 
social media.

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.380 
I already mentioned that the users perception

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.590 
and how people are using the world wide web.

5
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.860 
This has changed around two thousand five ten years ago.

6
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.520 
The participation principle becomes more and more important

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.660 
and it occurs what we today call web 2.0.

8
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.050 
Users became editors not only readers of static web pages, no

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.610 
they were able to design and create their own information to

10
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.610 
create their own pages and to add comments to other people's

11
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.680 
content. So users share their data resources,

12
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.910 
they use the web technology to share data resources data resources like bookmarks,

13
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.460 
like photos holiday, for photos family photos,

14
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.150 
to share professional information, to share videos and others.

15
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.500 
And by means of supports ability to add own to comment other

16
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.360 
people content a community feeling occurs.

17
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.360 
So the web became increasingly used as a communication platform.

18
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.630 
Not only as an information platform,

19
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.610 
it became increasingly used as a communication platform.

20
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.420 
And another important

21
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.920 
effect is that the boundary between a web application and the

22
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.580 
application running on a local PC that this applauding.

23
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.440 
This made it possible that

24
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.890 
a rich internet application could be developed and could be used

25
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.520 
we discussed this already in the last weeks and took as an

26
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.850 
example Google docs.

27
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.560 
Another example I want to mention here is gmail, gmail.

28
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.560 
Web services in the in the web instead of a local mail client.

29
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.180 
So this are forms of the development of the social web and there are different

30
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.070 
forms communication forms application forms.

31
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.410 
One are so called wikis.

32
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.730 
Wikis are an early form of social web applications

33
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.250 
and Wiki is Hawaiian and it is a word which says quick,

34
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.660 
quick interaction. And the idea of this Wikis is

35
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.190 
to realize an idea of collaborative text editing and commenting.

36
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.670 
So using such a Wiki a group of people is able to

37
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.990 
share their knowledge to contribute new logic,

38
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.400 
and to use the world wide web technology to this end.

39
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.180 
So first Wiki installations were already released very early

40
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.990 
in nineteen ninety five it was a Wiki Wiki web

41
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.730 
but the concept of Wikis became really famous

42
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.310 
when in two thousand and one so online and the globe the Wikipedia was launched

43
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.730 
and advance the popularity of the concept.

44
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.520 
Here many people contribute to design and a huge

45
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.220 
encyclopedia collecting all the knowledge about different topics,

46
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.330 
and it was very easy for everyone to contribute.

47
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.290 
This wiki concept with the Wikipedia became so popular that it was

48
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.670 
already shortly time after, listed among the top ten most popular websites.

49
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.450 
But Wiki not only became popular in the context of such an

50
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.820 
encyclopedia or other service, it became also very popular in the enterprise

51
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.520 
context because Wikipedia allowed to collect

52
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.780 
enterprise knowledge

53
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.640 
and to collected and to persisted.

54
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:41.430 
So also when we developed openHPI we used and organized communication in the group

55
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.300 
by means of such a Wiki so everyone contributed

56
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.410 
his observations his ideas, other people could comment

57
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.100 
this and in this way there was a possibility to make,

58
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.730 
to create a knowledge base which every developer could access and could

59
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.970 
contribute.

60
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.100 
Another a typical form of social web application also created web blogs

61
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.790 
or shortly blocks.

62
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.740 
Such blogs emerged in the end of the nineteenth and are a very

63
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.490 
important implementation of the social web.

64
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.940 
Typically such blogs are diaries are personal diaries or personal journals

65
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.430 
which were published

66
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.380 
over the world wide web.

67
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.210 
One or more authors are called bloggers,

68
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.950 
they contribute postings in a regular way.

69
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.460 
Such postings shortly posts are ideas or short

70
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.050 
text or image short information pieces of information

71
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.710 
about the daily life or about a special topic,

72
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.980 
new insight or other.

73
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.090 
The interesting cases that the users a reader of blogs are not

74
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.940 
only able passively to read these posts but no they can actively participate

75
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.810 
by adding feedback by commenting some posed by adding own experience

76
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.440 
by giving some ratings or others.

77
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.650 
If an user starts to be interested in such a block

78
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.790 
there is a possibility two to subscribe to such a block by

79
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.960 
means of so called feeds for example provided by RSS or Atom.

80
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.910 
Technically such blocks are realized either

81
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.890 
on block hosting services for example on Blogger on Tumblr

82
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.930 
or one can also host a blog block on their own server and for this

83
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.600 
most famous software is Wordpress.

84
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.940 
A very special form of this blocking is Microblogging.

85
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.430 
Microblogging also very popular was introduced for very short status,

86
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.750 
updates for causal personal or cooperate status updates and characteristic is that

87
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.470 
the posts are not allowed to be long. They could have maximally

88
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.880 
a size of two hundred characters.

89
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.480 
Such posts can be created publicly or privately by means of

90
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.900 
the browser by means of an APP on a smartphone by means of email

91
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.820 
or instant messages.

92
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.890 
A special concept developed in the context of Microblogs

93
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.270 
are the concept of a synchronous followers.

94
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:57.050 
And the idea behind is that a follower a subscriber of such microblog

95
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.990 
receive a status update of the microblog,

96
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.610 
they are following but not vice versa. There is a blogger does

97
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:12.540 
not informed whether it's micro or its post was

98
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.490 
read honored. You all know Twitter

99
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.940 
is the most currently at least the most popular microblogging services.

100
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.270 
Twitter started in two thousand and six

101
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.730 
and meanwhile it's considered an important media channel for

102
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.360 
public persons for political activists and others.

103
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.050 
To indentify twenty topics in the social web

104
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.850 
see hashtags are used.

105
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:51.260 
Now let's come to social networks or social networking services.

106
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:59.900 
Social networks are of course the main characteristic the most important most popular

107
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.050 
application in the social web.

108
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.480 
They have established together with microblog and of course you know Facebook

109
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.140 
perhaps most famous one LinkIN in a google blog

110
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.640 
is this social the idea of social networks is that they combine

111
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:25.270 
the blogging or micro-blogging functionality together with an additional list

112
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.300 
of common features. For example,

113
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.860 
it is possible to publish in such a social network a personal profile,

114
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.680 
which is the information a person wants to give others to make

115
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.340 
it more easy to get in touch with each other.

116
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:49.780 
It is possible and very constitutive that one can give a list of friends,

117
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.590 
in contrast to the followers concept where the follower is

118
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.080 
informed if something is done, is published by the

119
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.490 
by the blocker, here in the

120
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:10.280 
social network friends list feature there is a bi-directional

121
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:16.030 
relationship, there is a bi-directional communication supported

122
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.740 
between all the friends on such a friends list.

123
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.320 
So in this way the communication with people also

124
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.050 
participants of a social network becomes supported

125
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.610 
very much. Another additional feature of a social network

126
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.660 
also called activity streams.

127
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.450 
Here is a it combined the status updates of a user's

128
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.080 
friends and allows commenting.

129
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.560 
There are more features characterizing such nodes or networks,

130
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.370 
there is private messaging possible with other users of the

131
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.470 
social network or with user groups.

132
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.080 
it's possible to express personal interest,

133
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.240 
for example with the like button

134
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.230 
that one can in a very simple way to say oh that's interest me.

135
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.150 
There are other social applications available on

136
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.410 
social network for example games.

137
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:26.140 
So in this way the social networks became a platform for own applications.

138
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.120 
Formerly the web was a platform to give information,

139
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.570 
here now by means of these new developments of social web applications

140
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.920 
the web becomes a social network it becomes a platform for

141
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.560 
application and communication.

142
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.410 
When we speak about social networks and the social web we have to

143
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.480 
consider also social media

144
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.840 
and the characteristic is here that the dropping prices for

145
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.140 
storage and for high speed bandwith, various social media portals have been introduced

146
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.140 
during the last years.

147
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.480 
For users that social media of our possibility a very simple

148
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.140 
and effective and cheap possibility to share their media resources;

149
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.440 
like images, photos, family holiday photos,

150
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.570 
popular songs, audios, or videos with friends, with a group of

151
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.040 
friends, with a family, or with the whole public.

152
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.940 
Interestingly compared to traditional media is that orders can get feedback.

153
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.480 
Can get feedback to their texts to their images to their videos

154
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:56.290 
and orders can store media for inclusion in their own personal website

155
00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.060 
and storage issues that do not play any role.

156
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:08.780 
So today the most popular social services are if you consider

157
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.010 
images, photos, then it's Instagram it's Flickr

158
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.650 
that provide the possibility to

159
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:26.360 
share such things. If we consider too the audio then SoundCloud

160
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.910 
provides the possibility for sharing audio resources and when

161
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.560 
we speak about video data then Youtube Vimeo

162
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.950 
very famous social media services that allow to share

163
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.250 
videos.

164
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.760 
When we speak about social map I mentioned some applications

165
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:56.530 
then there are much more applications. So this illustration shows

166
00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.580 
a lot of this there are the different categories

167
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.190 
for example the blogs the comments the

168
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.480 
social networks as the social occupation

169
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:16.750 
voice. So you see here the many different areas and you see inside

170
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:23.770 
social media services that supports us. Social bookmarks here for example

171
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:31.280 
pictures life cars and there are many many services which easily can be used

172
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.010 
over the worldwide web and you see

173
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.290 
I want to impress you only with the huge amount of such services

174
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.290 
that there is space also for new applications, there's space for new ideas

175
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.740 
and sometimes it's possible to make our business

176
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.870 
from this ideas to create new social services.

177
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.650 
But when we discuss about the

178
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.830 
big promises and the possibilities of

179
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.640 
social web and social media we have also

180
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.820 
to discuss some critical points. One of these critical points is privacy

181
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.230 
people in a social network tell a lot about themself.

182
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:24.620 
It starts with the personal profile, it is goes on with the discussion about

183
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.920 
political service about society service and a lot.

184
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:34.370 
So the social network provider has access to all this information

185
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.570 
and often the social networks provider

186
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.910 
claim to make extensive usage

187
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:50.830 
of this content and they claim extensive usage rights on this user contribution contact

188
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:56.690 
they explain you get the service for free and I earn the money with

189
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.890 
analyzing, selling your data. So personal information can be used

190
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:09.310 
for example for personalized advertisement. So the social network

191
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.250 
provider can make money with

192
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.220 
selling such personal data to

193
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.930 
interested advertising companies.

194
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:27.910 
One can discuss advantage that is it's important that each person that

195
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:34.120 
using the social web that giving in information

196
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.540 
needs to think what kind of information

197
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:43.680 
is published over the world wide web. Another important issue

198
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.070 
generally in the world wide web particularly in the social

199
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.350 
web and social media context is trustworthy.

200
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:56.470 
Everyone can publish content in the internet,

201
00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.570 
there is no instance that checks whether this information is

202
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.440 
correct or whether this information is incorrect.

203
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.070 
See for example edit wars on Wikipedia as such

204
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:15.040 
people can can establish fake accounts they can do this on

205
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.040 
the wrong name.

206
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.490 
Every time for every information that's published in the web

207
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:30.340 
one has to ask how trustworthy if is particularly if there are news information

208
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:37.820 
then all the rumour and other things can be published can be distributed

209
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:43.830 
about such social media channels and they can do this compared to

210
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:49.310 
old times now over the world wide web they can do this world wide,

211
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.230 
and then cause reliability that is another

212
00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:00.160 
point one has to discuss. You see many services

213
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.110 
in the world are blocked by governments

214
00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.830 
that afraid that certain information

215
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.220 
reaches the people and they want to influence they want to

216
00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.540 
censor this information they want to control what kind of information

217
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.540 
is published and not, so

218
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.290 
in a certain sense it is good and the web should be free.

219
00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.810 
When we think on the other way about for example child pornography

220
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:34.160 
then it makes sense to think whether restrict or whether

221
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:39.240 
some restriction should be established to certain kind of content. But

222
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:44.730 
you see it's a wide range of discussion one has to follow and all

223
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.570 
around the new possibilities which are provided by means of social media

224
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.650 
in a very cheap way to distribute information or

225
00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.530 
to share information with friends but also with the whole world.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.820 
I want to close our openHPI course on
Confidential Communication in the Internet

2
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.730 
with confidential emails
that can be sent

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.990 
by means of the GPG system.
GPG is a GNU privacy guard.

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.870 
It's a famous system which helps to
protect all the email communication.

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.440 
Protecting email communication is, as I
mentioned if you send an email without

6
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.850 
security measures taken, then
it's like an open postcard.

7
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.690 
Everyone who has access to the internet, who
has access to the intermediate systems there

8
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.970 
can access your email and since
it's not encrypted can read

9
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.810 
and can see and understand
the content of the email.

10
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.700 
So, if one wants to avoid this, then
one has to encrypt the email and

11
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
practically one needs a system which
supports this encryption and also

12
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.270 
supports digital signing of an email
and GPG provides such a system.

13
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.280 
It works only, of course, like all the
other encryption methods works only

14
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.720 
when both communication partners are
engaged, username, same system,

15
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
agree on the same
algorithms.

16
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.760 
So this GNU privacy is a popular
tool, this is the logo and it

17
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.640 
provides functionality for encryption and
digital signature, particularly for emails.

18
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.970 
It is freely available,
it's a software you can

19
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.450 
load and install on
your computer.

20
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.400 
It is a freely available variant
of the commercial PGP,

21
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.360 
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a
very famous system, originally

22
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.710 
it was also open, now it is continued
to developed for commercial use,

23
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.550 
you have to pay for it but
GPG can be used free.

24
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.980 
It relies on freely available
technologies, so all

25
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.770 
the cryptographic methods which are
implemented and offered by GPG

26
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.500 
are patent-free. The same is
true for crypto algorithms.

27
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.710 
Since, the GPG uses and implements
the open PGP standard,

28
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.110 
therefore it is compatible with PGP and
the certificate format which differs

29
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.820 
from the certificate, we discussed
about X.509 certificate

30
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.460 
is in this world of PGP

31
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.960 
variants, it is
compatible.

32
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.920 
So what are the functionalities which are
provided by GPG? GPG offers support

33
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.100 
in the execution of almost all
tasks related to securing

34
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.800 
your communication, to
incurring your documents.

35
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
So, it provides functionality to
encrypt documents or emails and to

36
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:49.705 
digitally sign these emails. To be
able to do this, several things

37
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.400 
need to be provided, for example, in
the beginning, keys are needed.

38
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:03.520 
So the key generation is
provided by GPG for

39
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.960 
the symmetric as well
as for the asymmetric

40
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.700 
cryptosystems. The key provisioning,
so storing the public key

41
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.580 
on the user system and making
it available to various other

42
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.510 
applications, for example, the email
application - this is provided

43
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.750 
by the GPG system. The key distribution
functionality is provided.

44
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.280 
So, the provision and the distribution
of public keys via a key server,

45
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.155 
so, that the other communication partners can access the public
key or the systems of the other partners can access. Then the

46
00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:50.350 
encryption of files, encryption of
emails, the signature, so, creation

47
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.980 
of digital signatures, for example,
for emails all these are

48
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.210 
functionalities provided
by GPG including

49
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.180 
the verification of signatures,
otherwise signatures

50
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.580 
make no sense if it's not
possible to verify if it's

51
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.290 
really coming from
the claimed sender.

52
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.210 
How to use the
GPG system?

53
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.100 
So GPG is available with different operating
systems, with Linux, with Windows

54
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.300 
with macOS, but

55
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.250 
to say honestly, it is
not easy to operate

56
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.450 
or not easy to operate
in its basic version.

57
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.870 
For that reason, there exist
GPG complete packages.

58
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.130 
These packages come with a graphic
interface and graphic interfaces

59
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
every time makes it easier for the user
to install a system and to manipulate

60
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.910 
things with the system. This
is what you use when you

61
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.900 
use a browser, you do
not have to give

62
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.470 
comments in letters, you only
have to move your mouse and to

63
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.710 
click on certain
places.

64
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.160 
There are various projects to
compile installation packages

65
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.450 
for this GPG
complete package

66
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.550 
with programs that make the
use of GPG much easier.

67
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.340 
So when you want to install
this on your computer,

68
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.530 
you should work with such
a complete package.

69
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.780 
The installation of such
a package consists

70
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.120 
of GNU privacy guard,

71
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.320 
an installation program and
certification manager is needed

72
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.310 
and plug-ins for email
programs and file manager.

73
00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:53.610 
If you want to access such
a complete package for

74
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.230 
a different operating system,
for Windows, for Apple's Mac

75
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.720 
and for cross-platforms,
here are some

76
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:10.720 
links to the GPG4win,
GPG Suite,

77
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.130 
and for cross-platform
for Mozilla Thunderbird

78
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.300 
plug-ins in Enigmail, you
can install an environment

79
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:28.260 
to secure your email communication,
to encrypt documents, but

80
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.490 
be aware the partners you
want to communicate with

81
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.630 
they need to be able to understand
this system and so they

82
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.260 
need to have it
also installed.

83
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:48.140 
If you look to GPG in practice, then
there is an announcement of openHPI

84
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.750 
workshop which was
titled, "Secure Email"

85
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.490 
"Sicher per Email kommunizieren-
Mitleser unerwunscht".

86
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.290 
This workshop was in German language, so
it was a two-week practical workshop

87
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.640 
which introduce you to all the
details that are necessary to

88
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.780 
to install and to work
with GPG in practice.

89
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.911 
The course contents of that Sicher
per Email kommunizieren are

90
00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:26.130 
Introduction of GPG and S/MIME,
Installation of GPG packages,

91
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.330 
Key generation and exchange,
Encryption and decryption of emails

92
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.720 
and the Use of Digital

93
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.390 
Signatures. This course
is available in

94
00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:45.130 
German language, here is the link
and it is open, all the material

95
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:52.130 
is open although the course is
already over, it has run in 2019,

96
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.860 
but all the material remains
open for self-paced study.

97
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.230 
So, you can follow all
the instruction to

98
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:08.590 
really get GPG installed on
your computer and this way

99
00:09:08.703 --> 00:09:15.850 
you are able to send and
receive confidential emails

100
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.790 
over the internet.

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.130 
In our openhpi course "A
Half Century of Internet"

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.790 
we now have a closer look
to local area networks.

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.790 
Local area networks are the most
popular type of computer network.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.920 
The term local comes from the fact
that local networks connect computer

5
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.530 
in close spatial proximity. So it's
about several hundred meters.

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.290 
So typically a campus or a building
that networks that covers

7
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.070 
a campus or building its a local
network, a local area network.

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.910 
So the infrastructure components, that's
the physical transmission media

9
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.980 
are shared in such a local area
network by many connected computers

10
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.970 
and this makes it very efficient
and economically considered

11
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.600 
this is a reason that such local
networks are so popular.

12
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.820 
The local area networks are most
common form of computer networks

13
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.210 
and they are usually private
networks. Private networks everyone

14
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.480 
can connect in his own responsibility,
the computer and the devices.

15
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.310 
Sso for example in your home
typically it's also a LAN that you

16
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.610 
create if you connect your devices
and printer and what you have

17
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.700 
to one network. What is the
principle of communication?

18
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.920 
The principle is
the broadcast

19
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.040 
that is the broadcast
principle. So a transmission

20
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.350 
sharing medium requires a lot of
coordination, administration

21
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.310 
and in case of local area networks
it's organised in a very simple way.

22
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.320 
The data, the data packets are sent, the
packets are sent to all other computers

23
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
that are connected to the
network. So local area networks

24
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.570 
typically are broadcast networks. So there is
no coordination no administration required.

25
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.130 
Package one sender wants to send to
a specific receiver is to send

26
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.450 
to all the connected computers in the
network and then each computer checks

27
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.970 
whether the package was
sent to him or not.

28
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.900 
This is done by means of an address.
So each computer in a network

29
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.810 
needs an address and
address is written

30
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.360 
in case of a data package, is sent,
is written in the address field.

31
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.120 
So the package has a header, in the header
there are the informations that are needed

32
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.880 
for the transmission. So it's
overhead and the message which

33
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.170 
want to be send, the data that want
to be sent they are in the body

34
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.550 
of the package.

35
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.880 
Now senders and package all
other computers in the network

36
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.070 
receives a package and then each computer
is smart device checks the address field

37
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.240 
of this package and
if the address

38
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.860 
in that field in the receiver field
is the same is not the same

39
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.870 
as address of the computer then
the package is simply discarded.

40
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.120 
And if the address agrees
with the own address

41
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.020 
then the package
will be processed.

42
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.260 
So here you see sender sends the
package all the connected a

43
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.500 
computer to receive it, the most
of some discard the package one

44
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.500 
as a receiver takes it.

45
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.540 
So let's have a closer look how
this addressing is organized.

46
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.180 
So an address is an assigned to
each computer. It needs to be

47
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.130 
a unique address inside
such networks.

48
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.090 
So that the computer

49
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.770 
the device it can be exactly
addressed by any kind of sender.

50
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.340 
The addresses, these are typically
company combinations of values

51
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.400 
in a very specific format. Format is changing
from network technology to network technology

52
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.760 
and this address uniquely
identify the computer

53
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.620 
or device in
the network.

54
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.820 
More carefully it's not
specifying as a computer,

55
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.120 
its specifying its
network interface.

56
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.780 
This distinction is important
since some computers

57
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.660 
have belonged to different networks
for example routers belong

58
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.490 
same time to different networks
and for that reason they have

59
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.460 
two different network interfaces
and for each network interface

60
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.870 
they need an own address. Here is
an example of a MAC address.

61
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.540 
So you see a special combination
of values it's very much

62
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:41.050 
specified and it can change from network
technology to network technology.

63
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.900 
This LAN local area
network interface

64
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.710 
that filters out all
the incoming data

65
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.920 
and it's done on the basis of the
recipient address. It checked

66
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.700 
is a recipient address the same
address as its own address

67
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.370 
and when it is agrees then the data
package are processed and otherwise

68
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:20.360 
it is discarded. So the data are transferred
to the LAN communication interfaces.

69
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.410 
The data I already mentioned it
are wrapped. So this our data

70
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.150 
to be sent, these
are the data

71
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.240 
to be sent to another computer
and this data are wrapped

72
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.850 
inside of a package and
here we have the header.

73
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.990 
And in the header there are all the
information collected that are necessary

74
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.180 
for the communication.

75
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.920 
When we consider addresses then we
see different types of address.

76
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.290 
Most common are the
individual addresses.

77
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.420 
This is the addresses for an individual
device in individual computer but

78
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:13.530 
we also see multicast addresses.
These are addresses for a group

79
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.520 
of selected computers. For
example in certain tasks they

80
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.100 
need to know exactly the same
information, so it makes sense

81
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.190 
to guarantee that they are
addressed by means that each of

82
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.280 
them addressed by this multicast address.
And then we have a broadcast address

83
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:37.000 
so that all the computers in a
LAN can be addressed. So this

84
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.080 
is important for example
in some technical cases.

85
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:49.600 
Let's have a closer look to the MAC addresses.
MAC means media access control addresses.

86
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.830 
These are of particular importance because
it is so called hardware address

87
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.910 
of the LAN communication
interface.

88
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.350 
It is important because later on
when we consider the internet

89
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.740 
the network of networks, we see that
the same cumputer in such LAN

90
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:17.070 
beside of this MAC address, he also needs
a second address, the internet address.

91
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.400 
But here we first concentrate
on the MAC address.

92
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:27.040 
The MAC address may only appear
once in a LAN, otherwise if

93
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.060 
a data package is sent it's not
clear to which of the computers

94
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.310 
with eventually the same
address it was addressed to.

95
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:44.340 
Now there are different ways to take care
about this unique for example manufacturers

96
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.890 
of such a local area
network interfaces

97
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:55.720 
clearly assign such MAC addresses worldwide
when they produce this network interfaces.

98
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.580 
There are other situations
where the MAC addressed can

99
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.120 
also be set up by the
network operator.

100
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.940 
The MAC address we already saw
it in the example is a twelve

101
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:16.370 
digit sequence consisting of the
numbers zero to nine and the

102
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.650 
letters A to F. So
here is an example.

103
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.770 
In the network in the
local area network

104
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:35.120 
each data package has to follow a
specific format. And this packet format

105
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.000 
changed from network technology
to network technology.

106
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.380 
Such a data package consists
of the package header

107
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:52.110 
and the user data or payload
that is intended to be sent

108
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.810 
and this typically is called
body of the packet.

109
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.980 
If we look to the header which is
important for the communication,

110
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:09.350 
then the sender address, the source and the
receiver, recipient address, the destination

111
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:18.190 
are stored in the header of each data packet as
well as some additionally unnecessary information

112
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:24.040 
for the correct transport. So in the
header, the overhead information

113
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.640 
for organization for organization
of the communication of transport

114
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.500 
through the internet, to
the local area network

115
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:39.060 
and the most important part of this overhead
are sender and recipient address.

116
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:46.800 
Package typically looks in that way - preamble,
destination address, source address,

117
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:54.250 
type, user data, and CRC for
checking the correctness

118
00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:01.020 
of this package. There can be
additional headers placed in front

119
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.030 
of the data packets
under different layers

120
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.960 
in the internet protocol stack. So
packet headers of the layers below

121
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:16.870 
then become part of the payload we
will understand if we look to the

122
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.510 
communication protocols stack
in the internet later on.

123
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.660 
Now let's ask how one can connect
to such an local area network

124
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.830 
and access to the local
area network is

125
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.740 
provided by the
network cards.

126
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.820 
So also called LAN interface card,
network adapter, network card here

127
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.660 
is something it's a
hardware in your computer

128
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.200 
in the smart devices. These
network cards are much smaller.

129
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.600 
So the LAN interface cards
is hardware for connecting

130
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:08.000 
a computer to the local area
network. So the interface cards

131
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.600 
are each designed for
each LAN technology.

132
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.590 
If you want to connect
your computer

133
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:22.270 
same time to different LAN technologies
then you need a different LAN

134
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.160 
interface cards.

135
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.810 
The functionality of such an
a network card it's like

136
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:36.760 
an input output device and it take
over details of the packet transfer

137
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:43.340 
without accessing the CPU. So
this enables the computer can

138
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:51.130 
process the data and communication is
organized without assessing and influencing

139
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:52.820 
the speed of the CPU.

140
00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:00.860 
The network cards are able to interpret
the received physical signals

141
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.460 
the light signals in a optical
cable, the electrical signals

142
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.330 
in the internet cable or the
radio signals in a wi-fi.

143
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.590 
This depends from the different
technologies it's used.

144
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.510 
And the network cards are that
devices that filter out

145
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.490 
irrelevant data packets. You remember
data packets are broadcast.

146
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.970 
So a computer gets many
data packets that is not

147
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:39.570 
yeah not a recipient. To filter out
this is a task of the network card.

148
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.950 
Local area networks are
several hundred meters.

149
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:51.320 
So they cannot simply go
longer be extended.

150
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.000 
The reason is that then the physical
signals. For example in the ethernet the

151
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.430 
most popular example of local
area network become weaker

152
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.750 
and weaker and in its end it's difficult
to interpret them in the right way.

153
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.840 
So we need special hardware and
special hardware components

154
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:20.670 
to extend the range of a LAN or to
couple different LANs to a network.

155
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.960 
Here is an example of an optical
modem. Optical modem means

156
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.590 
that a local area network
can be extended

157
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:36.100 
by enabling an
expansion of

158
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.760 
copper cable based LANs through
some fiber optical lines.

159
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:50.180 
For example between two places of
a company located in different

160
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.230 
places of a company that form all
together one local area network.

161
00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:02.920 
There are LAN repeaters to extend LANs
and the task of such a repeater is

162
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:09.650 
to amplify signals whether it's whether
electrical or optical signals.

163
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:15.270 
Then we have so called
Hubs for LAN extension.

164
00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:21.000 
The hubs enable a load to
couple different computers

165
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.690 
to couple different LANs segments, to
couple a computer to a LAN segment.

166
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:33.270 
So such type of device is needed
to link similar LAN technologies

167
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.230 
so that all incoming packets are
sent to all connected devices.

168
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:46.360 
Another device which is important
for LAN extension are bridges.

169
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.480 
Bridges are needed to extend and
coupling local area networks.

170
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:57.400 
So they provide a link between
even different LAN technologies.

171
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.490 
Then we have switches also to
couple computers, two computers

172
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.540 
with LANs and to couple
different LAN segments.

173
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.760 
So the destination is determined
for each incoming packet and

174
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.800 
then the packet is only sent to this
destination. So we have two LAN segments

175
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:24.440 
connected by a switch. Then the
broadcasting is restricted

176
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:30.210 
to each of the LAN segments.
And if the switch sees

177
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.890 
the package should be sent to
some computer in the neighbor

178
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:42.790 
LAN, in the connected LAN, then the switch
broadcasts this data to the second

179
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.010 
LAN segment.

180
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.940 
To finish we'll look to the
network technologies we have

181
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:57.680 
to understand that they are different
topologies, different ways

182
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.770 
to interconnect
the computers

183
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.520 
in such a local area network. So there
is for example the bus topology.

184
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:13.510 
Here all computers on the LAN are
arranged along a linear bus connection

185
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.700 
medium. So for example like
in the ethernet all the

186
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:24.310 
computers are connected to one cable
so broadcasting is a very simple

187
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.730 
computers and data package it's
a distributed and to all the

188
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.690 
other computers
along this cable.

189
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.490 
Of course only one
computer can send

190
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:43.050 
at any time because otherwise if two
computer same time send signals

191
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:50.150 
will disturb each other and
then it's no more possible

192
00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:56.020 
to correctly interpret the
information that was

193
00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:04.350 
sent in this package. There is a referee
mechanism needed to resolve such conflicts

194
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:11.360 
and we will speak when we speak about
ethernet we have a closer look

195
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:18.820 
to this technology . Today hardly any problem
occurr to the full duplex connections

196
00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.500 
which enables the collision free
transmission in both directions.

197
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.620 
So other technologies and
topologies are needed.

198
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:34.230 
Another typical network topology is a ring
topology. The computers are arranged

199
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:39.890 
as a ring in a closed loop and
transmission means one computer

200
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:44.960 
hands over the data package to his
successor, he gets a package

201
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:50.970 
from a predecessor and submit it to
the successor. So the data packets

202
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.890 
is sent, is forwarded in this ring
from one computer to another.

203
00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.960 
This cost more time than with
its broadcast mechanism

204
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:08.070 
but there are advantages and
disadvantages for use of topologies.

205
00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.760 
I have no time to go into details.
If you are interested in more then

206
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:19.240 
please look to wikipedia or
look to our internetworking

207
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.420 
to understand this. Lasttopology
I want to introduce a star

208
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:31.980 
topology. Here computers are arranged in
the star shape around a central hub.

209
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.770 
Here is a central hub. The hub
controls all the communications

210
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.080 
so each computer who wants
to send a message to

211
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.900 
another computer has
to go via this hub.

212
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.610 
This star topology is very
powerful but there is a

213
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.500 
single point of fehler this hub. So
there are different advantages,

214
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.120 
disadvantages for each of
said topologies typically

215
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.080 
today as modern networks have a
use of mix of such topologies

216
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.130 
but to give you a first insight
into the functionality of

217
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:13.740 
such local area network, it's
important also to consider such

218
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.320 
a topology question.

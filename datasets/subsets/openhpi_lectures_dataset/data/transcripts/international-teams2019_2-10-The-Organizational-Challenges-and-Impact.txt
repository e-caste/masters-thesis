00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.050 
So, Salim, we heard a lot
of interesting things,

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.870 
about the organization and all that
stuff of your remote teamwork.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.830 
Now, let's try to some to sum
up the challenges, and the

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.460 
impact, that moving
to remote teamwork

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.500 
will have for your
organization.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.370 
yes, I think it is a good
thing for all participants

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.970 
to see, the organization has
challenges and impacts, also, the

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.690 
remote workers have a lot of
challenge and impact, we will

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.430 
just summarize the main points
that we want to have.

10
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.120 
We need an agreement between
managers and employees

11
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.190 
and as I said before, the first
thing you need to consider

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.940 
is establishing trust, if
you don't trust each

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.070 
other, managers and employees
don't trust each other,

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.430 
let's close this, do not start this
program, because it won't work.

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.020 
You need to make sure that you
can measure results and that

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.950 
you can ask people to
achieve something doable.

17
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.550 
don't overload them and
also don't give them

18
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.190 
too much freedom there because
they will not achieve

19
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.300 
anything. It is necessary to
consider that the people

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.620 
need training, to keep training.
And also, need to consider

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.970 
each step will require improvements
but you start today, believe me,

22
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.810 
in six months, in one year, will
be by far different if you

23
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.950 
keep training and having
feedback from people.

24
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.120 
Infrastructure factor, if you do not
have the proper infrastructure

25
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.290 
in place, it will not work
either. You need to have

26
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.660 
all the time the IT people involved,
from the very first beginning

27
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.900 
of the project or involve that
people because you have

28
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.390 
what you always mentioned,
security and privacy even if you

29
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.210 
are using external tools, internal
tools are also very relevant

30
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210 
for them...... The worst thing
that happened, is that

31
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.530 
the remote teams
start to

32
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.000 
find the tools that they want
to use themselves. Outside of

33
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.950 
the organization? Outside of the organization,
it will be a real issue.... and you always

34
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.910 
need to keep control of
all of the access there.

35
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.250 
Software security, data sharing,
and collaboration are extremely

36
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.340 
important in the remote structure
you need collaboration,

37
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.890 
and don't forget, you need if you
are working remotely design

38
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.760 
your workspace remotely. So that
you if you're working at home

39
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.920 
you're outside of this all domestic
situations that normally

40
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.610 
happens in a normal home but just
make sure that you're designing

41
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.830 
this. Focus on results, instead of
processes. Allocation of responsibilities

42
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.640 
extremely important, who is doing
what? If you have a team out

43
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.270 
with ten people, who have done
what? I'm depending on the job

44
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.590 
someone else is doing. I'm performing
enough because I did what the

45
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.270 
other people are waiting for me.
Definitely, very important,

46
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.970 
The interaction in a distributed
team is very relevant

47
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.700 
if I don't know the
responsibilities that payroll is

48
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.480 
out there. Probably the marketing
is out there and I don't know

49
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.670 
who is doing what, I'm lost,
definitely in a normal organization

50
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.440 
It is easy because I go to the office,
sales marketing and I'm there.

51
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.720 
Make meet-ups and sprints
just regularly, let

52
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.140 
the team to find their own
rhythm but you need to define

53
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.100 
some minimum to be achieved by
people, you start meeting

54
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.450 
at least once a week,
if the people say

55
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.660 
OK, we need to meet more,
go ahead and meet more.

56
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.370 
The quality of communication
also is a gold rule. Face time

57
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.760 
is definitely necessary, probably,
you will know drive in

58
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.590 
a remote structure which is
permanently outside there but you

59
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.240 
probably meet people once a
while. It is very important

60
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.900 
the relevance of ongoing feedback.
That you give feedback to

61
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.630 
the people, all of them
do not exclude anyone.

62
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.630 
All of them need the feedback and
ask for feedback from their

63
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.280 
side, it's important to
keep this on track.

64
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.390 
Informal communication
as you said before,

65
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.430 
let's try to prevent this
second thought about

66
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.740 
the organization.
Also, it is

67
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200 
very important, that you
communicate this program

68
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.220 
to all of them. Not just three
people who are working at home and

69
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.030 
the others don't
know about that

70
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.930 
particularly informal
communication, it's also

71
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.990 
a very important
thing that you have

72
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.780 
an office environment, coffee
breaks, people talking

73
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.620 
to each other a lot. This
is also a kind of office

74
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.550 
setting. Not necessarily the
optimal solution, if things

75
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.310 
get discussed in the coffee
break and not everybody

76
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.770 
on track. Correct.
But like these,

77
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.160 
the out of work, next
to work discussions.

78
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.480 
These are really getting
lost in a remote setting.

79
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.510 
Keep anyway talking about your
private life when you're

80
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.460 
with your peers remotely but
it just to prevent, we have

81
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.720 
the second channel of
communication because it will be

82
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.280 
hurting the company. Take care
of respect and boundaries

83
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.000 
because people are working there,
they don't need to work necessarily

84
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.310 
twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
hours a day. No.

85
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.010 
There are some boundaries that
you need to respect and also

86
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.900 
they respect you.

87
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.970 
This is very important.

88
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.180 
the dynamic of the new routine
there is a new routine in this

89
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.540 
model, there are definitely times,
locations, all the things change.

90
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.820 
Keep your mind,
things keep moving.

91
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.890 
Manage the time effectively
because you don't need

92
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.860 
to go forty-five minutes to
the office, another one an

93
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.220 
half hours, as we say before,
what are you doing with it

94
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.550 
with the time, are you using it
effectively? or just no time to?

95
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.400 
I don't need it anymore.....
You also should define

96
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.400 
who's time is this actually,
is it the company's

97
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.970 
time? the organization
time? Depending

98
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.550 
on how you had organised it
before. Exactly, and the

99
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.060 
self-management is
really relevant.

100
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.560 
you need a check-in?, check out?,
why? No, you're working because

101
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.000 
we want to achieve some targets
and you define your own

102
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.950 
time. Coordinated with all your
peers, doesn't make sense

103
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.590 
that you start working at
six but your peers are

104
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.530 
working at eight and you
cannot work together. Just

105
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.270 
you need to coordinate this. This
a new culture, definitely,

106
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.740 
it is not necessary, it doesn't
need to be permanently

107
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.600 
remote work, probably twice, three
times a week, you work remotely

108
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.420 
and the other to work at home,
sorry, work at the office

109
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.290 
but this is a culture and each
individual needs his own

110
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.110 
motivation in order to achieve
that. There are some constraints,

111
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.540 
and some problems? Talk about
them, from the very first

112
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.230 
begin, address all these issues.
You need to make sure that

113
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.850 
you're not ignoring
people. Even the most

114
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.920 
insignificant work that it
can be done in one hour,

115
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.380 
doesn't matter you need to be controlling this,
you need to be having a feedback on that.

116
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.590 
We have a new digital
speed, a new digital

117
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.430 
era. We have PCs, mobiles, everything
is working by far faster

118
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.620 
than before. Get closer to the
employees, get closer and talk

119
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.020 
to them. Use this and prevent the
digital isolation and the passive

120
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.090 
peers. The passive peers, reduce
the performance of the whole

121
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.810 
chain. This is very important if
you see something is sleeping

122
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.200 
out there, Come on
my friend here

123
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.440 
and let's talk about what is going
on. This is very important.

124
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.220 
Make sure that this is a working
lifestyle and therefore

125
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.120 
people working together, people
working in groups, they may have

126
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.990 
discussions, they may have
problems, keep this on a ongoing

127
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.240 
feedback process. It is
definitely extremely relevant.

128
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.310 
the people need to understand they
are working for an organization

129
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.470 
and the organization is
considering their private life,

130
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.800 
this is also very relevant to
control two to consider.

131
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.170 
and i'm sure this is now,
the end of our week.

132
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.870 
People out there may have some
experience in teamwork culture

133
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
probably can contribute and
join the discussion for

134
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.290 
more thank you Salim.
Thank you Tom.

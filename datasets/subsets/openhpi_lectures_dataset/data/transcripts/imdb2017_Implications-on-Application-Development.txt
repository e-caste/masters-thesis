00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.700 
Another supporting

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.120 
reason that speed is an
essential prerequisite for

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.160 
other things to come,
speed and parallelism.

4
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.200 
Our brain works because we are
relatively fast and massively

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.240 
parallel, relatively
fast, massively parallel.

6
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.280 
My last comment with
regards to speed is:

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.310 
why is speed an absolute
prerequisite for

8
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.380 
for future enterprise applications?
- Enterprise applications

9
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.410 
moved in the last ten
years from desktops

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.490 
to laptops, to phones, to
large portable devices like

11
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.000 
the iPad types tablet PCs.
When you are on the phone, you

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.630 
work on the phone, a device like
this, if the response time is

13
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.680 
beyond three seconds you click
it away and start reading emails

14
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.720 
sending text messages
again you do something else

15
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.780 
actually there is, a
pretty good approximation

16
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.820 
is, if you do something
into actively multi-step

17
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.860 
interaction the response time has
to be below one second otherwise

18
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
it bothers you it
is a single question

19
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.940 
but you have then another
question after that

20
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.970 
it should be at least
under three seconds

21
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.101 
so this is, google response time
has to be under three seconds,

22
00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:47.107 
if you really need something
the maximum attention span of

23
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.110 
our brain is 8 seconds
after that we wander away.

24
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.114 
We cannot concentrate
longer waiting for something

25
00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:58.118 
so we can test this, the
psychologists can test this,

26
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.121 
people talking to each
other when somebody is

27
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.125 
asking a question the other one is
not answering within eight seconds

28
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.127 
we assume that the other
person is not there anymore.

29
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.136 
That means with these with these
numbers we have to build systems

30
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:20.140 
so if you want to build an interaction
and a multi step interaction

31
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.143 
and the individual
step is longer than

32
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:28.148 
one second, is beyond three
seconds, we really killed the user.

33
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.156 
There is no excuse , I saw in
development, some prototypes

34
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:40.160 
in SAP they change some UI
things and came up with response

35
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.164 
times around five seconds, and I
said this is totally unacceptable

36
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.167 
do you understand that and
then I got all the reasons

37
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:51.171 
we have to load something and
something is in the library and

38
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.174 
the library is not split up
and whatever reasons it doesn't

39
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:57.177 
matter: users will
never accept any more

40
00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:03.183 
response times of that nature,
because since we have google

41
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:07.187 
it started with yahoo since
we have google since we have

42
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:12.192 
other online services we know
that this is achievable, a human

43
00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:17.197 
response time, we know that
people get tired when the response

44
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:21.201 
time is between one and three
seconds, if it's over three seconds

45
00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:25.205 
they complain and stop working,
and we have systems like that.

46
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.209 
We have to change them, we have
to program them differently

47
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.214 
we have to think about, we can
not put the pressure on people

48
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.217 
to suffer using systems,
if they are too slow.

49
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:45.225 
That means as a general rule
even long lasting batch programs

50
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:52.232 
which take today hours,
should run under eight seconds

51
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:57.237 
if we want to use them as
transactions and use everything as

52
00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.240 
a transaction and get rid
of all the batch programs.

53
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:06.246 
Once, when i started SAP, my
biggest goal, I didn't achieve it

54
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:12.252 
actually with the growing size
of companies using our software

55
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:17.257 
the response times started
to degregate again and the

56
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:20.260 
batch programs run longer
and longer and longer again.

57
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:27.267 
Good news is that
for example the

58
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.000 
alocation of new funds in
the bank coming in, they get

59
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.274 
round about two hundred
million a day they have to

60
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:41.281 
put to work from their customers,
the program they use currently

61
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:47.287 
runs eight hours, so
probably to five o clock they

62
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.290 
take new orders and then they
need basically the whole night

63
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:56.296 
to allocate
the new money

64
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.299 
to existing funds to tell the
customer next day what they

65
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:05.305 
have done with the
money. This program

66
00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:09.309 
was changed to run,
do you know it?

67
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.311 
- sub 10 seconds.

68
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.319 
This means, or probably thirty
seconds, I don't know exactly

69
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.323 
anymore, might mix it up.
Definitely sensationally fast

70
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.327 
so it is close to be by my
definition, a transaction.

71
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.330 
Now they can run this
several times a day

72
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.335 
basically the customer
can wait. The customer

73
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:39.339 
says i want to put
500,000 to work

74
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.343 
what can you do for
me, what is the best?

75
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:48.348 
They can answer this
online instantly and do it

76
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:55.355 
now it's done - huge difference,
they gain basically a day.

77
00:05:56.356 --> 00:06:02.362 
A day in interest,
so wherever we look

78
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:10.370 
it is the speed a prerequisite
for a relevant change in the

79
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.375 
business then the other big
one was the simplification.

80
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:22.382 
The simplification, I hope this
is understood now, that just

81
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.385 
to record transactions
and the rest is

82
00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.388 
programming algorithms
to deal with the

83
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.392 
transactional data and
produce a meaningful result

84
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:37.397 
is completely different than
pre building in a transactional

85
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:41.401 
mode, pre building aggregations
and then be forced to report

86
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.403 
against these aggregations
for performance.

87
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:50.410 
So it is conceptually
a huge step forward

88
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:58.418 
and the next
consequence from speed

89
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.424 
and with the help of caching
that we can seriously now

90
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:10.430 
look into multi-step
transactions which

91
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.434 
lead to simulation,
we can tell the system

92
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:19.439 
to do multiple iterations
and then we look at

93
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:25.445 
the result sets
to pick one of the

94
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.447 
combinations which
is probably better.

95
00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:32.452 
You might know that i'm a sailing
a lot and I build a lot of

96
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.455 
race boats in my
life and every

97
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.457 
decent race boat which
is building being built

98
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:44.464 
is a combination of a computer
simulation and tank testing.

99
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:50.470 
And they calculate
on the computer

100
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.474 
at least ten different boat
shapes slight variations of the

101
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:58.478 
boat shapes go through all the
different conditions, sailing

102
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:04.484 
conditions and calculate
what the different

103
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:10.490 
performance factors will be
and then you can select which

104
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.492 
bold will be under which
additions the optimum boat.

105
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:17.497 
Strong wind, flat water, strong
wind, high waves, light wind

106
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:21.501 
high waves light wind,  flat water,
ok all these different sailing

107
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:25.505 
conditions you can simulate and
then you can do tank testing

108
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:32.512 
and in the end the performance
prediction of race boat is within

109
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:36.516 
one percent of the
true boat measured.

110
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.520 
Except the last america's
cup was an exception

111
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:45.525 
of team Oracle improved by
forty percent during this years

112
00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.529 
which is unheard of, this
has never happened before

113
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.534 
and has to do with something
we leave the mathematics we

114
00:08:54.534 --> 00:09:00.540 
have for sailing with a
foiling boat, plaining we

115
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.544 
know now enough about, foiling
is completely different

116
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:08.548 
it is like flying in the water
and the mathematics for that

117
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.551 
are completely different
than floating or even

118
00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:19.559 
plaining. So simulation, we have not
achieved, we, SAP has not achieved

119
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.562 
any significant simulation
in the last forty years.

120
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.567 
APO probably the
best the closest

121
00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:33.573 
this is "advanced
production optimization"

122
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:38.578 
it's an optimization
it's not a real

123
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:43.583 
multi variable simulation.
Now with the speed

124
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:48.588 
we can do this and we
will do this is not yet

125
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:52.592 
done in manufacturing, it
will have huge impacts.

126
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:59.599 
I give you just one
last, just how huge

127
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:04.604 
the business relevance
is of speed there is

128
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:10.610 
a chinese bottled water
manufacturer and distributor,

129
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:16.616 
large company shipping water
across the whole of china. China

130
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:22.622 
is pretty big, as big as europe,
a lot of desert, there's a lot of

131
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.625 
transportation problems
different weather systems

132
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:31.631 
in different parts of the
country. The shipment planning

133
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:37.637 
the distribution planning ran  I
think something around 12 hours

134
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.640 
the program was programmed
by the son of the owner of

135
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.646 
the company and the team actually
the program was very good.

136
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:51.651 
With a little rewrite of the
program the whole scheduling

137
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:57.657 
could be brought down to three
seconds. Same logic, same data

138
00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:01.661 
same - just completely
in memory and using

139
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:05.665 
different operators this is the
difference, the different operators

140
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:11.671 
what does that mean? The company
is permanently rescheduling

141
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:16.676 
the slightest information
on the weather channel

142
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:22.682 
or a delayed transportation
railway or a blockage of a highway

143
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:26.686 
and they reroute, they calculate
the transportation again

144
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:32.692 
that means from the source where
they bottle the water to the customer

145
00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:37.697 
till they get the money they can
completely optimize the logistics.

146
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:42.702 
Huge difference changes the
company actually it changes the

147
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:47.707 
company so much that they report
that they have five percent

148
00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:51.711 
five absolute percent
gain in profit.

149
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.716 
I am not allowed to tell you
the profit but they have five

150
00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:02.722 
percent absolute gain in profit.
Huge, unheard of, I've never

151
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.725 
seen this in my whole life
that somebody can improve

152
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:11.731 
that much through a single
program. This is what speed can do

153
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.736 
so it's the application,
the applied speed

154
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.740 
which is the
business advantage.

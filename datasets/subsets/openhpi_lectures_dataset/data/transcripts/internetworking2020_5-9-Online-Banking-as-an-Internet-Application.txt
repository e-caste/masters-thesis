00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.300 
Let's have a closer look to the
internet application online banking

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.750 
in our openHPI course - A
half Century of Internet

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.350 
What is online banking?

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.100 
Online banking refers to the
processing of banking transactions

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.210 
with the help of computers, with the
help of devices like smartphones

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.380 
or other electronic
devices

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.230 
So, traditionally you have to go
to a bank house, you have to

8
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.260 
fill in a formula and then the
people from the bank organize

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.370 
the transaction of the money. Today,
with online banking you can do it

10
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.780 
by your own. So, almost all the banks created
applications, internet applications

11
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.540 
that user can access via their
clients; so, around 50%

12
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.280 
of all bank customers meanwhile
are using online banking

13
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.830 
it's big start was in
the beginning of 2019

14
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.440 
before many people were afraid
that something is not working

15
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.330 
but it is convenient that meanwhile
many many people use online banking

16
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.770 
without visiting
the bank accounts

17
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.240 
and to a bank a house

18
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.010 
but banking is more problematic
than, for example, World Wide Web

19
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.770 
to access an online learning video
because online banking needs security

20
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.380 
that needs high security because
you are transferring money,

21
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.690 
you are receiving money. What
are the security procedures?

22
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
in place for these
online banking

23
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.700 
I think you notice from your own
experience we have TAN and

24
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.870 
iTAN and these are typically paperless,
we have TAN generators which

25
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.540 
generate it, we have smsTAN,
we have photoTAN; to go

26
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.590 
a little bit into more detail
here is a table so TAN,

27
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.940 
iTAN list that is a paper list
with transaction numbers

28
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.120 
security is not very high
everyone who has access

29
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.050 
to this list can misuse; the smsTAN is a
TAN that is transferred individually

30
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.650 
to the phone for the transaction
via SMS. It's much better so

31
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:48.070 
the person that wants to
do a bank transaction

32
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.550 
he needs to be registered, the phone
number needs to be registered

33
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.260 
and then in the case the person
says we should do something

34
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.660 
the smsTAN is sent to
the smartphone of the

35
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.060 
person that wants to use a service
and then this person can use

36
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.830 
this communicated
number

37
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.030 
we have TAN generators, photoTANs
with even higher security here

38
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.210 
it is a TAN generator; TAN
is generated individually

39
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.510 
for a single transaction by means of
a special device and this photoTAN

40
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.720 
displays a graphic using
a smartphone or reader

41
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.010 
then 2019 in September there
was a new regulation

42
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.410 
the PSD2 - the Payment
Service Directive 2

43
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.040 
which has been in effect
since September 2019

44
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.690 
and the aim was to increase
the cost to consumers safety

45
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.200 
which are using online
banking applications

46
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.090 
so the idea behind is that for transactions,
transaction numbers and TANs

47
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.240 
must be generated
dynamically

48
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.070 
so the TAN lists on
paper were forbidden

49
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:27.180 
so, PSD2 regulation says that TANs
need to be generated dynamically

50
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.060 
displayed on a smartphone or reader
so paper lists are no longer

51
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.010 
considered safe; the reason
is because storing

52
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.840 
in paper list or people that recognize
this is a letter from the bank

53
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.930 
as highly probable that it's a TAN list
they take it out of the post box

54
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.100 
and misuse it this was
no longer possible

55
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.190 
to attack a dynamically
generated TAN

56
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.270 
it's much more work and much more
complicated for the attackers

57
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.590 
because they need
to have as well

58
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.450 
a connection to the person
and to the computer

59
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.370 
where someone is using an
internet application

60
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.540 
and is performing some online
banking transfer as well

61
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.520 
he or she needs control
of the device where the

62
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.560 
TANs are transmitted to and they need
this access during the process

63
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.560 
uh uh uh tons are transmitted too and they
need this access during the process

64
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.470 
of online banking. So, the reason for the
change is that nowadays attacks are

65
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.890 
rarely directed against the
bank branches, they are

66
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.960 
directed against
the user

67
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.230 
the user which are doing online
banking, which are shopping

68
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.920 
often with computer devices
that are not well secured

69
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.190 
with wrong
configurations

70
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.670 
with malware in the background so
for the attackers much more easy

71
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:19.390 
to try to get access to the money in the
case of the online banking services

72
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.030 
attacking the user then
attacking the bank

73
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.000 
so attacker against the users are
increasingly successful when

74
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.890 
we spoke about e-mails, we already
spoke about phishing e-mails

75
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.110 
phishing e-mails are very popular
in the field of online banking

76
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.240 
so the attacker
sends an e-mail

77
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.800 
a falsified e-mail that
looks very similar

78
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:56.130 
almost identical like the e-mail a
person gets from the bank house

79
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.430 
and then they are asked to
give their TAN or give their

80
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.670 
account number we have to do
some technical service on it

81
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.760 
and when the recipient of such
phishing e-mails are not aware that

82
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.550 
it is a falsified manipulated
mail from a cyber

83
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.080 
criminal then and they give
their sensible data

84
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.530 
to the attacker and the attacker,
later on, can misuse sensible data

85
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.920 
another

86
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.070 
commonly

87
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.990 
attack is to intercept
of TAN list sent

88
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.990 
attack is to intercept
of tunnel is a sand

89
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.370 
by post but this meanwhile
is closed. New regulations

90
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.300 
make online banking more secure
definitely and what's behind is

91
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.510 
something like what is called a
"Two-Factor Authentication"

92
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.790 
and two-factor authentication is
during the process of making

93
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.380 
online with one device

94
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.780 
TAN is dynamically created exactly
for this online transaction

95
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.350 
for the planned online transaction
which is sent on a second channel

96
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.620 
to the user and then the
user can take this TAN

97
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.570 
which is needed otherwise he
cannot complete the transaction

98
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:26.620 
he can use this TAN as a second
factor for proving that

99
00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.900 
he is really the one who wants
to do this transaction

100
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.990 
Multi-factor (two-factor) because
knowledge, ownership, inheritance

101
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.410 
these are typically
different factors

102
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.720 
and in such two-factor or multi-factor
authentication different

103
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.750 
factors are brought together, for
example, the knowledge is a

104
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.580 
knowledge of a password or
some secret ID number or PIN

105
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:02.710 
the ownership is the PIN or
TAN arrives in that moment

106
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:09.930 
the user is doing some online banking
activity on his or her phone

107
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.090 
so because the
bank knows

108
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.730 
the user is the owner of that
phone through the ownership and

109
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:21.480 
what's possible to use as a
third factor is inherence

110
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.070 
for example, the fingerprint,
face, or voice recognition

111
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:33.900 
and combining such different
factors makes authentication

112
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:41.270 
much better and increases as
the security of the payment

113
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.070 
payment activity

114
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.180 
If we look to traditional versus
modern online payment systems

115
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:57.610 
then the traditional payment
methods since our prepayment

116
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.990 
is our direct debit these
are cash on delivery

117
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.760 
the disadvantages here are its
increased efforts for the buyers

118
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.890 
sensitive data has to be disclosed
again and again if you're

119
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.130 
showing your credit card, all
the data on your credit card

120
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.160 
come into the hand of the seller,
so that's our real disadvantages

121
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.730 
and with the new possibilities, internet
is providing, one tries to overcome

122
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.880 
this and provide new
methods which are more

123
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:42.060 
convenient, are more secure, have less
disadvantages. What are modern payment methods?

124
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.880 
These are online payment via
external service providers

125
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.580 
for example, PayPal or
Apple pay or Ali Pay

126
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.260 
and the advantage here is the external
service provider is specialized

127
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.250 
exactly on such online
financial transaction

128
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:06.210 
so sensitive data only has to be
disclosed once only this providers

129
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:11.050 
is external service provider needs to
know your bank account number and

130
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.650 
your credit card or what's what
kind of information, your name

131
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:22.290 
and address. The
seller trusts

132
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.120 
online payment service,
so the seller

133
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.200 
will not get access to this
sensitive data and then of course

134
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.490 
it's fast and easy to pay if you
remember the times where a bank

135
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:42.210 
transfer needs days; today's here with this
online systems transfer needs seconds

136
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.080 
Let's have a closer look at two of
such modern online payment systems

137
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:54.140 
Let's start with PayPal.
PayPal was founded in 1998

138
00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:00.790 
and initially, it was mainly used
as the payment methods on eBay

139
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.410 
on the eBay
auction platform

140
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.810 
the idea behind is the virtual
account and the virtual

141
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:13.100 
account is linked to the current
account so it's an "interim account"

142
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.870 
and when registering
with PayPal

143
00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:23.090 
and not with your account number but with
your e-mail address and your password

144
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:29.940 
and then money transfer is possible
without knowledge of the

145
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:35.510 
account details. If payment is
made with a virtual account the

146
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:41.200 
amount will later on be debited
from the current account and

147
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:47.890 
what's important advantage here is
PayPal transfers are credited

148
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.760 
to the recipients immediately
without the usual bank processing

149
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.760 
time for a normal transfer so
that user immediately get paid

150
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:03.600 
and it became popular and
famous in the context of eBay

151
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.030 
meanwhile, it's really very popular
already used mainly by younger people

152
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.320 
in a very different
context

153
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:19.740 
The owner of Apple products, they
can use the Apple Pay service

154
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:26.900 
it is a payment system designed by Apple
and the idea is to use Apple devices

155
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:33.940 
to pay for such a payment
process. It was introduced in

156
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.190 
2014 in the USA; here
in Germany it was

157
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.940 
introduced in 2018

158
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:50.180 
the functionality of Apple Pay is that an
Apple account is linked to credit card

159
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.070 
and to the Apple device
and each Apple Pay

160
00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:02.060 
compatible device contains
a unique device number

161
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.640 
and this unique device number is
sent to the seller when paying

162
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:11.870 
and using the device numbers
seller can claim the amount to

163
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:18.180 
be paid from the bank, so, here the
bank account data are not revealed

164
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.420 
the only thing what's
revealed is the

165
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.690 
unique number of the device
that used for this

166
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.560 
for this payment. An advantage is
buyer does not have to reveal

167
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:37.830 
credit card details to the seller,
all is done on the bases of this

168
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.090 
Apple account. Something very
similar is provided by Google,

169
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:48.880 
it's called Google Pay. it works in an
equivalent way and requires a device

170
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:57.730 
with an NFC chip (Near Field
Communication chip) so for both

171
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:03.470 
big groups of mobile devices for the
Apple devices, for the Android devices

172
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:10.250 
and for smartphones, from
which are using with the NFC

173
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.920 
chip, payment in this
way is possible

174
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:22.270 
Speaking about online payment, Crypto
Currencies are in every mouth

175
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.010 
so, Digital Payment System
- Digital Currency

176
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.960 
became very popular,
speaking about Bitcoin

177
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:41.230 
so each digital currency defines its own
decentralized and cryptographically secure network

178
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:48.440 
the characteristic of such digital currencies
is that there are no banks involved

179
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.940 
the users themselves provide a
network and over this network

180
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.750 
one can send money amounts, one
can receive many money but

181
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:04.720 
the money amounts
are provided

182
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.850 
in a digital currency

183
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:12.110 
so the payments are made directly
between the users and there

184
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.980 
is no bank involved with all the
other mentioned systems there

185
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.770 
was a bank involved, here, with
the digital currencies there is

186
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:27.590 
no bank involved, so of course, it's
needed an increased security mechanisms

187
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:33.890 
so, all transactions in such
a currency network are

188
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:38.020 
redundant and need to
be stored in a chain

189
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.880 
so that all those sequences cannot
be changed by anyone of the

190
00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:50.290 
members of the network and
it means Blockchain which

191
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.220 
at least the notion is very popular,
the technique behind is not

192
00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.590 
understood by all the people, so
the value of the cryptocurrency

193
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.640 
is determined among other things
by how many users are in the

194
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.220 
network if it's a large network
then the trust in this guarantee

195
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:15.200 
that the cryptocurrency
is increasing

196
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:22.460 
so if we look to the top 5 of the
cryptocurrencies by market capitalization

197
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:28.590 
it was the last numbers from
August this year so Bitcoin

198
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:34.740 
is the first with a market cap
of 226 billion US Dollar

199
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:41.000 
Ethereum at 48, there's a big
gap, 48 billion US Dollar

200
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.740 
XRP at 14 billion US Dollar,
Tether at 10 billion US Dollar

201
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.540 
Chainlink at 5.8 billion US Dollar,
so you see there is a lot of such

202
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.960 
cryptocurrency, lots of such networks
based on Blockchain technology

203
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.920 
Bitcoin definitely is
the most popular

204
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:09.180 
if you are interested to learn more about
Blockchain and the technique behind

205
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:17.790 
then you can see the openHPI course
- "Blockchain - Sicherheit auch

206
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.020 
ohne Trust Center" blockchain security
even without the trust center

207
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:28.110 
this course is provided in the
German language and tells you

208
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:34.890 
about all the techniques behind
such cryptocurrency systems

209
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.020 
it tells you all about Blockchain and
how Blockchain is technically realized

210
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:47.650 
by cryptographic methods. So, online banking is
really a very important internet application

211
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:55.280 
there is a large variety of different such
services meanwhile each banking house

212
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:01.930 
provides you several channels to do
your bank business but you can do

213
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:07.680 
such banking also without
any support of a bank

214
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.410 
then you have to use
such cryptocurrencies

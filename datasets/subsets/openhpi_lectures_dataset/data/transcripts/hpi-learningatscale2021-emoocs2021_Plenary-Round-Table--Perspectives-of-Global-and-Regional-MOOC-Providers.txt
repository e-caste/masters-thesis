00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.250 
hello everyone

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.310 
to welcome to these round table on perspectives of global and regional

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.110 
providers. I would gonna start the round table now.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.010 
let me start by presenting the international track that

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.800 
protests from class center myself the university of miuccia taryn.

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.630 
and this is the first event of this international track a EMOOCS

7
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.220 
and we'll have several marches tomorrow.

8
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.680 
In these round table

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.250 
we are trying to bring on the spotlight on diverse

10
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.590 
initiatives around the world we know that most of the press

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130 
on research has been focusing on a number of

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.850 
global mooc providers that have received more attention
than other more regional initiatives.

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.550 
so here we are trying to present a more diverse ecosystem where the

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.810 
that these regional initiatives are getting more importance.

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.340 
and we can see different approaches to these ecosystem.

16
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.720 
we will explore several aspects of these ecosystems such as

17
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.270 
completion of gaps that emerge due to human

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.870 
development index or and the influence of culture or language or

19
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.830 
how can we have courses that target more properly the needs

20
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.060 
of the students that are local to our region.

21
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.130 
I will now ask each one of the participants. we now have six great

22
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.810 
and diverse participants from all over the world.

23
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.560 
I am gonna  name each one of you.
And then I ask you to introduce yourself

24
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.210 
and your experience in online learning in

25
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.540 
less than a minute. so first Catherine Mongenet.

26
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.270 
yes, good morning everyone. so my name is Catherine Mongenet.

27
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.860 
I am ceo of france université numérique.

28
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.080 
france université numérique is the public french organization

29
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.480 
within charge of running the phone move platform,

30
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.890 
which is a move platform a name says especially in the french language

31
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.700 
but not necessarily. And we are responsible for all the evolution of

32
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.110 
the digital education transformation that is currently on the way

33
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.620 
especially with hybrid education on campus on one side and

34
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.190 
coaches professional development on the other side.

35
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.250 
thank you catherine. we'll go on with marcangelo.

36
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.420 
thank you. hello everyone, I'm angela basically a professor

37
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.140 
of library information science.
and now serving as pro-vice-chancellor

38
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
of indira gandhi national open university

39
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.450 
in new delhi india.

40
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.420 
I have been involved in the india moocs that is well

41
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.950 
from the very beginning

42
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.020 
in fact from designing itself.
I have been involved.

43
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.820 
I have been in various committees for platform development policy

44
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.770 
guidelines and

45
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.270 
in monitoring the forces that are going on.

46
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.070 
so basically in terms of moocs.

47
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.280 
I think it's.

48
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.160 
so I cannot call it just a regional mooc,
because we are focusing more towards

49
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.410 
english language rather than the regional language.

50
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.340 
so i'll be happy to answer any of the questions.

51
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.400 
there is a maximum math jenner,

52
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.410 
everyone matt jenner here.
I'm the director of learning for future land

53
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.680 
which was founded in the uk by the uk open university.

54
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.220 
and then two years ago was jointly and sort of co-founded or co-

55
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.300 
purchased by a sikh group who are an employment and job-seeking

56
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.760 
platform in the asia pacific region.
and the reason for adding

57
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.810 
that in is because it's given us a very interesting angle of

58
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.510 
opening up education to people through mix

59
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.020 
through micro conventuals degrees and our new offering which

60
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.370 
is an expert track which is a subscription model.

61
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.250 
but also increasingly focusing on career
professionals so thinking about

62
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.360 
those who are trying to get new skills
or trying to work within their

63
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.420 
current career or get a new career.
we are very much an english speaking platform.

64
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.880 
we do have english language courses taking up a

65
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.110 
high ninety percent of our courses,
however we very much see

66
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.790 
ourselves as a global platform.
and we see learners coming from

67
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.620 
all over the world and i'll talk a bit more about
why i say that later on.

68
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.570 
thank you matt and rocket monday.

69
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.470 
I said thank you very much,
my name is rocco but everybody calls me

70
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.480 
rock. as name hernandez, i'm from guatemala.

71
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.760 
and I represent a university.
the university is

72
00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.130 
one of the largest and more tech oriented universities in the region

73
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.780 
without forty thousand students.
and i'm in charge of all the digital

74
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.310 
services and initiatives and innovation within the university

75
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:19.870 
for over twenty years.
the university has heavily invested on the

76
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.970 
educational technology which has helped us
to develop very interesting things.

77
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.120 
we started with moocs about 2012, 2013.

78
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.010 
actually we'll launch of the one of the very first mobile firms in

79
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.490 
the region in latin america.
and we have produces so far about seventy laws moocs.

80
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.810 
and right now we're since let's say six or so years,

81
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.010 
we are part of edx and our main efforts right now are to produce

82
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.880 
books within edx,
because we like the platform and so on.

83
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.520 
but still we have some moocs outside of that platform as well

84
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.350 
and as very much about me.

85
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.080 
thank you rock i sheriff,

86
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.420 
hello everyone this is a schrift from the

87
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.940 
online platform rock situated in jordan in the middle east.

88
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.750 
online learning has been the area of my doctoral studies at

89
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.830 
stanford, and then i joined the team here at rock in jordan

90
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.310 
where we serve books primarily in arabic
to learn across the arab region.

91
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.240 
I was also lucky to be part of
a research committee with me and others

92
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.810 
that studied differences in engagement and outcomes between

93
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.920 
rock and between other english moocs providers.

94
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.300 
I'm here to share you know this part of
our perspective a pleasure to meet you

95
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.470 
and to share you.
and last but not least geoffrey cross

96
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.810 
geoffrey cross professor and general manager

97
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.890 
the tokyo tech online education development office that has

98
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.160 
developed books on edx for seven years.

99
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.900 
and a laboratory doing research on learning analytics and AI

100
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.520 
in education happy provides prospects related to

101
00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.750 
online education in japan.
actually tomorrow one of my doctoral

102
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.810 
students will make a presentation
about one of our moocs and talk about

103
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.930 
disease self-efficacy in cambodian university students.

104
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.470 
thank you for the invitation to participate.

105
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.580 
thank you so much to the six participants for taking this time

106
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.810 
and they're distributed in different parts of the world.

107
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.140 
so times will be pretty different.

108
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.710 
a couple of hints about what we're gonna do.
we'll have several blocks of

109
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.480 
questions where we'll go from we will traverse  different topics.

110
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.900 
and some of the question might be addressed to a single participant

111
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.070 
and others will be completely open to whoever wants to respond.

112
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.750 
and please if you want to engage with each other feel free to do so.

113
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.380 
and with a father at you.
let's start with the questions.

114
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.930 
I think you'll bring introducing ourselves
and as i said our agenda for

115
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.270 
the session is to explore local moocs ecosystems worldwide.

116
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.200 
but for these ecosystems to emerge well,
you need to be able to reach

117
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.740 
a local audience.
so the first question is and this is a question for the entire

118
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.740 
panel how should books be different?
how should move platforms operate differently

119
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.590 
when the primary goal is not to reach a global audience?

120
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.030 
and then but also 2012,1 20AI thank so a couple of I,
rather to really target a local one ?

121
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.220 
well perhaps sherif could go first in this way then.

122
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.450 
alright ok ,so it was interesting to see

123
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.970 
the research that we did with with jose and a number of other

124
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.170 
researchers around the world

125
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.840 
that will speak about what's different in a local

126
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.540 
platform, it's not just about the language, it's not just about

127
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.930 
you know these obvious cultural aspects
and adapting them to the region.

128
00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.770 
but one of the things we found most effective was that the

129
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.720 
platform actually manages to focus its marketing.

130
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.190 
so starting from its landing page
how the platform looks the moment an

131
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.710 
organic learners comes from the web to your platform that this

132
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.680 
whole journey of navigation is actually focused on the needs

133
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.770 
that are primary and key for the region that you are serving.

134
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.100 
now this is something that i know academia doesn't focus on a lot.

135
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.250 
we focus tend to focus more about the learning itself.

136
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.410 
the learning dynamics the activities
the design of the course content,

137
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.760 
but we oftentimes do not touch much on that part which is more

138
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.060 
considered marketing.
but working with a drug i think revealed how

139
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.990 
you know content might not actually be exposed to learners

140
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.920 
in a way that increases consumption until you design this into

141
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.350 
the platform design itself.
and this is a big big factor that

142
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.410 
you win when you're able to focus on
a certain region and focus on its

143
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.190 
browsing habits and its needs particularly.

144
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.430 
would someone want to offer a contrasting perspective to this one ?

145
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.380 
by the way thank you.

146
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.560 
i'm an maybe i just cannot

147
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.230 
a few comments there and I completely agree as well with going on

148
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.990 
and on the thing of

149
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.970 
in order to be able to expand the reach of a mooc within your

150
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.960 
region you have to really focus a lot on good communication.

151
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.080 
and if you like some good marketing as well.

152
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:45.560 
another thing is that sometimes
we have developed some very tech oriented

153
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.100 
moocs for let's say four app development

154
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.690 
or something like that and making them in spanish

155
00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.500 
by a professor who is local and so on and so forth.

156
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.060 
it makes a huge difference.
we have seen that certainly these students prefer a lot

157
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.280 
to learn in their own language,
how many of them speak a secondary language

158
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.070 
for instance english,
but also this is important to have

159
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.470 
this kind of localisation or this if you like a flavour that

160
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.040 
the way the person communicates within the

161
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:30.070 
region and so on so forth, makes them more familiar
to the teacher and the

162
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:36.090 
learning content as well.
so that's also a lot about localisation.

163
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.760 
I think that's really important for mocks to have them

164
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.270 
with subtitles, or if you like translated that's fine,

165
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.590 
that's  good and certainly that will help to

166
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.440 
grow the reach of a given topic or mooc to a wider audience.

167
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:58.700 
but if it's produced by someone
who actually speaks the language and knows the

168
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.420 
cultural differences, then the content becomes more familiar

169
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.120 
and that helps a lot for the learning

170
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.390 
by any means go ahead.

171
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.820 
so in india what we're doing in fact on this web

172
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.990 
platform from the language point of view.

173
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.460 
you see most of the courses are in english,
but a major initiative

174
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.580 
has been taken up, in which we are actually

175
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.950 
we are as you know in india  has twenty two

176
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.580 
official languages.
so what we have done initially now.

177
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:40.550 
I mean  most of the videos that are there, we are actually

178
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.460 
translating them into i mean the transcript is getting translated

179
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:50.480 
into eight different languages at the moment,
and then subtitling is being done.

180
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.270 
and perhaps in future we may go in for

181
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.500 
some kind of a dubbing also to be put in.
and also perhaps even the

182
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.590 
text content that is there is to be translated.

183
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.440 
so that in the next few years it will be coming in.

184
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.100 
part from that i think from the point of view of the platform.

185
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.910 
I think at the moment the kind of courses
that we put in there very journalistic.

186
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.850 
I think some kind of a personalization customisation can be

187
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.890 
built on based on the

188
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.510 
learners life-cycle that can help to a great extent.

189
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.800 
I think that's where we should be focusing on the moves platform.

190
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.270 
thank you much, so perhaps a follow up question could be to

191
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.770 
flip the first question on its head and ask

192
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:41.510 
well what are the all hallmarks of
designing a truly global learning experience.

193
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.510 
and maybe matt could take this one.

194
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.730 
thank you, i'm gonna go slightly back to the previous question and

195
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.380 
question so on top of language
which i think is a really important point.

196
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.070 
we have an example of a course and i don't know if there's

197
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.340 
a bell, but i'm gonna mention current virus already.

198
00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:03.390 
we have a course that was created
by a group connected to the NHS.

199
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.270 
so our national health service
in the uk called public health england.

200
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.850 
and they made a course about psychological first aid through

201
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.110 
the covert nineteen pandemic.
and it was very much a government

202
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.080 
a uk government public body as a partner a future learn making

203
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.970 
a course for the uk.
it's not geo fence door, you can't not access

204
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.580 
it from anywhere else in the world.
but it's designed for a

205
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.150 
uk audience.
so very very local in a global sense.

206
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.820 
but then to pick up the second question.
they made an alternative

207
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.260 
version of the course for africa.
and the purpose says is that

208
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.470 
a lot of what happens in the uk a lot of the content and the

209
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.280 
resources and what's available to a front line health care

210
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.030 
worker in the uk.
it is just not relevant to anyone else outside of the uk.

211
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.940 
and particularly other countries
that the organization wanted to focus on.

212
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.930 
so you can flip it round by they took the skeleton of the course.

213
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.860 
they took loads of the completely reusable elements of the course.

214
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.480 
but then they re contextualize it back into african countries.

215
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.860 
so some simple examples are they change some of the imagery

216
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.090 
which would resonate more with a different audience that they

217
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.380 
change the case studies they change
some of the order and some of the language.

218
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.780 
and even thinking about the bandwidth for the videos i believe

219
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.460 
that there are tweaks and changes made across the course that

220
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.390 
would just naturally make it more adaptable
to a different environment

221
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.280 
not deeply into the pedagogies.
but i think it's that sometimes those subtle changes

222
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.520 
that someone who really wants to access something and is hit by a

223
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.110 
HD video wall.
every single time they want to watch a video

224
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.970 
that can be very off-putting that can be the kind of thing

225
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.750 
where you have to pause your learning.
you might not have the

226
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.650 
bandwidth to do something and you have to stop.

227
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.640 
so it's sometimes like language barriers those kinds of things that

228
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.560 
you want to try and reduce those walls down as much as possible.

229
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:52.820 
thank you matt.

230
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.930 
does anyone want to add something to that?
otherwise I already

231
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.020 
have a follow-up question precisely on that topic.

232
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:05.490 
so you touched on a one of the big obstacles
that movie creators and platforms

233
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.800 
face which is the cost of production

234
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.000 
so and this obstacle is sometimes even
more present in a local context.

235
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.910 
so how can a movie production be made
more efficient more affordable

236
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.050 
in a local context?

237
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.680 
would rock want to take this one?

238
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.760 
perhaps and i think if we can make the causes more participated.

239
00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.780 
so in writing content from the

240
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.060 
donors, also i think that we can go ahead and

241
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.680 
it could be a kind of a peer learning happening in.

242
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.080 
so that's maybe we have the basic content available and then

243
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.200 
build on that with the participation from the

244
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.740 
donors and that could be a way down.

245
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:11.080 
thank you. any other tips on mooc production

246
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.980 
may affordable? i think that's something,

247
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.360 
yeah for example at toko tech we use teaching assistants.

248
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.920 
so basically students who making the courses

249
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.830 
that kind of cuts down on cost for staff, but it does take more time.

250
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.620 
just to contribute. i think

251
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:39.370 
it depends on how the quality you want to do it and how different

252
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.780 
or very specific or what kind of

253
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:49.560 
peculiarities you want to add into a given course.
so the more unique

254
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.590 
you make it, the more expensive will become,

255
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.310 
and the more standard you make it the process,

256
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:04.290 
the cheaper will come.
so it entirely depends on how  you want to approach this.

257
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.840 
but what we found is this the most

258
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.810 
expensive part of off

259
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:18.460 
production is  the time that is consumed

260
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:25.100 
or the professor consumes too much time
for producing the the actual mooc.

261
00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.500 
and that it is really hard for many professors,
because they have

262
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:34.580 
their own you know scale lives activities commitments
and so on and so forth.

263
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:39.120 
and if you get into a production that will take you a lot of time.

264
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:43.080 
so i think that's a one of the he then cost which of course

265
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:49.700 
can be reduced to economic cost,
but is more about time and sometimes it

266
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.610 
has a big penalty for the actual professors producing the content.

267
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.370 
thank you very much, over to you.

268
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.430 
so we'll jump now to one of the or probably the most research

269
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.060 
question in the area of moocs which have been related to take

270
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.230 
ups in terms of completion on next six. so there's been several

271
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.870 
research papers addressing gaps in globally in terms of the

272
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.320 
human development index of the country, but also locally in

273
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.020 
the same country by analyzing the socio

274
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.470 
demographic status of each one of the neighborhoods.

275
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.710 
do you think that local initiatives conquered by the eight these

276
00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.370 
gaps that we have serving most of the research?

277
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.600 
we did some very relevant research on this.

278
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:49.460 
so we compared engagement on a drug by arab learners to engagement

279
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.480 
of arab learners on english platforms,

280
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.190 
particularly on a set of courses by mit

281
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.130 
and other affiliates. and we compared these two groups as well

282
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:09.040 
with english-speaking learners on the english platforms.

283
00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:14.900 
now the interesting finding was that it showed a drug had

284
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.570 
significantly higher completion rates where sometimes talking

285
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:23.900 
two to three fold the completion rates that we observe in arab

286
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.670 
learners studying on english platforms and sometimes even more

287
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.380 
than english speaking learners on the english platforms.

288
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.620 
now  that may be attributed to some differences
in course structures we admit.

289
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.930 
but the interesting thing was persistently that this

290
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.140 
you know agrees and actually

291
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.060 
enforces or agrees with the evidence
that we have from learners themselves

292
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.670 
that oftentimes when they go to english speaking platforms.

293
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.740 
their language could help them get started in the course.

294
00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.550 
so it's not an issue in rolling it in,

295
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.790 
but what's not to actually engage with the content the just

296
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.680 
the sheer cognitive load of processing a language they're not

297
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.080 
comfortable with, soon starts to kick in and translate in a

298
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.210 
drop out that maybe to them themselves wasn't predictable when

299
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.230 
they enrolled in the course.

300
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:22.350 
so i think this was an interesting finding,
that sort of juxtaposes the point on

301
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.360 
content relevance,
but also the cognitive load in processing a non-native language

302
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.810 
as something that we saw strong evidence of.

303
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.500 
thank you. more thoughts?

304
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.280 
if I may add something,

305
00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.340 
I agree with the other speakers that the language can be an issue.

306
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:49.010 
but as far as we have seen what's happening
with our learners on the open platform.

307
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:54.010 
there is also something which is very relevant to the engagement

308
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.170 
and the completion rate.
It is really the nature of the course and the

309
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.920 
respective nature of the learners.
so we do have courses that

310
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.370 
are very professionally oriented that

311
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:12.250 
are on topics that where the learners are
they really come because they need

312
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.440 
these content, they need these new skills.
so they come with

313
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.220 
a very specific background they want to
improve their knowledge in the

314
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.740 
topic of the moocs.
and the completion rate is much much higher

315
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.130 
in more general looks.

316
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.790 
so I really think that

317
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.530 
this question of completion rate should be taken very carefully,

318
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.410 
because we know that learners are registering to several courses,

319
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.560 
when you have a newsletter everyone's and when you advertise for

320
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:49.190 
twenty forty or fifty moocs, when we  know that learners will

321
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.190 
register in one click to several moocs. and when the moocs will

322
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.940 
start, then they will say ok.
I only have this amount of time to work.

323
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:59.560 
among the three moocs,
I have been registering to in the last couple of

324
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.740 
days or weeks. I'm going to choose this one or i will maybe

325
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.020 
choose to start the first week of different courses and then

326
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.340 
to select the one i really will focus on, because it's

327
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.820 
more important for me regarding to my objectives.

328
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.220 
and depending on the objective of course the result is different.

329
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:25.100 
so this question of completion rate should be very should be taken

330
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.640 
with all these sociological parameters and all

331
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.660 
that the learners need. and last year during the covid 19 crisis

332
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.690 
we opened many more courses,
and usually we had many many more learners

333
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:44.050 
we had  an increase of learners and an increase of the registration

334
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.610 
by a factor of four,
four more than the same year last.

335
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:53.300 
and when we had the survey at the end of this period we realized

336
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.760 
that the learners they had more times
and they really got engaged in more courses

337
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.810 
than they did usually.
so i really think that there are lots of parameters

338
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.900 
with respect to this question of.

339
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.810 
do they follow the mooc in the end,
are they successful or not ?

340
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.250 
when in india in fact,

341
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.480 
i see that is a difference

342
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.620 
in terms of the disciplines that are there.

343
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.630 
engineering technology they are doing much better compared to the

344
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.830 
humanities and social sciences.
and i don't know maybe there

345
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.590 
is some kind of a value addition
that is there from the certification that gets

346
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.590 
the completion depends on that and in fact.

347
00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.990 
now we have a policy in place where we talk about

348
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.870 
ready transfer towards their degree programs.
so that's something

349
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.900 
and initially in 2016.
it was just a twenty percent credit transfer.

350
00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:01.590 
now 2021 we have a new notification  which talks about 40%

351
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:08.930 
great joiners.
so i think gradually people are getting avilable about it

352
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.640 
and in fact during the pandemic perhaps people

353
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.980 
bought into the platform and learning online.
they're getting used to it

354
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.250 
earlier they were not i mean they had a lot of apprehensions,

355
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.390 
but since it had happened,

356
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.160 
i think things are changing quite a lot.

357
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.690 
so if we follow this same line of topic connectivity,

358
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.960 
have you seen any

359
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.550 
evidence that these local initiatives can help as well

360
00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:49.560 
to improve the presence of under-represented populations in each

361
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.490 
region ?

362
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:05.780 
in our case, where we have seen is that
we have survey several of our learners

363
00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:12.550 
where those were hosted medic score in our own platform.

364
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:19.230 
it seems like a still with the same print
is seen lowly that is most people

365
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.790 
that are accessing of course depends on the type of mooc or content.

366
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:29.330 
but it is access or are most of the people enrolling

367
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.030 
on some. and most of the moocs are

368
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.890 
professionals already.
so that's one of the trends that we have

369
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.450 
already seen everywhere. so that's one thing,

370
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.610 
on the other hand we have created a set of moocs for

371
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.520 
own represented you know

372
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.890 
populations and science so forth.
and we have seen

373
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:58.120 
that we have been successful,
but that means that, also we put

374
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.510 
a lot of fort on introducing
and promoting and motivating if you like

375
00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:09.610 
these special populations to actually engage young
and roll into the course.

376
00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:15.170 
all the things as a work of course putting an online course

377
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:20.040 
give it for free for our under-represented population

378
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.040 
and if you are really good into communicating it.

379
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:28.370 
then you get some traction,
so that kind of things of course, well we'll have.

380
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.150 
i think we have actually an interesting point related to what you're

381
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:37.640 
just saying rock. we found that a drug to big clusters of learners.

382
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.580 
you know so they go along the lines of these are people who

383
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.640 
are learning for career related reasons.

384
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.300 
and those are people
who are learning more towards personal development out of

385
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.180 
personal you know general knowledge interests. now the interesting

386
00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.670 
difference between these two groups is that people learning

387
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.780 
for career related reasons often didn't show that much sensitivity

388
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.860 
to the language of instruction. and i think this partly goes

389
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.100 
to that english is the main language they will be using.

390
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.900 
and we actually caught some signals from the industry that industry

391
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.450 
has preference for people who actually are capable of learning

392
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.970 
and working in english. and this is why this group tends to

393
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.860 
actually target learning resources regardless of language.

394
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.660 
but the other group was particularly more sensitive to language.

395
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.540 
and i think it has to do with the fact that

396
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.410 
age average was  generally older in the second cluster.

397
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.920 
so people who are learning for general

398
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.870 
knowledge tended to be of a  higher age than the other group.
and i think this also

399
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.420 
correlates in the arab region. i don't know if that reflects

400
00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.710 
also to the rest of the world.

401
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.700 
but you know english proficiency is a bit lower in that age

402
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.340 
group than in the other. so this was an interesting nuance that

403
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.220 
we found i think that reflects on you know the which

404
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:57.350 
learner clusters tend to benefit more from localisation.

405
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.560 
if i may build on that point, obviously another challenge is

406
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.010 
always the price or the sort of financial cost of involvement

407
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:11.540 
or of showing some level of certificate or attainment.

408
00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.780 
and price is always going to be a challenge,
unless if you're in a position where

409
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.780 
you can offer everything for free.
you'll always have some price

410
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.340 
tag associated with some feature or outcome.
and certainly on

411
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.020 
future land we although we have a sponsored model where a partner

412
00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.700 
is very welcome to create a course that's entirely free and

413
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.990 
offers every feature that is available.
most of our courses

414
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.520 
run on what we call the upgrade model which means that there

415
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.630 
is ultimately a price. and in the uk
it's about thirty forty pounds.

416
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.550 
but for someone else in another country that could be a substantially

417
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.980 
disproportional sum of money.

418
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.940 
so we've tried initiatives and some of our initiatives around

419
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.190 
geo pricing which are really exciting where you actually bring

420
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.540 
the price down to a point much like netflix
tries to do where it's localized.

421
00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.720 
we found from some of our experiments
that it was still a sort of socioeconomic experiment.

422
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.960 
we still found people that were well graduated with good jobs.

423
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.710 
we're basically just getting quite a nice discount on the cost

424
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.690 
of their course.
we were still not really reaching that right

425
00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.820 
the right audience that would be very willing to take this course.

426
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.590 
the price was set at a much more competitive level.

427
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.460 
but again that goes back to i think rock was saying the messaging and

428
00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.640 
how you communicate what the course is and who you communicate it to.

429
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.730 
so quite a few new challenges,
but i would say price is definitely

430
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:27.630 
one of the big ones.

431
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.700 
sorry, i have a question for matt.

432
00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.100 
go ahead rock yeah i know,
because i was interested when you

433
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.300 
presented yourself that you mentioned about

434
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.790 
you are deploying or already working with a subscription model

435
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.890 
future learn. so can you can you tell us has that time,

436
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.680 
because i think that's one of the main

437
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.590 
things that will happen with large providers in the future

438
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:01.610 
more like a netflix style subscription. so maybe you can give us

439
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.890 
some information has learned that. happily so in january this

440
00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.660 
year we launched something that would look very similar to

441
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.410 
a specialization on coursera the idea that it's a series of

442
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:17.780 
courses all on the same topic building on each other.

443
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:21.650 
typically forty to one hundred hours of learning.

444
00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:25.670 
and we started with  the idea that
we'll offer anyone a seven day free trial.

445
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.610 
and we debated what would be included in that trial

446
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.750 
and maybe you can you know,
we're a business ultimately where we are

447
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:36.870 
out to make a profit, however in the free trial at the moment

448
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.930 
and at the moment that's continuing you can if you want to

449
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.340 
complete the entire expert track so you can finish every single

450
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.270 
course you can get every certificate nothing is locked to you

451
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:50.220 
at all you have the whole experience. the reality is very few

452
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.410 
learners are doing that i don't think gaming the system and learning

453
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:58.070 
go hand in hand very well. of course someone is always out to

454
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.140 
get what they can for free.

455
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.370 
and that's great. they're welcome to it.
but i think we know

456
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.220 
that authentic learning takes some time.
it takes some investment

457
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.130 
and it takes a challenge. and that you could probably dance

458
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.430 
around different models of how to do this subscription seems

459
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:17.390 
like quite a good one. and if you can also add geo pricing onto

460
00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.510 
the subscription. so in some countries it's as low as a few

461
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:24.210 
dollars in other countries.
it's higher because of gdp or other measures

462
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:27.390 
then i think you're starting to look at a new access model

463
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.960 
that actually could even start to work for credit which is

464
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.120 
another avenue that i think in the next,

465
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.720 
i don't want to pin it on the time frames,
but in the next few

466
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.010 
years i think we're going to try to look at credit and subscriptions

467
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:42.480 
and see what we can start to talk about with our partners to

468
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.010 
further break down that model as well,
because it's a very interesting

469
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.970 
and for our learners quite compelling

470
00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:53.580 
way to stop and start your learning.
so you can stop subscribe pause it

471
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:57.760 
come back resume that offers quite a lot of flexibility, i think.

472
00:32:59.150 --> 00:32:59.610 
thank you.

473
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.410 
thank you thank you both and taking the conversation in a different

474
00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.900 
direction and this is a topic that kuma has touched on earlier

475
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:13.280 
four credit books have you seen four credit moocs being used in a

476
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.360 
local context,

477
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.120 
well and maybe the answer to some of the questions we're going

478
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.700 
to be asking is going to be no, so the and that's ok too.

479
00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:35.510 
in that case so a drug has worked with universities in jordan,

480
00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.050 
it was an insightful experience.

481
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:45.010 
because you know we had you know certain aspects of success.

482
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:50.190 
but we also learned about a number of challenges as well.
and maybe i think

483
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:54.160 
you know the value introduced by online learning you know,

484
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.760 
it's not in a university context is
not something we need to discuss

485
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.660 
at this roundtable.
but i think it would be interesting to reflect

486
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.290 
on some of the challenges we encounter.

487
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.430 
so working with universities means that we need to integrate

488
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.830 
with universities whether technically when it comes to their systems,

489
00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.870 
or in terms of adoption from instructors and and students.

490
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:19.090 
so one thing that mooc platforms have to keep in mind is that

491
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.770 
most universities nowadays already have a platform
that's up and running.

492
00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.850 
so you are coming in as an impostor to an extent.

493
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.090 
you're telling people, okay now you will have some

494
00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:33.010 
courses in this experience.
and some courses in that experience

495
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:38.660 
and we were surprised to be honest by how much students resisted

496
00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.680 
having to work with two different platforms at the same time,

497
00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.780 
even if they were two different courses.

498
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.580 
and to the extent that you know four instructors.
it was tedious

499
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.540 
you know to practice grading here and grading there,

500
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.320 
know the features here and the features there.

501
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.130 
that is also to set aside you know the technicalities of the

502
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.730 
integration itself with universities platforms,

503
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.770 
which is not really a research problem, but a technical problem.

504
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.730 
but it's also so much worth putting on the table. so these were

505
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:10.130 
two things that you know i felt that animal platform targeting.

506
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:13.930 
you know universities and for credit needs to be aware of these facts.

507
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.590 
thank you sheriff.

508
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.840 
and i would like to add in fact in our
national education policy 2020.

509
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:29.250 
something the idea of academic bank credits have been mooted.

510
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.240 
and the work is there,
i mean it's being them and sam is going

511
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.150 
to play a major rul. so the credits the learner earns from

512
00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.590 
moocs can be actually accumulated

513
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.910 
put on the academic bank of credit.
and later on that can be

514
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:48.660 
combined i think you have bouquet of courses available,
something structured by some

515
00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:52.330 
universities which can be pick and choose from different universities

516
00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:56.260 
and you have a degree available. and that's kind of a idea that's

517
00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.350 
being floated and we're working towards that.

518
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.270 
and in fact i possibly had something called a

519
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:08.370 
meta university concept also taking
causes from different universities combining them,

520
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.270 
where moocs platform can play a major role.

521
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.850 
thank you ma. well on a related

522
00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:21.090 
note perhaps expanding a bit going beyond credit specifically.

523
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:23.550 
could you tell us about some of the

524
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.720 
opportunities and some of the unique facets

525
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:34.160 
of operating a national mooc platform

526
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:34.870 
and i wanted to direct this question to  Catherine.

527
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.230 
when we launched this initiative
it was really a very collective initiative

528
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:50.420 
from french universities,
from professors in universities, from rectors

529
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:51.810 
and from the ministry.

530
00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.900 
of course it was very important for us in 2013.

531
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.660 
we launched the platform 2013.

532
00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.830 
it was very important for us to be
able to provide a good environment.

533
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:07.290 
let's say a french speaking environment for
learners wanted to take courses in french.

534
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:13.180 
and even though we do have courses in english.
we we also have bilingual courses.

535
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.340 
but most of the bilingual courses are in french and in english.

536
00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.590 
but we have one or two in french or spanish,

537
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.510 
because they are created by cooperation between
french universities and spanish universities.

538
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:30.410 
and of course it's important for us to give visibility to

539
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:34.790 
french-speaking learners around the world.
and as you probably know

540
00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.160 
france used to be a colonial country,
so we we do have lots

541
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.860 
of learners especially in africa who speaks french.

542
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.770 
and this is very important for us to provide
to those learners good french content

543
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:52.470 
from universities. and we have basically eighteen percent of

544
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.730 
our learners who come from africa in watch teaching courses
on  our platform.

545
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:02.860 
i would like to come back to the previous
question about certificates. we do have

546
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.860 
a few courses on them who provides a certificate.

547
00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.620 
we don't have the same issue as you you have a sherry for network.

548
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:17.100 
because the people who take those courses
and want the certificate, are not students

549
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.840 
they are lifelong learners they are people who work in companies.

550
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.060 
they are people who seek for a job, and they come on the platform

551
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.220 
to take a course. and they are willing to pay for a certificate

552
00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.730 
because this certificate is going to have a value for them

553
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.940 
in their professional development. so the issue that you have

554
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.290 
been describing the relationship with universities with

555
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.230 
the difficulties for the teacher to manage

556
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:46.350 
and for the student as well to manage
the elements of the universities and the mooc platform.

557
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.240 
this is not really an issue for us

558
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:54.790 
on this respect.
and that's a very interesting perspective katrin.

559
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.450 
thank you so much.

560
00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.820 
absolutely thank you well i have a question perhaps now on

561
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.930 
the flip side of academia and that would be

562
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.680 
employer perception. and this is a subject
that is brought up very often

563
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:15.000 
has its changed over time.
and i'm wondering about the situation

564
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.870 
in in japan although this could be asked to everyone jeffrey.

565
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.470 
do you have something to offer in that regard

566
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.330 
oh employer perception related to little online courses.

567
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.660 
yeah so i think in japan

568
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.800 
there's the multinational companies

569
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.500 
brand name toyota honda etcetera and they offer a lot of online

570
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.990 
courses within their companies.

571
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.960 
but recently related to AI

572
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.150 
some of them are actually reaching out to universities to partner

573
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.950 
making online courses.
so there's kind of a

574
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:57.460 
transition that they meet content and some sometimes they will

575
00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.490 
provide content and working with us to create online courses.

576
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.160 
and in other cases they are looking to educate

577
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:10.460 
staff related to new technology,
so there is more and more opportunity for

578
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.520 
working with companies. and i think though in japan one of the

579
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.580 
issues that we have is we cannot

580
00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.310 
typically offer courses for credit

581
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.030 
simply based upon online experience.
it has to be some sort of exam

582
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:28.120 
which has to be proctors etcetera. so i think in japan

583
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.830 
it's we're a little bit behind other places.
but i think within the next

584
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.430 
four five years that will probably gradually change.

585
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.210 
thank you Geoffrey. and we discussed before about the

586
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:46.190 
potential influence of language and i'm interested within this

587
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.320 
topic of language especially also in those

588
00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:54.250 
languages the half several countries that took them.
and i'm thinking

589
00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:58.250 
for example in the panel about arabic in the case of rock or

590
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:03.130 
spanish in the case of rock. do you have a something in mind

591
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.990 
in terms of marketing to different countries in a different way,

592
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.360 
was the role of language in two spaces?

593
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.900 
yes sure.

594
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:21.040 
our experience is that when we create a book certainly we think

595
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:26.240 
about the region not only about our country
or the nearby countries but the region.

596
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:30.470 
so when you are doing a marketing or communication process

597
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:35.990 
to try to engage learners you have to somewhat localize.

598
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:39.820 
sometimes is easy in  a way of how this

599
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.860 
just to change some messages to have better impact.

600
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.460 
and that's something that you see when you're

601
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:54.070 
promoting, because for instance you're seeing a lot of enrollment

602
00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:57.890 
in south america.
but not in central america and then you start to

603
00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:01.420 
you know to tweak and try to

604
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:08.120 
tune the messages in order to engage more learners
to enroll into the course.

605
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.560 
that's one thing, because in the other hand once
they are enrolled there's a

606
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:15.940 
completely different story how to keep them engaged
in the course and

607
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.070 
as some of our colleagues mentioned.

608
00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.420 
many of the learners just come to consume very specific

609
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.620 
part of the course or content.

610
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:32.460 
and in our world it's also similar to what rock explained.
but an important

611
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:40.020 
contrast is between our experience with moocs in k to 12

612
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.070 
versus, you know with more adult learners.
so with adult learners

613
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.340 
we found that you know you really need to change a few things

614
00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.330 
here and they're really to optimized. so yes you know the

615
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:56.240 
accent in egypt is a bit different.
let's say than that in jordan than in the

616
00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.740 
western arab world and then in the gulf countries.

617
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.830 
but you know still it's a few tweaks, then once everyone is

618
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.260 
in the course we have this median language which we called

619
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.510 
white arabic which is which sort of caters to all is understandable.

620
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.250 
now it was surprisingly more challenging when we were working

621
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:19.780 
with key to twelve, because some of the technical terminology

622
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.820 
actually difference between arabic so imagine synonyms.

623
00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:27.650 
but different you know synonyms being
the approved ones in the curricula.

624
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.890 
so now all of a sudden a curriculum
that you are designing according

625
00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.140 
to the jordanian curriculum does not use the same terms as

626
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.840 
used in egypt, even though the words are understood

627
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:41.270 
but to a twelve year  old student, it does make a difference.

628
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:45.730 
so it was surprising to see how different

629
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.440 
this is in mooc application k twelve versus fairness.

630
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:54.230 
thank you to both of you for your perspectives and beyond language

631
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.110 
should moocs be culturally aware?

632
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:01.330 
for example should we also take into account local philosophy

633
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:05.340 
in terms of instructional design when producing courses and so on.

634
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.370 
and perhaps i would like to hear jeffery's opinion

635
00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.870 
based on japanese culture for example.

636
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.100 
we've created a courses

637
00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.800 
trying to provide some sort of japanese context.

638
00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.330 
this is actually one of the courses where we talked

639
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.330 
about tomorrow an international session.

640
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.870 
so i don't think we've really tried
to design based upon instructional design principles different

641
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.850 
for japan versus international audience,
primary we're focusing on

642
00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.460 
international audience of our courses we're trying to appeal

643
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:45.520 
but just add the kind of cultural aspect related to japan which

644
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.480 
we find international learners may find of interest.

645
00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.490 
any other thoughts?

646
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:58.260 
we've certainly found at feature land many
of our partners are predominantly either

647
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:02.130 
from the uk or across europe or they're from australia.

648
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.070 
and so if you were learning,
if you're learning based anywhere

649
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.720 
else you could easily look at our platform

650
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:14.270 
and feel. it's a bit global north,
it's quite white, it's westernised curriculum

651
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.790 
and so on it might not immediately look like it's accounting

652
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:23.550 
for diversity of learners or of opinions
or of perspectives from educators.

653
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.930 
and i feel that that's a topic that we've just tried to grapple.

654
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:30.650 
i don't think it's an easy topic
and i don't think anyone is doing it brilliantly.

655
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.500 
but it goes to the cultural sort of awareness piece,

656
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:38.260 
because perhaps if i zoom in again
and give you an example one of the

657
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.430 
topics that's been really interesting that we've been

658
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:42.940 
working with over the last six months has been around

659
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.230 
black history black curriculum and thinking about

660
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.900 
the amazing influence of teaching a teacher.

661
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.710 
and so we have a partner,
i'm going to check that i get them right that course

662
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:57.220 
is called teaching black british history.
it's a teacher training

663
00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.910 
guide from the black curriculum which is an organization.

664
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.550 
and the purpose is, if you think about the extra

665
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:08.850 
the potential of teaching a teacher is we arm them with some

666
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.410 
skills or case studies and examples and they talk to other teachers

667
00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.820 
about black british history.
they can then go and teach it themselves,

668
00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:18.830 
but that means that we have this amazing

669
00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.620 
amplifying effect of if you reach one teacher who reaches ten

670
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:26.180 
students then suddenly you've reached those
ten students plus that teacher.

671
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.590 
and if you can start to look at the sort of cultural or diversity or

672
00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.830 
different audiences that you might not be quite reaching correctly.

673
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.510 
i feel that one really great way to achieve,
it is through that teaching

674
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.850 
sort of magnifier effect that can be achieved, and teachers

675
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:47.120 
are just in my experience the best online learners.
they're enthusiastic,

676
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:51.860 
like i said they love sharing resources
they love sharing tips and stories

677
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.970 
always open to new pedagogies who doesn't want that in their

678
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:56.910 
online platform.

679
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.950 
thank you matt. and at this point
were ten minutes away from the end.

680
00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:09.380 
so we wanted to have asking a playful question or rather to

681
00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.470 
give you the opportunity

682
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.460 
to ask a question. would any one

683
00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.140 
of our participants want to
ask a question to the other participants ?

684
00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.810 
i would. go ahead jeffery.

685
00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.530 
so one of the things i'd like to ask the other

686
00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:32.430 
and of course developers is there a particular period when

687
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.610 
you have a course, you'll run it and then decide to close it

688
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.560 
so that two years three years out or content changes

689
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.170 
any any comments? would be appreciated.

690
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.890 
i can only add that we've recently been moving as many courses

691
00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:53.290 
as possible to make them available particularly last year.

692
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:58.310 
we're now trying to move everything
to an on-demand model which effectively keeps everything open

693
00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:03.210 
forever with the awareness that forever digital is not a great

694
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:06.630 
combination if you don't update. so one of our next challenges

695
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:11.260 
will be how do you start to set content exploration flags for

696
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.530 
specific types of content, for example health care advice is

697
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:17.610 
very different to courses on history you know the event was

698
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:19.870 
a long time ago. we're probably ok for a bit longer.

699
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.570 
so i think your question raises a good challenge

700
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.300 
we leave the responsibility with the educators and our partners,

701
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.590 
but i think more technology solutions could certainly help

702
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:34.020 
improve that sort of work flow for content updating.

703
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.830 
we don't have a defined duration for our courses however.

704
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:44.390 
i wanted to maybe for the moment on the  phone platform

705
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.950 
most of the courses organizing sessions. they are not open

706
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.140 
so this is really the responsibility of the teacher and more

707
00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.420 
important is the responsibility of
the university with branding the course

708
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:59.910 
to make sure that the course is regularly abrogated.

709
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:05.230 
and by experience i can tell you that all the courses are graded

710
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.710 
sometimes a little bit, sometimes much with a much larger trunk of

711
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.650 
work from one session to the next one.

712
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:20.030 
and i believe that the academic people who produce those,

713
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.290 
i mean they don't produce a mooc.
they create them, they create the content,

714
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.720 
they are very aware of the fact that their image is carried

715
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.050 
by the course and they are very willing to make sure that the

716
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:35.270 
contents are correctly updated otherwise.
it's both their image

717
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.760 
as an academic person and the image of
their university when the courses

718
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:41.630 
are obsolete in the content

719
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:46.050 
and that would be my  answer jeffrey.

720
00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:54.070 
thank you. i think, i think certain also

721
00:49:55.830 --> 00:50:01.120 
domains of knowledge change,
so when i think about drugs courses

722
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.830 
when it comes to technology for instance tools. so even you

723
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:08.390 
know a tool on, let's say a business intelligence the tool itself

724
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:11.120 
would change one year after the other,
and this is one of the

725
00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.960 
challenges, i think a particular in the area of technology yeah.

726
00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:24.270 
thank you. so if and at this point maybe
we should take questions from attendees.

727
00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.110 
if someone would like to ask a question

728
00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.710 
please feel free to use the raise hand,

729
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.460 
you're raise your virtual hand and we'll mutua.

730
00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.540 
in the meantime if they may and

731
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:58.720 
we get a question from the public.
I would like to ask to our

732
00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.180 
colleagues in the table.

733
00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.120 
what they think is the future of moocs and

734
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.690 
if you like to some extent

735
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:13.330 
do the moocs on the grand acceleration of the adoption

736
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:18.650 
pandemic, what is the future of education as well,

737
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:20.410 
let's think about the future of moocs first.

738
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.710 
that's the big question isn't it?  and perhaps localizing it

739
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:37.410 
a bit could help, have you seen ways in which moocs at a local

740
00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.700 
level have gone in a direction that perhaps moocs

741
00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.890 
more globally haven't taken

742
00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.030 
refugee camps, perhaps here in jordan,

743
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.010 
so this was one of the important

744
00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:01.420 
use cases you know that that was different.
so you know obviously

745
00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.840 
a lot of challenges around availability of stable internet.

746
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:09.760 
so there is need for strong partnerships.
so i worked with the

747
00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:13.550 
norwegian refugee  council and the danish refugee council

748
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.310 
who facilitated a lot and there were a lot of success stories.

749
00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:20.860 
so this is something i think that is maybe specific to jordan,

750
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.620 
as well as other places in the world with the displaced communities.

751
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.980 
but the other thing which we're starting to see in jordan and

752
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:33.090 
actually i have just two examples it's really early work.

753
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.550 
but we recently launched a program

754
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:40.740 
for adaptive learning of english. so we take a placement test

755
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.520 
to see you know your starting level
and then you can progress all the way

756
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:47.370 
to the end. and then we started taking this to businesses in

757
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:50.610 
jordan and say. hey ok if we introduce this at a management

758
00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:54.440 
level right and then a management actually encourages and pleased

759
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:58.110 
to take it and it is in the tourism sector particular
so english is important.

760
00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.270 
we observed a lot of engagement and what was surprising was that

761
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.810 
we saw an example of word of mouth from business to business

762
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:08.340 
so businesses starting telling you to each other,

763
00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.740 
hey this thing worked for me why don't you try it as well.

764
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.240 
and i think this happened in the

765
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.660 
in jordan one of the reasons we saw this was, the challenge

766
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:23.270 
is key it is around english and we had
this sort of thing that worked somewhere.

767
00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:27.000 
and i think if elsewhere in the world there is also this sort

768
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.290 
of you know common challenge and you take something and you

769
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:33.310 
try to work with businesses then we might start seeing business

770
00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.110 
to business word of mouth just like
we see it among learners as well.

771
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.810 
now i'm not sure this is actually a worthy example.

772
00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:43.270 
and but i thought you know i cherished as an example love.

773
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:46.870 
something that i saw for the first time maybe perhaps in jordan.

774
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:50.470 
but it's definitely not something
that's specific to to the middle east.

775
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:54.660 
thank you very much very.

776
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:59.440 
does anyone want to add something,
otherwise i have another question.

777
00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.490 
i saw that ruth has a question in the chat.

778
00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:14.340 
so the question is i would like to ask,
if you if you have any

779
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:18.190 
move based initiatives to encourage women learners and in what field.

780
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:22.630 
and i would like to also like to know if you have many partnerships

781
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.810 
using third party moves with translation.
so let's start by first one

782
00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.740 
and are you aware of any move based initiatives to encourage women

783
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:32.370 
learners and in what fields ?

784
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.310 
then we are not creating courses

785
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:43.790 
for women. i don't know,

786
00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:48.870 
if but for example we have a collection of courses that are

787
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:51.120 
specifically designed for

788
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:59.660 
student students wore not at the university level.

789
00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:03.020 
i forgot the name in english for those students
who are going to take the final exam

790
00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:08.840 
at high school before coming to the universities.

791
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:12.810 
and in these courses we want to to promote the different

792
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.950 
degree that you can find at universities.
we want to show them

793
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.640 
what are the jobs that they can say
you are interesting in digital technologies,

794
00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:26.210 
then the curricula are organized like this,

795
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:28.930 
the job market is like that,
the job that you can

796
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:33.920 
go to is these are the so that and in these courses

797
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:39.230 
there is a strong dedication to make sure that we promote image

798
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:44.280 
of men and women especially in some fields where we know and

799
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.310 
digital technology is one of the field where we know that at

800
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.970 
least in france, but in europe
and probably another part of the world.

801
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:56.010 
women do not come and this creates a huge problem for the future,

802
00:55:56.010 --> 00:56:00.240 
if we think of AI we know that AI algorithms are going to be

803
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:04.640 
biased by the fact that too many men are creating
those algorithm and that

804
00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:09.130 
well women should come and join.
so we make sure in those courses that we really

805
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:14.120 
put on the stage figures of women who have succeeded in different

806
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:19.430 
type of the job to make sure that young girls
from fifteen to eighteen

807
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:23.130 
who are going to choose their path at the university

808
00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:27.830 
are willing to understand that there is there are pathways for them,

809
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:32.430 
even in jobs that they don't think of,
because they are too strongly

810
00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.920 
mainly oriented whatever.

811
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.830 
so that's one of the experience that we have in france.

812
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:43.290 
that's going to add to that question that we see around sixty

813
00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:46.810 
percent of our learners identifies as women, which has always

814
00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:49.070 
been the case in feature land. it's actually slightly lower

815
00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:52.550 
than when we started it used to be
a bit higher about sixty six percent.

816
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:56.390 
and i think i want to make it not so, that's just a sharing

817
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:59.610 
of insight, but a call to action is we have a lot of courses

818
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:03.860 
around for example domestic violence gender in the media intimate

819
00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:07.450 
partner domestic violence understanding  gender inequality

820
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:12.160 
and they're also taken by women.
so my call to action would be to men,

821
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:14.840 
i think you also need to learn these topics,

822
00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.680 
because these are some serious topics around the world
and if men don't learn,

823
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:22.000 
it's not going to get better.
so that's my response to the question.

824
00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:29.550 
thank you matt. sebastian i believe you have a question perhaps.

825
00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:30.680 
you can ask at live.

826
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:35.270 
i can do that thanks. so throughout the panel

827
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:39.670 
you've talked a lot about kind of content localisation.

828
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:46.520 
and making that accessible to various groups
and which impact kind of the local

829
00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:52.100 
area has to to the content adoption for example and i was wondering

830
00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:55.520 
and how about the communication between participants,

831
00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.780 
so that of course the form that is provided
for all participants is

832
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:02.820 
kind of easy. because it's an asynchronous medium to participate in.

833
00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:08.360 
but if i think of other moocs that might involve teamwork,

834
00:58:08.610 --> 00:58:09.230 
for example or foster

835
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:14.670 
small groups of students to work together, i was wondering

836
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:19.640 
how that kind of global aspect can be used across different

837
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.690 
continents for example there are different time zones and different

838
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:27.190 
backgrounds and what the advantages
or disadvantages of this might be ?

839
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:35.430 
who would like to jump in ?

840
00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:43.890 
don't make me point fingers.

841
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:49.730 
months you moved i mean if i have understood the question correctly,

842
00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.530 
a big part of where we think the direction might go is sort

843
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:57.320 
of localize smaller study groups cohorts,
maybe they're not localized

844
00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:00.360 
and that might go some way. if i have understood your question

845
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.540 
correctly to addressing this. but platforms probably need to

846
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.960 
facilitate that i don't lana self-organising is very challenging

847
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.040 
especially, if you don't even really know who you're learning

848
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:13.070 
with because they may be passively learning
rather than very visibly learning.

849
00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:16.540 
so i would personally like to see more of that i think there's

850
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.770 
a social contract that kicks in and also very fruitful learning

851
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:21.940 
outcomes at the same time.

852
00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:27.890 
thank you matt. does someone want to add to that ?

853
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:37.880 
India we have some examples it was a kind of a blended learning

854
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:42.490 
a hub-and-spoke model are used you have generalists,

855
00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.530 
and you have centres around

856
00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:47.740 
where looking supervisors are there to help.

857
00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.870 
i think that kind of thing can work,

858
00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.260 
even if we think in terms of global offering of the courses.

859
01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.290 
thank you very much Uma.
and on that note we have run out of time.

860
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.290 
so i want to thank you all for participating in this roundtable,

861
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:12.140 
thank you to all the attendees too.

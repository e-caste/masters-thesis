00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.707 
Welcome to my workshop on LERNEN.cloud,
where we then talk about the possibilities and limits of digital training.

2
00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:18.008 
We will also look at the scientific findings
and what we can do with it and what it means for us,
to design digital advanced training courses.

3
00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:30.377 
On LERNEN.cloud we have the possibilities,
To transfer further education now into a digital format, there are many design possibilities,
and, of course, certain challenges.

4
00:00:30.377 --> 00:00:43.459 
From science we know - here the offer-use model of Frank Lipowski and Co -
that certain conditions must be met,
so that further training courses are actually effective in the end.

5
00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:51.718 
We look at all these metastudies, not all, but many
or rather what has emerged from it.

6
00:00:51.718 --> 00:01:02.113 
So scientific knowledge from science and look now,
what this must mean for us, can, in order to create effective online training here.

7
00:01:02.113 --> 00:01:07.744 
So where are the limits of online training
compared to analog formats?

8
00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:16.228 
And how can science now
work with such digital platforms,
and how can great formats be created from it?

9
00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:25.616 
Exactly, so that is our goal.
We want the theory to be as good as possible,
is also moving into practice in online formats.

10
00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:29.536 
And whether that can happen, how that can happen,
We will talk about that.

11
00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:35.166 
There we will also discuss a lot,
and there I invite you to visit us

12
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.913 
and then join the workshop and work diligently.

13
00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:40.425 
So long!

Hello everyone! We are at the
HPI School of Design Thinking.

2
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.200 
This is where teams of students
work on different projects

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.180 
applying the design thinking
methodology and right now there's

4
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.590 
a team which is applying different
techniques of brainstorming

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.480 
to come up with a lot of ideas.
Hi guys! Could you tell

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.440 
us what you're working on?- So right now we're
trying to solve a problem that Ali has.

7
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.190 
So, Ali is a young law student who
we met during our interviews

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.450 
and he lives in Berlin, he is very
passionate about social project and wants

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
to get engaged but he is also very busy
balancing his studies and also his

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.230 
student job on the
side. So yeah, he's

11
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.340 
quite active on social
media, like most of us.

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.760 
But we'll see where we
can go from that.

13
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.290 
So the "How might we"
question that we're trying to solve

14
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.740 
and that we'll use for our
brainstorming session is

15
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.260 
"How might we help Ali to
contribute to meaningful social work

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.860 
even though time is a scarce
resource."- So no we are going to use

17
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.350 
different brainstorming techniques to
be able to come up with different

18
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.050 
new ideas.- Right, and I would
suggests to start with

19
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.130 
silent brainstorming. So everyone of you takes
some sticky notes and writes down the ideas

20
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.380 
on one sticky note. So each
idea on one sticky note.

21
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.110 
And I set the timer
on three minutes.

22
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.190 
For silent brainstorming make
sure that everyone has sticky

23
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.250 
notes and markers. Set maximum
five minutes on the timer.

24
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.280 
The team would write down their
ideas silently in a short amount

25
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.660 
of time. Tell them up front that
they should go for as many ideas

26
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.750 
that come to their mind. When time
is up the team shares their

27
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.800 
ideas on the whiteboard or any
surface, one person at the time.

28
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.890 
When a team member is sharing,
tell others to listen carefully.

29
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.290 
This may spark a new idea in their
mind and they can write it

30
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.320 
down and share it afterwards. We
recommend to use this technique

31
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
in the very beginning of
an ideation session.

32
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.180 
It will allow everyone to free
their minds from all ideas they

33
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.960 
have without any
influence.

34
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.130 
The "Hot Potato" is a physically
active brainstorming technique.

35
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.540 
You need a ball or something
fluffy and round that you could

36
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.060 
throw and catch easily. Stand in
a circle with your team and

37
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.370 
start by throwing the
object to a team member.

38
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.000 
That person is supposed to come
up with an idea very fast

39
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.610 
and say it out loud. He or she then
throws the object to another team

40
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.460 
member and it
continues like this.

41
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.370 
Here you would need a coach or a team
member that takes a facilitator

42
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.110 
role, who writes down each idea
that is shared on a sticky note.

43
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.200 
Otherwise everyone is just shouting
out ideas and will forget

44
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.150 
them by the end of the session. The
facilitator will read the ideas

45
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.860 
once again at the end and puts them
on the whiteboard or another

46
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.690 
surface. This technique is really
good for pushing people to

47
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.880 
come up with wild ideas fast
and without any judgment.

48
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.950 
We suggest that you try to go
through this technique at least

49
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.470 
for five minutes. Teams often
feel uncomfortable in the very

50
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.730 
beginning and need to get into
the flow of this very fast

51
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.190 
and spontaneous technique.
In this technique

52
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
both your body and brain is engaged.
Physical movement activates

53
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.210 
different parts of your brain and
helps you think differently.

54
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.790 
"Photo brainstorming" is a
technique for changing your perspective.

55
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.960 
All you need is a picture. Print
out a large image on an A4

56
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.160 
paper and put it up on a wall or
in the middle of the table.

57
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.080 
The team looks at this picture
and tries to come up

58
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.120 
with ideas associated
to what they see

59
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.120 
and capture each idea on a sticky
note. Different attributes

60
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.580 
of the picture, for instance
colors, shapes or a landscape in

61
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.480 
the picture may inspire
individuals differently.

62
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.850 
This technique triggers different
associations and creates

63
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.850 
a space for new combinations and
ideas. You can either do this

64
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.090 
session like a silent brainstorming
where team members write

65
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.790 
down their ideas on sticky notes
first and share it at the

66
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.310 
end, or write each idea down and
say it out loud during the

67
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.090 
session. We recommend to set the
time between five to ten minutes

68
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.820 
for this session.

69
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.910 
The last technique that we want
to demonstrate in this video

70
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.790 
is a way for your team to act out
the brainstorming principle

71
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.520 
of "building on the ideas of others".
We call it "Plus five".

72
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.870 
To start, ask the team to have
a look at the ideas that are

73
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.820 
already on the board, then each
member picks one idea they would

74
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.320 
like to build on. Make sure that
no one picks their own idea.

75
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.360 
Now each team member has to come
up with at least five more

76
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.480 
ideas that built on that idea they
picked. This can be done in

77
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.530 
five to seven minutes. Again: noting
down the ideas is done silently

78
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.890 
and all ideas are shared afterwards.
As you notice, this technique

79
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.680 
is not suitable for your first
round of brainstorming.

80
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.800 
The team should already
have collected a pool of

81
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.330 
ideas to choose from and build
on. This technique helps teams

82
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.160 
to elaborate and add to ideas
and make them more concrete.

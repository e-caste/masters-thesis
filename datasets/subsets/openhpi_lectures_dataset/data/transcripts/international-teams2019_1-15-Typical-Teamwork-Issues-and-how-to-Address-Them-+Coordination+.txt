00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.260 
OK, Salim.So now I've been
talking a lot about all these

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.240 
tools that you can use
but I guess it is

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.980 
not only kind of good stuff
there's also some that

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.470 
have to be some challenges it
can't be that kind of it's just

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.130 
like super easy and everything
is just go? True, your tools

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.890 
I must say they are necessary
without these tools we will not

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.740 
be able to work but there is
something that definitely

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.710 
we need to address and
is the coordination

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.740 
the coordination of a team working
remotely it is really one

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.040 
of the key parts of the
success of the remote work

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.740 
not just because people are
working outside it means that

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.910 
they will be inspired or be more
creative and more productive

13
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.620 
no, if you do not coordinate
that team you will have

14
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.460 
definitely several issues
and some of them

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.550 
let us start in the coordination
let us start with selecting

16
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.030 
the people who should be working at
home, who should be working remotely

17
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.140 
who should be working
in a different

18
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.260 
part of the world normally you
have already organization

19
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.880 
and you want to let say, to
virtualize to make it remote

20
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.740 
you need to select a team not
necessarily the volunteers,

21
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.420 
volunteers they have
a need, a will

22
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.280 
but you need to see the need
from your organization.

23
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.500 
Let's say if you have
a team a big team

24
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.170 
let's say fifty people in one organization
in one part of your business

25
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
let's take five to ten, five
ten people that they want

26
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.240 
also don't move, don't push them
too, you have to go out now

27
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.880 
let them go and in
this small team

28
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.090 
take some of them who are team
leaders who are the leading part

29
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.320 
bring outside just the people
and someone who can lead them

30
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
because of the reason, they
will need still to see

31
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.310 
or to hear from his
or her leader

32
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.340 
and second because we
also need the leader

33
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.990 
to have experience there.....
So that they know what

34
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
what is the whole about.... what the
team is experiencing.... Exactly

35
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.020 
because if you have the people
outside and the team leader

36
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.780 
is sitting at the office he
doesn't know or she doesn't know

37
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.070 
what is going on out there this
is very very very important.

38
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.760 
And also try to have those
people, the first try, to have

39
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.650 
the people from the same unit if
possible that they know what

40
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.450 
are they doing people that
already have experience.

41
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.210 
Don't try to put their
people that you just hire

42
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.610 
because they don't know
the rhythm of the

43
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.900 
organization and this is really
really a something really important

44
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.410 
and please do not exclude
women or men, mix them

45
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.100 
we have in our researches
we have found

46
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.450 
the capacity of women for leading
in the remote structure

47
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.920 
it is fantastic, it is great also
man they have their capabilities

48
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.060 
but it is I want to make sure that
we had not make any discrimination

49
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.600 
here because it is a
fantastic performance

50
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.740 
of mixed teams it brings a
dynamic definitely a dynamic.

51
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.380 
When you also bring this team
outside you have to make sure

52
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.200 
that you know exactly what are
the targets and you communicate

53
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.240 
them clearly if you bring people
outside but you're not saying

54
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.980 
what are you really
expecting from them

55
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.220 
they will not deliver
anything, they will deliver

56
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.000 
something that is not what you
expect and this is a really

57
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.980 
really big mistake we have seen in
the past in some organizations.

58
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.200 
Yeah we want to achieve this, no
it's not just the final target

59
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.510 
we want a progressive achievement
of this... So you need

60
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.200 
a path how to get to the final
exactly.... and when you say that

61
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.330 
you just say to the team and you
also say a new in this team

62
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.270 
you are responsible this part you
are responsible of this part

63
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.090 
and you're responsible
if you have an issue

64
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.910 
at the office then you run to
the other office and say well

65
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.560 
what is that, when you are in a
virtual structure in a remote

66
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.290 
structure is a bit more
difficult even you have

67
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
the tools you presented now but
still there is a coordination

68
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.730 
but if you have that information
already it's by far better

69
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.210 
therefore it is definitely
necessary to make sure that you

70
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.680 
communicate the targets to achieve
and who is achieving what

71
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.010 
and when, because if you make a
target to be delivered in two

72
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.000 
weeks but you don't coordinate the
sub-tasks, then you will not have anything

73
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.810 
it's like a normal project but
with the complexity let's say

74
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.370 
let's say complexity that people are not
just facing each other, sitting together

75
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.830 
Yeah and there is another part
that is really important

76
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.080 
is that a in this target defined
you need to define something

77
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.540 
that can be measured
not something that is

78
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.220 
probably we achieve this will
be no. On that day I want to

79
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.690 
achieve this, and then you can
verify it was achieved or it

80
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.940 
was not achieved otherwise
it would really

81
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.140 
not realistic and the
practice is that we will

82
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.660 
need to consider is relatively
necessary because it's

83
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.160 
a combination of the technologies
also the combination of the

84
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.950 
responsibilities and also the
task if you coordinate this and

85
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.260 
i'm talking right now mainly for
the leaders or for the managers

86
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.320 
if you leave this to
happen just like that

87
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.000 
it won't work it won't work you
need to make a full up constantly

88
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.280 
and making a follow up means to
have a chat to have a meeting

89
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.560 
coordinated your tools
you should just before

90
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.800 
you can have a video meeting and
then you will see each other

91
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.570 
the expression of
everything will be by

92
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.380 
far more rich, this is something
that it is necessary to consider

93
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.370 
this is something that we will
need to take into account

94
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.590 
otherwise if you don't have
coordination your done.

95
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.490 
Let me put this point which is really
relevant mainly for coordination

96
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.670 
and mainly for managers you have
to stop managing the hot seat

97
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.630 
and what it means exactly if
people are not sitting there

98
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.520 
they are not working this is
the meaning this is our...

99
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.140 
No, you need to start
thinking differently

100
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.840 
if you want to achieve
something different you

101
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.740 
need to start making
doing things different

102
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.050 
and this is the reason people
are not sitting here in front

103
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.310 
of you but you know they have a
task because what we saw before

104
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.730 
they have a task something to
achieve with a timeline and

105
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.270 
cooperation in the meantime
will be happening.

106
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.500 
It means if you stop
managing the hot seat

107
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.420 
it would be a huge
huge improvement

108
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.590 
this remote teamwork it is a
culture it is not just a way of

109
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.870 
working it's a culture where
you are based on trust

110
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.050 
your organization based on
the trust of the employee

111
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.980 
and of the manager both sides
need to trust each other

112
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.210 
and the communication
must definitely be

113
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.420 
open at all sides and
there is one thing

114
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.440 
we have some experience is already
with this and you as manager

115
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.830 
you also need to to get know about
local laws and regulations.

116
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.980 
Regulations let's say let me put
an example what happened if

117
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.110 
you're working remotely
and you have an accident

118
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.470 
who's gonna pay for that..... insurance
issues? Exactly, is the insurance

119
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.050 
of the organization or is your
private insurance which

120
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.990 
is gonna take care, then there are some
things and in different countries

121
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.590 
there are different conditions and
this is definitely necessary

122
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.590 
to evaluate. Also, there are some
regulation, tax regulations

123
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.790 
there in some countries
there are some benefits

124
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.020 
they are also called
a green law

125
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.330 
it means this green law they try
to protect the environment

126
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.360 
So because you spend less
energy in commuting

127
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.550 
Exactly, you need less coffee to
go. For instance! Exactly and

128
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.010 
then there are some benefits
for organization that

129
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.700 
implement such programs and just
have a look to that because

130
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.810 
it is necessary to consider.
Now the last point but

131
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.200 
it is probably one of
the most important

132
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.240 
is the IT whenever you're working
remotely for any organization

133
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.450 
you have to have technology and
technologies involves internet

134
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.660 
involves also the laptop the high
resolution cameras, security

135
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.990 
all this stuff but normally you
have in your organization people

136
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.670 
taking care of that, those are the
IT teams, network managers all

137
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.160 
the stuff...... and they
really should be kind of

138
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.970 
in the in the process when you start to do
that?....... From the very first beginning.

139
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.660 
Otherwise at the end,
there will be people at

140
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.380 
home or remotely will worried saying
"I cannot access this", yeah of

141
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.990 
course because IT didn't have
any security consideration

142
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.070 
about that and they closed all
because is ok to close all access

143
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.750 
from outside but if IT is involved
from the very first beginning

144
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.070 
defining which kind of accesses
they can have which kind of

145
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.240 
tools they can have and then
you can build up your program

146
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.270 
based on this capabilities
what you have.

147
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.660 
Another issue that can
happen is kind of you

148
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.890 
if you do not provide the
tools for your employees if

149
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:27.210 
they are working remotely most
employers actually have

150
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.800 
a tendency to try to
get their work done

151
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.870 
and they will kind of they will
come up with solutions of their

152
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.540 
own..... and this will be an issue
this will be an issue because

153
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.950 
in this part of the IT I want
to mention this exactly is

154
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.210 
because whenever you have
the IT under your control

155
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.800 
you can activate and also
deactivate access at any time

156
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.850 
therefore try to prevent
that your team outside

157
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.680 
is using different tools that
the ones that you're allowing

158
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.520 
at any time probably will
need to cut some accesses

159
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.840 
then it's better you to have
control of those access

160
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.440 
all the time, it's not
just about the beginning

161
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.340 
during the whole process it
is necessary to have this

162
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.970 
and therefore IT plays an enormous
role, This remote organization

163
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.840 
will work based on technology and
you have to have this technology

164
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.290 
under control. Well this is the
part we wanted to introduce.

165
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.630 
Yeah so again as always
we would like to

166
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.960 
invite you to contribute
your own kind of

167
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.560 
issues that you have
particularly for now with the

168
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.030 
regarding the coordination of
virtual teams and if you have

169
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.620

class topic or anything that

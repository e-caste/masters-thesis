00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.550 
Welcome back again. In this video I will introduce some basic concepts

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.030 
that are important for you to follow the topics in this course.

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.190 
Let's start with the concept of sustainability.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.050 
One of the most common definitions was conceived in nineteen

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.810 
eighty seven by the World Commission on Environment and Development.

6
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.080 
They published a paper that is also known as the Brundtland Report.

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.120 
There sustainability is defined as a development that meets

8
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.550 
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations

9
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.850 
to meet their own needs.

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.070 
So the overall goal is that we make sure that our sons and daughters

11
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.800 
including their subsequent generations can live well on this planet

12
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.310 
in the same way as we can do it today.

13
00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.100 
Sustainability is often defined as the intersection of three main areas

14
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.890 
which are social aspects, environmental aspects and economic aspects.

15
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.960 
This concept helps to categorize issues and actions in the field of sustainability

16
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.160 
in one of these three fields.

17
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.010 
So, in projects it works quite well to increase the understanding and to

18
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.350 
categorize things a little bit.

19
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.870 
So far about sustainability, that should be enough for this

20
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.380 
course about this concept. Let's move on to the next important concept.

21
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.290 
The concept of a sustainable software engineering or software engineering

22
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.640 
is obviously important for the course as well. What is it?

23
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:49.110 
I quote - a software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering

24
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.480 
to design, develop, maintain, test and evaluate computer software.

25
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.590 
Put simply software engineering is a more sophisticated expression for software development.

26
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.270 
Software engineering adds systematical engineering approaches

27
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.850 
that might not be explicitly included in the expression of software development.

28
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.260 
However in both cases, the outcome is very similar - software.

29
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.100 
One of the most important gases responsible for greenhouse

30
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.590 
effect for the greenhouse effect

31
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.400 
and therefore the global warming is carbon dioxide, also known as CO2.

32
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.150 
It is sometimes abbreviated accordingly as GHG, greenhouse gas.

33
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.540 
There are other gases too but CO2 is the most relevant one,

34
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.930 
also for calculating the ecological impact of our resource consumptions.

35
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.050 
And also in calculations you often find an eq

36
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.780 
or e just after the CO2 and that is an abbreviation for equivalence.

37
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.340 
And these equivalents represent the potential or effects of global warming

38
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.900 
translated to the warming effect of CO2.

39
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.480 
So, if for instance if some gas x is half as harmful as CO2,

40
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.640 
two units of that gas x can be described as one CO2 equivalent, as easy as that.

41
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.550 
Thanks to the standard

42
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.450 
this is why it's very important to know about that.

43
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.410 
It's widely used because many calculations about emissions can be compared

44
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.820 
to each other even if there are several different gases involved

45
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.260 
in the calculation. So this is quite helpful.

46
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.340 
In the context of CO2 and CO2 emissions, the global perspective is interesting.

47
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.390 
Obviously, according to this image you see here

48
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.140 
developed countries have a higher CO2 emissions, like in the northern hemisphere

49
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.490 
and Australia of about five to ten tonnes of CO2 per year and person,

50
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.180 
sometimes even higher.

51
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.900 
While on the other side, less developed countries often have

52
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.690 
emissions lower than five tonnes. Especially Africa you see these

53
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.760 
white spots there representing a very lower CO2 footprint.

54
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.150 
And this raises the question of fairness.

55
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.410 
Why should we be allowed to emit more CO2 than others? Is

56
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.920 
that fair to everyone on the planet?

57
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.620 
Some say that we in the more developed countries take ourselves

58
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.620 
maybe a little bit too privileged.

59
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.980 
Well I just want to mention this discussion here. It is

60
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.090 
an interesting one and I think

61
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.960 
it's interesting for you to maybe

62
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.700 
read more about it but it's out of scope for this course to

63
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.960 
go deeper at this point. So it's on your own to do more about it.

64
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.370 
But for now let's go back to the next important concept

65
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.160 
and that is negative externalities.

66
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.700 
What is that about?

67
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.080 
A negative externality also called external cost is an economic

68
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.900 
activity that imposes a negative effect on an unrelated third party.

69
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.330 
I think we have to explain that a little bit

70
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.640 
for example air pollution is a negative externality because

71
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.140 
when we consume resources for digitalisation, this might come

72
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.140 
with some sort of air pollution.

73
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.850 
For instance hardware is often produced in Asia,

74
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.040 
far away from Europe and transported on air or sea to Europe.

75
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.970 
Both means of transport air or sea pollute the air but

76
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.480 
and this is the point, the parties involved in this business activity

77
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.760 
to buy hardware from Asia do not have to compensate for the air pollution.

78
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.510 
Just because air as a common good being everywhere,

79
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.550 
this good does not really have a price tag. It's something

80
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.990 
external and its pollution has negative impacts

81
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.610 
on a party that is not involved in this business activity.

82
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.820 
Now if you consider CO2 as air pollution,

83
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.690 
meanwhile some countries actually put a price tag for emitting CO2.

84
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.570 
So for example production sites in some European countries

85
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.660 
have to pay for each tonne of CO2 they emit.

86
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.810 
This transformation of a negative externality to a good with a

87
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.340 
price tag is called an internalization of negative externalities.

88
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.670 
So you literally internalize something external.

89
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.530 
Like internalize something that was external before.

90
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.680 
So in that case the negative effect of CO2 now has a price tag.

91
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.930 
So parties who emit CO2 have to pay.

92
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.420 
At this point we do not talk about if this price tag for CO2

93
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.740 
is currently actually high enough. That discussion is

94
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.640 
important well you see there's many important discussions here but

95
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.860 
it's again out of scope for this course.

96
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.780 
So let's move on to the next concept.

97
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:39.020 
When calculating the ecological footprint or the energetical footprint of software,

98
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.350 
we need to know the basics to do so.

99
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.990 
One of the most important units is watt.

100
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.820 
Watt describes the transfer of energy. Watt is the unit of power.

101
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.440 
So for instance if you say a notebook needs fifteen watts

102
00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.700 
that means it needs transfer of energy at the level of fifteen watts of power.

103
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.760 
And that in a moment. So without saying too much about a time period,

104
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.140 
in this moment fifteen watts.

105
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.500 
If you want to calculate the energy consumption of this notebook

106
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.830 
over a period of time, let's say one hour,

107
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.570 
then you take the fifteen watts of power

108
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:25.010 
times the time which is one hour and the result is fifteen watt-

109
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.880 
hours. As simple as that.

110
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.280 
In calculations you often see a k in front of the watt-hours.

111
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:39.540 
That means kilowatt hours. So the k literally means a thousand times.

112
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.810 
So if you want to translate fifteen watt-hours,

113
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.600 
through the unit kilowatt-hours you have to divided by one thousand,

114
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.880 
and the result is then 0.015 kWh.

115
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.660 
And finally, sometimes you also see the unit Joule.

116
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:04.090 
Joule is defined as watt second: So let's take the example of our notebook again.

117
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.910 
Our notebook needs fifteen

118
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.300 
watts of power. Let's say we run it for ten seconds

119
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.710 
and then we calculate fifteen times ten

120
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.520 
which is one hundred and fifty joules.

121
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:23.050 
If we let it run for one hour to take the example of the early example again,

122
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:28.920 
we calculate fifteen times and then one hour has three thousand six hundred seconds.

123
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.630 
So fifteen times three thousand six hundred which is fifty four thousand joules.

124
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.010 
And finally you can use the k again to make it a little bit simpler.

125
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.370 
You divide the fifty four thousand

126
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.100 
oules by a thousand and then you have fifty four

127
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:49.810 
kilojoules.

128
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.850 
As last concept, efficiency and effectivity

129
00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.060 
are important.

130
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.660 
In this course we'll often refer to the concept of efficiency.

131
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.640 
Let's look at this first.

132
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:12.710 
It's the fraction of output divided by input. For example, if you take a

133
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.820 
if you take a computing unit such as a microprocessor or a CPU,

134
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.970 
and supply it with some electrical power of

135
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.680 
one hundred watts as input, the processor can compute a certain

136
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.520 
number of computations per second with its power.

137
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.560 
That is the output the computations. As easy as that.

138
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.610 
the rest is math. So for instance, if theCPUu can perform

139
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.700 
more computations with the same level of electricity input, the fraction is

140
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.590 
higher and then we say the efficiency of that CPU is higher than the one

141
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.880 
that can do less computations with the same level of electrical power.

142
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.340 
Effectivity on the other side seems sometimes close to efficiency

143
00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:09.010 
but in fact it is not. While efficiency is about doing something right,

144
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.270 
which often means fast

145
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.270 
like a fast algorithm,

146
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.930 
effectivity is about doing the right thing.

147
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.390 
Taking the example of the algorithm,

148
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.610 
an effective algorithm is actually solving the problem at hand

149
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.850 
and not something else. An efficient algorithm is solving a problem fast.

150
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.620 
So that's it for the basic concepts we need for the course.

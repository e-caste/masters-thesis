00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.910 
Hello so here we are again.
My my colleague Konstantin

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.580 
has already shown you how to
get into the Quantum circuit

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.710 
composer on the IBM Quantum
experience and I'll show you

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.350 
what further steps you can take
here too to really get into

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.760 
into his kit and just to program
one computer more or less.

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
So you see on the screen that had
this is a exemplary circuit

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.150 
and is constantly already
mentioned there's a few

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.520 
things you can do here you can
can show this code here.

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.550 
But yeah that's also made use of
this little bit so for example

10
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.500 
one thing that you can do,
you can just copy some

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.020 
gates here in this quantume
assembly language and

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.590 
now you that this is just doubled
and you can do this as many

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.840 
times as you want. Also add
gates manually you can

14
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.050 
still you can still
track them in and see

15
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.020 
that it's gonna change
here instantaneously

16
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.200 
and the same is of course also true, if you
look not only at this assembly level.

17
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.130 
But you go to a kiss kit and
even here so for example if I

18
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.940 
just delete a qubit it's gonna adjust
all of these parameters here.

19
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.270 
So you saw a like before this was
for example the quantum register

20
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.860 
is larger and ever more gates
so i'll delete it again and

21
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.120 
you see this does change that
reflected immediately but still

22
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:42.110 
like this is only
at a level of the

23
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.660 
circuit drwaing here
and of course you

24
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.870 
can go deeper as well. So
like it was already pointed

25
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.770 
out you can then just open
this in the quantum lab,

26
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.380 
so let me do this here and if
you click on it it's going

27
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.720 
to load for a while so luckily
I have already done this and

28
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.060 
you can see this
this sample here.

29
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.120 
Right so this will to order the
imports you need and in fact

30
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.510 
well it's it also has everything
in the cloud that you

31
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.800 
need to run this. So there is all the
python modules and installations

32
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.590 
and everything reinstalled so
this is actually a nice upgrade

33
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.700 
to how it was before so now you don't even
have to worry about the local installation

34
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.230 
which you can still do, it is sometimes
useful if you want to tune things but

35
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.540 
you already have all
that you need.

36
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.970 
Ok here you still have the
three cubits and first if

37
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.070 
you run the cell with the shift
enter, here nothing really

38
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.930 
happens like it just kind of copied
the code from how it was before.

39
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.070 
So if you want to find out
what else you can do in

40
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.960 
this note book is always
useful to use the top key

41
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.960 
because with that you get a
list of different options.

42
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.790 
So for example here I see ok
you could add things you

43
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.840 
can include
different things

44
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.590 
copy at gates all these kind of
things, for now let's select

45
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.270 
this one's electoral you can you can
play around with that a little bit.

46
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.730 
And you see there still is a lot of
different options of what you can do,

47
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.330 
here on the like, of
course if you also want

48
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.010 
to delete things you now have to
tune it manually for example.

49
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.010 
We'd have to go down to two
cubits in this way and then

50
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.020 
you see the circuit and of course
you can also add things,

51
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.590 
clear it, I mean that's
the great advantage of

52
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.010 
using kisskit, obviously
you can automise all of

53
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.660 
this, you can just write any python
script around that you need.

54
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.150 
Ok but now I have prepared
another notebook already that

55
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.310 
shows you a bit like what
other benefits have to

56
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.210 
to use kisskat rather than just
drawing a circuit, so if

57
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.130 
you click on this quantum lab
over here you can also like a

58
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.240 
save your notebooks, you
took the note books here

59
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.910 
and open them again, so here
I have prepared a few ones

60
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.170 
and and this one basically
built upon that circuit

61
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.780 
that we already saw, just a simple
entangling circuit so this

62
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.600 
how I get into superposition and is
controlled not gate that creates

63
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.740 
the entanglement if you combined
with the solder mark.

64
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.170 
And this is the way that you run
this on a specific backend,

65
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.700 
here I'm choosing one backend,
so that means running it

66
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.340 
on an actual quantum computer now. I
choose one that I have access to

67
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.890 
you can check this directly in
your quantume experience,

68
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.970 
you see like which kind
of quantum computers

69
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.600 
you have access to obviously I
can access probably more than

70
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.220 
you can accept a few but just
afford to research program

71
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.570 
then you'll you'll have access to
most of these devices as well.

72
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.430 
Coming back to the
to the circuit, so

73
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.720 
this is basically if you just
type ten then a second you get

74
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.240 
old informations
about it.

75
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.350 
How many qubits, what's
it's structure, that

76
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.290 
that can also be quite important
and many more properties and

77
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.630 
parameters that you can check
out yourself. Now the point

78
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.260 
I want to make here is so if you actually
run things on a quantum computer

79
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.970 
sometimes the circuit
that you put in will be

80
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.820 
changed a little bit so I'll give
you an example here so you

81
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.960 
see this is our device its like
has these qubits connected

82
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.690 
in a kind of snake form so each
qubit is connected to the next

83
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.390 
and here I'll show you something
so I'm kind of forcing it here

84
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.830 
to do this like two qubit
operation between like the

85
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.190 
the first and last qubit so you see
there's no direct connections

86
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.260 
of what's going to happen, so
first you would think I can't do

87
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.860 
direct operations between
these two qubits,

88
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.890 
but let's see what happens so
this is called a trance-

89
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.870 
pilar so this happens automatically
if you run this from your

90
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.710 
cirucuit composer but here
we're looking at it directly

91
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.990 
and see what happens so
instead of just doing this

92
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:10.370 
the simple one single quibit gate
and one two qubit gates now

93
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.470 
it's introduced automatically a
number of extra qubits called

94
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.630 
and scilla qubits that are just there to
help so what are they are going to do,

95
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.770 
so if you see these three gates
running at three senate gates

96
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.200 
running after each other that's
actually a so called swap operation

97
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.840 
and what to do with swaps two different
quibits. So what's happening

98
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.550 
is that it's swaps zero and one
its swaps two and three and

99
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.850 
swaps three and four and then
actually runs this two qubit gates

100
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.880 
between this quibit one and
two that is here, so let's

101
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.540 
look back at this structure of
the little quantum computer

102
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.790 
we're running on here so in
order to run from zero to four

103
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.400 
its swapping it around here from
forty three and from three to

104
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.730 
and from zero to one and then you,
you can do this operation here

105
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.620 
so that you effectively get the
circuit that you put in, right?

106
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.410 
So that's called transportation
and and this is something you

107
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.530 
can tune much better in kisskits
so here I am actually telling it

108
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.130 
use cubits zero and four and
there's many other options

109
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.360 
that you can address it is also
a huge documentation if you

110
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.250 
just google kiss kit documentation
yes you'll find all of this things.

111
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.610 
And now I'm actually going to run
this on the quantum computer

112
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.250 
so I'm submitting
this to circuit

113
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.340 
and you can also go back to the
quantum experience and if I

114
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.200 
reload this than you see
there's the new chop

115
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.070 
and I see some kind of status
message it's ran a few

116
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.490 
few seconds ago it has a unique idea,
so that you can always find it again

117
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.170 
and if you click on it you also get a
bit more information about this job

118
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.700 
like for example see that
it completed just now

119
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.200 
and even like
what kind of

120
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.050 
probability outcomes
it had. So

121
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.460 
you see as I said it's never
enough to do one shot

122
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.530 
never enough to do one
measurement one 1024

123
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.270 
and then we get this type
distribution of probabilities. So

124
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.500 
ideally from the circuit should
be only zero zero and one one,

125
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.420 
both of it should be 50%
but you see it's not it's

126
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.580 
not completely perfect as I said
there are some errors running

127
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.740 
the operations there's also some errors
some small errors during the measurements

128
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.440 
and it's the circuit that we
also saw the transpolar.

129
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:51.010 
And one thing about these errors
that you see so one one good

130
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.820 
thing about cricket is that you
can correct this a little bit

131
00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:00.070 
though our job has finished we can
we can confirmed it it's done

132
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.450 
and then we can also here see
the same histogram that we

133
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.490 
just saw in the in the quantum
experience directly.

134
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.710 
And one more thing though that's
a bit subtle I have prepared

135
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:19.940 
that code for you it's called measurement
arrow type mitigation, right?

136
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.100 
So what's it going to do it's
trying with a with the kind of

137
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.320 
calibration matrix it's trying
to correct some of the errors

138
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.360 
that you do in the preparation
of the quantum states and the

139
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.320 
reader of the economy states
saw I did already run this

140
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.430 
calibration job because
it takes a little bit,

141
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.620 
but basically the opening in the
kitchen documentation this

142
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:48.220 
arrow mitigation section is
pretty much copied from there

143
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.130 
and then you get some kind of
calibration matrix that tells you,

144
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.130 
Hey if you want to prepare for
example state zero sometimes

145
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.400 
actually get with a small probability
you get the wrong states

146
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.990 
you can see this in this matrix and
then it uses this calibration

147
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.570 
matrix to correct some of the
errors so you see it's already

148
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.630 
a bit better than before so as
I said idealy it would be 0.5

149
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:16.130 
on each of this of these
outer bars and the

150
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.850 
other one should ideally be
completely 0. and you see its

151
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.290 
already corrected is a little bit
and not as randomly but with

152
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.980 
this calibration matrix that way
that we have. So, this shows

153
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.960 
you two things firstly again
it's not completely perfect or

154
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.780 
video on the quantum computers
and secondly there's a way to

155
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.330 
correct for that in an kiss
kit called arrow medication.

156
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.330 
All right and as a last thing
as I promised I want to show

157
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.350 
you a bit more of an illustration
about quantum entanglement

158
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:52.760 
right? So I have some local notebook here
and once again I have a similar circuit,

159
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.300 
so here I am just running
this control not without

160
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:03.420 
a prior superposition state
and then running a bit

161
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.200 
of visualization the same quantum
sphere that which we saw before

162
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.370 
and here pretty much nothing
has happened right so we have

163
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.270 
prepared both of these
quantum bits in states zero

164
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.800 
and because it's a control not when
when the control cube is zero nothing

165
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.430 
nothing really
happens so

166
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.550 
the nice thing here is we see
also on the individual qubit

167
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.310 
level, what are the states of
the individual qubits. So here

168
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.070 
they're both zero
everything is fine.

169
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:38.170 
Now, let me uncommon this had
a market that we had before,

170
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.900 
ok, now we have this hadamard
end and see note operation

171
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.930 
and what happens now ok excuse fear
looks a little bit different

172
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.400 
so that's kind of an illustration of
the joint state of these two qubits

173
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.690 
and let's let's see how does it look
at the single cubic level now

174
00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:00.740 
this just no more arrows right so
that's the kind of surprising

175
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.990 
thing about entanglement you can't describe
this any more distinguished level and

176
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:11.430 
a whatI have prepared here is a measurement
of quantum entangled it's called

177
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.770 
conquering so it measures for
two qubits whole in tangled

178
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.790 
are they and this one is showing
almost a 100% entanglement

179
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.220 
so what happens is now they
are entangled right?

180
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:28.360 
And yeah once again like now
you can't say anymore what's

181
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.090 
what's this at a
single qubit level

182
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.520 
so another interesting thing
this was briefly mentioned in

183
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.240 
my previous talk as well if you just
measure one of these quantum bits

184
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.650 
you will actually affect the
other ones that's that's it's

185
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.620 
kind of great because again they
are two separate things they

186
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.070 
are entangled and only measure
one of them and suddenly this

187
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.660 
one change schedule will citizen
in a second saw so now I have

188
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.550 
two state vectors that I
get from the circuit

189
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:03.010 
and now again it's just 0.0 and if
I look at the single qubit level

190
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.970 
then suddenly both states are
shown again as as clear single

191
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.940 
qupid states right and and also
like our entanglement has been

192
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.200 
completely destroyed it's now
zero measure of entanglement

193
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.810 
right? even though I only measured
one of the cubans not two

194
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.060 
of them just one of them and now
here I have from this measurement

195
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.210 
I get like a fifty percent
chance have of getting the

196
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:34.590 
state 1.1 or getting the state 0.0
and in both cases the states under

197
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.130 
on the qubits of well defined
there is no entanglement I'll

198
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.440 
just comment out this measurement
once again so that you see

199
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.460 
if I don't do it there is
entanglement between these disputes

200
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.370 
and there's no way of showing
what are the single cubits like

201
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.640 
the measurement of entanglement
it's then high again.

202
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.210 
And just so that you've seen it once
i'll show you how this is defined

203
00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.330 
as a last thing to
enjoy for you so

204
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.400 
you see the definition it's a
little bit crazy it's an ordering

205
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.370 
of the eigenvalues that you get
if you make this if you turn

206
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.320 
the state into a matrix multiplied
by a few other operations

207
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.360 
to a magic squirrel all of that
so if you want to have some

208
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.720 
fun enjoy the definition of
concurrence calculate for yourself.

209
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.010 
Other than that i'm
kind of done here so

210
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.940 
this shows you again what
entanglement is all about and you

211
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.650 
can't describe it anymore in a single
cubic level only at the level of two

212
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.990 
two different cubits and altogether
so we've seen quantum computers

213
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.180 
are not perfect today there are some
errors in everything you do. Some of it

214
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.810 
is because of the quantum physics
behind it because you do have to

215
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.200 
too many measurements and some
of it is because of the

216
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.160 
limitations of the hardware, you
can correct it and on the other

217
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.130 
hand you have teeth discreetly
effects that you don't have

218
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.150 
anywhere else in nature and these
are the ones that promise

219
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.880 
you great performance four point
computers in the future.

220
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.810 
Thanks a lot for
your attention!

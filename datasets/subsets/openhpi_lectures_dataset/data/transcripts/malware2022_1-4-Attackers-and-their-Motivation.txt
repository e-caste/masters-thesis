00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.900 
In our openHPI course on Cyber
threats by Malware, we now

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.400 
have a look at the attackers
and their motivation.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.830 
I remind you the situation - we have
the internet, we have so many

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.650 
networks that are
inter-connected in the internet

5
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.750 
and which provides this virtual
network, which offers so many

6
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.810 
services to the users,
users are accessing

7
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.990 
these services in the internet by means of
their tools, their laptops, their smartphone,

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.580 
their tablets and then
we have attackers

9
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.550 
which are really

10
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600 
using all possibilities
to attack

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.090 
the internet, the internet
services, the user

12
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
to get access to their data, to misuse
the services, to find the possibility

13
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.900 
to earn money in
a criminal way.

14
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.910 
And what we want to do is to have a
closer look on the different types of

15
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
attackers in
the internet.

16
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.800 
So let's start with
the so called Insiders.

17
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.490 
These are company's own employees. They could
attack or steal company's resources,

18
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.310 
for example confidential documents
or servers, misusing

19
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.940 
their privilege in the company
and this is often much easier

20
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.350 
for insider to do than for
externals because we have to

21
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.760 
imagine that there is a world
outside the company and outside

22
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.070 
the network and the services of the
company and there are the bad guys

23
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.640 
and inside the service company's
boundaries there are the good guys.

24
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:03.080 
And many of the security infrastructure
is designed following this image.

25
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.030 
But of course this
image is wrong. The

26
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.980 
attackers can also sit
inside the company

27
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.810 
and they could have different
motives, for example,

28
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.390 
simply curiosity or
frustration about the

29
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.510 
work, revenge, greed, envy -
there are many human

30
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.590 
motivations that an insider
brings to have a look to some

31
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.580 
secret documents, to try to
get access to servers and others.

32
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.180 
So insider attacks are
particularly dangerous

33
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.130 
because they come from inside
the company's network, from the intranet,

34
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.940 
and I already
mentioned many

35
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.630 
security and protection tools,
like for example firewalls are

36
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.940 
typically designed
in a way that

37
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.130 
messages that come from the inside
are not taken with the same

38
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.780 
care as messages that
come from the outside.

39
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.630 
So the

40
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.110 
motives or behavior, it
could be a naivety,

41
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.540 
it could be carelessness. This
opens doors for social hacking

42
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.940 
that provides attackers a possibility
to bring the people inside a company

43
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.920 
for example to do something they would
not do alone, for example download

44
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.330 
some malware or others.

45
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.900 
And there is an increased risk
by these types of attack

46
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.720 
because of the integration
of home offices.

47
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.970 
The idea bring your own device,
use your device as well in

48
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.920 
a private life, as
well for the business,

49
00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.860 
this inside and connected to the resources
of corporate networks, this makes

50
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.910 
the situation much more difficult to protect
the system and it makes it easier

51
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.360 
for the attackers to attack, to steal
resources or misuse resources

52
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.610 
inside the
company's network.

53
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.270 
So the noncompliance with
internal security instructions

54
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.810 
that opens the door for attackers, so here
it's really important for the companies

55
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.530 
to educate their
people to formulate clear rules,

56
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.940 
that's called
security policy,

57
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.720 
so that the people

58
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.230 
the insiders
are not doing,

59
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.930 
by means of carelessness or with
activity, attacks in the network.

60
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.750 
Another potential group
of attackers in the internet

61
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.030 
are the so called
Script Kiddies.

62
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.130 
These are attackers without
deep cybersecurity knowledge

63
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.250 
who launch cyber attacks using
hacker tools, looking in the

64
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.730 
internet for such hacker tools and play
around with the hacker tools and try

65
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.810 
to apply them. For that reason
often one speaks of the Script

66
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.460 
Kiddies, of school kids or students that
also have time that are driven by

67
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.580 
which are driven by curiosity
just for fun to do something,

68
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.630 
show off that one is
able, to have an impact

69
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.470 
by means of
such an attack.

70
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:47.460 
So indiscriminate and usually
its done usually without direct

71
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.690 
criminal intent.
Mostly young people,

72
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.610 
I already mentioned pupils, students
starting to learn about cyber

73
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.590 
security, they are experimenting and
looking around. And it is so easy

74
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:09.390 
to find hacking tools in the internet
which can be used for such

75
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.270 
cyber attacks, which can easily be downloaded
and then misused makes this type

76
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.020 
of attack also
dangerous.

77
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.650 
In particular, such Denial-
of-Service-Attacks, the DoS

78
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.640 
are dangerous. Here by
means of a huge number of

79
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.260 
requests to services the
service is brought in a situation

80
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.840 
that it's no more
able to regularly

81
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
respond to
all these requests.

82
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.010 
These are not request for using
the service, these are only a

83
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.270 
huge number of risk

84
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.980 
requests to

85
00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:01.240 
attack the service, to make the service
no more available for other uses

86
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.570 
and so to overload
the situation.

87
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.300 
Another potential attacker on
the internet are the hackers.

88
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.570 
Unfortunately the term hacker
has different interpretations.

89
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.590 
Originally the term was used in
recognition of particularly

90
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.670 
creative and talented individuals which
were able to design such an attack.

91
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:33.530 
I mentioned, today the attackers,
cybercriminals can get the attack

92
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.920 
tools easily from
the internet. So this

93
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.090 
is no more proof that they are
able to design this by himself.

94
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.830 
Later then hacker has
got a negative connotation

95
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:54.180 
by the media to the indiscretion and
damages by their cyber attacks.

96
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.920 
Sometimes they want to

97
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.580 
shed light to a
certain point but

98
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.890 
in doing that they create a big
damage. So typically now hacker

99
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:11.920 
is no more used in this originally
positive meaning mostly.

100
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:19.070 
Mostly this term refers to people with
in-depth technical

101
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:25.370 
knowledge and if we have a
closer look, then today

102
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:32.170 
often hackers are categorized in
different groups. We have he white hat

103
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:39.210 
hacker, we have the grey hat hacker, we have
the black hat hacker, we have hacktivists.

104
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.710 
Let's have a closer look when we
speak about white hat hackers.

105
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.970 
These are the good hackers.
These are the ethical hackers.

106
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.810 
These are professional experts who look for
security vulnerabilities in computer systems,

107
00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.490 
in application,
services, networks.

108
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:06.880 
So for example we develop a large
SchulCloud system and we asked

109
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.210 
such ethical
hackers to attack

110
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.050 
what we are designing to find out
whether there are vulnerabilities

111
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.970 
before we make the system public.
So this is the help such

112
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.880 
white-hat hackers
are providing

113
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.970 
motives are good samaritan and
increase cyber security awareness.

114
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.270 
So they perform
security analysis

115
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.840 
of systems, they perform
penetration tests

116
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:43.740 
to detect security gaps
and report these gaps

117
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.900 
to the owner of the system so
that the owner is able to

118
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.570 
to increase the security
of the system.

119
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:59.440 
So the information of the authorized
owner about the discovered security gaps,

120
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.610 
this is a characteristic of the
work of the white-hat hacker

121
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:09.500 
to help to improve the security
of that computer systems.

122
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:17.720 
And what they do with this is they help to
prevent future attacks on the system

123
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.600 
by cyber criminals.

124
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.120 
If we look to the other
side, these are the

125
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.720 
black-hat hackers. These are
also called the

126
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.420 
evil hackers and
cybercriminals.

127
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:40.140 
Mostly these are professional computer
experts who hack the computer system

128
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.100 
with some criminal

129
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.940 
motivation, to do some
criminal activity,

130
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.520 
for example to steal data, to
manipulate the system, to

131
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.260 
install a backdoor
to be able to

132
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:04.020 
get access to the system. So they do
this for self interest, for example

133
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.890 
to get money by
selling the

134
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.990 
stolen data and
greed for profit.

135
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.130 
So motives here are typically
the motives of criminals

136
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:22.980 
to easily earn money, to get power,
blackmail, notoriety and others.

137
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.460 
So the exploits that
are discovered

138
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.490 
from discovered
security gaps,

139
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.440 
these are done to gain
unauthorized

140
00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:43.390 
access to the system. Here I

141
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.780 
better say unauthorized,
I mean

142
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.330 
authorized was that
when they find a way,

143
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.540 
for example to steal the
data of authorized users

144
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.950 
or find ways to overcome this
authorized station, then

145
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:07.460 
they get access to the system
and can do their every work.

146
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.820 
The aim is to launch crimes such
as data theft, identities theft,

147
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.870 
service destruction
and others.

148
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.700 
For their own benefit,

149
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:27.040 
on behalf of others to gain money by
means of the attack. In most cases

150
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:34.410 
the discovered security gaps are kept
secret. So when they find a way

151
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.020 
how it's possible to

152
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.450 
attack a system and to
break into a system,

153
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.420 
then typically they will
not tell how they did it

154
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.110 
to prevent that this
vulnerability is closed.

155
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:57.480 
So they share this knowledge with
other black hat hackers, for example

156
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:03.160 
to get money they give this information
in darknet, so to

157
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.580 
earn money and support
other cybercriminals.

158
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.710 
The black hat hackers could
sell stolen information.

159
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.700 
They could sell
it to the public.

160
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.860 
Usually it's organized
and done in the darknet.

161
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:30.330 
For example some information you
can find here in this cited website.

162
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.870 
For example, when you want to
buy an email account and you

163
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.050 
can do this for a few
dollars, if you want to

164
00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:45.530 
illegally get the driving licence information,
you have to pay about twenty dollars,

165
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:51.520 
credit card details
are available between eight

166
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:57.310 
and twenty two dollars and medical
records are up to a thousand dollars.

167
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:04.790 
These black hat hackers also provide
services and tools for various

168
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:10.620 
illegal activities. For example,
tools to hack Facebook accounts.

169
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:19.300 
You have to pay for an attack over
three months here only twenty dollars.

170
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:29.740 
Or to change the rating on Google and
Co or to access special user accounts.

171
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:36.840 
Such things are sold as a service
typically in a darknet so that other

172
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:43.360 
cybercriminals can misuse this,
access all this data for their work.

173
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.150 
And when we speak about
grey hat hacker then it's an

174
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.810 
immediate group
between the

175
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.420 
white hat hacker and the
black hat hacker. Sometimes

176
00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.210 
they do good work sometimes
they do bad work.

177
00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:08.370 
Also they are mostly professional
computer experts who have both

178
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.300 
benign and malicious
selfish goals.

179
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.880 
So the exploit found

180
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:23.580 
which are misusing a security gap in
the computer systems, sometimes it is

181
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.850 
announced sometimes
it is sold.

182
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:33.090 
So they possibly launch criminal
activities for their own profit.

183
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.890 
The grey hat hackers publish
found security gaps to

184
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.190 
increase security awareness.
So this is some positive

185
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.030 
thing what they
are doing

186
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.730 
and a special group of

187
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.440 
these grey hat hackers
are so called hacktivists.

188
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.560 
Hacktivists is a created

189
00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.490 
word from hacker
and activist.

190
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:08.400 
So hacktivists are individuals or groups who hack
computer systems for ideological reasons,

191
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.320 
for social, political,
or religious reasons.

192
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:18.310 
So the motives are they want to
raise awareness, for self ego,

193
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.940 
there are political
goals they perform.

194
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:30.270 
So they launch attacks to computer systems
to highlight some issues to the public.

195
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:39.490 
For example they believe with this
activity to contribute to higher causes,

196
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:47.130 
they do not shy away from criminal
activities for following their

197
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.980 
political or ideological
thinking and they

198
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.620 
try to influence the media
and the public opinion

199
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:03.810 
often with false reports or
confusing ideological phrases.

200
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:10.310 
Some known groups here are the
group Anonymous which is

201
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.180 
such a hacktivistic group.

202
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.340 
And then when we consider the

203
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:21.490 
motivation of the attackers in the
internet, we have see common criminals.

204
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.870 
So criminals who use the
internet for their activities.

205
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:34.060 
They do their traditional criminal work
and use the internet to prepare this,

206
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:41.400 
to exchange information with the
partners and they of course want to

207
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:49.270 
use the potential of the internet as a global
marketplace for their criminal activities.

208
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:57.250 
So they use the internet for criminal
activities, for example drugs and arms,

209
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.360 
trafficking, extortion, computer
fraud and other things.

210
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:08.950 
For the authorities it becomes
more difficult to enforce the

211
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:13.260 
law and investigate the criminal
activities on the internet

212
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.990 
than in the
physical world.

213
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.080 
So therefore the governments
may be interested to install

214
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.710 
backdoors in cryptographic
protected systems

215
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:30.690 
to get access to the information that
are cryptographically protected, exchanged

216
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.380 
by such criminals
and terrorists.

217
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:41.410 
And then the next group of attackers
with some own motivations

218
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.680 
our secret
services and our

219
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.480 
attackers that
do espionage.

220
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:54.220 
The extensive possibilities of the
internet of our high potential

221
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.440 
for spies, for
secret services.

222
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.760 
So economic crime is to steal
confidential information,

223
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.130 
development, information,
spying out competitors

224
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:14.190 
in any area. For espionage,
spying out on political

225
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.920 
interesting actors,
spying out the

226
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.080 
communication of
politicians

227
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.790 
and of other countries,

228
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:29.240 
spying out international political
organization and others

229
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:36.760 
and of course performing politically or
economically motivated cyberattacks

230
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.200 
on services or on
computer systems.

231
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.100 
One example to mention
here is Stuxnet.

232
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.290 
Stuxnet is a malware, or
a group of malware

233
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.910 
attacking Windows networks and
proprietary programmable systems

234
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.520 
of nuclear plants with
the aim of destroying

235
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:06.230 
the Iranian uranium enrichment
plants and this of course was

236
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:13.320 
organized by such attackers from the
field of secret services and espionage

237
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:20.620 
and this is where we have a closer look
in our excursus when we speak about

238
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.690 
advanced persistence threats.

239
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.300 
And then here also
this is a notion,

240
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.740 
you should remember "zero
day vulnerabilites".

241
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:39.580 
These are vulnerabilites not detected
yet and not publicly known

242
00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.280 
and these secret services and
espionage, they have a lot of

243
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:51.730 
means and money in the back. They often
use as such zero-knowledge vulnerabilities

244
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.910 
for their work.

245
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.690 
There are more motivations but this
is to see that the attackers

246
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:06.810 
often have very different backgrounds and
very different motivations for their

247
00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.150 
cybercriminal activities and this
is important to take into account

248
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.940 
when we think about how
to protect our systems.

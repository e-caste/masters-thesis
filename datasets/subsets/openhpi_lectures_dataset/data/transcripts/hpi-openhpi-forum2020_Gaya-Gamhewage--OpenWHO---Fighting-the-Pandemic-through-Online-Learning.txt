00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.020 
Hi. Do you have
a few minutes?

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.130 
I'd like to share with you a story of what could
become the world's largest international

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.310 
training response
during an emergency.

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.380 
In twenty seventeen the World Health
Organization as the UN health agency

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.500 
and the Hasso Plattner Institute
in Germany started working together

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.690 
on a technology enhanced
learning project.

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.840 
At WHO we were still reeling
from the challenges in the West

8
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.060 
Africa Ebola outbreak that lasted from
twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen.

9
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.960 
We knew during that outbreak that
training had a very big role

10
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.510 
to play in emergencies.

11
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.770 
We wanted a way to use technology and
partner up to build a learning platform

12
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.050 
that could reach massive audiences,
millions of learners and

13
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.880 
so that we could transfer
the know-how

14
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.880 
and core knowledge real time
during a public health emergency.

15
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.050 
So we had some design criteria. There
were things that we really needed.

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.500 
So the size and the capacity of
the platform is very important.

17
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.930 
We needed millions of people to learn
at the same time during an emergency.

18
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.130 
We wanted the platform to be
really easy to use for people

19
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.770 
who are developing the courses, so the WHO
could quickly take new guidelines and advice

20
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.170 
and transform all that into
learning through the platform.

21
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.050 
We have to be quick.

22
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.970 
And of course the most important to us,
this platform had to be accessible

23
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.630 
for everyone. It had to be
accessible in terms of being able

24
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.140 
to have different languages, we had
to cater to people's preferences,

25
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
in some cultures people
prefer to learn through

26
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.250 
oral tradition. So we needed
audio, for others related video,

27
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.500 
for others we needed pictures, and yet
for others we needed written material.

28
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.170 
We needed to address the people who are
still very tragically on the wrong

29
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.630 
side of the digital divide. Some
millions of people don't have

30
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.410 
access to good broadband and some
have no access internet at all.

31
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.440 
So this platform had to deal with low bandwidth
and had to offer offline versions

32
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.330 
and of course the cost. We could
not charge people for gaining

33
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.800 
life saving knowledge during an
emergency, so we decided this

34
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.140 
would be an open
and free platform.

35
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.560 
And that's exactly what we did. Together
with Hasso Plattner Institute, WHO,

36
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.040 
we launched the openWHO
platform in twenty seventeen.

37
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.300 
In just a couple of short years
we've had great success. We

38
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.670 
had more than one hundred thousand
learners on a platform by

39
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.490 
end of december twenty nineteen.
Our self paced courses were part

40
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.490 
of a bigger blended learning program
where we were helping key personnel,

41
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.650 
WHO staff, people in ministries
of health around the world,

42
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.260 
policy makers, logisticians, facility
managers, UN partners or front-line workers.

43
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.150 
We were helping them to get the
knowledge and the know-how they

44
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.480 
needed to work effectively,
efficiently, ethically and safely

45
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.300 
in any health emergency.

46
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.990 
Thousands of people took a course
on incident management system,

47
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.030 
yet many more thousands took courses
on our pandemic preparedness,

48
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.880 
risk communication and
capacity building courses. But

49
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.920 
as we had all feared, the next
pandemic is just a matter of time.

50
00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.260 
When my team heard about the new
virus that originated in China

51
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.320 
and that it had pandemic potential,
we sprang very quickly into action.

52
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.720 
We started developing courses that were aligned
with the global response strategy.

53
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.040 
We worked with HPI and we had to
adapt the platform to manage

54
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.610 
the increasing number
of learners.

55
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.140 
The thirtieth of January, just
a few weeks after we knew of

56
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.550 
the existence of the virus, we already
had the first causes on the platform.

57
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.690 
And in the last month I have
really watched with pride as

58
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.800 
WHO, the openWHO

59
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.830 
learning platform met and passed
its biggest stress test ever.

60
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.110 
Just in the last nine months, by early
October our learner registrations

61
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.910 
had surpassed four point five
million from a modest one hundred

62
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.520 
thousand at the
beginning of the year.

63
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.660 
Today we offer more than one
hundred courses, many of them most

64
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.170 
of them in health emergencies but also
quite a significant number of them

65
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.110 
outside health emergencies, looking
at causes on aging antimicrobial

66
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.250 
resistance and
many more.

67
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.970 
We offer for the COVID response eighteen
topic areas, eighteen separate courses and

68
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.540 
we offer them in forty one
international UN languages

69
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.560 
as well as national
and local languages.

70
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.480 
Together with the language when
you compare the language courses

71
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.290 
we have actually one hundred
thirty three COVID courses.

72
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.970 
And we know who's taking these courses.
People who work in the response,

73
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.120 
healthcare workers, clinicians,
front-line responders, students, NGO

74
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.800 
personnel and people from other
professions including logisticians,

75
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.070 
hospital managers
and others.

76
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.150 
We continue to offer these courses in low
bandwidth and offline versions using our app.

77
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.060 
They are free of charge to learners
but the value is immense.

78
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.720 
They help save lives and they
help us prevent disease.

79
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:21.800 
They empower people to keep safe in this
unprecedented, massively disrupted global pandemic.

80
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.850 
So where does my story end?
What have we learned?

81
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.840 
We've learnt and I have learned about
the power of technology enhanced

82
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.420 
and technology enabled education.
Even during the stress and chaos

83
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.900 
of a pandemic, we can ensure
if we have the right thinking,

84
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.130 
the right design and the right platform.
Speed, accuracy, reach and impact.

85
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.850 
We have learned that great
partnerships like the one that we

86
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:57.320 
had with HPI are based on mutual
values and not commercial interests.

87
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.160 
They open us up to a world of
possibility, creativity, innovation

88
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.810 
and really impact
in people's lives.

89
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:12.110 
The openWHO platform has helped us
prove that knowledge, education, training

90
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.230 
are global public goods

91
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:20.060 
and now training is part and parcel of
WHO's international response

92
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.670 
to health emergencies.

93
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.870 
And I personally am even more
convinced about the commitment

94
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.330 
that we should have for
equity and access.

95
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.170 
Any person who needs life-saving
knowledge to protect the health,

96
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.530 
to protect the health of their
loved ones, to protect the health

97
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.060 
of their countries of the world
should have access to that.

98
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:49.330 
So that's my little story about
HPI and WHO and how we helped

99
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.640 
to change the world.

100
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.990 
I see for the future a world where we
can continue to harness technology

101
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.710 
and learning science,

102
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:06.570 
to do good. I see technology
enhance and enable education,

103
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.610 
fueled by wonderful
partnerships like the one

104
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.240 
we have between
HPI and WHO.

105
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:19.290 
If used properly and ethically we can
create high quality education

106
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:25.300 
in help for all, so that we can contribute
meaningfully through education and training

107
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.190 
to achieve global and national health goals,
so that we can also protect ourselves

108
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.420 
and the health of
our loved ones.

109
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:38.820 
So my last words to you are, the
pandemic is by no means over

110
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.680 
and I really want
you to stay safe.

111
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.390 
I want you to follow all health
advice, not one, not two things,

112
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.740 
but do everything you
are asked to do.

113
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.290 
Even if you yourself are
feeling safe and healthy,

114
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.790 
remember your generosity in adopting
protected behaviors would

115
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.840 
protect others around
you. Stay safe,

116
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.320 
stay strong and continue your
lifelong learning. If you want

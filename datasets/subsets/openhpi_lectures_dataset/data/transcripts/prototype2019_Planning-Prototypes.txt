00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.910 
Hi folks! In this video we talk
about how to plan your prototype.

2
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.780 
We already mentioned that
prototyping is all about getting

3
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.470 
into the mood for building
and not overthinking,

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.540 
but sometimes you need to do some
planning anyways and we will

5
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.030 
explain why. - You can build prototypes
for idea development, prototypes

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.680 
for communication, and
prototypes for learning.

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.080 
So if we build prototypes
for idea development,

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.630 
your goal is to flesh out a general
idea into a more tangible

9
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.630 
solution. So when you
build in your team

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.600 
you can explore different ideas
because you bring them to life.

11
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.350 
And while you build you'll have
a hundred of new ideas of how

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.280 
to adapt the prototype. - If you
prototype for communication, your

13
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.980 
goal is to align the idea
vision of your team.

14
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.340 
Often you think you're talking about
the same thing, but afterwards

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.190 
you figure out that actually
everyone had a different idea

16
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.890 
in their own mind. The
goal might also be

17
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.470 
to communicate your idea to
a partner or stakeholder,

18
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.870 
and here prototype is much more
visible and interactive than

19
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.500 
a written description or even a
sketch. If a picture is worth

20
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.860 
a thousand words, then a prototype
is worth ten thousand words.

21
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.350 
So for both of these types
of prototyping, for

22
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.850 
communication and idea
development, it's

23
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
okay to jump into action right
away, it's actually good.

24
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.570 
If you build for learning, it
will take some more time that

25
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.030 
you will have to spend on
planning for your prototype.

26
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.570 
So there are two aspects that you
need to consider, the testing

27
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.010 
assumption and the user
interaction, when you test your

28
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.980 
prototype. - If you build a prototype
for learning, make sure that

29
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.670 
this prototype helps
you to answer your

30
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.310 
assumption. In design thinking we
discover a real user need and

31
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.620 
then we develop a solution for
this need. And while we develop

32
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.330 
this solution, new assumptions
and hypotheses come into play.

33
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.730 
This is perfectly normal: you
rely on them to be creative,

34
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.260 
but a prototype for learning, for
testing allows you to check

35
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.450 
these new assumptions.

36
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.700 
So when you start you need to ask
yourself what is the assumption

37
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.800 
that I want to test with the
prototype? This could be things

38
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.120 
like 'does my prototype tackle
the user need that I'm trying

39
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.320 
to solve with it?' Or 'does my
user understand the prototype?'

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.950 
It could also be, 'is it
fun to use my prototype?'

41
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.070 
When you start you probably
have several assumptions, but

42
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.420 
for keeping things simple we
would like to focus on only one

43
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.260 
for this course. So in the beginning,
pick the one that you're most

44
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.410 
curious to learn more about. -
When you prototype for learning,

45
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.630 
make sure that your prototype
answers the assumption that you

46
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.060 
have. So imagine your solution is
a smartphone for elderly people

47
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.380 
and your assumption is that a
very basic interface with big

48
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.360 
symbols will help them to navigate
through the smartphone.

49
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.150 
So to check your assumption here
you could build a paper mockup

50
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.170 
which shows these different
aspects on the screens.

51
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.080 
Then you could invite some
elderly people as testers,

52
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
watch them test your paper
mockup and listen to them.

53
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.440 
The difference between an idea and a prototype is
that people can actually interact with a prototype.

54
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.980 
The more interactive
your prototype will be

55
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.160 
the more explicit your learning
will be from it, so you

56
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.400 
can observe how the tester
interacts with the prototype, you

57
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.510 
can note their reactions, you will
find out what's clear about

58
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.770 
it, what's unclear about it, and
maybe also some features that

59
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.340 
you overlooked. - Here you see a
storyboard prototype of a service.

60
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.030 
The idea of the service is a
restaurant that changes its setting

61
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.500 
to the favourite historical
epoch of the user,

62
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.080 
so it offers an
extraordinary experience.

63
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.670 
Now here's a photo of a team
that did a role-play prototype

64
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.440 
for this. They acted out the
experience for the testers and

65
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.790 
collected their feedback. Do you
see how the role-play is much

66
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.990 
more interactive than the storyboard?
Testers actually had an

67
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.290 
experience of the idea. If you
use a storyboard as a prototype

68
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.360 
you can only ASK testers what
they would do with your idea

69
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.020 
and their answer would always
be a bit speculative.

70
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.820 
If you build an actual mockup
or a role-play for a product

71
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.000 
or service idea then you can
watch the testers INTERACT with

72
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.180 
your idea and the feedback you get
will always be more valuable.

73
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.260 
Of course sometimes if you
want to explain an extremely

74
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.780 
complex process or you want to
quickly run an idea by a friend

75
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.540 
or colleague, then a storyboard
might be the quickest and easiest

76
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.840 
prototype to build, but
you will always get more

77
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.860 
helpful learning from an
interactive prototype.

78
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.870 
As you see, planning is part of
prototyping, but don't get stuck

79
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.350 
on it. It might help you to set
yourself a time limit here.

80
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.940 
And remember that one of the
most important strengths about

81
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.840 
prototyping is that you actually
stop overthinking and start

82
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.640 
building things. So let's just
start building, try things out

83
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.940 
and let's learn
together!

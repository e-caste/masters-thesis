00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.090 
Welcome to the third week of
our openhpi course "A Half

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.430 
Century of Internet:
How it Works Today".

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.320 
In this week we want to discuss
the idea of internetworking -

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.660 
the search for the
one network.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.680 
We have become acquainted with various
network types and technologies last week

6
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.000 
and each of this
network technologies

7
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.190 
is fundamentally different from
the other one. They are in most

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.940 
cases incompatible with each other. So
the question is how one can organize to

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.270 
interconnect all these different
network technologies and to provide

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590 
one homogeneous
network.

11
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.900 
The network technologies they
differ in many characteristics.

12
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.510 
They differ in the specific
transmission media, they differ in

13
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.700 
the performance parameters
and control mechanisms,

14
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.060 
they differ in the formats such as
address schemes and packet formats

15
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.670 
and each network technology has its
advantages for some special use cases

16
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.180 
and has disadvantages when it's
used in another use case.

17
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.320 
So there is not the network
technology that fits all.

18
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.040 
For that reason there are different
networks and creating the internet

19
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.250 
we have to discuss how we can
connect this different networks

20
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.760 
to together and how we can organize
a level and unified level

21
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.280 
of the network technology level to
provide this homogeneous internet.

22
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.840 
We have already discussed the idea
of linking different internetworks

23
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.610 
when we discussed about
wide area networks.

24
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.280 
The different networks can be
connected bye intermediate systems.

25
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.880 
That could be router
or another device

26
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.560 
which creates a coherent
communication system by translating

27
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.700 
the different communication protocols
between the different networks.

28
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.840 
And this
technology, this

29
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.280 
translation technology of different
communication technologies and protocols

30
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.860 
this is called
internetworking.

31
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.810 
Internetworking is a concept for merging
heterogenous computer networks

32
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.380 
into one uniform communication
system and the internet

33
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.010 
is the merging of different networks
with different network technologies

34
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.370 
into one network. It is a virtual
network because in fact

35
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.930 
it is an interconnection of different
networks but for the user

36
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.030 
it feels like one
homogeneous network.

37
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.930 
The idea of linking different
networks together is organized

38
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.800 
in the following way. We have our network
in this case it's the home network

39
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.120 
a small home network that is
connected by means of a router

40
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.650 
via the telephone line with an internet
service provider. Internet service provider

41
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.780 
who is connected with other
internet service providers who

42
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.070 
are who help to connect other
networks to each other. So in this

43
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:57.370 
way we got a huge network consisting of
different networks that are interconnected

44
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.980 
by the means of internet server
uh service providers and

45
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.850 
the important tools here is,
important tools for this

46
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.070 
interconnection are the routers
on each side of each network.

47
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.510 
Kind of challenges have to be solved
if one wants to provide the one

48
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.300 
virtual network in this
interconnected tool.

49
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.260 
The big question which have to
be solved is how do we mediate

50
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.890 
between the different network technologies,
how this translation is organized?

51
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.440 
What do uniform packet formats
in address schemes look like

52
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.050 
that are understood
for all the networks?

53
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:57.120 
Then we have to provide solutions on how
data packets find their destination

54
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.700 
in such a network of
heterogeneous networks.

55
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.380 
We have to answer the question how
the packet routes are calculated.

56
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.540 
How does packet switch the router
gets this ability for finding

57
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.300 
the pass for a packet?

58
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.220 
How error free communication is
organised and guaranteed because

59
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.070 
each network comes with own each of the
internetwork interconnected networks

60
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.940 
comes with own technologies? How the
transmission errors are avoided or overcome?

61
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.490 
How traffic jams and overload situations
are avoided? You see there is a

62
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.650 
long list of questions that
have to be answered.

63
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.210 
So the internetworking technology
provides such answers

64
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.740 
to all those question and we in this
week want to have a closer look to it.

65
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.810 
So the internet is a network
of computer networks.

66
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.680 
An internet is a network of computer
networks and the internet is the worldwide

67
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.580 
connection of diverse computer
networks which appear to us,

68
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.570 
which appeared to the user as
unified communication network

69
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.890 
thanks to the network
technology.

70
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.460 
Network technologies or the core there
are so called internet protocol stack

71
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.230 
above the

72
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.940 
technology layer, the technology layer
that comes with different networks

73
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:41.870 
and this internet protocol stack makes the
network the connected network appear

74
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.570 
as a logically seamless
communication system.

75
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.430 
So we have to consider internet protocols, we
have to consider internet protocol stacks

76
00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.410 
and the one which is used in practice
is a TCP/IP protocol stack.

77
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.160 
The internet itself it is an
open system architecture.

78
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:13.420 
Everyone knows exactly how the internet
is working and how it's composed

79
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.430 
and certainly this is
a reason for the

80
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.200 
explosive growth of the internet. Sixty
nine it starts with four computers

81
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.020 
at universities and now estimated
around twenty billion websites,

82
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.980 
one billion internet hosts in the domain
name system, four billion internet users.

83
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:40.880 
So meanwhile it's a huge network, it's
a basic communication infrastructure

84
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.380 
of our modern world.

00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:09.000 
Hi, my name is Jan Koch.

2
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.870 
I’ve been part of the D-School faculty for the last eight years

3
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:14.440 
and worked together with students as well as professionals

4
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:17.130 
on their individual design thinking projects and initiatives.

5
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:19.400 
Today I'd like to share with you a little tool

6
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:20.390 
that might be of help

7
00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:23.110 
when it comes to diving into the interview phase

8
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.300 
during your empathy work.

9
00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:26.220 
I've experienced professionals

10
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.160 
as well as students doing amazing jobs

11
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.970 
when it came to testing their prototypes,

12
00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:32.300 
but the same people struggled in the very beginning

13
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:35.060 
when it was all about conducting interviews to gain empathy.

14
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:37.880 
If you think about those two situations,

15
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.480 
what differentiates them is for the testing interviews,

16
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.710 
people were able to bring along their prototype

17
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:44.160 
for their idea or their concept.

18
00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:46.140 
People could interact with the prototype

19
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:48.860 
and could give feedback accordingly to what they like,

20
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:50.180 
and what they didn't like so much.

21
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:51.790 
Wouldn't it be great

22
00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:53.380 
if we could create something similar,

23
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:55.470 
a little prototype that would work as a conversation

24
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:57.970 
starter from the very first interview that we conduct?

25
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.580 
This is what I'd like to talk to you about today

26
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:01.940 
and give you one little example.

27
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:03.820 
So say we want to learn more

28
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:06.470 
about the topic of how trust is established

29
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:08.250 
and how people decide on whom to trust.

30
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:10.660 
If you think about this question, it is

31
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:12.170 
probably one of those questions

32
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.200 
where you need a minute before you could answer this.

33
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:16.670 
So how could we best support our interviewees

34
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:18.930 
to structure their thoughts without influencing their answer?

35
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.410 
I created a little card deck

36
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:22.280 
for this purpose

37
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:24.690 
that I could easily bring with me to the next interview.

38
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:27.080 
It consists of a range of professions

39
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:28.650 
that I could present to the participants.

40
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:31.950 
It starts with people who are very much

41
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.340 
related to the topic of trust,

42
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:34.090 
like a policeman,

43
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:36.500 
and goes all the way up to professions

44
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.150 
that are up to interpretation from the interviewee’s side,

45
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:42.230 
like an astronaut or a gardener. In the very beginning,

46
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:44.860 
I would ask people to spread those cards out on the table,

47
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:46.650 
and start forming a line for me,

48
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:48.120 
beginning from the profession

49
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:50.870 
they are very much trusting up to the profession

50
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:51.550 
they would trust

51
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:54.100 
the least. I would ask people to think aloud

52
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:55.590 
and share with me their thoughts

53
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:57.220 
on how they process the card deck.

54
00:01:57.881 --> 00:01:59.570 
Once this line is established,

55
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:01.350 
I could dive into more detail

56
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:03.640 
on what in particular made this profession

57
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:05.510 
trustworthy and up to the other

58
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:06.430 
end of the range,

59
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:07.910 
what makes this profession

60
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:09.590 
the least trustworthy in their opinion.

61
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:11.160 
I could also have people

62
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.140 
contrast individual cards and select

63
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:15.710 
what makes a gardener way more trustworthy in your opinion

64
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:16.610 
than for instance

65
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:18.890 
a professor? At any given moment

66
00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:20.520 
I could dive deeper into aspects

67
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:23.410 
that the participants bring up and that I find interesting.

68
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:26.070 
Also, if the conversations starts running dry,

69
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:28.390 
I could easily revert back to this structure

70
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:30.870 
and pick another starting point to dive deep again.

71
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:32.930 
Conversation

72
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:36.560 
starters are a great way to help people not only structure

73
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:39.000 
their thoughts, but also to learn along with them.

74
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.370 
So it's not only that we are learning about their opinion,

75
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:43.150 
but it's also that together with them

76
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:45.690 
we retrace how those opinions came to being.

77
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.910 
Therefore they are also of great help when

78
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.370 
it later comes to the synthesis phase.

79
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:51.210 
You can also feel

80
00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:53.670 
very much invited to adapt this tool to your individual

81
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:54.650 
needs and purposes.

82
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:55.420 
So for instance,

83
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:56.730 
to stick with my example,

84
00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:58.570 
I could think of a second card deck,

85
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.530 
that would have individual prompts for things

86
00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:02.090 
that people can trust others with,

87
00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:04.110 
say like access to your smart phone,

88
00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:05.540 
or the key to your apartment.

89
00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:08.710 
Whom would you trust with that? Conversation

90
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.280 
starters should be playful,

91
00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:11.640 
engaging, interactive.

92
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:12.630 
But most of all,

93
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:14.090 
they are considered to be a helpful

94
00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:16.560 
hand for the participants to structure their thoughts.

95
00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:19.120 
We want to learn about their point of view

96
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:21.440 
and not only confirmation about our own opinions,

97
00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:24.460 
so therefore you might want to be careful with what materials

98
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:25.410 
you bring to the interview

99
00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:27.330 
so that you don't subtly influence

100
00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:29.690 
other people's response to your questions.

101
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.040 
With that said,

102
00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:33.110 
I wish you best of luck for your ongoing research,

103
00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:35.880 
and please feel free to post your comments, questions,

104
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:37.650 
or even examples of conversations

105
00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:38.590 
starters that you create

106
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.460 
for your individual fields of research

107
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:41.880 
in the forum to exchange

108
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:43.270 
and get feedback from classmates.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.730 
Hey, it's cool that you came
today for testing and

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.500 
I hope you had a good start in
the day! - Yeah, I already went

3
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.340 
for a run actually in the morning
and then I came straight

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.740 
here for the test. - Oh
wow! That's ambitious.

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.570 
So I want to test today
an idea that I've been

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.870 
working on. It's still a
rough prototype that

7
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.700 
I will test with you and it
is connected to sport so

8
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.060 
this is why I also picked
you as a tester.

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.900 
And I want you to think out loud
and say anything that comes

10
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.120 
to your mind. I'm curious about
your personal opinions, so honest

11
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.330 
feedback is very much appreciated
and you need to know there

12
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.170 
are no right or wrong answers.
So you don't need to overthink

13
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.000 
what you're telling me or
not. I'll also be taking

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
some notes, this is just easier
for me to recap later what we've

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.800 
been talking about. - I'm alright with that.
- Okay! Perfect. So I would just start

16
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.940 
by giving the prototype to you.
So it's not a programmed app

17
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.390 
but it works like a real app:
so when you click something

18
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.930 
you get somewhere. - So
I use my imagination.

19
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.090 
Okay! Welcome to SportsBuddy! Okay,
now I think... okay, SportsBuddy,

20
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.830 
yeah maybe, maybe it has something
to do with buddying up for

21
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.940 
sport. But I don't know yet.
I just hit this button now.

22
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.010 
So who do you pick as your
SportsBuddy? Okay, my thought

23
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.340 
maybe was right, and then I can
access my contact list. Okay,

24
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.290 
it's another button. So I
think it's going to lead

25
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.540 
me to select some people
to partner up with.

26
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.570 
Okay, I hit the
button now.

27
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.380 
Okay, and here we need to do
this a little together because

28
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.210 
I don't know which contacts
are in your phone book.

29
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.950 
So it would be great if you
named two or three people

30
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.700 
that are in your telephone book
- Okay, yeah, sure. Chris.

31
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.130 
Um, Miriam. And Paul.

32
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.450 
Okay neat! So now I see some kind
of check boxes to the left,

33
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.740 
so I suppose I would just select
my friends now, who I want

34
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.460 
to do spots with. I would
select Chris, Miriam, and

35
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.970 
Paul, because I like them all. Okay,
now once I have selected them

36
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.280 
I would wish to continue but
I don't see any continue

37
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.900 
button. So now I'm thinking
about how to proceed here.

38
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.230 
Okay so yeah I realised
I forgot this.

39
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.010 
But if you imagine it's
there we would just go to

40
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.830 
the next page. - Okay, and maybe
we just use swipe or something.

41
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.300 
Okay, yeah, if you like that
we can use swipe! Perfect.

42
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.030 
So it looks like some kind of wizard.
So we just swipe to the left now.

43
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.210 
Okay and when we go to the
next page and I need to

44
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.930 
tell you that the feature to
invite all your friends is not

45
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.380 
available yet. I haven't fully
thought this idea through yet

46
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.030 
so this is something I'll
take into consideration

47
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.360 
definitely, but yeah we'll just
continue with one person

48
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.990 
because at the moment...
I'm sorry! - Fine for me.

49
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.960 
Okay, now I see 'invitation
sent'. So i've selected Chris

50
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.760 
as my only person and now he gets
some kind of message probably.

51
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.510 
I'm still wondering how he gets
it. Like is it an email?

52
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.390 
Or is it WhatsApp? Or is it
an SMS? Or maybe he has the

53
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.530 
same app and gets some
push notification?

54
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.540 
Yeah I would
think that now.

55
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.480 
What would you like here? -
I think once Chris isn't

56
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.850 
using this app yet, probably some kind
of WhatsApp message would be nice

57
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.070 
just to get him an instant
message. Yeah, and once he

58
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.340 
has the app maybe a push
notification for him.

59
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.500 
Yeah and then I know it has sent
the invitation and I swipe

60
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.770 
again probably. Okay, now I see this
watch, maybe it tells me that

61
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.590 
time goes by or I have
to wait. Yeah? Okay.

62
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.520 
Okay, now I see 'Yes! invitation accepted'.
Okay, so there's no name here,

63
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.550 
so I would probably wish for having
'Invitation accepted by Chris',

64
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.420 
or 'Chris wants to do sports with
you' would be nice as well.

65
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.660 
But I like this little image because
it's just a bit motivating,

66
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.950 
you know? - Yeah!

67
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.440 
Okay nice! So now
probably I swipe again.

68
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.680 
Okay, 'plan your workout'! Ok now
I see some some red spots here,

69
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.960 
probably Chris has put in his
information when he is going to

70
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.390 
do sports. Maybe I would
wish for his name.

71
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.190 
Again, just to know, and maybe
if I have more friends in this

72
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.810 
app that I can distinguish
them as well.

73
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.900 
Uh okay! Now I can touch
here and here and here.

74
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.910 
Okay, now I said Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday for my sport

75
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.110 
dates and I have one overlapping
day on Tuesday with Chris.

76
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.550 
So I think now I could partner up
with Chris on Tuesday for sports

77
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.810 
actually. - How would
you imagine this to

78
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.430 
happen or work? - So once I
select the same time frame

79
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.590 
as Chris does, he will get
another notification

80
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.550 
that we can partner up now
and then we can basically

81
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.360 
just both check in, and
then go. - Okay nice.

82
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.660 
I hit continue here. - Okay,
and then it's kind of,

83
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.140 
just before you have your
appointment coming up,

84
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.070 
and this pops up. - So I get a
push notification 'Your friend

85
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.540 
is ready for sports, how about you?'
Okay nice. Okay, what I'm missing

86
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.000 
here is probably who
is ready for sports?

87
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.060 
And at which time as well,
because I need to know that.

88
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.900 
Just to get it quick. And
I just get an idea now

89
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.520 
because I'm using this sports
flatrate app for Berlin,

90
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.840 
so I can go to all the sport
studios just with one app

91
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.690 
and maybe we could even
link to this app

92
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.730 
and put Chris in
there as well,

93
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.230 
so we can choose the
same studios to go to.

94
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:24.090 
Okay! Interesting.
Perfect. So thank you.

95
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.090 
So that's how far
my idea has come.

96
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.270 
Just in the end I would like to
know is there is anything else

97
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.460 
you want to comment on,
something you want to share?

98
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.910 
I think as I said it would be
nice to partner with multiple

99
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.200 
friends and maybe to link it to
my other sports planning apps.

100
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.750 
And I really like that I can do stuff
together with my friends here.

101
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.470 
Because sports, it's usually,
you have to organize it

102
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.750 
and you need time and everything.
- Yeah! - But that's super nice!

103
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:03.880 
And um yeah! So far! - Great,
thanks for your very honest

104
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.990 
and detailed feedback. This will
really help me to move forward

105
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.920 
with this. And if you're
interested I can let you know

106
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.220 
about the new version in a couple of weeks
so we can test again. - Definitely!

107
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.020 
Yeah so it was great.
- Yeah thanks!

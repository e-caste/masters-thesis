00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680 
Hello and welcome to our quantum
session. I'd like to show you the

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.200 
quantum experience
platform which is the

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.070 
official development platform,
quantum platform from IBM. If

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.640 
you tell in your browser IBMQ,
IBM quantum, you will

5
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.070 
come to quantum start here page
and in this portal you can find

6
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.050 
a lot of information about the
researchers, for educators,

7
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.120 
for business, for developers,
for everything.

8
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.270 
So let us launch the
quantum experience.

9
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.140 
Now you get the
graphical user interface

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.590 
where you can see the
different types of information.

11
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.450 
On the right hand side you can
see the backends. Backends are

12
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.850 
really quantum computers that
are available right now

13
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.600 
to do your test, to run your programs. You
can see here for example Santiago, London,

14
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.270 
Vigo, Valencia and so on. It
doesn't mean that this quantum

15
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.410 
computer is placed in the
city, it is just the name.

16
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.240 
Let us have a
look in

17
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.140 
some of them. For
example, now we go to

18
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.820 
Melbourne computer and you
can see here sixteen qubits.

19
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
Therefore melbourne-sixteen. So you can
see here the topology of the qubits.

20
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.660 
You can see the topology is
quasi linear but with

21
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.000 
connections from qubits to each
other. So now the colour code is

22
00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:04.250 
the green, which means that
it has the better error rate

23
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.060 
than the blue one. And you can see here
the single qubit U2 error rate,

24
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.690 
you can see here, 5.4 to
the power minus four

25
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.980 
and here, to
power minus three.

26
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.480 
That means the transpiler
of your program will prefer

27
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.400 
to run your program, will prefer
this high qualitative qubits

28
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.110 
but in principle you also can
select the qubits where you want

29
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.650 
to run your program. Here
you can see CNOT error rate.

30
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:57.160 
It is for entangled qubits.
So the error rate is

31
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.460 
significantly bigger
than with single qubits

32
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.120 
and you can see that for entanglement
the best choice is the

33
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.850 
qubits that have

34
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.580 
not a lot of neighbors, just two
neighbors. This is the best choice,

35
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.570 
for example, qubit zero and qubit
thirteen or ten, so that there

36
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.050 
was a case for entanglement
because you see the error

37
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.130 
rate is very very high here,
just to power minus two.

38
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.300 
Okay, on the left
hand side

39
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:55.740 
you can create the composer. The
composer is a very good tool to

40
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.230 
play around with your first
quantum algorithms, very simple

41
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.930 
quantum programs, very simple
programs. What we can see here?

42
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.140 
In the top you see them
operators or gates, yes,

43
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.280 
that is like a classical
computer, add, move and so on.

44
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:25.160 
Further you see the
qubits, q0, q1, q2

45
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.180 
and add more qubits
and c3 is

46
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:39.080 
classical register where we will
read out the results from our qubits.

47
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.170 
In the bottom part you see
the measurement probabilities,

48
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.830 
that is the predict which
probability we will have

49
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.890 
and on the right hand side
you can see the state vector.

50
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.500 
We will see right now
what state vector is.

51
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
Let us try first. So the very
simple program on the quantum

52
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.570 
computer is do nothing, which is
the same as a classical computer.

53
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.230 
And do nothing means you just
measure what you have right now

54
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.180 
and the measurement operator
is that here you just

55
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:23.700 
drop here to the fifth qubit q0

56
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.940 
and you can see the measurement
probability is just zero.

57
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.500 
The state vector is also zero.
So the qubit is initiated

58
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.500 
from the very beginning with q0 and
we have measured also on the 0.

59
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.660 
Okay, let us try to play around
with that. I take the

60
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.940 
hadamard operator and hadamard operator
or haramard gate, this is the gate which

61
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.020 
brings the qubit in the
superposition, between zero and one,

62
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.750 
the superposition between zero and one. So
now you can see after the measurement,

63
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:18.000 
we can get the results of
one and result of null, of

64
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:27.800 
zero to fifty percentage,
each of them. Yes, we have

65
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.630 
to read from right to left and the
qubit 0 is on the right hand side,

66
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.720 
you see one and zero. Ok now
the state vector. State vector is

67
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.240 
so called it represents so
called quantum tomographies, that

68
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.740 
means it is the status before
measurement that really what

69
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.160 
the status has the qubit
right now and state vector is

70
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:07.140 
more or less the amplitude of this
wave functions of the qubit

71
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:13.540 
and if you square the state vector
you will get the probability.

72
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.470 
Okay, let us do more complex.
We take also the next qubit

73
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.110 
in our game and I place here
the entanglement operator.

74
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:32.700 
Sorry entanglement operator. Okay,
now the qubits q0 and q1

75
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:38.690 
are entangled to each other and we
have to measure the whole system.

76
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:46.180 
So now you see, you will get
the two possible states. Either

77
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.050 
both of them are in zero or both
of them are in one. You see,

78
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.450 
one one zero zero. Why? Because
the rule for entanglement is if

79
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:01.150 
the control bit and control bit is
q0 in this case, if it is zero

80
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:07.530 
then nothing happens to the
target bit, it is q1, and if

81
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:13.690 
the q0 is one then the
q1 will be swapped.

82
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.260 
So with this rule we have an
entanglement and as you can see

83
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.380 
only two combinations are possible.
Either both of them are in

84
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.440 
zero or both of
them are in one.

85
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.080 
There is no possible combination
zero one and one zero and

86
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.510 
this is very important for
quantum computation. Why?

87
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:43.210 
because if we manipulate just one qubit
from the entangled quantum system

88
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.960 
then all the qubits will be also
manipulated with that and

89
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.900 
that is the property that only in a
microvolt and quantum volt is possible.

90
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.540 
You cannot do the same on the classical
computer, only through simulation.

91
00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:06.310 
So, and if we get another qubit to
our system, the third one like this,

92
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.640 
we will get more complex system.
It is called also entangled

93
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.040 
GHZ that system that is the short
of the name of the inventors of

94
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:25.160 
this systems. Okay, and now let us
run this program. Again what

95
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.090 
we see in the measurement probability and
state vector that suggest predictions

96
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.260 
just for our give us the
feeling what will happen if we

97
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.370 
run the program, but let
us now run this program.

98
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.900 
To do so we can have a look
around settings. You can see

99
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.020 
here the program will be run on the
simulator but in principle we can

100
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:55.790 
here make a choice of each, of
really quantum computer that is

101
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.260 
available right now. So our back-end we can
select here. I would take this simulator

102
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.700 
and then this shots or
shot number that means

103
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.140 
how many times the quantum
experiment will be done, will be

104
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.200 
repeated. It is very important
because when we run the quantum

105
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:25.020 
experiment just once, we get only one probability.
But we need the probability distribution

106
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:32.560 
so that to see where our
solution is placed or

107
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.090 
situated with most probability.
So therefore we need to run

108
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:42.100 
the program many times. Okay, the
default is about a thousand times.

109
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.270 
Okay, so now I will start
the run on the simulator

110
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.340 
and you see, here
on this picture,

111
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:58.250 
we have fifty fifty result, or
exactly fifty fifty. It will

112
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.930 
never happen on the real quantum
computer and simulator take

113
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.920 
this also into account.

114
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.860 
Their job is completed.

115
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.340 
Now if we click on this job,
you will see now the results.

116
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.150 
You see there everything
is completed.

117
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:25.700 
Okay and in this time you
see fifty percent-fifty percent,

118
00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.840 
one-one and
zero-zero.

119
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:34.260 
And this is the circuit that
we have created. Maybe, you

120
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.990 
know, maybe the problem is that I have
not placed their measurement operator

121
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:47.040 
here. It may happen, okay. Let
us repeat that.

122
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:52.960 
Okay, our job is running
now, it is completed.

123
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:03.900 
I have to say the measurement
operator after each qubit

124
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.590 
that is in our quantum system. So now
you see the real results that

125
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.820 
one one one and zero zero zero are
only possible states because

126
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.510 
the system is entangled. And
you see that zero zero zero is

127
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.270 
forty eight percent and one
one one is fifty one percent.

128
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:33.640 
Yeah, and this is the one correct
saved here. Okay, and the last thing is

129
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:40.290 
if you have a look here into the
code then you see the first

130
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.900 
assemble code

131
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:52.020 
for this program, that means
if you drag and drop something

132
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:59.150 
on your graphical interface, the quantum
assembly code will be written automatically.

133
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.950 
Okay, and you can go from here
immediately to quantum lab,

134
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:15.420 
where you can walk with jupiter notebooks
with Qiskit. And with Qiskit,

135
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.800 
my colleague Johannes will tell to
you. Thank you very much for

136
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.390 
your attention.

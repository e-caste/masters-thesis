1
00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.950 
Yes, I would like to welcome you.

2
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:30.030 
Finally a lecture hall where you can look into faces again, because those were bad times, of course we have lecture

3
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.750 
continued.

4
00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:39.680 
At the very worst times the lecture theatre was empty, and that's strange, Because of course when you're talking, in interaction

5
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.329 
you have to look in the eyes, it's difficult.

6
00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.310 
With the crowds you weren't, do people look at you smiling or are they quite horrified by what you say?

7
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.950 
So we're glad it worked out, and we're glad that you accepted the, that you accepted the invitation.

8
00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:03.530 
I would like to welcome State Secretary Franziska Doktor Franziska Brantner from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

9
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.079 
and Climate I would like to welcome

10
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:15.840 
Prof Dirk Messner, President of the Umweltbundesamtes, of the Umweltbundesamtes so only

11
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:28.069 
and Mr Oliver SÃ¼hne, the Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Ecco Association and Dr Bernhard Rohleder, Managing Director

12
00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.439 
of Bitkom, we want to

13
00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:43.900 
think about clean IT and see what computer science, what digital technologies have to do with climate issues, I know

14
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.930 
you have to do the arrow to point to this little person.

15
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:58.120 
So, I think we are facing the challenges of digital transformation in our society.

16
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.789 
many people say that the he has been talking about digitalisation for ages, it's old-fashioned, but what does that mean?

17
00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:11.460 
our society in all areas, I think we will find out yet and that are many profound changes.

18
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.150 
than we have now in the first year.

19
00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:23.599 
That's one side of the challenge that humanity faces, this overcoming and when we have these big SDGs

20
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:32.139 
that is the Sustainable Development Goals so the ones set by the UN as development goals, challenges,

21
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.710 
that humanity is facing, these are the 17, they can see them.

22
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:46.710 
Then it is the case that for almost all of these goals, digitisation offers an indispensable tool.

23
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:57.960 
So to achieve those definitely of the 17, 13 will not be achieved without the IT technologies without the digitalisation

24
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.650 
progress.

25
00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.620 
And that, of course, is a challenge.

26
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.319 
It's not on one side that the technologies are developing.

27
00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:15.550 
We see that it offers quite great opportunities and to do things that are really essential to do, education,

28
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.250 
fight against poverty, improve health and all these issues.

29
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:31.170 
And by the way, HPI joined an initiative so that the Universities have such a dashboard, where on the individual objectives

30
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.850 
the activities at which that university contributes.

31
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.319 
And you can see from the colouring how strong that is, and of course that's to make visible a little bit on insight what it's

32
00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:54.560 
activities that are being carried out here at this university in the sense of achieving the goals.

33
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.949 
will see.

34
00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.560 
That's quite good with us already with the colouring, that's what I said.

35
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.019 
Great challenges, digitalisation, great opportunities, but now this is coming.

36
00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:15.050 
But digitisation itself of course has huge impacts on the environment, on the climate, on global warming.

37
00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.560 
The CO2 footprint of digitalisation is twice as big.

38
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.300 
Today is twice as large as the CO2 footprint of all air travel of global air travel.

39
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.680 
And they are always considered a bit evil not.

40
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.279 
Then he came up with terms like flight shaming.

41
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.689 
So we are very worried that there will be something like digitalisation, shame in the discussion, because digitalisation will be

42
00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.149 
is an indispensable tool for many issues in our society.

43
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.209 
But we have to keep an eye on that, and what is happening is not that we can lie back contentedly and that

44
00:05:55.209 --> 00:06:00.149 
digitisation is the way it is now, but that it is exploding.

45
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:09.009 
You see, just now we were talking about gigabytes and work, soon it will be Petabyte, Exarbytes, Zetabytes not imaginable anyway.

46
00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:18.540 
I don't know what new data will be generated and brought in the next few years through this digitalisation, but here are two

47
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:28.550 
also very concrete figures, AI yes, on everyone's lips and great expectations of what can be achieved with AI in all areas of life

48
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:37.050 
so one anyway with the modern technology that is now in development, in research.

49
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:44.529 
If I train such an AI model, then you know, these are the ones that the Deep Learning.

50
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:53.730 
These are such neuronal networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes and connection neurons, where very simple computational tasks

51
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.750 
are executed.

52
00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:02.420 
And when you train them, when you show them a million pictures and always explain what it is to see on the picture and then

53
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:10.279 
he shows them the unique and the first picture without explanation, then these networks already come around with good explanation

54
00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:18.980 
the corner, so partly better than humans in certain areas, which is quite difficult for machines.

55
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.629 
The meaning of an image for machines are, This will be thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of pixels, black

56
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:30.959 
yellow, green, and something, and from that now to make out an image and a content.

57
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:37.040 
This is a huge achievement that seems to come quite naturally to us, that we do every day, that we want to do this.

58
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:45.370 
the ones that radiate, the signals that arrive on the retina as in In pictures someone we see what it transpose

59
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:55.370 
so to train such an AI model requires the same amount of energy as 300 flights.

60
00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:09.279 
New York San Francisco with study 300 flights New York or five years in the life cycle of a car production, petrol, driving,

61
00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.350 
all that is produced there.

62
00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:20.540 
To train an AI model, that's a very complex model images later on you can always use that, but

63
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:27.129 
such trainings are quite essential and that is somehow obvious, that will not work with rolling out, if we do that

64
00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:27.610 
roll out.

65
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:37.090 
If we now assume that in every application, in every company there are now such AI models I'm going to be built in.

66
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:41.649 
then it goes completely wrong with climate and global warming.

67
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:48.460 
Second example Fortunately, word has already got around about the Bitcoin, which was a bit like this.

68
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.740 
a saviour, not

69
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.639 
Thing about later.

70
00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:59.750 
The less you understand the technology, the greater the expectation of what's solved, that's anyway, like

71
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:08.230 
Bitcoin is operated today is in a form that clearly cannot continue, namely with these block

72
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:14.039 
creation, which would then be recognised as worthy of trust by all, even those who do not trust each other?

73
00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:23.600 
Complex mathematical problems have to be solved with a huge energy demand and CO2 emissions of 22 million tonnes.

74
00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:32.340 
at this Bitkom mining and that's kind of the annual balance of a country again Jordan,

75
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:42.950 
so digital technologies, problem or solution, that's exactly what our clean-IT initiative is supposed to be about.

76
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.929 
not to give up and say it's too problematic.

77
00:09:46.929 --> 00:09:55.059 
Must look for something else, but just to see the weak point and to see the task what we can do in the

78
00:09:55.059 --> 00:10:03.669 
development of digital technologies in order to find the solutions that digital technologies can offer.

79
00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:10.649 
to solve the problems of mankind, i.e. CO2 emissions must be reduced.

80
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:19.429 
Small remark now you sometimes also hear from the very big tech giants that they are already climate neutral, that

81
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.750 
is of course a bit of window dressing.

82
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:27.549 
It's not they paid, they really only get green electricity, but there's only a certain amount of green electricity.

83
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.049 
If they use that, the others use the other electricity, because that's this mixture.

84
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.639 
So it's not that easy to solve the problem, then I can say here, I have made an effort, we have here

85
00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:45.769 
has also green electricity but is not comparable to tech giants and the consumption they have so it really has to be

86
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:49.909 
about making the IT systems and the software better.

87
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.629 
That's just the way it is.

88
00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:58.210 
Plattner, who with the founding of the Hasso Plattner Institute a good 20 years ago wanted to create the possibility to work in this

89
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.230 
field of digital technologies

90
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:10.549 
university centre of excellence to build up IT engineers to support this digitisation, this digital transformation.

91
00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:11.350 
to help shape it.

92
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:20.169 
And insofar we also see ourselves a bit in this duty to think about such issues, when others blame with

93
00:11:20.169 --> 00:11:23.649 
What have you done to our world, with your fucking digitalisation?

94
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:35.039 
So, we started this Clean IT initiative in Davos 2 20 just before we started with Corona.

95
00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:46.230 
There is, that sounds similar, a Green IT movement, that's older, that's like 15, 20 years old, and that's focusing

96
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:53.149 
on how to run data centres in a climate-friendly way.

97
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.649 
With the data centres it is mainly about what happens with the heat that can be used to the second and the like.

98
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:06.549 
but we are asking deeper and more immediately what do the it systems themselves consume?

99
00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:12.679 
Not only we have to see how they are and have to try to make the framework good, but you can ask

100
00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:20.769 
not consider this more when developing complexes using software programmes of ki solutions?

101
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.350 
What about the energy requirement?

102
00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:33.720 
So the facets are as a university institute of course clearly to raise awareness would be to create it for

103
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:41.789 
this problem, especially the circle of people who can really do something about it, the IT developers,

104
00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:45.549 
the IT architects who are building this system.

105
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:55.409 
Second is the question if we don't develop models if we develop such blockchain activities if we develop software

106
00:12:55.409 --> 00:13:04.500 
programme in mind, what about the energy balance can't we achieve the same goal with

107
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:15.590 
a lower use of energy and what we want to propagate a little bit as a solution the topic of sustainability by

108
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:24.100 
design, so we don't build first and think about how to get it clean, but that's also an approach in the field of energy efficiency.

109
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.850 
of safety.

110
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:33.120 
Also pryvacy by design also because it is always very difficult to just modify the systems afterwards, so the T Mobile

111
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.649 
T with you are its biggest challenge.

112
00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:44.059 
If we now see such a software programme in development, that is not easy at all for the developer.

113
00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:53.190 
or possible to perceive the energy consumption of what he develops, software then runs on machines that need energy.

114
00:13:53.190 --> 00:14:03.340 
Operating systems Technologie stack and then at the top comes the application programme where a developer architect of the feel

115
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.049 
get it?

116
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.830 
Is that a good solution, a bad solution.

117
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:13.059 
That needs to be worked on, that is now we need measuring possibilities where you can try things out.

118
00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:16.909 
Say that is better why you can namely in algorithm.

119
00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:24.600 
To solve a problem there are many algorithms and so far they are looking at what it takes the fastest what it takes the least.

120
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.370 
memory.

121
00:14:25.379 --> 00:14:27.529 
The question What needs least

122
00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:34.210 
Energy has not been on the agenda at all so far and that is actually an equally justified an equally justified

123
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:39.250 
criterion for assessing which algorithm is good and solving the problem.

124
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:47.330 
There is the next stage The algorithm can be implemented in quite different programmes, Even there have

125
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:55.059 
we again have the whole world that the different implementations bring different energy requirements so the

126
00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:58.370 
is issue where we need to move forward in research.

127
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:04.860 
There is no conference that is dedicated to the topic, there is no scientific journal that is dedicated to the topic.

128
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:13.190 
that cares about it, that catches the scientific community, has to start to think about it and to take that into account in order to

129
00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:15.490 
move forward on that.

130
00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:22.110 
I'll give a small example this afternoon we'll show more and discuss more solutions, what you can really do concretely.

131
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.750 
can do.

132
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.149 
In my research group, the idea is that we want to address this issue with this network with the AI networks

133
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:40.789 
And there it is that the Deep Learning, the great AI technology, has brought AI back into the conversation in such a way that this is connected with this

134
00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:49.019 
huge networks that works in this neurons with 32 bit architectures there will be, so Convolution, a relatively simple

135
00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:55.580 
Operation multiply Whatever you what That's done on the basis of 32 bit architectures.

136
00:15:55.759 --> 00:16:03.500 
The question was Can't we just do it at the one bit level, and when you do that, directly do it without a big thinking

137
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:12.539 
If you do it directly without thinking about it, then you save a lot of energy, but the accuracy, that's the measure.

138
00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:21.389 
How good are they in their predictions, how good are they in the in the in the solution determination they are clearly worse

139
00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:30.860 
than those of the 32 bit architecture over 10% is this accurate heiz biz and the competition in developing such

140
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:38.350 
AI system is How accurate are you in your solutions answers so the question How can we work on this?

141
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:45.049 
So directly translate is not enough, but then there must be new architectures, new approaches to get that done.

142
00:16:45.049 --> 00:16:55.750 
At the moment we have made good progress, so 95 % energy demand and we are now only at 5 % loss.

143
00:16:55.759 --> 00:17:03.009 
On accuracy In some issues it's not that bad, but it has to get better somehow, that's the

144
00:17:03.009 --> 00:17:07.950 
Challenges in research, but also affects other topics How is that?

145
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:16.609 
Data storage is a very energy consuming process, data will continue to explode, rethink with each new application

146
00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:17.579 
Internet of Things.

147
00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:21.930 
If something like that comes, it's not going to be a multiplication, it's going to be an explosion.

148
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:29.079 
This exponential growth in data are how do we go around with that, how is that with data centres and cloud that are now

149
00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:36.390 
new this computing that once again things We're still talking about going to the cloud, but in the research always there

150
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:41.829 
thinking again, which parts you don't need to put in the cloud at all, but you can solve on-site much better

151
00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:48.440 
to then only give the results into the cloud, so that you can also do that in the end, for example, with Clients with small

152
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.259 
devices.

153
00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:54.019 
Smartphone or similar streaming is a big issue.

154
00:17:54.029 --> 00:18:00.900 
Of course, everyone in the world can watch their own movie version of the same movie seconds apart, but can you do that

155
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:07.579 
not make it smarter that I then wait five seconds and then somehow have it in the pool which is then streamed

156
00:18:07.579 --> 00:18:13.250 
that people are looking at at the same time, so that I don't have this amount of data huge amount of data at the same time

157
00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:14.119 
at the same time?

158
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:22.009 
At blockchain, a good technology is only in the form that it used to be, that is, how it was developed, there it is

159
00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:24.319 
too energy consuming and of course much more.

160
00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:31.980 
Especially if we think about the Internet of Things, so this Clean IT initiative was such an idea, so that bit to talk about

161
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:42.450 
and we were also very pleased that we found comrades-in-arms, immediately SAP, the ECO Association

162
00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:50.759 
Acatech, also universities such as the Technion in Israel, with which we are connected through the Research School and that is

163
00:18:50.769 --> 00:18:52.779 
very important for the implementation later on.

164
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.359 
IEEE is the world's largest engineering association.

165
00:18:58.369 --> 00:19:05.930 
So the standards sets about standardisation, if you know exactly what screws you can turn, of course.

166
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.160 
through standardisation then suddenly bring that into broad effect?

167
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:20.519 
We have tried with the means of openHPI, that is our platform, I hope all of you know the very strong uses of openHPI.

168
00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:30.400 
over a million 1.2 million enrolled learners, where so much is offered to explain digital technologies

169
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:38.079 
we have also set up a channel where we invite everyone, a clean it forum where we invite everyone.

170
00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:44.759 
Their best project is to also put their ideas there for publication in the public domain.

171
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:55.660 
There is a monthly colloquium, that is good, we have also found a hearing in politics, so now in this one.

172
00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:05.960 
year the G 20 is under Indonesian presidency there is a paper a clean it paper in the political discussion

173
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:12.960 
so there the question you can't think about developing labels than first it would be research and such issues

174
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.880 
promote label to develop for good, especially good solution.

175
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:27.549 
And also in the G seven process, which is under German presidency, this issue is now being discussed.

176
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:34.690 
So with our conference clean-IT conference the first, they also want the continuation.

177
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:40.059 
Do we want to create such a platform, because we see efforts in this direction in many places, but these efforts are not being continued?

178
00:20:40.059 --> 00:20:41.259 
all of them are not perceived.

179
00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:49.420 
If you bring that together a bit like that, then you can make a lot more school with it than that is the case so far

180
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:58.000 
is to bring into consciousness than it is a very optimistic view that through research through technology in these technologies we can

181
00:20:58.079 --> 00:21:04.759 
much better, cleaner, so don't slacken in research, but push it forward, just with especially

182
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.589 
so and here is the conference, the procedure.

183
00:21:08.589 --> 00:21:11.470 
We have the whole day planned.

184
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.049 
I warmly welcome the various speakers who are then always introduced.

185
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:28.079 
We start with a keynote by Mrs. State Secretary Brandner, we then have a 1st panel.

186
00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:36.210 
I think they all have this our booklet, our booklet lying in front of them, which is a bit more than simple

187
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:40.160 
Conference booklet, which is supposed to give a bit of information on the subject as well.

188
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.930 
We have partners in this conference.

189
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:52.450 
SAP WMWare Huawei, the EU You can see that we thank everyone very much.

190
00:21:52.839 --> 00:22:00.250 
We have changes in the, in the, in the lecturers, in the presentations.

191
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.430 
Especially him.

192
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:12.640 
Doctor Herzig from SAP, who is responsible for a large area and is presenting, is Corona infected from India at the weekend.

193
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.539 
but will be replaced.

194
00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:20.079 
Mr. HeitkÃ¶tter will present the work.

195
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:32.140 
So I'm glad that we're finding support there and today hopefully an instructive and instructive doesn't mean

196
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:41.380 
that it can't also be a joy to come together and that what has always been missing from the video conferences, which is that

197
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:48.279 
you can stand out there together over coffee or tea or juice and also talk about things that are not on the agenda.

198
00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:52.400 
that are not on the agenda, happen to come up and can network through that.

199
00:22:52.859 --> 00:22:58.160 
Let's be happy that this can be a real live event again.

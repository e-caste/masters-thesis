00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.779 
Hello, it's me again Wolfram Greis from the European Mainframe Academy

2
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.148 
and in this video clip, I want to talk about the Cluster

3
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.469 
technique from IBM concerning the IBM mainframes.

4
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.379 
I want to talk about SYSPLEX, PARALLEL PLEX and GDPS.

5
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.819 
Let's start with the so-called Base Sysplex environment.

6
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.739 
Base Sysplex means we can set up to eight

7
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.019 
systems into one single image environment

8
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.439 
with different properties.

9
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.449 
All the systems have to be connected any to any with so-called signaling

10
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.889 
path. The operating systems running

11
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.719 
on these servers must have access to a set of past datasets

12
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.729 
called the Sysplex couple data set where all the configuration

13
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.839 
is defined and a lot of parameters are set.

14
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.279 
These operating systems are running with the

15
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.509 
clocks synchronized on the different servers.

16
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.669 
This is really important for reasonable

17
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.939 
collaboration between these different operating systems.

18
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.729 
We have a so-called N-2 rule for hardware and software means

19
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.169 
we can have a maximum of three different hardware generations

20
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.699 
and three different software generations in such a

21
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.029 
configuration. But in many cases that's enough because the

22
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.619 
work staff responsible for such an environment don't want

23
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.089 
to have different operating systems in a system environment,

24
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.879 
different-different versions of the operating systems.

25
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.469 
And normally they also don't have different hardware

26
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.119 
generations. Normally it's just a short time frame

27
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.889 
when we change as example from operating version

28
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.319 
to the next level of the operating version and then we have a mixture

29
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
in such an environment of normally just two different generations.

30
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.989 
Parallel Sysplex means we have an additional device in place.

31
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.789 
Parallel Sysplex is also a synonym for data sharing and data sharing means

32
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.699 
we have an additional device called the coupling facility.

33
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.609 
And this coupling facility is a shared memory, memory shared

34
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.069 
between the operating system running in such a Sysplex environment.

35
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.749 
Those in a number of  z/OS systems that can be set

36
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.539 
up is extended from eight to 32 and

37
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.279 
we have at least one coupling facility for this data sharing

38
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.839 
I just mentioned.

39
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.549 
The general idea of Syslex and Parallel Sysplex is the elimination

40
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.460 
of each and every SPOF.

41
00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:19.869 
SPOF Is an abbreviation for single point of failure and

42
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.149 
we can eliminate these SPOFs with redundancy

43
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.859 
means each and every component have to be available at least

44
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.479 
twice. This means the servers by itself,

45
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.159 
the physical machines, the coupling facility, the FICON

46
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.839 
directors, the DASD subsystems, Channel pass, coupling links, coupled

47
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.309 
data data sets, and so on. All these components have to be at

48
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.379 
least twice in such an environment, because if one component

49
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.969 
fails, the other component can take over the

50
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.359 
work of the failing component.

51
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.549 
And the same is true for software.

52
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.099 
For software, it means z/OS, the operating system, the middleware subsystems,

53
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.569 
databases, message queing, transactional systems and so on.

54
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.029 
And of course, also the applications.

55
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.119 
In such a coupling facility, we have a different

56
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.069 
set of structures, structures in an area that is

57
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.149 
managed by such a coupling facility.

58
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.739 
So, the coupling facility I mentioned already is a shared

59
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.839 
memory and we also have some processing power

60
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.349 
in place to manage the

61
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.329 
the software and manage the so-called structures.

62
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.789 
We have three different structures.

63
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.399 
The most important structure, the so-called Lock structures

64
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.656 
to set locks,

65
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.569 
especially in database environments.

66
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.449 
It's really important. There's a component running in each and every system it's called

67
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.869 
the internal resource manager

68
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.309 
managing locks that if we have different operating systems

69
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.779 
and different database management systems running in different machines and

70
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.029 
they access the same data, it has to be prevented that the same data

71
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.579 
is updated from another operating system.

72
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.289 
And that's why these lock structures are needed.

73
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.999 
We have also Cache structures to store and retrieve large amounts

74
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.559 
of data. This is especially in place for

75
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.580 
shared database environments, for security

76
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.549 
data like RACF and also other components

77
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.859 
using cache structures.

78
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.670 
These structures are used to store and retrieve data which comes

79
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.419 
in some kind of messages, some signals.

80
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.489 
Other things are managed, for example,

81
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.970 
webSphere MQ messages or IMS transactions.

82
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.998 
The next level when we talk about Syslex - Parallel Sysplex

83
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.319 
is GDPS. GDPS stands for Geographically

84
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.359 
Dispersed Parallel Sysplex.

85
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.859 
It means we we extend the idea

86
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.839 
of Sysplex and Parallel Sysplex beyond one computer center

87
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.399 
means, we combine or

88
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.666 
manage distributed Sysplexes.

89
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.109 
So, in this case, we can have complete site-switches

90
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.609 
in case of outages without affecting transactions

91
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.789 
that are running. The key technologies that are in place in this case is

92
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.199 
Parallel sysplex, we just talked about it.

93
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.429 
Systems Automation for z/OS and there are two

94
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.129 
products or possibilities available to synchronize all

95
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.019 
the data. So, if you want to have a high availability with GDPS,

96
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.521 
we have to synchronize the data in the

97
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.240 
computer centers which take part in such an GDPS configuration.

98
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.749 
We have different disaster recovery tiers, I don't

99
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.789 
go in each and every detail here, but the most important thing is when we talk about

100
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.619 
disaster recovery configurations, there are two important things

101
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.209 
to mention. One is the data loss, means how many

102
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.519 
data are lost in case of failure and the second

103
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.509 
key point

104
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.049 
is recovery time, means how long does it take to

105
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.599 
get the system again up and running.

106
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.611 
And there are now different tiers, it starts with Tier 0, that

107
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.994 
means we have no disaster recovery plan.

108
00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:23.289 
In this case you lose of course, all your data and recovery

109
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.706 
time is not applicable because if you don't have any data anymore,

110
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.419 
you can't do any recovery.

111
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.889 
And there are now different levels and I want to emphasize now

112
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.719 
the highest levels, its GDPS,

113
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.849 
so you don't lose any data and the recovery time is

114
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.559 
seconds. And there's special configuration

115
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.209 
possible, it's called the active-active configuration, means in

116
00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.129 
each and every data center, the same applications are running

117
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:05.259 
and we have a load balancer in place where the requests

118
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.969 
come in and the load balancer decides which request goes

119
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.009 
to Computer Center one and the next request goes to computer center two

120
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:20.169 
or whatever, where the capacity is available to fulfill

121
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.729 
the request. And if a failure occurs, nothing happens

122
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.289 
at all because all the transactions can run on

123
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.849 
the still available configuration.

124
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.619 
Active-Active has the highest level of disaster recovery

125
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.359 
tiers, with no data loss at all and with

126
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.559 
no recovery time because it just runs on and on.

127
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.979 
Just to show an example of how such a configuration, looks like - this is a

128
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.809 
typical configuration with two sides and all the data

129
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.609 
in these two sides are synchronized and

130
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.469 
also you see these disk devices, all the tape devices

131
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.979 
have the same data available in both

132
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.339 
computer centers. And in this case, we have just two

133
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.610 
machines, C14, in the site-1 and C14, in the site-2.

134
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.239 
And a lot of helpers are working together to setting up such

135
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.220 
a Sysplex environment.

136
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.819 
There are a lot of Redbooks available. If you want to go into more detail,

137
00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.859 
Redbooks are really important papers

138
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.359 
to show you how different

139
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.249 
scenarios can look like and a lot of

140
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:56.340 
introductional material concerning such kind of configurations.

141
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.528 
Yeah, this was the Sysplex, Parallel Sysplex and GDPS videoclip.

142
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:11.019 
Have fun and we see and hear us in

143
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.119 
one of the next video clips.

144
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.659 
Thank you very much for attending.

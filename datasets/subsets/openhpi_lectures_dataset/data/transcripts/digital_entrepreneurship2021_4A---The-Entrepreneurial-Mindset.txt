00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.600 
What makes for a successful
entrepreneur and why should you

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.780 
know your ABCs? In this video, we
address this principal question

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.060 
by highlighting three key aspects of
the entrepreneurial mindset - that is,

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.190 
how entrepreneurs think,

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.620 
act and feel. Welcome to this video of
the course Digital Entrepreneurship.

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.180 
My name is Katharina HÃ¶lzle, and
in the following Robert Rose

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410 
and I will briefly introduce you
to the so called ABCs of

8
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.130 
the entrepreneurial
mindset.

9
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
To begin with, what
exactly is a mindset?

10
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.340 
Following a definition by the
renowned American psychologist

11
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.790 
Carol Susan Dweck from
Stanford University,

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.440 
mindsets are individuals' mental lenses through
which they make sense of information,

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.610 
giving them a unique way of
understanding the experiences, and

14
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.930 
guiding them toward corresponding
actions and responses.

15
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.650 
A further defining feature, according to Dweck,
is that mindsets are individual beliefs

16
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.970 
about whether their abilities,
intelligence and talent are fixed

17
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
or can be formed and developed.
This distinction has resulted

18
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.280 
in a popular debate on the growth
vs. the fixed mindset and

19
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.310 
leads to a fundamental question -
are we 'born' as entrepreneurs

20
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.870 
or can we actually develop
an entrepreneurial mindset?

21
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.720 
We will address this question in
later videos of the session

22
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.970 
on intrapreneurship and
entrepreneurship education.

23
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.960 
But first, let us introduce you to the
entrepreneurial mindset as such.

24
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.590 
In entrepreneurship research, we
use the mindset concept to

25
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.210 
explain what drives
entrepreneurial efforts.

26
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.590 
The leading entrepreneurship
scholar Dean Shepherd

27
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.930 
describes entrepreneurial mindsets to
"involve the ability to rapidly sense,

28
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.620 
act, and mobilize, even under
uncertain conditions."

29
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.950 
You likely have noticed this yourself or when
talking to entrepreneurially-minded people -

30
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.390 
they often question the so-called
dominant logic of markets and are able to

31
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.420 
identify and address opportunities in a
rapidly changing and uncertain environment.

32
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.100 
Or to put it differently, successful
entrepreneurs ask simple

33
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.400 
but powerful questions again and again
about what others traditionally deem true

34
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.230 
or given. So what does
this ABC stand for?

35
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.920 
The entrepreneurial mindset can
be differentiated across a

36
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.570 
triad often used in psychological research.
That is A, Entrepreneurial Affect -

37
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.550 
what entrepreneurs feel, B Entrepreneurial
Behavior - how entrepreneurs act,

38
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.020 
and C, Entrepreneurial Cognition -
how entrepreneurs think.

39
00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.710 
First, why is affect or specifically
why are emotions important

40
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.540 
to understand entrepreneurial
success? In fact,

41
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.190 
emotions are evidently more powerful when
individuals act under risk and uncertainty.

42
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.180 
That, by its nature, characterizes
any entrepreneurial effort

43
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.830 
positive and negative emotions substantially
shape entrepreneurial success

44
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.580 
especially when facing
crisis or failure.

45
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.270 
Researchers therefore have a keen
interest to learn about the

46
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.020 
various aspects of entrepreneurial effect such as
emotional stability, support and certainly,

47
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.020 
entrepreneurial passion, which is
an effective inclination to

48
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.860 
engage in entrepreneurial
activities.

49
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.370 
Research by the expert on
entrepreneurial passion, Melissa Cardon

50
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.510 
shows that passion can not just help to explain
entrepreneurs creativity and persistence

51
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.550 
but also start-up performance, for
example, due to the magnetic effect

52
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.470 
passionate founders have
when recruiting talent.

53
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.660 
Second, how do entrepreneurs act? Following
a definition by Bird and Schjoedt,

54
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.290 
entrepreneurial behavior is the
observable human behavior involved

55
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.660 
in finding and exploiting
entrepreneurial opportunities through

56
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.940 
creating and developing
new ventures.

57
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.360 
We usually draw from three frameworks to
explain entrepreneurial behavior, that is,

58
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.190 
(1) Causation, meaning that individuals
select their means with

59
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.480 
their outcome in mind, they
know what they want to do.

60
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.190 
(2) Effectuation, that is a more iterative
approach, with given means

61
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.570 
but various outcomes. I
just take what I have.

62
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.410 
And (3) Bricolage: make
do with whatever is at hand.

63
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.520 
These theoretical lenses help
us to understand and practice

64
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.480 
why entrepreneurs, for example, approach
the development of business

65
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.310 
plans often very
differently.

66
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.750 
And third, Entrepreneurial Cognition
refers to the mental models

67
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.250 
or knowledge structures that individuals
use within the entrepreneurial process.

68
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.740 
After decades of entrepreneurship
research, it became more and more clear

69
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.610 
that entrepreneurs can't be
differentiated by their traits but

70
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.170 
rather by their mental
processes.

71
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.210 
Understanding those patterns of how
entrepreneurs think, how they make sense

72
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.070 
of so-far unrelated information
has substantial predictive

73
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.620 
power to explain what makes
entrepreneurs successful.

74
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.780 
For example, Fredricks and colleagues
have shown in a recent study

75
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.880 
that the higher individuals engage in
prospective thinking and perspective taking,

76
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.100 
the higher the quality of new
venture ideas strengthened by

77
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.820 
prior knowledge of
their technology.

78
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.120 
So, you should actually
look into the future, right?

79
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.100 
Taking all three of the ABCs in
perspective, it becomes apparent

80
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.670 
that affect, behavior and cognition
are strongly interrelated.

81
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.460 
Donald Kuratko and his colleagues describe
this as a self reinforcing cycle,

82
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.030 
meaning that the three aspects
interact and reinforce each other.

83
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.810 
An entrepreneur's mental process
will shape entrepreneurial

84
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.240 
action and emotions relating to eventual
success or failure will obviously influence

85
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.440 
any further activities. An example
provided by Kuratko makes this clear.

86
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.750 
Think of an employee in an
established organization, a firm

87
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.720 
who would be discouraged to take
entrepreneurial action in some project.

88
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.430 
It then would be very likely
that entrepreneurial cognition

89
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.360 
and emotion can't materialize as
well and the employee loses

90
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.120 
their passion and intention to
actually create that new idea.

91
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.250 
However, well designed corporate
entrepreneurship programs can

92
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.330 
leverage the entrepreneurial
impulses within the organization

93
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.020 
and reinforce the facets of
entrepreneurial reminded employees.

94
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.670 
We will build on this very notion
in a further video of the

95
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.940 
session where we will talk about
intrapreneurship in more detail.

96
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.240 
So, we hope this outline of the key
facets of the entrepreneurial

97
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.510 
mindset will provide a framework
and context for the scientific

98
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.710 
thing findings from entrepreneurship
research you will read

99
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.500 
and hear about
throughout this course.

100
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.230 
Coming next, we will talk about the entrepreneurial
mindset in established organizations,

101
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.820 
also called intrapreneurship, and further
talk about whether entrepreneurial

102
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.990 
minds are born or
can be taught.

103
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.430 
For now, we would like to thank
you for attention and see you

104
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.150 
in the next video.

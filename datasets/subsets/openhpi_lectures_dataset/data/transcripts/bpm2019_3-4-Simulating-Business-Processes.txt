00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.790 
Welcome to video clip 3.4
in which we simulate

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.930 
business processes.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.770 
In the introduction we have already
seen that business processes

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.610 
are very useful for a number of activities
and process management projects including

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.910 
process documentation, improvement,
automation and process monitoring.

6
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.810 
And it's essential that the
different stakeholders involved

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.370 
in these processes agree on the meaning of
these business process model. And therefore

8
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.300 
business process model is in the centre
of this figure in the right hand side.

9
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.140 
And the motivation for simulating
processes is now that we

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.540 
want to study process executions
without implementing the process

11
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.540 
and thereby we can we can
validate the process.

12
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.220 
Actually when we discuss when we
review process models we actually

13
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.280 
kind of simulate
them already.

14
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.570 
To see this we
can look at the

15
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.240 
process model here on the lower part
of this of the slide. And normally I

16
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.220 
introduce process models. Well
first the order is received,

17
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.130 
the start event occurs
the order is received,

18
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.870 
then the order details are
entered then we have the check

19
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.500 
correctness of order activity then
there is a decision either the order

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.960 
is incorrect we go the order is
incorrect, go that way, the order

21
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.570 
is correct we go that way. So this
is some kind of step through

22
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.900 
of the process. And a simulation
has also this flavor simulation

23
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.790 
there is also a step through
simulation that allows to step

24
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.940 
through the activities in the
process model as specified

25
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.820 
by the execution constraints
between between the activities.

26
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.390 
We can look at three different
kinds of simulation in

27
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.570 
a business process management. First of all
this step through simulations that I just

28
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.470 
explained a little bit. So the key here
is to understand the process behavior

29
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.090 
and we can also regard this as
a qualitative simulation. We

30
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.110 
don't look at the quantities we
just look at the quality of the

31
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.190 
execution ordering
of activities.

32
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.720 
Then there is a single instance
simulation. In this case

33
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.030 
we add additional properties
of activities also of

34
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.150 
the resources and we want to
learn something about the costs

35
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.560 
incurred and about the time that is spend
while executing business processes.

36
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.290 
Something we will not look at when
we do step through simulation

37
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.020 
we are just interested in the
logical ordering of activities.

38
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.200 
In single instance simulation we
are also interested in costs or

39
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.320 
in performance of
the process.

40
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.430 
Then there is multiple insistance
on multi instance simulation

41
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.670 
in which we are not interested
only in the cost of one process

42
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.850 
instance but in the cost of
many process instances that

43
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.230 
run in an organizational setting
where we in addition need to model

44
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.350 
need to represent resources, their
working times, person working times

45
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.130 
availability of other resources
and things like these.

46
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.910 
And we use multiple instant simulation to
run many process instances concurrently

47
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.940 
and to get an idea about the run time and
cost of executing these process instances.

48
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.750 
In this context a very detailed
representation of resources is required

49
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.860 
and unfortunately we cannot cover
this topic in this course

50
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.590 
but we just mention a few a few
words on multi instance simulation

51
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.010 
later in this video.

52
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.940 
So let's come back to the step
through simulation. Again the usage

53
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.180 
is step though simulation is used
during process model design

54
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.770 
to achieve a common understanding
of the behavior of the business

55
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.210 
process. The logical ordering of
activities is in the center here

56
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.150 
and we do this by walking through
a process step by step.

57
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.700 
Technically so the simulation is done by
the user by persons involved in this

58
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
in the process design.

59
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.210 
And they use a simulation engineer
they use a piece of software that

60
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.880 
does the simulation for us and actually
the simulation engine calculates

61
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.250 
the dependencies of activities
and triggers the respective

62
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.680 
state transitions and gives a
visual representation of the

63
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.300 
current state of
the process.

64
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.430 
Alright during step through
simulation uses triggers state

65
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.600 
transitions of activity instance
from ready to terminated

66
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.810 
and also uses select conditions. So in
processes we know we have conditions

67
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.720 
for instance the data based XOR
split, we can either go or

68
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.960 
any of the outgoing branches of
the XOR split. And that cannot

69
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
be decided by the simulation
since it doesn't work does not

70
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.560 
work on real data, there is no
implementation of the process behind it.

71
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.830 
Therefore we as users need to help the
system to decide which way to go.

72
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.260 
To make that a little bit more, to
illustrate this a bit further

73
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.770 
the user trigger state transition
from ready to terminated of the

74
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.940 
register claim activity instance.
So also in the Signavio

75
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.310 
process editor has a facility or has
no possibility to do a step through

76
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.400 
simulation and when we use that when we
simulate the process we've seen before

77
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.130 
we first of all start the
simulation by performing the

78
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.400 
claim received event, so by clicking
on that the event occurs.

79
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.860 
And then in this state of the register
a registered claim activity

80
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.500 
instance is in the ready state. So
activities that are in the ready state

81
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.170 
have these double blue border. And
by clicking on that we change

82
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.500 
the state of the activity instance
from ready to terminated.

83
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.090 
When we do that we can
we will see the next

84
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.130 
a diagram here, so the next
picture here on this slide.

85
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.980 
And that indicates that register claim is
terminated, that's the solid blue border

86
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.150 
and that now the next activity of
the process is in the ready state.

87
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.040 
So and that of course continues
until the end of the process.

88
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.520 
So we have a similar situation than we
had in the formal analysis of the

89
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.100 
business process that we are not
really interested in the actual

90
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.890 
running state of the activity instances but
only in the logical ordering and therefore

91
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.850 
in the transition from the ready
state to the terminated state.

92
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.400 
Alright so again
we had this

93
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.550 
already so also in process
simulation we go from ready

94
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.850 
directly to terminated.

95
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.490 
So we are not interested in the
concrete running of the activities

96
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.270 
since we just simulate
the process.

97
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.710 
And this is appropriate since we are
interested in the logical ordering

98
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.600 
of activities not in the activities themselves
or even in the activity implementations.

99
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.930 
I also indicated that the user
select the condition of an XOR

100
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.960 
split and that's represented
in the Signavio simulation

101
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.530 
front end like this. So here
we can decide whether we

102
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.900 
want to prepare a letter of
approval or we want to prepare

103
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.260 
a letter of rejection. Thereby
we click on these edges

104
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.900 
these two edges also have these
double blue shape at this

105
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.750 
in this state of the simulation.
So we can click on one of them

106
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.700 
thereby selecting it and
unselecting the other.

107
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:59.230 
Then we select the upper one of course
prepare letter of approval will be

108
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.010 
will be will come from the init
state to the ready state,

109
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.480 
can now be executed therefore it
has this a double blue border.

110
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.650 
Alright so much to the topic of
step through simulation, very

111
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.450 
easy means but also very useful
means if you think about

112
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.350 
the process reviews when you
really want to understand

113
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.460 
what the logical ordering of the
activities in your process.

114
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.320 
But we are also interested
in the costs and in the

115
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.030 
performance of the process before
implementing it in the target set.

116
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.000 
So qualitative or quantitative sorry
quantitative simulation allows

117
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.690 
estimating the performance of a
process before its implementation.

118
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.990 
So how long does a
process instance take

119
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.950 
and what is the cost of one process
instance? For instance these are two

120
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.670 
metrics that are
quite often used.

121
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.620 
To calculate this of course we need
additional information. So far

122
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.490 
we have no we did not represent the
runtime of an activity instance and

123
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.980 
also the cost of the employees
involved, we did not represent

124
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.610 
that because it was not required.
In fact we were not interested

125
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.800 
in the properties
of the execution

126
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.200 
regarding these
performance parameters.

127
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.560 
So we need additional simulation
information for instance time and cost

128
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.910 
of conducting
activities.

129
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:28.370 
Other than that the overall
execution overall logic of this

130
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.560 
on the focus of a single instance
just remain at this point.

131
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.720 
Alright so we like to simulate
the insurance claim process

132
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.660 
that you see here on the
lower part of the slide.

133
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:46.910 
And we came up with some numbers.
I mean these numbers are

134
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:54.370 
just example numbers to present the
approach, to talk about how to simulate

135
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.970 
the business process and how to
calculate the cost and the time that

136
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.170 
that are associated with
one process instance.

137
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:09.670 
So we are not very let's say very
particular about the specific numbers.

138
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.780 
Alright so in this in our
example we have the following

139
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.110 
activity processing times. The
register claim takes five minutes

140
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.500 
decide on claim coverage always takes
fifteen minutes we see that is

141
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.530 
a sub process so it has an internal
structure, it is a bit complex

142
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.590 
we need to decide on it therefore it
takes fifteen minutes to process.

143
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.770 
Preparation of the approval letter
takes eight minutes, preparation

144
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.440 
of the rejection letter takes a bit
longer we need a bit more detailed

145
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.460 
discussion when we

146
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.820 
write the rejection
letter.

147
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.930 
We need to associate costs and
staff member costs is always

148
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.110 
forty euros per hours. In our
example and each letter that is

149
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:55.910 
sent at the end of the day so
it takes or costs 1.5 euros.

150
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:02.670 
Ok these are the parameters that we put
into or that we use in the simulation.

151
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.380 
And now we can a do a simulation quantitative
simulation of one process instance

152
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:15.390 
and we do it like that. So we again can
choose which path to take and here

153
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.840 
we chose the path well from
claim received to claim

154
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.530 
approved so the
positive outcome here

155
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.140 
the sense of the
client, at least.

156
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:33.950 
So cost calculation is like follows.
So we first of all claim received

157
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.380 
is an activity
does not sorry

158
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.140 
claim activity is,
no claim received

159
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.910 
is an event therefore does
not incur any cost.

160
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:52.050 
Claim umm register claim takes five minutes so
this activity is executed first. So it takes

161
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.040 
five minutes.

162
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:59.990 
And five minutes with the
forty euros per hour

163
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.840 
amounts to a cost of 3.33
euros. So executing this

164
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:09.660 
one activity costs
3.33 euros.

165
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.080 
And we also do that for the next
activity. Decide on claim coverage

166
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:19.990 
takes fifteen minutes, so
costs ten euros executing

167
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.590 
then we have the preparation of
the approval letter that costs

168
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:28.380 
5.33 euros and we
have to add the

169
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.710 
costs of sending the letter which
is one point five euros and that

170
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.420 
and that point. So that amounts to
a cost on the right hand side of

171
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.770 
twenty euros and
seventeen cent.

172
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.720 
And we can also calculate the
cycle time and the cycle time

173
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.610 
is five plus fifteen plus
eight which is twenty eight

174
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.170 
minutes in that
in that case.

175
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.690 
Alright so in in the case of
rejecting or rejecting the claim

176
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.410 
we have well in other
process behavior so we

177
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.380 
of course here decide to go
the um lower branch when we

178
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.680 
want to reject
the claim.

179
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.230 
Rejection is a bit more costly
and we see that well due to

180
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.010 
the fact that the preparation of the
rejection letter takes a bit longer.

181
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.300 
It takes fifteen minutes instead of
the eight minutes before, therefore

182
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.950 
we have more labor cost here to
calculate. So overall the cost

183
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:32.070 
is 24.83 euros in that
case. So by these

184
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.250 
numbers we get an idea of the cost of
processing just one one process instance

185
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.190 
and also we get an idea of the time
spent and the time is longer

186
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.150 
so it's thirty five
minutes in this case.

187
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:51.550 
So I mentioned that I'd like to make a few
remarks on multiple instance simulation.

188
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.190 
That's far more complex to
set up the simulation model

189
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:59.970 
so additional value comes from multi
instances simulation which requires

190
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.800 
much more detailed
simulation model.

191
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.660 
So we need to talk about the
case frequencies. So what

192
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.780 
is the arrival rate or

193
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:15.120 
the arrival distribution, which
distribution is followed

194
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.770 
in terms of the arrival of
new process instances.

195
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.360 
We have to have a detailed model of
the resources that are available.

196
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:30.540 
So the organizational structure, which persons
are involved, which handovers between

197
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.850 
persons are involved and aspects
like these. We also have to

198
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:39.740 
take into account of working
times of the employees and of

199
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.650 
course we need to say what's the start
and the end of the simulation,

200
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.180 
what is the number of instance we
like to simulate, what is the what

201
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.660 
is the time we want
to simulate.

202
00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.780 
And the simulation runs a number
of instances and aggregates

203
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.550 
cost and performance values and
thereby we can find information

204
00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.680 
about bottlenecks and also
regarding properties regarding

205
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.420 
resources, so are they over utilized
are they underutilized resources

206
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.290 
and aspects like this.

207
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.970 
Alright that brings us to
the end of video clip 3.4

208
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.990 
in which we simulated
business processes

209
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.180 
the idea of simulation is we want
to evaluate the process without

210
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.390 
implementing the process, we want
to validate it, we want to work

211
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.970 
as a group and want to agree on the
on the behavior of the process

212
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.670 
in terms of step through simulation.
We can also learn about

213
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:36.300 
the performance of a process
for instance regarding cost

214
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.040 
incurred and also time spent for
one process instance and these

215
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.600 
are the quantitative
aspects of simulation.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240 
so dear colleagues, dear

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.110 
participants, friends very much welcome in Potsdam.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.830 
it is not in Potsdam. it's virtual sorry for that.

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.010 
there is a pandemic situation all over the world.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.100 
there we would be very happy to have you here

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:26.620 
to not only share our common visions or results of our work. but also to

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.520 
network to each other to create discussions
and ideas for new projects from cooperation.

8
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.200 
anyone we have to work and live with this situation,

9
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.290 
and we will make the best out of it. before i start to

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.220 
share some sorts from our side here and potsdam

11
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.780 
with openHPI. and other platforms i want to thank very much for the colleagues

12
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.470 
who organized this learning at scale.

13
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.780 
amy paras and marcus

14
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.090 
very welcome. thank you for preparing the program

15
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.710 
bringing the keynote speakers and organize this.

16
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.310 
in the program of is and i also want to chair our loca organize us.

17
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.830 
there stephanie schweiger and Thomas Staubitz

18
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.150 
which try to do their best to give us an very

19
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.170 
interesting and fruitful environment for our

20
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
this year's second virtual

21
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.770 
learning at scale.

22
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.630 
let's start with a viewpoint which shows how urgent it is to think about

23
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.620 
education about new form educations, about

24
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.390 
massive educational faults.

25
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.820 
we live in a very new time. in a new time of colonizing,

26
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.230 
the new digital world internet is a little bit more than fifty years.

27
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.580 
the web is thirty-three years old

28
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.700 
for in my age i became a professor before the world wide web exists.

29
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.370 
so when I tells us in the lecture the students think i should be death already.

30
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.800 
so it is a very young development we are the first generation to manage this.

31
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.580 
and this is completely change our world and completely change how we work,

32
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.570 
how we live together, how we communicate, how we have our political

33
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.990 
systems, how we run in direction, how we educate.

34
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.320 
and all this changes are titled as digital transformation.

35
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.590 
and before covid at least in germany. i think in US you are

36
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.790 
more at once many people. say ok there is the technology and

37
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.840 
they like their smartphone. but they were another way i said

38
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.680 
bases a drastic changes into society in all areas. so this

39
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.780 
was showing a little bit the situation meanwhile at least the people after

40
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.960 
the needs of digital technologies during the

41
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.590 
time of crisis. the people at least have to know that they are

42
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.560 
that. there is such a wave behind them and that we have to really

43
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.790 
face the situation and solution.

44
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:47.430 
there are new dreams internet of things, cloud computing, big data technology

45
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.030 
all that let us dream from a smart world from a smart home.

46
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.990 
a smart cities where traffic for fabric all things

47
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.960 
are assumed to become smart and indeed this technologies.

48
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.640 
technologies provides the means to change our world into a smart world.

49
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.350 
but this needs to bring speak challenges needs

50
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.870 
very strong engagement and definitely education.

51
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.890 
so digital transformation is changing all our lives the younger.

52
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.080 
people are born into such a world those do not see

53
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.070 
or cannot remember the drastic changes. but the older ones they can

54
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.430 
see traditional transformation cause change in all area of our life.

55
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.230 
it is much more easy to interact with each other

56
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.340 
like in our conference to sit on different continents in the world

57
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.230 
and discuss to them.

58
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.970 
it is are able to discuss important things together to create

59
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.540 
to run projects, to create new

60
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.020 
products, new services, new activities. and

61
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:18.170 
their challenges how to use how to master since huge potential

62
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.420 
is in that digital transformation and how to master the challenges

63
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.720 
for human kind.

64
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:35.460 
and i see a situation that in order to master we only can master digital information

65
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.290 
by means of a digital enlightenment.

66
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.340 
you remember in history

67
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.080 
after the feudalistic time when the citizens modern, citizen society came up.

68
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.380 
there was this age of enlightenment.

69
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.730 
philosophers like imre kant they found that a light meant is

70
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.910 
the exit of man from hisself in afflicted a majority

71
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.370 
and though the people shouldn't be.

72
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.660 
this was the idea of

73
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:19.120 
the enlightenment should be empowered to be able to run their life in

74
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:26.190 
with the own air in their own responsibility and are able to do this. and

75
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.500 
i think to manage how we deal and how we move

76
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.170 
and how we behave in the new digital world.

77
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.630 
we need nowadays digital light,

78
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.390 
and this digital light ment needs a basic understanding of

79
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.140 
c i t technologies. so this

80
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:52.010 
must be told already in the schools many people think they are able

81
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.460 
to know what digital dense means. because they can use such smart phones

82
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.660 
and are very fast in navigation in web services.

83
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.850 
but when we look behind the scene when we see that people are no worry

84
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.590 
where they spenser data for what purposes, where they give things

85
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.150 
very personal things out of their control.

86
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:24.360 
we have such a password they study, because we are as a institute

87
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.150 
dealing with future technologies. we also investigate cyber security questions

88
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.730 
and we are very much worried in the internet, in the open in

89
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.140 
the darkness. there are more than four the fourteen billion

90
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:48.140 
leaked identities. identities name their christian name address

91
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.040 
bank account, credit card number, password.

92
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.820 
this is a digital identity and fourteen billion are

93
00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.670 
open in the internet.

94
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.580 
one third of the fourteen billion we collected says and we

95
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.610 
provide services people can check whether their identity is

96
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.820 
affected by such a leak.

97
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.730 
one third of the identities they have the password in clear text.

98
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.720 
so from the forty billion

99
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.860 
almost two percent hundred million

100
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.510 
people we know the password in clear text and from the empty handle,

101
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.300 
as we know from four billion and hundred million a little less

102
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.620 
than a hundred million. they use a possible one two three four five six.

103
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.280 
one can say so many people are stupid.
but i think it's a wrong conclusion.

104
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.830 
this are people that do not understand,

105
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.940 
how to behave into the world in the right way. so we need such a digital

106
00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.730 
enlightenment and to prepare people to make the best use of this natural world.

107
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.810 
and the goal is to empowering citizens to master digital transformation

108
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.500 
and to live also in this new world in a self determined and in a

109
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.940 
self responsible way,

110
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.490 
and coming to education to realise this potential. we need

111
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:25.080 
educational content in the way of that today we providers in the

112
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.670 
most efficient digital way we need digital educational formats.

113
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.890 
we need digital education infrastructures.

114
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.030 
and this is what our institute has a plattner institute is

115
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.970 
working for. so this is has a plattner a one of the founders

116
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.990 
of as SAP. and  as a chance a board member.

117
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.010 
and he has a large foundation, so has a blood nose something

118
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.220 
like a german big aids and a large foundation and the foundation is

119
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.130 
financing. he has a plattner institute as an university excellent center

120
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.070 
for mastering digital transformation. this is a

121
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:14.950 
short fact sheet we have a small number of value much selected

122
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.480 
students special master programs at systems engineering cyber security

123
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.690 
health data engineering. we have twenty one research departments

124
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.080 
a large number more than two hundred phd students here in hpi.

125
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.800 
and in our worldwide a phd programs at the hpi research

126
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.250 
schools in israel, south africa and china, US.

127
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:46.950 
we have a d school he and puts them there is an HPI d school at stanford university

128
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.570 
and some more around the world and we has a plattner institute

129
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.350 
has a digital health center

130
00:10:55.170 --> 00:11:01.370 
in new york at manzini hospital. so they to master the digital

131
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.970 
transformation and to provide to develop technologies

132
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:11.910 
projects systems, this is in the center of our competence and task.

133
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.920 
so there are different digital education initiatives run at hpi.

134
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:22.020 
the biggest and most important is the openHPI

135
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:29.730 
platform first european MOOC platform, then over the last years we had a national

136
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.020 
project to develop an infrastructure

137
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:40.050 
to allow schools to use future digital technologies in the class.

138
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:46.970 
on the basis of this very strong european data protection laws.

139
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.820 
it is in summer in july and july it has finished the development

140
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.140 
phase and then this data structures is school cloud.

141
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.050 
it goes in the responsibility of the german states

142
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:07.580 
which will run them, and then we are part in an important german

143
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.300 
project the german AI campus where government is

144
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.290 
is funding a place platform,

145
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.990 
mooc platform with all the a and teaching content that's available in germany

146
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.420 
about z artificial intelligence.

147
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.100 
i also mentioned in this context design thinking our activities.

148
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:38.190 
because we see the future engineers we educate.

149
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.220 
they are every time part of teams that are in innovation projects.

150
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:51.070 
because digitalisation changes work flow changes, services changes,

151
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.680 
how things are produced, so we feel also responsible to educate

152
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.780 
our students in design thinking to manage such changes

153
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:08.160 
to be prepared for creativity techniques and to

154
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.950 
dear with this innovative situation.

155
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.550 
those are our global open compass in HPI.

156
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:24.750 
the contribution we provide to the topic of digital environment. there is the

157
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.160 
hpi mooc platform says tele task.

158
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:34.410 
the tool we create contents and the cloud i want to say a few

159
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.390 
words to each of this project

160
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.210 
that as we already did more than twenty years.

161
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.320 
we tried to use new digital technologies.

162
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:52.570 
to fix a lecture hall's situations to record a lecture,

163
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:57.690 
not only to recall as a teacher that is important, but not

164
00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.350 
enough because we need also

165
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.480 
what he is illustrating, what he is showing what it is speaking

166
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.670 
about in the technical topics and

167
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.060 
taking it up. its you need also to show and

168
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:24.130 
an architectural infrastructure assessing. so the idea is to as well as

169
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.490 
recalled the lecturer, but also what he or she is presenting.

170
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:37.850 
and so we have device design such an easy box. you can connect

171
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.230 
the laptop to it and the camera and micro, and then you can

172
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:47.030 
push the start button and all is recorded and streamed to the internet.

173
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:54.710 
and it is recorded in this dual screen see presenter as well as the background.

174
00:14:55.390 --> 00:15:01.750 
and so this is the recording system. and you see it's not only that you can

175
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:07.250 
half show the powerpoint slides, but you can use any

176
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.290 
the screen is recorded. so you can use

177
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.350 
the smart vaults or any kind of assistance.

178
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:22.760 
with this you saw the big numbers of people that are using this

179
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.610 
recordings or what happens in HPI conferences are recorded

180
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:33.190 
there is a huge number we get a lot of e-mails which say all

181
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:37.210 
thank you. it's nice to get access to your content.

182
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.890 
but we never got an email which says or it was fun to follow,

183
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.020 
this ninety minute lecture recordings or others.

184
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:52.900 
and so when we became aware of the first MOOCs the first massive

185
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:58.900 
open online courses with the bassline tune for example with several thousand

186
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:05.850 
ten thousand visitors. we immediately got the idea because the Moocs

187
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.130 
contribute a

188
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:14.790 
social feature to this e-learning following recordings of lecture.

189
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.470 
lectures sitting alone at home in front of the screen

190
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.750 
telephone rings girlfriend is coming,

191
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:30.460 
when likes to drink something all is easy to go away from this.

192
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.320 
there is not such an

193
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.950 
connection like having in a class sitting together speaking together,

194
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.410 
because the notion is the social dimension is missing.

195
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.040 
so and with the MOOCs to say ok. we do not only present the material we

196
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.750 
present the materials in causes, so we have first like a second week.

197
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.390 
and we present in the first weeks this topics in the second week that

198
00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:01.470 
and then marriage this such a platform with social media.

199
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:06.090 
then the learners which are synchronized they immediately start

200
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:11.170 
to interact with each other like we are used in the ocean.

201
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.460 
and this concept,

202
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.380 
was taken around the world as a new and very important possibility

203
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.730 
to provide two chair

204
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:31.050 
knowledge, two chair education. so this massiveness

205
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.810 
this openness and submit it as open. it's helps to create a lot of people

206
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.490 
that take part in such a learning event.

207
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.800 
and the more people take part the more lively is the direction

208
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.370 
in the social media. though learning needs social interactions. i think

209
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:56.920 
for those which didn't believe this the corona crisis helped to understand says

210
00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.500 
when we saw that our students which are not allowed to come to campus

211
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.860 
are able to learn at home. but they have

212
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:12.340 
no much fun, they fear that it's much more difficult to learn alone

213
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.040 
than in the class and together

214
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.930 
with other students. so we created because the learning management

215
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.500 
systems in that time were not able to deal with such mess

216
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.690 
with its mass events also ethics was not

217
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.140 
available. it's just started

218
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.970 
to develop such a platform, so we developed such a platform by ourself.

219
00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.990 
in hasso plattner institute we have enough gifted

220
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.840 
engineers, phd students which know how to deal with

221
00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.680 
their with digital technologies. and this is how it looks like

222
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.810 
we are just in.

223
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.170 
it we didn't finish it before the conference, it was a goes

224
00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:05.660 
away in summer we have a relaunch as a showing as a platform in new work.

225
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:12.070 
we made good experience with such with this format to have six week courses.

226
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.730 
each week ten to twelve short videos self-test,

227
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:22.130 
further readings homework the final exam. and when you reach

228
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.050 
more than fifty percent of the scores, you will get a certificate.

229
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.440 
there from our platform if you switch on

230
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:36.410 
the camera during the examination situations,
then you can also get credit points.

231
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:43.680 
so this is a form, but we never was thinking to replace university activities.

232
00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.010 
so our world from the beginning was more to open

233
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:55.150 
our to openHPI and bring the knowledge to all peoples that are interested in.

234
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.660 
usually at least in germany. it's very strong you need to be

235
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.850 
sure it's not everyone allowed to go through university. university

236
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.560 
is free of course of course. but it's not allowed for everyone

237
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:12.380 
to go to university. we want to change this and open and provides

238
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.850 
this knowledge to all people which are interested.

239
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:23.950 
we also thinking about this social factor,
thinking about what motivates people

240
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.700 
to sit alone in front of their screen or their machine and to learn.

241
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:35.030 
learning is difficult you need usually you need an action.

242
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.700 
so we tried to find and investigate also scientifically investigate,

243
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.790 
how we have what we can learn from online gaming's. what is

244
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.160 
the motivations.

245
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:51.760 
they are for so many people to users we were thinking about

246
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.500 
other things is forms of discussion forms

247
00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.890 
the collapse spaces which are available note HPI, so people

248
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.910 
can enter own their discussion rooms public or private one.

249
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:14.810 
so this is the activities mean by many of the platforms provide such activities.

250
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.740 
and what we see when we look for who is who are our participants.

251
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.900 
then we see it's not so stools

252
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:29.170 
during the pendency elsa's and colleagues used open api
for blended learning formats.

253
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.970 
but our main

254
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.620 
part of the users these are professionals. these are people between thirty

255
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:44.380 
and and sixty which are in which have professional work a job

256
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.020 
anywhere which have a family and which like

257
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.830 
to be on the state of the latest knowledge for that job for changing the job.

258
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.450 
so here we offering mostly digital

259
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.900 
content about digital technologies and others.

260
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.880 
this is because in the eMoocs we have an image conference.

261
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.520 
we had a lot of discussions,

262
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:16.750 
how universities could use universities have the right people to create content.

263
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:22.670 
but we should spend knowledge for the world and not hold

264
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:23.840 
it in the university.

265
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:30.380 
we have partners. so our platform our openHPI platform is used by as sap

266
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.710 
for their openSAP and offer Mooc offers they have

267
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:41.980 
walls and five million enrollments, since it was the first enterprise platform

268
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.280 
in the world. they tell about their products, how the products

269
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.420 
can be used for what they are good

270
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:55.130 
at how the technologies work behind. so meanwhile we see many

271
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.830 
companies using the moocs for disseminating their knowledge.

272
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.930 
for us a very interesting was the case of the health organization.

273
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:12.480 
as the openwho.org is a use our platform we came in contact

274
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:18.230 
shortly, or not shortly one two years two years before of the crisis koruna rises,

275
00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:25.300 
when ebola was again it was back in africa and who head every

276
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:30.230 
times a problem, if such a pandemic was starting, their server crash

277
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.540 
down. because we are not able to provide the knowledge

278
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.740 
people requested in such a situation in short time.

279
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.830 
so if we start to cooperate and

280
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:47.210 
ready when corona came, so shortly before corona is was about

281
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.200 
a half million users and rode in the WHO

282
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:59.010 
platform but meanwhile its mora's and five million five five half million

283
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.470 
their richest users ninety four content in ninety four language.

284
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.710 
so this is really amazing what is possible and the world

285
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:16.000 
particular also the developing world is asking for such support.

286
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:20.140 
here are others these are other partners which are use our

287
00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.600 
platform and where we can learn, what they need and develop the platform.

288
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:33.600 
on all the platform we could see that the number of people using that

289
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:40.080 
lock down time for a digital education there was increasing very much,

290
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.370 
though people learned that in such situation like in the crisis.

291
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.530 
but also in others i hope also win prizes as

292
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:53.550 
gunn said the people remember that it's possible to use digital content

293
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.840 
and learn from such digital sources.

294
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.150 
what could be next.

295
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:05.620 
this is a national education cloud's germany his government

296
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.290 
has started a huge project. they want to interconnect

297
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:19.030 
all the education sources all the universities and all the institutions that provide

298
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:25.990 
a digital content to make it more easily accessible and nation wide,

299
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.680 
as this is

300
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:34.510 
often german speaking content.
so we will see whether this approach is working

301
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:40.790 
we as HPI are proud, because the idea was first pitched by HPI

302
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.870 
the national it summit in two thousand sixty.

303
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.850 
and there is really a need to interconnect all this

304
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:57.390 
also sources that provides a learning content that provide

305
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:03.330 
teaching moocs and other forms of digital content.

306
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:12.090 
let me close to share which i also mentioned as our

307
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:18.880 
moocs and panels if we look for the development of the universities.

308
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:23.630 
and we can say there was the first type of university university one o.

309
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.490 
this were the asian universities and academies.

310
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:33.010 
this was the wisdom for a few professors at that time most

311
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.550 
cases it was philosophers were

312
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:41.980 
living and thinking and discussing together with a few students around.

313
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.030 
you noses that were sitting in the garden and discuss about world.

314
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.110 
university two o. this is

315
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.890 
that today's universities

316
00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.010 
which are responsible for educating

317
00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:01.150 
mostly young people they were driven the development of university.

318
00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.830 
two o were driven by the invention of mooc printing

319
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.380 
in the age of enlightenment what i start to discuss it's important

320
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.530 
to make people able to

321
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.580 
become self-responsible for their lives.

322
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.530 
and those universities are organized around libraries.

323
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.300 
students physically attend classes.

324
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:32.160 
and i believe that the development of a university three o of future university

325
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:40.460 
goes into the direction of becoming institutions providing lifelong educational

326
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:46.940 
offers two universities should become lifelong education companions.

327
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.890 
people become older people have to work longer.

328
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:56.210 
the knowledge is exploding by means of new technologies we

329
00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:01.830 
have in all areas. so it is no more enough to prepare young people

330
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.120 
in between twenty and twenty five or

331
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.600 
to make them fit for a lifelong professional

332
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:14.660 
career. we have to really not only speak about lifelong education,

333
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:20.890 
we have to do it. so driven by this changes caused by the digital transformation.

334
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:26.110

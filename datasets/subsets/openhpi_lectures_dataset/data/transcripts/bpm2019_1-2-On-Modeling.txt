00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.410 
Welcome to video clip 1.2 in
which we will be looking at modeling.

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.420 
Modeling is a human way of
coping with complexity.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.980 
The world around us is complex and
humans tend to make simplifications

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.130 
on this complexity using models. So a model is
an abstract representation of an original

5
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.510 
and a model always
has a modeling goal.

6
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.040 
So if we look at this example of
a map of a room in the house,

7
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.080 
we see this abstract representation
of the original. The original is

8
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.870 
the room itself and the goal of this
model it is well to organize where

9
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.550 
kitchen appliances
will be

10
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.640 
a put afterwards.
So we see here

11
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.220 
that there are some appliances
put here, some whatever

12
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.810 
applied as a sink
is put here.

13
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.780 
And you also see elements of the
real world that are represented

14
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.580 
in these models or here we have
a door, here there are windows

15
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.560 
and here there is that same
opening where there's no wall.

16
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.920 
Also there are very detailed
measurements here you know

17
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.060 
supposed to read all that but
these detailed measurements help

18
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.820 
engineers then to build the
kitchen appliances so that

19
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.690 
they will fit
exactly this room.

20
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.940 
Another example of a
model is this drawing,

21
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.550 
this architectural drawing of the train
station - the main train station in

22
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.300 
berlin that has been drawn even
before the train station was

23
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.040 
There. So it's a architectural
picture a drawing of

24
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.270 
the main train station
in berlin at a point in

25
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.040 
time when the train station was
not was not actually built.

26
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.250 
Here we have also a model and
this is a representation

27
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
of a transportation
process so to speak. So

28
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.670 
last year I was buying some
product from an online store and

29
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.030 
I was interested in when the
parcel would finally reach me.

30
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.120 
So I use this model provided by
this transportation company where

31
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.950 
we where I so well
it's already been

32
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.320 
sorry it has already been
provided to the transportation

33
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.570 
company, it has already been
transported to the main hub and

34
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.480 
it's already been further
transferred to some local hub. And

35
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.150 
the next activities that are
pending is now the actual

36
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.440 
delivery of these parcels. So
this model gives me a nice idea

37
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.730 
of these of the original where the
original is the transportation

38
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.310 
Process. This is already related to
would say business processes in the

39
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.230 
bit of a
broader sense.

40
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.210 
So one slide on modeling theory and
that's the properties of models

41
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.580 
defined by Stachowiak in 1973
already. So he

42
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.720 
says that all models have a mapping
feature that means models are

43
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.980 
associated with
originals

44
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.050 
which might or might not exist
and originals are mapped to

45
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.940 
models during the creative
act of modeling.

46
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.280 
And this feature in German is called
Abbildungsmerkmal mapping feature.

47
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.010 
The abstraction feature says that models
are abstract representations of originals,

48
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.410 
meaning that models disregard
properties that are not considered

49
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.130 
relevant for the modeling goal by
the modellers. So certain aspects

50
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.060 
of the real world are abstracted from
and that helps of course in coping

51
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.250 
with complexity and here the German word
VerkÃ¼rzungsmerkmal abstraction feature.

52
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.230 
The third property is the pragmatic
Feature, so models can replace

53
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.950 
originals for the purpose
of the modeling goal.

54
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.390 
and that in German is
pragmatisches Merkmal pragmatic feature.

55
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.070 
Right there are descriptive
Models. Certain kind of models are

56
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.750 
descriptive models that
describe an original.

57
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.150 
Descriptive models always
describe an existing original.

58
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.780 
We've seen the example here of the
transportation process where

59
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.590 
we could see in this model
quite nicely the steps

60
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.990 
that have already been performed of this
transportation process and the upcoming

61
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.480 
steps as well without going into
the detail of some IT

62
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.860 
system where which might have
records that represent exactly

63
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.290 
what happens there. This is a much
nicer view of this complexity

64
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.090 
though the complexity of the IT world of this
transportation company is somehow hidden

65
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.880 
and therefore
that makes

66
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.210 
makes me let's say understand this
process status quite good.

67
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.260 
Alright we have here the children's
toys or this train,

68
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.330 
and also here we have an original which
is the real train the real steam

69
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.690 
train and of course
this little model behaves

70
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.930 
similar to that one. Of course
it's far more a simple or

71
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.190 
let's say a representation
of this original.

72
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.370 
Here we see two different models
of the human, the human body

73
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.960 
so to speak which are different
in their modelling goals. So here

74
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.440 
we have let's say a
very simple pictogram

75
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.570 
type of picture that just gives
us an impression you should

76
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.390 
not walk through here. So the human
body is abstracted quite quite a lot

77
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.460 
and for a different modelling goal
we can abstract that say from

78
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.500 
other aspects of humans but go
into much more detail in the

79
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.590 
inner structure of the body using
this skeleton. So we might

80
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.340 
have all regionals which have
different models. For each modeling

81
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.040 
goal we have one model that
uses the pragmatic feature

82
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.360 
so that I can study certain
things using this model that

83
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.150 
would be far too complex to study if
I would do that on the original.

84
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.560 
Prescriptive models prescribe
how to build an original. So

85
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.370 
descriptive models describe
originals, prescriptive models

86
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.140 
prescribe how to build an original that
at this time might not be existing

87
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.130 
or is not existing. And here we have
the example again of the kitchen.

88
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.740 
So the right hand side the picture on
the right hand sign we've seen already

89
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.730 
where we have the map the
architectural map of these

90
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.180 
kitchen with all the measures.
On the left hand side we have

91
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.980 
generated its picture of how
the kitchen would look like

92
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:22.130 
the end of the day. So here we see in
exactly that that's the view from here

93
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.950 
so that's exactly what
we see here in this example.

94
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.990 
It's also a model of the - is
also a prescriptive model, it

95
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.780 
details or it shows how that
looks like. It has a different

96
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.150 
modelling goal
which suits to

97
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.200 
provide to the end user or to
the person who would then

98
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.480 
use this kitchen a visual
impression of how that all would

99
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.560 
look like. The right hand side
plan would not be very helpful

100
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.210 
in that but the right hand side
plan is very helpful for the

101
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.980 
engineer who builds or for other handicrafts
people who build and to install

102
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.610 
the kitchen in
this room.

103
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:06.680 
So the question is if a model is
descriptive or prescriptive.

104
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.460 
Can we take a look at the model and
say well the model is descriptive

105
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.900 
or the model is
prescriptive?

106
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:18.100 
And we like to discuss this using
also the kitchen plan again.

107
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.360 
And we cannot really say
whether this is descriptive

108
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.040 
or prescriptive as order to you
as being prescriptive because

109
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.470 
I told a little bit about the
content of about the context

110
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.170 
of this room and this room needs
to have kitchen appliances

111
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.350 
and so forth and therefore we
need to design it so that the

112
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.160 
engineers can then build
the kitchen or install

113
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.670 
the kitchen. But once the kitchen
is installed that could

114
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.570 
that's these models would have
a descriptive character.

115
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.390 
So the models describe

116
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.800 
the visual representation
of the view of this kitchen

117
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.550 
the right hand side on the left
hand side who have all the

118
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.170 
measures and the measures described
the room exactly, though

119
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.940 
the measures are still of a descriptive
character relative to the room.

120
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.930 
So in general we cannot tell from
the model itself whether it is

121
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.530 
a descriptive model or
a prescriptive model.

122
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.580 
We can only tell it if we know the
modelling goals and the modelling goal is

123
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.290 
I need a plan to build a kitchen
that I know is a prescriptive plan.

124
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.340 
When I have this picture that
shows how that should look

125
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.130 
like it's a prescriptive one, but
if we have other models and

126
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.920 
we can derive we can

127
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.930 
take a look at the model and then say
well the model describes this kitchen

128
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.310 
and once the kitchen is built the
right hand side model might

129
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.350 
as well describe how
that looks like.

130
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:54.860 
Modeling is not only relevant and
important for us as humans in the

131
00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.910 
in our daily life and using the examples
we've been using before which would know

132
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.710 
non IT examples but of course
also modelling plays a key

133
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.900 
role in computer
science.

134
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.750 
Which is not surprising since
computer science deals

135
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.390 
with design of system design of
complex systems especially IT systems.

136
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:24.660 
And computer science has developed
different types of models

137
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.710 
and the next slides I'd like to discuss
briefly some of the types of models

138
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.090 
that we are using in computer science.
So its like to start with UML

139
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:42.800 
use case diagrams and these
diagrams give you an idea of the

140
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.180 
users of a system, of the system
boundaries, of the functionality, the

141
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.710 
big blocks of functionality inside
of the system in which of the

142
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.630 
users of the actors would
excess certain functionality.

143
00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.990 
So here we have an automatic teller machine,
we have a customer, an administrator

144
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.300 
and we have here another actor
which is which is the bank

145
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:09.930 
and it tells you that customers
can withdraw money but

146
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.650 
can also do a money transfer
and can also deposit money

147
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.940 
and so forth. So that gives you
an idea of the boundaries of

148
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:23.350 
a system and the key actors interacting
with a system to be built.

149
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:30.150 
So these models are clearly prescriptive
models because they prescribe

150
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.480 
how systems need to be built,
what are the components which

151
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.860 
functionality needs to
be covered by a system.

152
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.870 
Data models are also widely used in
computer science of course and here

153
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:49.920 
a variant of an entity relationship
diagram with cardinalities

154
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.370 
where we have elements or entities
of the real world customers,

155
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.610 
orders and products and their
relationship models. Here the

156
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.450 
original is the data and we can see on
all these examples we quite nicely see

157
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.340 
the abstraction and the
abstraction is just that the

158
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.640 
complex building of a
customer with all the

159
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:18.820 
with all the properties are abstracted
to modelling customers containing

160
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.780 
data for attributes, for city discount,
customer name and customer id.

161
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.770 
So all other aspects of the
customer are abstracted

162
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:32.340 
abstracted from. However the pragmatic
feature also holds for the customer since

163
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.350 
the customer can be
substituted by these entity type

164
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.920 
customer and their relationship
to orders for instance.

165
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.980 
We have architecture models.
Architecture models play an important

166
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.000 
role in computer science as
they show the building blocks

167
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.770 
of a complex system and how
these building blocks interact.

168
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:03.550 
This is also a picture from the
BPM book where we have elements

169
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.910 
like the process engine interacting
with the process environment

170
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.160 
invoking services using service
providers and so forth. Here

171
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.570 
architecture models show the
building blocks and how

172
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.020 
these building
blocks interact.

173
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.190 
And of course process models.
Process models are also

174
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:25.530 
models in computer science
that simplifies complexity

175
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.390 
of the world. Business processes
if you think about it a very

176
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.450 
complex entity very complex
thing so we need to abstract

177
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.130 
we need to concentrate on the
main elements that are relevant

178
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:43.180 
for the modeling goal and the insurance
claim example we came up with this

179
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.370 
type of process model. Well we
have the main activities and

180
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.800 
the way these activities
are coordinated.

181
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.920 
Alright that concludes
video clip 1.2

182
00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.090 
on modeling. We discussed modelling as
a human activity. In the modeling

183
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:06.040 
basics we discussed the Stachoviak
properties of models - the mapping

184
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.960 
Feature, the abstraction feature
and the pragmatic feature.

185
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:14.120 
We looked at descriptive models and
prescriptive models and discussed

186
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:19.650 
that you cannot tell from the model
whether it is descriptive or prescriptive.

187
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.830 
Sometimes and we start with a
prescriptive model and then later

188
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.080 
It turns to a descriptive model
like also application example.

189
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.680 
And finally we talked about the
modelling different types of models

190
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.500 
in computer science and that
concludes videoclip 1.2.

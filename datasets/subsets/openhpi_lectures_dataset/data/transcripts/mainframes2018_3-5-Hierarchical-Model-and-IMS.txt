00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.539 
Hello, it's me again, Wolfgang Greis, from

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.119 
the European Mainframe Academy.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.279 
And this next video clip I want to talk about

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.659 
the hierarchical data model and the most

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.509 
important implementation, especially

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.569 
in mainframe environments called I.M.S.

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.329 
(Information Management System) from

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.330 
IBM.

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.729 
It all started in the early

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.869 
60s.

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.869 
On May 25, 1961,

12
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.599 
there was a famous, very famous speech

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.949 
of John F.

14
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.099 
Kennedy in the Congress,

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.799 
and he came out with his

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.159 
vision. Before this decade is out,

17
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.429 
we are landing a man on the moon and return

18
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.419 
him safely to the earth.

19
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.689 
Now, this video clip on YouTube,

20
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.829 
showing this Congress speech.

21
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.739 
And we all know in between it

22
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.769 
happened, though, Apollo 11

23
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.768 
was launched and

24
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.439 
the moon landing took place

25
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.079 
in 1969.

26
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.049 
And this all was really

27
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.349 
only possible because really

28
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.799 
huge IT environment supporting

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.219 
this preparation of the

30
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.429 
moon landing.

31
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.809 
And it started in

32
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.719 
the United States with North American

33
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.809 
Aviation in partnership with IBM,

34
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.959 
and they fulfilled the requirements

35
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.929 
for an I.T. environment to manage huge

36
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.909 
bills of material.

37
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.579 
And this is really important to understand this bills

38
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.249 
of material for the spacecraft in

39
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.809 
1965.

40
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.569 
Apollo as example of spacecraft, had two

41
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.709 
million parts.

42
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.009 
And these had to be organized

43
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.169 
from an I.T.

44
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.899 
environment supported. It involved

45
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.809 
12 people from IBM, 10 from North

46
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.110 
American Aviation and three from Caterpillar.

47
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.519 
Very interesting collaboration.

48
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.189 
They designed and developed a software system

49
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.639 
that was called Information Control System.

50
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.549 
And the second part of this environment

51
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.939 
was the Data Language Interface.

52
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.879 
And the abbreviation was

53
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.880 
ICS/DLI.

54
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.159 
The team completed the first release in

55
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.099 
1967 and in April

56
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.099 
1968, ICS was

57
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.009 
up and running. And as you all know,

58
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.739 
in 1969, Apollo

59
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.409 
11 landed on the

60
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.109 
moon. And it

61
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.699 
was on the

62
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.929 
20th of July in 1969

63
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.460 
and the

64
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.509 
ICS was afterwards relaunched from IBM

65
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.231 
as Information Management System/360

66
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.219 
and the name information management system

67
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.649 
is available until today.

68
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.129 
So there were a lot of versions in between

69
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.169 
of I.M.S.

70
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.139 
and it's, as I

71
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.079 
already said, it's still in place today and a very

72
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.389 
important implementation of the

73
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.120 
hierarchical data model.

74
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.776 
By the way, Five Systems/360

75
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.439 
machines were used in Houston

76
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.169 
by NASA for the

77
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.879 
Apollo 11 mission.

78
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.199 
Bills of material is redesignated

79
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.009 
for hierarchical structures, and that's why, as

80
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.749 
an example, also BMW,

81
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.719 
Volkswagen, Daimler, these are

82
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.629 
big automobile factories

83
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.039 
in Germany.

84
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.709 
All of them use IMS for parts

85
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.710 
management.

86
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.219 
IMS as a hierarchical database management system

87
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.919 
is really important, and one

88
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.799 
thing that was introduced in this

89
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.709 
environment was the separation of

90
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.179 
data and application code.

91
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.359 
And this separation in the IMS

92
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.509 
environment was made with the Data Language

93
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.479 
Interface already mentioned.

94
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.809 
IMS controls the access and recovery of data

95
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.489 
and application programs.

96
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.459 
With this Data Language Interface can access

97
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.639 
and navigate through the data by using

98
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.369 
these interfaces.

99
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.249 
And this separation established a

100
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.369 
very new paradigm for application programing.

101
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.459 
The application code could now focus

102
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.579 
on the manipulation of data without

103
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.339 
the complications and overhead

104
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.249 
associated with access and recovery

105
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.619 
of data.

106
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.829 
And this was

107
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.919 
really an important start

108
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.799 
in these times for getting up and

109
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.410 
running with database management systems.

110
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.929 
Yeah, that was the video clip

111
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.139 
to hierarchical databases and

112
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.339 
I.M.S.

113
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.729 
and as always, for questions and remarks,

114
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.489 
please use the discussion forum on the

115
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.769 
openHPI platform.

116
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.679 
Thanks for attending. And see you in one

117
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.239 
of our next video clips.

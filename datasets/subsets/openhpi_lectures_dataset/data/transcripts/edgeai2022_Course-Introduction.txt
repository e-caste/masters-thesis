00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.259 
Hello and very welcome.

2
00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:12.570 
As you probably know, AI has made astonishing breakthroughs in the recent years and deep learning technology is like the

3
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.660 
javelin, the chrome.

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.320 
The success of Deep Learning has brought us a lot of breakthroughs.

5
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.980 
For example, the alpha zero defeats human champions in strategy games.

6
00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:30.559 
AI surprises human performance in various computer vision and speech recognition task.

7
00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:40.420 
Deep learning is widely used in a large variety of applications such as autonomous driving material science, medical imaging,

8
00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.200 
biological research, Deep mind's.

9
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:55.399 
New AI offer for two can predict the 98.5% of human protein restructures, almost solving the problem that has plagued the

10
00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.049 
biology community for 50 years.

11
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:10.750 
More recently, open AI is a new AI Data E two model can create original realistic images and art from the text, text description

12
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.650 
It can combine concepts, attributes and styles.

13
00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:22.980 
It shows the probability to transfer important semantic information from one modality to another.

14
00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:32.450 
We can see the example images from the left bottom of this slide. So from nature language to viral representation,

15
00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:38.019 
they already achieved great improvement in the cross modality representation

16
00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:48.299 
learning. Another example that 82 model can also take an image and create different variations of it inspired by the original

17
00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.049 
image.

18
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.659 
You can look at the example on the bottom right.

19
00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:05.329 
On the other hand, deep learning still faces the limitations, many limitations such as a strong dependence on expensive, extensive

20
00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:14.569 
training data and high computing power. In particular with the rapid development of communication technology and the data

21
00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:23.150 
transmission bandwidth, AI applications are quickly evolving from centralized cloud computing to the day centralized edge AI

22
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:33.030 
paradigm, thus making deep learning model more efficient, reducing the carbon emissions generated by AI computing and improving

23
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.960 
the applicability for numerous applications from mobile platform and other low power devices becomes highly desirable.

24
00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:53.400 
So, this course will mainly address the following topics. Because this is an advanced course,

25
00:02:53.409 --> 00:03:02.199 
we recommend that you have already studied machine learning and deep learning introductory courses in the past. But to help

26
00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:10.520 
you better understand the content of this course, we will briefly explain the basic deep learning knowledge technologies related

27
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:19.710 
to this course. We will focus on the compression technology of deep learning models including compact network design, knowledge

28
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.060 
desolation, quantization techniques and pruning techniques.

29
00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:32.750 
We will introduce some more recent techniques and applications in the decentralized and collaborative learning scenarios.

30
00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:41.469 
We will explain our understanding of the concept of edge AI and talk about the carbon progress and the future potentials of

31
00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.219 
edge AI

32
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:47.659 
from the perspective of algorithm software and hardware development.

33
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.060 
Our teaching team comes from multimedia and machine learning research group of Hasso Plattner Institute.

34
00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:09.050 
We have been engaged in deep learning research since 2014. Joseph is our PhD student. He's about to complete his PhD study.

35
00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.009 
Christian

36
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:15.560 
already finished his PhD and started a new journey at the German aerospace center.

37
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.560 
He also has significant contribution to this course during his last couple of months at HPI.

38
00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.620 
My name is Haojin. I'm a senior researcher at HPI.

39
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.939 


40
00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.259 
and the group leader.

41
00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:33.250 
I also serve as Privatdozent at the University of Potsdam.

42
00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:43.000 
As I said, we recommend that you have already started machine learning and deep learning introductory courses.

43
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.459 
You also have basic knowledge of python and are familiar with derivatives.

44
00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:54.850 
The target learners are students, professionals and lifelong learners.

45
00:04:55.339 --> 00:05:00.560 
The time required for the study is about 6-9 hours for each week.

46
00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:07.610 
This is a specific weekly plan.

47
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.199 
First week we will be talking about the relevant deep learning basics.

48
00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:19.730 
In the second week we will learn how the deep neural networks architecture evolved and some important techniques will be

49
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:28.689 
highlighted. In the week three and four we will study several model compression techniques and in weeks five and six we will

50
00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:29.589 
introduce edge

51
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.439 
AI and present some interesting topics regarding algorithm software and hardware in the edge

52
00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:37.660 
AI scenarios.

53
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.319 
How is the local environment set up?

54
00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:49.160 
You probably want to know or what you will need for our practical task.

55
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.560 
Yes we have practical task during this MOOC lecture.

56
00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:55.060 
It's very simple.

57
00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:00.620 
You just need a standard web browser installed on your laptop or desktop computer.

58
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:07.649 
You will need a kaggle account since we will do most coding exercises using kaggle notebooks.

59
00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.560 
Some further general information of the course.

60
00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.750 
Our course is six weeks.

61
00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.759 
The language is in english.

62
00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:26.550 
We will get the confirmation of participations when accessing more than 50% of the course materials.

63
00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:37.129 
If you can get at least 50% of the credit points, you can gather certificate for the course, 60% of the scores come from

64
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.060 
the final exam and 40% come from the homework.

65
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.740 
So let's get started.

66
00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.529 
Please go to the next video.

67
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.060 
We will talk about a brief history of neural networks.

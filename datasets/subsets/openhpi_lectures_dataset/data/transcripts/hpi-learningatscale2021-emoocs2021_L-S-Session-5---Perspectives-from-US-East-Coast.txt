WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960 
okay. we're ready to begin.
i'm ken kittinger and welcome to

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.530 
this session at of learning at scale.
we have three great papers.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.180 
i'm really excited to hear more about them.

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.230 
the first one provides a really nice

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.280 
taxonomy of different ways to think about supporting students

7
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.100 
motivational engagement their self-regulated learning.

8
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.920 
and excited to hear about that we have two other papers following

9
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.350 
up that are both related to learning sourcing learner
sourcing and super interesting

10
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.070 
results from those we have.

11
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.790 
presentations of about ten minutes and ten minutes for q a.
and then

12
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.580 
well we'll have plenty of time for interaction in this session.

13
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.360 
so look forward to your questions feel free

14
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.350 
to put questions in the chat and raise your hand.

15
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.060 
and we'll take your questions for the participants sir

16
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.230 
as we go and maybe even have some time for general

17
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.370 
discussion at the end.

18
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
hey my name is young joe casey student at cornell university.

19
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
i will present a synthesis paper applying the behavior
change technique taxonomy

20
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.120 
from public health interventions to educational research.

21
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.080 
the behavior change technique taxonomy is a widely adopted coding scheme
in public killed.

22
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.830 
it is used to accumulate knowledge learned from empirical studies

23
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.180 
and to better communicate between stakeholders in public health.

24
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.380 
in this presentation.
i'll talk about what the taxonomy is

25
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
what it can be useful in educational research and

26
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.230 
while we can do it in educational research

27
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:12.210 
behavior change technique,
or bct is the smallest unit of analysis in the taxonomy

28
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.150 
the taxonomy defines ninety three bct 's in a fine grid manner.

29
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.200 
for example there are nine bct keys defined related
to goal-setting and plenty

30
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.350 
thus an intervention typically consists to go

31
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.550 
multiple vz t's who interventions with the vc key taxonomy while also

32
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.050 
compare similar interventions and identify effective vc keys

33
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.530 
bct folksonomy provides detailed guidelines for classification.

34
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.830 
it has other well established techniques in the definitions

35
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.310 
and allows coding more than one bct for an intervention technique.

36
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.390 
for example the definition of the vc key demonstration of the behavior

37
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
major's fatherly was as a frequently used term in psychology.

38
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.400 
it also specifies other cities to occurred and walk condition.

39
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.560 
in the taxonomy we cities are grouped into sixteen clusters

40
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.260 
based on psychological mechanisms.

41
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.280 
this clusterings makes it easy to navigate the cities and code accordingly

42
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.290 
after coding we can have a quick overview of what psychological

43
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.550 
mechanism of intervention mostly realized on

44
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.470 
the bct taxonomy is evolving.

45
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.880 
there is a taxonomy developed based on the bct taxonomy specifically for

46
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.580 
techniques for morning physical activities and healthy eating

47
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.330 
recently war cross tures like

48
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.720 
personalisation and chemical occasion are suggested

49
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.970 
reflecting at the advanced technologiesï¼Œsuch as we are time

50
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.920 
sensing and machine learning

51
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.900 
why can the bct taxonomy be useful in education research behavior.

52
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.860 
and psychological science perspective can help students

53
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:26.610 
persist in their learning process.
for example we all have some experiences that

54
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.850 
we planned to study regularly.

55
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.620 
but actually it was challenging to keep up with the study plan

56
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.560 
taking the behavior perspective when intervention can help curtius

57
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.960 
said he habits.

58
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.570 
the bct taxonomy is developed from public health,

59
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.980 
but it is still useful for educational researchers, because there are

60
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.450 
similarities and interventions between the two fields

61
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.510 
both target goal-oriented behaviors and require a long term commitment

62
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.110 
in other words participants need to engage in various activities

63
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.430 
for a long period of time to achieve the intervention goal,

64
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.740 
then what can we do with the obesity taxonomy in educational research.

65
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.440 
we can catalyze best interventions in his current arranges and

66
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.580 
develop new interventions

67
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.550 
to demonstrate the feasibility of using
it as a coding scheme in educational research.

68
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.420 
we could have four large scale interventions with the taxonomy.

69
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.410 
the interventions share the strong similarities
in their whole context and design

70
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.530 
the aim to improve attrition and massive open online
courses that reached

71
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.950 
millions of people all around the world.
and they provided course

72
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.010 
takers with short writing activities at the beginning of the course.

73
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.260 
our coding shows that these interventions used
different bc keys meaning.

74
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.010 
they're leveraging different psychological canvas those

75
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.560 
mackinnon has current interventions by adding one or more bc keys.

76
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.630 
for example the plan making intervention prompt
course takers to make plants

77
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.190 
which class full to having to be cities problem solving
an action plenty.

78
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.030 
in addition we could have another vct behavior experiment.

79
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.360 
we can our command keeping a record of when participants followed

80
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.150 
the plan and when they did not this will help identify obstacles
to following plans,

81
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.820 
and eventually help them make a better plan.

82
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.580 
the bct taxonomy can serve as an evidence base foundation.

83
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.880 
for developing new interventions in education

84
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.890 
bc theories such as associated learning
and heavy formation suggest that

85
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.520 
we can shape a habit when repeatedly engaged in the behavior.

86
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.250 
In the same context or in association with another neutral stimulus,

87
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.460 
for example to cultivate a habit of sitting at regular times.

88
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.390 
an intervention can encourage participants to schedule to depart

89
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.770 
immediately after their other daily routine, such as walking a dog.

90
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.870 
a message can be sent during or after the chosen daily routine
to remind participants

91
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.750 
that it is time to study.

92
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.700 
and summary the pct taxonomy as a fine grained according scheme

93
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.960 
for behavior change techniques evolved by public health researchers.

94
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:56.150 
the pct taxonomy can be used in educational research
to synthesize past interventions.

95
00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.610 
in hence current interventions and create new interventions

96
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.610 
more examples are available in the paper.

97
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.030 
about how public health research uses the pct taxonomy and

98
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:14.680 
how we can develop or improve interventions with it in education?

99
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:21.760 
thank you. wonderful presentation.
thank you very much young.

100
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.880 
we have time for questions and

101
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.310 
young,
if you want to share your slides, if anybody wants has

102
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.360 
any questions that might be relevant to some of your particular slides

103
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.390 
that could be potentially useful.

104
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.130 
while people are thinking.

105
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.260 
one thing oh,  Mar has a question.

106
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.520 
i'll save mine go ahead, Mar can you unmute yourself.

107
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.260 
yes, i'm there.
thank you very much young for your presentation.

108
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.170 
it's very interesting and i think the results are very

109
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.520 
very cool.

110
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.910 
i wanted to know if we are trying to do this.

111
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.520 
similar change of behaviors in terms of self-regulation

112
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.950 
in hybrid learning environments and some of the

113
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.090 
of the interventions that you use.
i think that could be useful

114
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:30.170 
in a hybrid learning environment like
the one regarding the planification.

115
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:36.340 
for example i was wondering if you think that we could maybe reuse

116
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.470 
similar interventions that you use in a hybrid learning scenario.

117
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.660 
if we can how do we do it.

118
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.540 
oh thanks for the question um what do you mean by hybrid learning

119
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.080 
and blended learning or there are many many different definitions.

120
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.620 
for example when the students they do some of the stuff online

121
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.310 
and then they come back to the classroom and they discuss like

122
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.860 
kind of flipping in the classroom.

123
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:15.610 
but we want also to promote the usage of
the content course content outside

124
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:16.840 
the classrooms

125
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.880 
during their home home time.

126
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:29.810 
so i don't know if your intervention could be useful in this context.

129
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.000 
so for this particular synthesis paper.

130
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:42.100 
we only the catalyze the current interventions and that includes planning.

131
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.120 
but this is like exactly why we were interested in looking

132
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.730 
at the pct taxonomy if you want to have an intervention

133
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.020 
to create an intervention.

134
00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.810 
we can actually look at what the probably killed interventions.

135
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.260 
people have gone before cause they have a longer history

136
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.820 
and changing people's behavior like how to promote

137
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.490 
healthy eating or how to make people engage in

138
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:20.150 
physical activities like that kind of thing.
so i personally do not have an answer for your question.

139
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.550 
but i would like highly recommend

140
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.060 
like looking at the taxonomy.

141
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:34.190 
yet they kind of like have all this like evidence collected
and made this categories.

142
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.190 
so i think you could be

143
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.290 
fired why what

144
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.930 
public health people like me have done.

145
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.720 
i think they do have some hybrid context.

146
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.980 
i have a simple clarify kind of clarification question
or informational question which is

147
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.020 
there are a lot of behavior change techniques in this taxonomy right.

148
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.640 
but i didn't actually

149
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.710 
get a sense for how many do you know but roughly speaking.

150
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.720 
is it like forty or fifty.

151
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.310 
i need three texts ninety three yeah or in the taxonomy.

152
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:20.520 
but not yet it is overwhelming to having that numbe.

153
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.740 
but it is a higher kick a higher kick a

154
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:33.080 
higher kick or a six on me.
so they have like sixteen clusters though.

155
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:38.310 
if you think a technique is relevant to the planning,

156
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.780 
then you can just look up that planning clusters and then

157
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.920 
see what technique you can use.

158
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.460 
so even though there are more than many.

159
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.240 
there's also good news in that they're ninety three and maybe.

160
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.760 
it's a good good transition to steven's question.
but you know i think that

161
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.080 
suggests that there's so much.
there's so many good ideas out there.

162
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.610 
that can be used to help increase students engagement in courses.

163
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.930 
yeah, so steven's got a question you wanna on meet stephen and
ask it out loud.

164
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.930 
yeah sure great presentation i was wondering

165
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.330 
related what can was asking about.
so for the ninety three bct s

166
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.240 
and you kind of targeted a few at least in the presentation

167
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.950 
probably more the paper was wondering,
if there's kind of existing

168
00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:32.230 
research or guidelines on like how to specifically target
and have intervention

169
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.980 
for the specific bct s that makes sense not in the yet.

170
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.020 
thanks for the question.

171
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.110 
not in the educational context.
but there are multiple like

172
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.040 
leadership review or medical analysis based on this taxonomy in

173
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:55.660 
public killed a literature.
they are like plenty so they all have

174
00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:01.190 
their own context and their own target behavior
and they also help like what

175
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.330 
combinations of techniques have been effective for which population.

176
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.090 
so there are like a lot of like resources regarding this

177
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.690 
pcts and how we can use them.

178
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.610 
but there is none in the educational context.

179
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.770 
that's why i really really wanted to in the present.

180
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.360 
there is this kind of taxonomy and there has been a lot of like work

181
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.200 
although it is another fit but it is still like trying to change

182
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.760 
someone's behavior in a better direction.

184
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.690 
marcus has a question.

185
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.730 
yeah thanks great presentation.

186
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:50.840 
i have one question we did a bit comparable work
with game design patterns.

187
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:57.330 
and there we also had the problem like.
there are many of these game design patterns.

188
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:02.380 
so the complexity first of all is in choosing
the right pattern for your problem customizing it.

189
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.790 
but also the combinations so the question is two-fold

190
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.230 
did you come across any kind of relations between bct and game

191
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:20.180 
design or design patterns,
and second what's about the combination of different bct.

193
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.790 
is it always clear which pattern to select for which purpose

194
00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.730 
or which bct sorry.

195
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.690 
square your first question.

196
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.830 
i'm not really familiar with all the game design techniques.

197
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:46.700 
but i am sure that there are some overlapping techniques,

198
00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:52.790 
if it is for changing someone's behavior like promoting a certain
type of behavior.

199
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.040 
so yeah sorry i don't know what you're vata.

200
00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.740 
but for the second one.

201
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:06.100 
yes typically one intervention has a multiple vct techniques

202
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.210 
and in the taxonomy each definition of electricity's has

203
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.840 
some guidelines.

204
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.310 
so like one technique the intervention technique

205
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:28.670 
can have like four visited can cause cross to multiple visited.

206
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:34.000 
and each bct says that if it is also used in this context.

207
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.440 
then you should could like this specific t as well.

208
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.750 
so i think that

209
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.690 
so the fact that the visit is so fine-grained

210
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.100 
really helps us to identify what combinations

211
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.460 
will be factor and also

212
00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.890 
it is not really biased to one theory,

213
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.710 
because one definition also contains like multiple terms

214
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.890 
used in different fields like psychology or public health.

215
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:17.090 
so they get one intervention you can have multiple.

216
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.700 
and it is easily detectable with what combination we have.

217
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.570 
i seem to recall that the paper indicated that there are updates

218
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:31.510 
of the framework that actually include some i guess gamification

219
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.700 
principles which might be part of an overlap with the

220
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.830 
principles marcus is referring to,
but probably a very partial overlap.

221
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.220 
yeah i think it's a great question.

222
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.310 
ali we have time for one more question.

223
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.550 
we'll take yours if you can unmeet yourself.

224
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.670 
ok thank you for your good presentation.

225
00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.970 
my question would be around motivation motivation in health too mine

226
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.600 
might be taken more seriously than motivation in education.

227
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:14.370 
how would this bct adapted adapted techniques

228
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.350 
and promote this motive self motivation in education.

229
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:25.350 
oh this is a really important question.
i also had this question and

230
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:33.300 
it listen our paper we specifically focused on behavior aside of

231
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.590 
education. so self motivation as very important.

232
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.470 
but it may touch on more complex psychological mechanisms.

233
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.250 
so it is a bit beyond,

234
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.200 
our beyond the scope of our paper.

235
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.310 
but we can certainly increase the self motivation

236
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:03.040 
by increasing the engagement. that's why i thought,

237
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.630 
but i don't have a clear answer for your question.

238
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.700 
yeah that's one thing i say those mehta analyses would be great
to collect on.

239
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.390 
i don't know if people know about this visible learning book.

240
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.750 
but this is one

241
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:25.670 
doesn't get these are more teaching oriented you know
not so much self-regulated learning.

242
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.790 
but i wonder, if there's a resource related to b c ts like that

243
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.290 
or one could be created,
because you know this isn't just meta-analyses

244
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.800 
as the sub-title says.
this is a summary of eight hundred meta-analyses

245
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.100 
which you know you don't get very much detail in this.

246
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.520 
but it's a great reference book to find stuff.
and it seems like the

247
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.060 
bct is just a wonderful way again to also find

248
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.760 
possible interventions.
and it does seem like they

249
00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:00.520 
would work in educational settings.
so it's great that you've brought those to us.

250
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:10.210 
i'm excellent so we are ready to move on to our next presentation.

251
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.880 
stephen moore are you going to share your screen for us.

252
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.590 
yeah well as you're setting up as i mentioned in the beginning.

253
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.680 
the next two presentations make connections to learning learner sources.

254
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.890 
so yeah take it away stephen everyone my video is a little rough.

255
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.490 
so apologize if you watch,
so i'm gonna do this one live

256
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.530 
hopefully do a little better.

257
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.280 
i'm here to present my work on examining the effects of student

258
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.040 
participation and performance on the quality of learner source's
multiple choice questions.

259
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.450 
so model choice questions since force probably referred to

260
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.670 
as mc q's are the most popular form of assessment likely due

261
00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.220 
to their efficiency in scoring the fact that it can be graded

262
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.390 
objectively and the great analysis you can do on them and traditionally.

263
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.060 
mc q's as a recall where you know they may ask for definition

264
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.320 
of a word or something. but they can also assess kind of at

265
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.100 
the application level where you might have to

266
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.350 
do some calculations and apply different bits of knowledge.

267
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.280 
and mc q's offer a scaleable and equitable means of assessment

268
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.590 
in low and high stakes environments. so as classes continue

269
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.370 
to grow and come online we're going to need these kind of types of assessments

270
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.810 
and the quality of mcq can vary drastically depending on words,

271
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.100 
as you can imagine an mc q place in an exam might be kind of

272
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.210 
a higher quality than one just low stakes
that was made by an instructor.

273
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.360 
the previous work has actually leveraged learner sourcing to

274
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.010 
construct mc q's.
but in a less natural context. so i might be

275
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.380 
preaching to the choir.
but just to formally define it learner

276
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.440 
sourcing is a form of crowdsourcing in which students contribute

277
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.880 
novel content for future learners while engaging in a meaningful learning experience themselves.

278
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.510 
so platforms like pure wise quiz icl and ripple have actually

279
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.050 
used students to generate these mc q's are great systems by the way.

280
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.460 
but they're kind of usually external.
so don't really needed

281
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.700 
to where students are working and they may be working in cannabis
or some other system,

282
00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.070 
then they'll go to one of these to make them c q's

283
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.400 
and then kind of go back,
so there's a little bit of context shifting there.

284
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.740 
so we wanted to see how we could naturally engage students

285
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.840 
in this mcq generation process, and previous work has indicated

286
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.170 
that actually having students make these mc q's does benefit their learning

287
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.850 
to some degree and ultimately we wanted to really understand

288
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.440 
how students both participate and interact with this mcq generation process

289
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.210 
ultimately hoping to improve the student's learning experience.

290
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.870 
and hopefully improving the quality of questions they might generate.

291
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.950 
so just to formally define the research questions we targeted.

292
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.770 
we first wanted to see how participation and online course

293
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.890 
materials impact students' contributions to learn resource activities.

294
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.440 
we also wanted to know what the quality of student generated

295
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.350 
multiple choice questions are from an optional
low stakes learning environment.

296
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.290 
and finally we wanted to see if certain student interactions

297
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.290 
that are online courses are associated with the quality of

298
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.810 
multiple choice questions that they generate.

299
00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.080 
so we first deployed our mcq generation task in online chemistry

300
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.380 
courses ran during the summer and fall of twenty twenty.

301
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.140 
this focused on a week long segment of
the course devoted to a single topic.

302
00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.960 
and the kind of system we deployed it in was the open learning

303
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.000 
initiative which has instructional text videos and a bunch

304
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.700 
of activities like drag-and-drop or
more choice questions short answer questions.

305
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.640 
and there are six modules for this week-long section and in

306
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.630 
total there are fourteen completely optional low stakes activities

307
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.780 
embedded throughout the course.
so one of those might be like

308
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.820 
drag and drop question one might be
a video with a free response question.

309
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.000 
and that would count as a single low stakes activity.

310
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.910 
so just to give you an overview of the study we had two hundred

311
00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.870 
one students in total taking this online chemistry course

312
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:42.020 
we had fifty seven of them choose to generate mcq,
because it was optional.

313
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.790 
so they could just skip it we didn't make them do it so fifty

314
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.060 
seven of them chose to submit one. we then had experts review

315
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.170 
the quality using a nineteen item rubric and we evaluated the

316
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.970 
cognitive level of the question again to look,
if it was recall or application.

317
00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.020 
so this is what the activity looked like kind of hacked together

318
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.720 
from a free response and short answer text boxes and we kind

319
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.450 
of wanted to be very bare-bones and low stakes,
because i really

320
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.370 
wanted this to be able to be employed into other systems that

321
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.970 
also had like a free response type question.
so they would input the text here

322
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.140 
and their answer choices here and again completely optional.

323
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:15.920 
they could just skip it.

324
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.900 
so to evaluate the quality of c q is primarily done through two ways.

325
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.740 
the first is using item response theory which has some downfalls,

326
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.930 
because if you're testing questions to see, if they're good

327
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.650 
or bad you're exposing students to potentially bad questions.

328
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.410 
so we didn't really want to do that.
so we took a more qualitative

329
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.180 
approach and applied what's known as an item writing flaws rubric

330
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.270 
which typically in past research consist of fifteen to thirty

331
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.500 
one different criteria for what makes a good or quality mcq.

332
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.240 
and these criteria include things like avoiding
the use of absolute terms

333
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.330 
don't always have your longest option be the correct one and

334
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.010 
don't repeat a word in the stem of the correct answer.

335
00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.170 
so for instance you would never want a question like
which of the following always happens.

336
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.660 
that's like a bad mcq.

337
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.090 
and in addition to applying the rubric again we did assess

338
00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.450 
the ai cognitive level of the question to see if it was at

339
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.560 
the recall level or more of the application level.

340
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.790 
so just to give you an example of what i mean when i say the

341
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.710 
recall level take this question here

342
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.860 
ask which some atomic particles are neutral or uncharged the atom.

343
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.640 
and so it's basically asking you for definition here.

344
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.750 
so you just need to know that to get the correct answer one

345
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.720 
of the flaws here is that it has a logical q since the question

346
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.800 
actually states neutral or in charge you may be able to clue

347
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.170 
in that the answer is neutron.
because neutral is very similar to neutron.

348
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.270 
it also has an implausible distractor since the question states

349
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.430 
in the atom therefore the answer is probably not atom,

350
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.750 
because an atom can't be in the atom.

351
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.620 
so there was a recall with two flaws here's an example of an

352
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.510 
application level question as you can see here it basically

353
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.450 
has you take these two numbers and do a small computation on them

354
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.940 
to identify the given element.

355
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.350 
and this didn't have any flaws so this was a rare but perfect

356
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.200 
question by the student that you could use.

357
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.990 
so towards the first question we wanted to know how participation

358
00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.740 
in online course materials impacts students' contribution
to these activities.

359
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:06.270 
we had a roughly twenty percent of the students submitted mcq

360
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.360 
which is pretty good for learner sourcing admittedly thirty

361
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.320 
seven of the two hundred one students didn't interact with

362
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.420 
any activities in the course.
so again there are fourteen activities

363
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.110 
all completely optional.
so some students just looked at the materials.

364
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.170 
but none actually interact with any of them.

365
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.900 
we had nine point seven five of these fourteen activities were

366
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.210 
done on average by students again some students total fourteen

367
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.580 
some zero and of course all the numbers in between.

368
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.320 
and we did find that the activity steps completed by students

369
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.560 
that actually did the mcq generation task versus a did not

370
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.330 
varied. so we had about forty five on average a steps a step

371
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.450 
being, if you work with the activity at all.
you're doing a step

372
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.470 
versus the did not which kinda makes sense because if you sipped

373
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.230 
the mcq generation task you typically did less activities.

374
00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.270 
also toward arcy one we found that students roughly spent eighteen

375
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.780 
half minutes working on all the activities throughout the course

376
00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.020 
and students that did the task worked on activities longer

377
00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.820 
than students that did not do the task. and this isn't to say

378
00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.370 
that the task itself took more time because the task only took

379
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.410 
two and a half minutes on average to make one of these mc q's.

380
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.640 
but usually students had this kind of completion as attitude where

381
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.720 
most students did either all the activities or kind of skipped

382
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.780 
a bunch of the activities. so if you were student or did all

383
00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.050 
fourteen activities you spent more time on the tasks in general

384
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.740 
and you also likely did them cq generation test,

385
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.640 
because you just wanted to do all the activities in the course.

386
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.490 
so to rq two we wanted to know the quality of student generated

387
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.680 
multiple-choice questions was from this optional
and low stakes learning environment.

388
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.250 
so in total about two thirds of the questions students generated

389
00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:42.610 
had just one or zero flaws meaning they could be used even,

390
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:46.610 
if there is one flaw depending on which criteria.

391
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.230 
it is flawed in .
it can typically be used as a low stakes assessment,

392
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.870 
so if it has a small typo or maybe it's not the most clear stub.

393
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.070 
it can still generally be used also toward this.

394
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.550 
we wanted to see what were the most common errors

395
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.390 
students had in their problems.

396
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.760 
and here are the top five errors which actually make up
seventy percent of the total

397
00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.570 
flaws in the student questions as you can see ambiguous or

398
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.090 
unclear information and implausible distractors were
the two most popular ones

399
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.730 
and a final point to rq two we wanted to again assess the cognitive

400
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.390 
level of the question seeing, if it was a typical recall and

401
00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.350 
comprehension question which is very common from c q's,

402
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.520 
or if it actually had the students do some application.

403
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.250 
and an overwhelming majority as expected or recall and there

404
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.050 
is a small significant difference in the amount of errors.

405
00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.510 
you would make and if your question was a recall application.

406
00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.970 
but again we didn't have that much data there.

407
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.170 
so for the final arc you wanted to have certain student interactions

408
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.910 
in an online course were associated with
the quality of a multiple-choice

409
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.830 
question that they generated.
we didn't find a correlation between

410
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.790 
the quality of the question and their participation on tasks

411
00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.820 
despite having a common trend.
but again that could be from

412
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.910 
a ceiling effect since most of the students that did this mcq

413
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.630 
generation task just went ahead and did all the tasks in the course.

414
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.380 
i didn't find a correlation either between the time spent on

415
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.930 
the activity and its quality.
so if you spent five minutes on reverse thirty seconds

416
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.260 
no correlation there really on if it's better quality,

417
00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:08.990 
because you spent more time.

418
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.290 
however we did find a quality or correlation rather on the

419
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.630 
quality of the question and the performance on tasks.

420
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.050 
so if you made more incorrect responses throughout the course you

421
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:22.530 
likely had a lower question quality and very similarly.

422
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.730 
if the first time you worked on the question,

423
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.850 
if you got the answer correct you were more likely
to contribute a higher quality question

424
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.610 
at least correlational.

425
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.680 
so we did find participation rates were higher than expected

426
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.420 
for this learning source activity with being optional twenty

427
00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:40.350 
percent of students choosing to participate and give us a question

428
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.440 
not too bad for learners sourcing my opinion.

429
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.410 
this task was embedded naturally. we didn't use an external

430
00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.570 
system, if your system can do a response question you can likely

431
00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.790 
kind of rig up an activity like this and while participation

432
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.550 
was kind of associated with the task there was only fourteen
in total.

433
00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.010 
so again that might have a ceiling effect there.

434
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.880 
we found that students that were able to generate them c q's

435
00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.790 
could readily be added to the course and use this form of assessments.

436
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.890 
so again like sixty seven percent of the questions had either

437
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.800 
one or zero flaws which means you could kind of throw them

438
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.030 
in as a logistics assessment

439
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.910 
and a bunch of them were recall that.
it's kind of to be is expected

440
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.410 
and you know we could potentially provide some explicit instructions

441
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.580 
or training to help them correct the flaws or even target a higher

442
00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.760 
cognitive level,
because again the instructions were literally one sentence.

443
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.140 
so for the flaws present in the questions they were typically

444
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.440 
of the same common errs.
so you know we could provide more instructions

445
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.090 
to remedy those in particular.
and there wasn't a there was

446
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.350 
an association between the performance and the question quality,

447
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.480 
however in this case we don't just want the experts
to answer the questions.

448
00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.460 
right we wanna also get novice perspectives.

449
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.760 
we just don't want the best students kind of giving us questions.

450
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.960 
we would like to ideally list all students.

451
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:57.020 
and so for the future evaluating the questions automatically

452
00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.130 
like applying that rubric took a little bit of time by the

453
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.850 
experts.  so having that be automated somehow would be great

454
00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.970 
engaging again for students of all knowledge levels.

455
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.710 
and kind of providing more instructions or perhaps training

456
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.580 
to get students to target application rather than recall.

457
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.390 
so in conclusion we found that performance and participation

458
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.090 
were the activities correlated with contribution to an mcq generation task.

459
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.440 
we found that the students that contributed at mcq.

460
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.160 
they were generally regarded as a higher quality and even if

461
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.610 
the task was low stakes and optional

462
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.550 
and while students did contribute both recall application levels.

463
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.660 
there were some student kind of behaviors in the course that

464
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.370 
were indicative of them applying or submitting a question at the application level.

465
00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.220 
and that's all.

466
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.370 
thank you very much going a bit over time oh no problem.

467
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.500 
i queued for time

468
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.650 
and jolly has a question in the chat.

469
00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.300 
but why not true on mute

470
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.720 
and in as stephen it directly.

471
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.910 
you know so my question is like in your

472
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.480 
way you evaluated the quality of your questions did you like.

473
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.700 
did that also factor in the fact that they could be copied
from somewhere

474
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.340 
and how did you treat those questions in your evaluation.

475
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.040 
oh thanks for the question as a good point we didn't explicitly

476
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.410 
have like a note for plagiarism although since the course only

477
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:30.560 
had fourteen kind of low six activities.

478
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.210 
the experts were very aware of all the activities in the course already.

479
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.990 
so i would say i don't know for sure, but i would assume the

480
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.120 
experts would be able to identify like. oh this is a copied question.

481
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.230 
i'm also pretty familiar with the questions.
i would say i didn't notice any plagiarized questions in there.

482
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.150 
and one thing i should have noted too is probably.

483
00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.290 
the actual activity that had them generate mcq was on a page

484
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.090 
with kind of other instructional content. but no other questions.

485
00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.490 
so they didn't necessarily have a question on that page they

486
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.460 
could easily copy and paste into there i mean they could easily

487
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.660 
traverse forward or backward in the course copy it and go back to it.

488
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.380 
but i would say i don't think that at least here,

489
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.040 
but we didn't particularly note it,

490
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.800 
when i asked your question.

491
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.880 
sorry,
i was wondering you mentioned one of the future directions is to

492
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.900 
to automate the i wf process. and it seems like some of the

493
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.740 
parts are relatively easy.

494
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:34.760 
it seems at least that way.

495
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.550 
do you agree and what might be the harder parts to automate

496
00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.560 
and that process is. it seems incredibly valuable for you know.

497
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:45.330 
all kinds of questions not just self-generated ones
to automate that process

498
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.530 
yeah a really good question. and that's something.

499
00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:53.670 
i kind of worked on a little bit and got distracted.
i do think even the thirty one

500
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.490 
item rubric has a lot of things that are super
easy to automate like looking,

501
00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.580 
if the longest answer choice is the correct.
one was really trivial to do

502
00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.850 
even using some basic nlp to see similarity between words in
the questions time.

503
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.700 
and the answer choice would be pretty doable.

504
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.770 
i think there are some though that might require
a little bit of domain knowledge.

505
00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.410 
and i think that's also what can i give some crowd workers

506
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:21.190 
a follow if we did some difficulty as well even the one i showed

507
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.090 
about the atom how it's like you know it mentions atom here.

508
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.580 
therefore it couldn't be inside the atom.

509
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.440 
you know technically that does require a little bit of domain knowledge.

510
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.640 
so i could see you know that being may be difficult,

511
00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.990 
if it's on a deeper level.

512
00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.240 
just kind of based on how gave crowd workers trouble as well

513
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.520 
be i would say i don't have a raw number. but maybe something

514
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.110 
like twenty something of the thirty one.
i think could definitely be automated by

515
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.760 
just using some basic text comparison techniques and

516
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.990 
basic nlp so being able to get all of them would be great.

517
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.280 
but i think maybe a little bit of domain knowledge required for some of

518
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.770 
them would be the pain point

519
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.190 
questions flowing in.

520
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.990 
let's see.

521
00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:10.410 
did i got renee i think illana and my questions have similarities.

522
00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.090 
so lana why don't you ask yours.

523
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.270 
first thanks really great talk.

524
00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.730 
and i was wondering because

525
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:27.300 
writing good questions is very difficult like given
forth trained instructors and

526
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:32.150 
from working with instructors. i know that it's hard to explain

527
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:35.000 
what to expect in higher level questions.

528
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:40.860 
so were the students given any training and how to like what

529
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.930 
to expect from question what's considered as a good

530
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.160 
question or an not so good question.

531
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:50.040 
thank you for the question and

532
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.720 
and some past studies that i've definitely seen that kind of
be done.

533
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.630 
but ours no we we didn't give them any training.

534
00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.510 
there's technically a case where i guess the students in the

535
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.010 
course maybe have had training in the past.
so they were like

536
00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.450 
a team for a course or something.

537
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.430 
but we didn't explicitly ask them for that.

538
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:11.680 
so it is possibility b a we gave them those like a single line

539
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.390 
of instructions on how to make multiple choice question put

540
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:17.210 
the correct answer choice in a and that was kind of it

541
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:21.900 
even with that bare-bones amount of instructions
and having the activity optional

542
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.270 
of vast majority of the questions had zero one flaws which
is not bad at all.

543
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.920 
i'm impressed it really is.

544
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.980 
but they were recall level which is fine most recall
these were a of the fifty seven the application.

545
00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:39.360 
but we do wonder if like exposing them to the rubric or

546
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.120 
giving examples of application or even at least stating it
like.

547
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.340 
hey you know try to make it not so recall here's what

548
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.390 
a recall question is we want to try to take it up to the next level.

549
00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.230 
i could potentially you know have them actually make questions
of that higher quality.

550
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.850 
but we were definitely concerned with

551
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.350 
the trade-offs on like, you know do we want to give students

552
00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.700 
a thirty minute training on how to make good questions for

553
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.390 
them to make a single question,
when they could be learning something else

554
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.910 
so always a particular learner sourcing i think even do you think.

555
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:13.810 
it might be easier to generate open-ended questions.

556
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.530 
i wonder if you could make it into two stages,

557
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:24.190 
then i especially mean higher order open-ended questions

558
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.710 
like the demand of anticipating that
i'm going to have to write in responses.

559
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.060 
i could imagine that being a kind of like.

560
00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.000 
oh well then i'm going to keep it simple.

561
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:39.020 
yeah that's a good point i do think that by nature of mcq having

562
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.540 
him,
then b recall and having that limitation i think totally

563
00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.310 
makes sense,
i mean i do that when i don't have to think that type of question

564
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.010 
a good point on the short answer we actually do have a bunch

565
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.610 
of activities out here very similar to this one that get students

566
00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.950 
to make short answer questions.
so i have that data i should

567
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:55.850 
probably look at it now.

568
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.530 
oh yeah right you could compare the ratios of higher level

569
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.970 
in the two contexts good follow up study.
thank you yeah yeah.

570
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:10.530 
i raza has a question about generalizability rising you want to ask it.

571
00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:15.560 
yes yes thank you,
so much for the presentation it was a actually very good talk.

572
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:19.500 
i'm curious to know about the generalizability of your findings,

573
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.460 
and also your next research steps,
if you can actually explain.

574
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.660 
yeah so this was in our chemistry course right.

575
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.730 
and so i do. i definitely think the domain has an impact for sure on

576
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:36.070 
these questions not just type.
but i think like typically in

577
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.210 
a chemistry course or even kind of stem courses.

578
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:42.790 
i think these questions are super common
and maybe not as common for something like

579
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.520 
you know prose analysis or something like with writing for instance.

580
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:50.520 
so i definitely think and also you know in this course.

581
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.030 
i'm sure they were exposed to other multiple-choice questions.

582
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:57.210 
i mean they were even in the system we used. so i think

583
00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.880 
if you put that into a different context domain or like a course

584
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.870 
where they had necessarily seen an mcq recently

585
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:06.620 
that would impact it. so i think context is definitely

586
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:11.150 
important here we actually do have the same activity in a bunch

587
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:14.100 
of other courses currently so that i guess toward

588
00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.130 
your second part of the question for follow-up we definitely.

589
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.530 
do want to look at how a domain might impact it

590
00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.030 
not just kind of student participation performance.

591
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.120 
but you know we do have it in some writing courses and some other stem

592
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.150 
courses to actually see if there is a difference there be.

593
00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.530 
i think definitely like location of the course is important

594
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:35.030 
because if you see a bunch of choice questions
on the page before this activity.

595
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.520 
maybe a little more primed and also just you know the domain

596
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.010 
of typically mc q's are fitting for a math problem.

597
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.850 
but maybe not so much for this, so i think that also has a impact.

598
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.940 
i say thank you so much for an explanation

599
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.230 
great stephen wonderful talk and good questions from everybody

600
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:57.080 
given suggestions for

601
00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.180 
ongoing research great

602
00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.240 
anjali we're ready to move on to you

603
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.960 
are you gonna share your screen. yes

604
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:23.340 
right all right,  so hi everyone i am angela i think a phd

605
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.380 
student at the university of michigan. and i'll be presenting

606
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.040 
our paper on the effects of lower sourcing multiple choice

607
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.950 
questions. but this time it's in a monk, so this work was done

608
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:35.600 
with my collaborators chris brooks and warren lee from the

609
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.640 
university of michigan and given from museum run

610
00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.860 
solar sourcing which we know know is a form of crowdsourcing

611
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.190 
where donors engage in learning activities by generating useful

612
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.720 
input for other learners is emerging as a viable approach of

613
00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.080 
scaling up the generation of learning resources and many recent

614
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.760 
works have shown the effectiveness of learning from learners

615
00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:00.610 
artifacts such as questions hints and explanations for the

616
00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.530 
learners who learn from these artifacts.

617
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.490 
but what about the effects of learner sourcing on the learners

618
00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:09.060 
who create these artifacts what's in it for them.

619
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.320 
so this question is important to address as learner sourcing

620
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.510 
tasks must be designed keeping in mind the needs of learners

621
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.910 
to provide them with a meaningful learning experience.

622
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.810 
we explored the effects of learner sourcing and the motivations

623
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:25.570 
behind engaging in it for students who create multiple choice

624
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.580 
questions or empty queues in a walk.

625
00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.980 
and student motivation can be brought to mix with diverse learners

626
00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.390 
can help uncover the various factors that affect learners motivation

627
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.670 
to engage in learner sourcing.

628
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.670 
several prior studies within formal learning settings have

629
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:45.580 
shown that question generation encourages the development of higher-order thinking skills.

630
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.870 
and this is the reason why we choose question generation as

631
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:50.180 
a learning sourcing activity.

632
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.160 
so one of the design considerations in lawyer sourcing is whether

633
00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.350 
it is required or optional rise studies have shown that optional

634
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:02.840 
learner sourcing can lead to very low participation.

635
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.930 
but on the other hand required learner sourcing can lead to

636
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.490 
lower quality output and even student disengagement.

637
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.120 
the voluntary versus required settings can also lead to varied

638
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.080 
perceptions of task value and effort among the learners to
our knowledge.

639
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.680 
there is no prior study comparing the benefits

640
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.810 
and drawbacks of each approach which is another gap we address

641
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:22.560 
in this work.

642
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.690 
so overall from a student-centered perspective the goals of

643
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:31.230 
designing learner sourcing tasks should be such
that students learn deeply,

644
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.560 
and find value in engaging with the task

645
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.660 
from the instructor's perspective.
it would also be great to

646
00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.040 
have high quality outward

647
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.160 
through our first research question we tried to understand

648
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.220 
whether optional or required learner sourcing was better in

649
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.610 
the context of books for learners such that they valued the

650
00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:52.900 
task and found it worth expending the effort as well as were

651
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.620 
collecting high quality questions.

652
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.380 
the second research question focused on the voluntary setting

653
00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.640 
of learner sourcing to explain why or why not learners may

654
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.350 
want to engage in such tasks this can help contextualize their

655
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.480 
propensity to engage in the learner sourcing of questions if

656
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.210 
it were to be incorporated as a personalized learning activity in dance

657
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.490 
through a third research question we looked at the differences

658
00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.310 
in the learning outcomes when learner sourcing is required

659
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.560 
versus when it is optional.

660
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.850 
since the effects of question generation have been studied

661
00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:29.050 
mostly within formal learning settings we also explore whether

662
00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.390 
these effects persist in walks which often have limited student-teacher

663
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:36.080 
interactions and lower stakes testing compared to one campus classrooms

664
00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.290 
to answer these questions. we conducted a three month arm experiment

665
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.290 
on the course i introduction to data science in brighton

666
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.220 
and as a small incentive to encourage learners to create good mc q's.

667
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.730 
we included this task as part of two of the quizzes which were

668
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.780 
worth a small portion of the total points needed to pass the

669
00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.080 
course and get certified.

670
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:02.190 
so we had three expert experimental conditions which we referred

671
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.340 
to as the control create and choice conditions

672
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.130 
in the control condition which had no question generation task

673
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.390 
learners got ten executes to answer

674
00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.550 
learners in the create condition got six anti q's to answer.

675
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:21.990 
and one question generation task in other words creating a

676
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:25.060 
question was worth as many points as answering four mc q's.

677
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.390 
and each quiz was followed by a survey with questions regarding

678
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:30.430 
students experience of creating an insecure.

679
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.220 
learners in the choice condition also got six mc q's to answer.

680
00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.250 
but then they got a choice between answering four more mc q's

681
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.440 
or creating one insecure.

682
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.710 
and similar to the create condition a learners in the choice

683
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.190 
condition also got a survey after each quiz

684
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.700 
regarding their experience of creating an insecure if they

685
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.960 
chose to create one and the factors that affected their decision

686
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:54.820 
to create or not create an insecure.

687
00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:59.440 
so to summarize the experiment was conducted by two of them quizzes

688
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.910 
and the formats varied based on the experimental conditions.

689
00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.720 
the file was which was a summative assessment was used for

690
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.990 
assessing learner's understanding of the course concepts for

691
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.780 
grading the quizzes the executes that students answered were

692
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:17.230 
automatically evaluated.
but the evaluation of the student generated interviews was done

693
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:20.060 
done by a team of graduate students who were proficient in

694
00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.890 
the course curriculum and they followed a grading rubric that

695
00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.710 
was specifically developed for the question generation task

696
00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.690 
in the mcq generation task description.
we first mentioned the

697
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.750 
self benefit and altruistic benefits of question generation

698
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.120 
in order to motivate learners.
next we provided them with the

699
00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.720 
instructions of creating an mcq that requires learners to apply

700
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.010 
analyze or organize concepts to creatively solve a problem

701
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.320 
rather than simply reading memorized facts.

702
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.340 
in other words we wanted learners to create higher-order thinking

703
00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.540 
and cues rather than recall questions.

704
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.600 
and other instructions ended with the grading rubric for the dusk

705
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.460 
based on analysis of data collected over a period of four months

706
00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.530 
and treat more than three thousand students.

707
00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:07.360 
we found that learners who chose to create questions created

708
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.010 
higher quality questions than those who were required to do.

709
00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.190 
so to evaluate the quality of the learner sourced questions.

710
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.050 
we qualitatively coded a sample of questions from the choice

711
00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:20.040 
and create conditions to seven levels which ranged from one

712
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.630 
hundred percent correct high-order thinking questions to invalid questions,

713
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.770 
then we conducted a man whitney test which is suitable for non-parametric data,77

714
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:30.850 
and to compare the quality of the questions from both conditions

715
00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.790 
and the results of the test were statistically significant.

716
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:37.140 
and our evaluation showed that learners who chose to create

717
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.010 
questions created more high quality questions than learners

718
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.350 
who were required to do so so as you can see the top three

719
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:46.250 
categories here are all higher-order thinking questions and

720
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.430 
the students who got a choice created more of these than the

721
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:49.990 
students who did not get a choice.

722
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:54.850 
we also found that learners who chose to create a question

723
00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.870 
had higher received value for creating questions compared to

724
00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.760 
learners who were required to do. so this result was also

725
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.200 
supported by a statistically significant in a walk.

726
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.540 
so this plot visualizes the agreement of learners with high

727
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.980 
value of creating mc q's showing a stronger agreement for learners

728
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.470 
who got choice in the first present experiment.

729
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:17.440 
and the same result was also observed in the other ways

730
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:22.730 
in terms of the perceived effort of mc q generation.

731
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.340 
we did not find any significant difference between the learners who

732
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.870 
did or did not get a choice.

733
00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.940 
next we analyzed the factors that learners in the choice condition

734
00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.850 
mentioned as influential in their choice to create a question.

735
00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:39.330 
we found interest in creating an execute task uniqueness and

736
00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:43.650 
willingness to contribute to future learners as
the top factors behind their choice.

737
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:47.090 
so here we have some open-ended responses where one learner

738
00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:50.560 
expressed that they found institute generation to be a unique task

739
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.210 
another learner expressed the willingness to challenge themselves

740
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:56.580 
by engaging in the dusk and several learners mentioned that

741
00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.220 
they learned deeply in the process of creating an execution

742
00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.470 
the top factors that influence learners' decision to not create

743
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:07.390 
an institute were higher perceived competence of answering

744
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:10.980 
interviews as well as more familiarity and more interest and

745
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:14.310 
lower perceived effort in answering executes in the open ended

746
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.020 
survey responses.
some learners mentioned choosing not to create

747
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.980 
an institute as they were not proficient in english, or because

748
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.670 
of time constraints as they felt that creating an institute

749
00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.210 
would take more time than answering four mc q's.

750
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.330 
surprisingly some learners felt that by choosing to create an institute

751
00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:32.260 
they would lose the opportunity to answer four mc q's that

752
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.760 
had been prepared for them few learners even expressed doubt

753
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.760 
as to the purpose and value of the task.
so this highlights

754
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.420 
a core challenge with learner sourcing where the goal is both

755
00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.300 
to benefit learners and encourage deeper learning while also

756
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.730 
generating new learning artifacts for other learners,

757
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.510 
even though we made the learners aware about the benefits of

758
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.410 
question generation as a learning activity some of them still

759
00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:55.060 
felt that it's not their job to create questions and that it's

760
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.260 
the job of instructors or course designers.

761
00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:02.670 
so not final research questions or and in terms of the learning

762
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:06.010 
outcomes and retention for students in the different conditions.

763
00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:09.030 
we did not find any significant difference and this could be

764
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.710 
because answering questions and creating a question can require

765
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.850 
learners to practice different cognitive skills.

766
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.290 
so in archies answering questions primarily require learners

767
00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:20.330 
to apply and analyze concepts whereas creating a high-order

768
00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.760 
thinking question additionally requires them requires evaluation and creation.

769
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.010 
so a more thorough assessment of learner's higher-order thinking

770
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.940 
and metacognitive skills might surface some differences in

771
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.890 
between the learning outcomes of learners who created a question.

772
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:34.860 
and those who did not

773
00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.680 
overall this work contributes to an understanding of better

774
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.500 
designing learner sourcing tasks particularly
from a student-centered perspective.

775
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.530 
we found that giving students a choice in learner sourcing

776
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.650 
led to higher quality output and also higher
perceived value among students.

777
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:54.330 
thus making it a viable personalized learning activity for more cloners

778
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:58.370 
the evaluation workload was also significantly reduced since

779
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.920 
only around ten percent of the learners chose to create an institute.

780
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.150 
but we still collected many questions given the large

781
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:05.170 
number of learners in

782
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.860 
some learners who chose not to create a question indicated

783
00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.500 
that they would like to engage in this activity in the future.

784
00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.870 
when they are more prepared thus validating learners' knowledge

785
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.540 
through formative assessments and additional scaffolding

786
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.390 
before giving them the option to engage in learner sourcing

787
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:24.920 
can help increase their confidence as well as the motivation to contribute.

788
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.470 
in the future we would like to explore the generalizability

789
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:32.560 
of these insights to other learner sourcing tasks and contexts

790
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.710 
and future research should also explore how to support students

791
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:38.680 
as they engage in learner sourcing to promote deeper learning,

792
00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.960 
as well as the generation of high-quality output.

793
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.860 
thank you. all for listening and please check out our paper

794
00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:49.150 
for more details of the experiment.
and now i'll take questions from the audience

795
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.090 
under phone great job.

796
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.520 
i really interesting work.

797
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.780 
i'm so collapse questions lots of questions,

798
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.880 
a lot of comments.

799
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:14.980 
i guess yeah one clarifying question,
i had was along the lines of understanding

800
00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:16.810 
what requirement meant.

801
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.480 
and if i can throw another one out there i was a little confused

802
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.740 
about whether you were saying the group as a total

803
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:28.780 
produced more questions or there were more questions per individual

804
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:30.300 
created in the choice group to clarify that.

805
00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:35.520 
so there were two in two of the quizzes in the MOOC.

806
00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:41.010 
they had basically it was worth ten points, so out

807
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:44.130 
of those ten points six points were for answering questions.

808
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:47.880 
and the four points were for either creating a question or answering forward

809
00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:52.590 
and so yeah so when i say required that means

810
00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.540 
that's the group that didn't get an option to choose between the two.

811
00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.940 
they have to choose four points

812
00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:04.380 
and you're regarding the question about creating

813
00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:08.330 
more high quality questions.
so that's like percentage of so

814
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:12.710 
if there are fifty students we took a around
sample of fifty students from

815
00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.540 
the group that got a choice and the group that did not get

816
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.850 
a choice and out of those fifty students.

817
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:21.160 
there was a bigger percentage of students who created higher

818
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:24.330 
quality questions in the choice group.

819
00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.540 
so you can say it's a proportion of the total number of students

820
00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.300 
who created questions not the absolute quantity

821
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.010 
renÃ©e you have a question. thank you.

822
00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:41.510 
thank you. i was wondering what was and maybe i missed it what

823
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:44.790 
was communicated to the students about the questions
that they're generating.

824
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.880 
are they told that they're used right there in the course and

825
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.790 
their peers are going to answer them in that session, or next

826
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:54.890 
time or what was sort of because that might affect the attitudes

827
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:58.110 
that they have towards the whole process. and it's value and

828
00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.380 
how they feel about it. yeah that's a very good question

829
00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:05.180 
and we actually put a lot about that
when we were thinking of the instructions.

830
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.230 
so we did not say any of that we just said it's a learning

831
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:12.210 
activity and like that it's very beneficial for you.

832
00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:15.660 
and it promotes deeper learning and the only thing that we did was

833
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.560 
at the end of the question we just took their consent that

834
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:22.300 
are you will give it this quick with your question being used

835
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:26.090 
for future students or for research purposes so that might

836
00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.510 
have given them some indication that it's going to be used.

837
00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.410 
but yeah not in the instructions,

838
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.110 
sorry you want to unmute and ask your question.

839
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:43.540 
and yes thank you and you talked about the learning outcomes,

840
00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:47.000 
and the effect of the condition on the learning outcome

841
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.810 
wondering if you also looked at

842
00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.660 
learning traces after a certain period of time say after one

843
00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.400 
year or after six months.

844
00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:03.760 
and did you say if you have then did you say anything an interesting.

845
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:08.260 
thank you. that's a great question. and we actually

846
00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:13.980 
have data on there like learning traces, but we haven't yet analyzed that

847
00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:19.810 
and i'm not sure what you meant by looking at their learning traces after a period of time.

848
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:24.590 
so the reason i'm saying that is because because

849
00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:26.840 
it's a mook r we only have the

850
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.480 
traces for the period that they were enrolled in the mooc

851
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:36.950 
form after after that.
it's hard to get that data to see how it

852
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:45.480 
was usually it requires surveys and being in touch with students

853
00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:47.570 
after this time.

854
00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.790 
you saw no difference in the learning outcomes between the groups

855
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:54.480 
so i wondered. thank you.

856
00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.640 
you have it related to that.

857
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:04.230 
there's an interesting back and forth in the chat around

858
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:08.990 
whether this is representative of students you know.

859
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.590 
there's evidence out there that students believe passive learning is better for them.

860
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.620 
you haven't seen this desolate race paper.

861
00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:21.140 
it's a really compelling one in this regard even though more

862
00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:24.930 
active learning is better.
but it also raises the question of whether

863
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:28.540 
the question generation sort of meets the

864
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:33.400 
desirable criteria for effective active learning
or deliberate practice because

865
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.930 
i think the evidence pretty strong that active

866
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:39.540 
learning with feedback is what produces effectiveness.

867
00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.930 
and so it's not sort of absence of information.

868
00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.970 
it's that the information comes in reaction to

869
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:50.570 
the student's response right they still read their read the feedback.

870
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:57.820 
yeah so i wonder if you've thought about ways to provide students

871
00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.280 
with feedback on their questions in a way that might help.

872
00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.600 
they actually did that yeahï¼Œ
so it was a very expensive process because

873
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:12.620 
we didn't so all of this data that i currently presented was

874
00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.290 
their first attempt of creating a question and their first

875
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:19.330 
attempt of the fine.
it was for evaluating their learning outcomes.

876
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:24.780 
but we actually gave them feedback which was as we kind of also like

877
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:29.110 
learner suffers that in a way that we asked a lot of graduate

878
00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:32.100 
students to volunteer for creating these questions.

879
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:35.280 
so we had like a team of ten students who's we'd like spend

880
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:38.900 
time on reading these questions and giving them feedback on

881
00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.360 
how to improve the question.

882
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.790 
and that it would be really interesting to see how that feedback

883
00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:48.480 
actually helped them improve their question and even there's force
in the MOOC.

884
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:53.680 
it is that possible given the data you have

885
00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:56.720 
i think so yes we have evidence.

886
00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.310 
so yeah that's possible

887
00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:03.080 
would be a great follow

888
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.150 
we raise a riza sorry,

889
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.930 
i'm actually a producer correctly thank you so much for.

890
00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.340 
thank you. so much for the awesome presentation.

891
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.090 
one tiny question i wonder whether the students knew in advance

892
00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:25.770 
that they're involved in these experiments or not.

893
00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:29.250 
and as you know some of the books are actually paid and some are not

894
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:34.260 
has this actually influenced students participation.
i'm curious to know

895
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:38.490 
that's a very interesting question and to answer your first question.

896
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:42.030 
they did not know that they are involved in the next experiment.

897
00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:47.580 
so we got the irish in google for that and the study was exempted from
your site.

898
00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.320 
and yet so the students did not know

899
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:57.430 
as for the fact that some groups are paid.
and some are not

900
00:57:57.450 --> 00:58:00.950 
that is actually very interesting,
because this move was for

901
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:04.910 
some students.
it was actually paid and because this was the pandemic time.

902
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:08.010 
there was an offer that coursera had at that point that you

903
00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:11.020 
could enroll for courses for free like for some institutions.

904
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.450 
so it was basically a mix like the or like the students we

905
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:18.120 
had some of them feed word.
some of them did not and in their survey responses.

906
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:21.940 
we actually saw that that was reflected that

907
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:25.570 
some students indicated that they have like a monthly subscription.

908
00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:28.050 
and their subscription is going to expire. so they don't have

909
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:30.210 
time to create a question. they just want to get through the

910
00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:31.320 
course and get done with it.

911
00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:37.280 
and then but that was like a very small proportion of students

912
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:42.650 
who complained about that. oh yeah i didn't see a lot

913
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:46.790 
of those kind of complaints.
i say thank you so much for an explanation.

914
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:53.280 
just in yeah great set of talks.
i think this question could be for

915
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.130 
both anjali and stephen.
and then if gene or anyone jump into.

916
00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:01.090 
i'm always your project, i'm struck this year at learning at scale.

917
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:03.130 
there seem to be a bunch of sort of

918
00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:08.810 
learner sourcing automated sourcing question answering things.

919
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:11.850 
they're you know. we've i've there's usually a paper to every.

920
00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:14.460 
year but it seems like, there's a bit of a surge in this area.

921
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.610 
i'm wondering if you know stepping back from your particular study

922
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.100 
like what do you think are the most interesting questions to

923
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.560 
be asked here the most interesting sort of pedagogies or technologies

924
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.530 
to be pursued what do you think the field should be working

925
00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:31.620 
on regards to this sort of you know like what are the

926
00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:34.650 
next steps not only for your own research. but for what you

927
00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:37.130 
think like a bunch of folks at learning at scale should be

928
00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.770 
should be working on related to this.

929
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.950 
so i think for what i saw

930
00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:50.100 
was that like just i saw this kind of it was also discussed

931
00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:54.700 
after steven's talk that how do we train the students to create good-quality output.

932
00:59:54.840 --> 01:00:00.450 
and that is something that i think is something really important to investigate and

933
01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:04.810 
in crowd work like training is given given a lot of importance.

934
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:08.900 
but the like the outcome.
there is just the quality of their output in our case.

935
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.170 
i guess it's important to balance both students

936
01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:17.730 
learning outcomes and the quality of the output so.
how do we

937
01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:22.290 
train them such that both goals are accomplished is i think one area.

938
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:24.320 
that's important to pursue

939
01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.020 
even you want to jump in on that one yeah i think more work

940
01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.570 
for sure still on like the learning benefit of learning sourcing.

941
01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:37.680 
i mean almost feel like guilty sometimes doing this work,
because it's like i make a question.

942
01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:40.720 
but it's like could you learn more from doing

943
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.610 
something else probably.
i don't know

944
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.880 
and then not to be that person.
but i think like ai to help

945
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.270 
students with like the more menial parts of this like

946
01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:53.740 
mentioning like applying.
the i'm writing class rubric automatically so maybe

947
01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:56.320 
as students are working on a learner associativity,

948
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.840 
if they do have a few flaws go ahead and point it out like hey you

949
01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.240 
know before you submitted could you fix this.
so at least if

950
01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.700 
we are getting them to do something that we use

951
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:08.390 
having it cleaned up as much as we can and helping them spend

952
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:09.110 
less time on it.

953
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.390 
it's funny stephen that you mention that that ethical component rob miller

954
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:20.060 
who was a early crowd work guy at mit got interested in MOOCs

955
01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.940 
for a little bit,
because he was like oh man there's some real issues with

956
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.410 
amazon turk let's go to moocs where maybe things you know the

957
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:29.960 
ethical questions will be clear and they know actually

958
01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:34.030 
technocrats trying to get people do certain things is always

959
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:36.180 
fraught with the ethical dilemmas.

960
01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.050 
and wherever we do them. we won't be able to escape them.

961
01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:46.680 
i'm thanks justin for asking a more general question.

962
01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.560 
we're now in the phase of this time.

963
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:53.620 
we have together where where we can open up the discussion more broadly.

964
01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:58.700 
so feel free to ask questions that may be general to the group or

965
01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.840 
going back to previous presenters guess what

966
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:12.720 
one question i have for giang.
sorry for my typo in the cheque.

967
01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:17.010 
i don't think we got a chance to ask you what are your next

968
01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:21.970 
step plans in your research agenda related to your paper.

969
01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.440 
i have two things in my mind.

970
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:34.450 
one upi actually listen to slides and do some meta-analysis on all the

971
01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.520 
educational interventions that one think up using the vct.

972
01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:45.240 
and then that the next one the second one will be like actually

973
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.210 
we have our own vct that develop

974
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:53.640 
a person for online education or education in general.

975
01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:56.480 
because in the vct taxonomy.

976
01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:04.900 
there are some very specific techniques that
can be only used for a health

977
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.370 
proposed few years though maybe we could

978
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:13.930 
make our own version of the pc keys.

979
01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:17.750 
yet the two are like what i really want to do

980
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.500 
in the near future.

981
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:23.730 
you want one thing i find

982
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.890 
particularly interesting is sort of the hierarchy of different

983
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.530 
kinds of interventions you know some are about long term goals.

984
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.280 
and i think this is reflected in the taxonomy
as i was reading your paper.

985
01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.830 
some are more about immediate actions i like the fitbit analogy

986
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.980 
like my long term goal might be to get into better shape.

987
01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.840 
but then i have this action oriented goal of ten thousand steps a day.

988
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:52.290 
but there's also this nuance on cues for behavior like a lot

989
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:54.620 
of times i have good intentions.

990
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.590 
but somehow in the heat of the moment. i don't know,

991
01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:01.030 
i don't decide to go walk or go work out.

992
01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:04.740 
because i'm something else draws my attention.
and i think there was a category

993
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.730 
about those kinds of changing queuing conditions is

994
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.290 
that right and did i use the taxonomy correctly with respect

995
01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:13.590 
to goals and actions.

996
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:20.780 
yeah i believe. so it's all about what school you have.

997
01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.170 
and the taxonomy can help you

998
01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:28.160 
compose a relevant bct or helpful bct to achieve your core.

999
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.770 
so if your goal is long term,

1000
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:34.650 
then the relevant bct can be different

1001
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.210 
compared to the goal that

1002
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.680 
is achieved in the short term.
so yes i think

1003
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:49.160 
other questions.

1004
01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:54.310 
i'm amy do you want to toss in your comment

1005
01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:57.760 
in the chat paper words.

1006
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.980 
yes

1007
01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:11.450 
pleased to share with you that our third paper of the session here

1008
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:18.070 
was a nominee for best paper award. and so lucky all of you

1009
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.900 
got to view this paper and all the other excellent
papers in this session.

1010
01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:28.010 
and i highly encourage you to join us at the poster session

1011
01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:34.220 
that is coming up shortly where the work in progress papers.

1012
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:38.640 
and the demo demonstrations will be presented and at the very beginning
of that session.

1013
01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:42.660 
we will be making an announcement about who

1014
01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:48.020 
has won the best paper award.
and we also have two other special awards to present.

1015
01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:53.630 
so i'd love to see you all there come get a chance to
chat individually with people

1016
01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.390 
talk about the work in progress.
but also hopefully meet up

1017
01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:00.610 
with others who were just wandering around the conference and

1018
01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:02.900 
have a little bit of social time together

1019
01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:12.480 
that starts in twenty three minutes time.

1020
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.950 
yeah right has a link i gathered early rather than father

1021
01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.260 
location for that post.

1022
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.450 
yes i'm

1023
01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:35.780 
super we do have some more time here.

1024
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:39.410 
yeah justin's

1025
01:06:42.970 --> 01:06:46.940 
not not justin's first joking in the chat.
now i'll note.

1026
01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.040 
thank you for the levity there.

1027
01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:54.370 
the cats and dogs things reminded me of the cats and mice in

1028
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:56.990 
australia if anybody saw that video.

1029
01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.270 
there's so many mice that the cats don't seem to care that.

1030
01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.690 
there are mice around in australia.

1031
01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:08.740 
i'm a general question for molly. thank you

1032
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:14.240 
please unmute and ask us. ok, thanks.

1033
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:19.640 
are you familiar with any study investigating the impact

1034
01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:24.450 
of different activities such as practice creation or event

1035
01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:30.050 
evaluation on the student learning or learning experience in general.

1036
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:37.110 
the like experiment or you know a tory event that show

1037
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:42.970 
creation has more impact or more positive impact on the student

1038
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:45.370 
learning or event pure evaluation might

1039
01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:50.480 
for white better learning experience for a student.
or something like that

1040
01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:59.130 
good question what would folks think.
i'm just to clarify.

1041
01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:02.720 
you are thinking of practice as being a kind of control here right.

1042
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:05.760 
because there's certainly it you know a lot of literature on how

1043
01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:11.570 
more generative activities active learning testing effect are

1044
01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:15.360 
better than then then passive learning experiences.
but you're saying

1045
01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.890 
consistent with these papers.
you're asking more about comparing

1046
01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:23.550 
practice you know like in the last paper to generation

1047
01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:27.230 
of some kind right creation as you said is that right.

1048
01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:40.760 
steven, hi has a contribution yep feels free to add more marcus i

1049
01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:44.140 
do want to reply ask something else yeah.

1050
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:48.500 
yeah. i know it's just probably a starting point what we used

1051
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:54.370 
for example with teacher trainings in house is a mooc from

1052
01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:59.110 
paul kirschner where he is writing about urban myths in education.

1053
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:02.650 
so it's more like a general approach but he collects evidences

1054
01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:06.010 
on some parts of this. so when you start to

1055
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.350 
discuss with your educators on bloom's autonomy,

1056
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:15.010 
and then he actually collects the evidence,
if one of part of that you can

1057
01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:19.190 
underpin with evidence and what part is difficult  to underpin.

1058
01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:24.460 
so i like that as a starting point for a difference like evidence based

1059
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.020 
reflections on these type of activities.

1060
01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:35.490 
yet maybe could throw a pointer and took that kershner work,

1061
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:39.050 
if sure people would love to have it.

1063
01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:51.420 
steve stephen in jolly want to comment on the pointers that you added here.

1064
01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:58.090 
yeah for the peer evaluation part to appear studio paper from

1065
01:09:58.090 --> 01:09:59.610 
kyle a few years ago now,

1066
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.700 
talks about that a lot and the related work has a good bit on

1067
01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:06.910 
having students evaluate other students work
and the benefits for learning.

1068
01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.520 
and yeah i think also the paper represented i have a related

1069
01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.660 
work section on student generation in regards to mc q's in particular

1070
01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.380 
and that has a lot of cited work.

1071
01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:26.830 
yeah, even i've included as one of the papers that i mentioned in the

1072
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:31.750 
related work section in my paper so this was a study that compared

1073
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.890 
like students who created questions versus students who only answered questions.

1074
01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.500 
and they didn't find any significant differences in students' learning.

1075
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.610 
but when they assessed their higher cognitive strategies

1076
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:47.290 
and metacognitive skills.
that's when a significant difference.

1077
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:53.170 
so arm and those who created questions had those skills more

1078
01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:54.650 
of those gifts than those who did not.

1079
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.860 
thank you.

1080
01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.520 
oh thanks marcus.

1081
01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:17.350 
for posting that kershner at all paper on urban myths about learning and education.

1082
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:23.330 
i know i held up this visible learning book before,

1083
01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:29.520 
as this much more general.
but i'll put that in the chat too.

1084
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:35.460 
i'm not maybe in here somewhere is a relevant study on

1085
01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:40.560 
question generation versus practice.
but i don't think so.

1086
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.030 
there's  lots of other things in here.

1087
01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.680 
yeah and as marcus says, it's a great book as a resource.

1088
01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.670 
it is much more again content oriented than then going back

1089
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.310 
to the first paper where it's so great to have

1090
01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.390 
motivation engagement oriented in self-regulated learning kind

1091
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:02.740 
of taxonomies as well. so look forward to your

1092
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:05.620 
future work in that regard dionne nineteen.

1093
01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:15.590 
ok, so i do we have more questions is a great session.

1094
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:22.910 
yeah i olli wait we did notice that you disappeared for a moment.

1095
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:25.730 
but i hope you're did you have a follow-up.

1096
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:32.900 
no, i just think you introduce a mooc or something.

1097
01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.320 
oh yeah and marcus pointed to that kershner paper.

1098
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:42.920 
but you know if you were asking about general experiments on

1099
01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:46.160 
learning, this is a great resource, because it

1100
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:53.050 
summarizes eight hundred meta-analysis analyses
and each meta-analysis summarizes roughly

1101
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:57.610 
a hundred experiments so that suggests if you do the product that there's

1102
01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.040 
been some eighty thousand experiments on learning that are

1103
01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.340 
summarized in this mooc.

1104
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:08.520 
they may or may not touch on the more particular issue that

1105
01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.300 
in fact i think.
the work that anjali is doing is pushing the

1106
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:19.020 
frontier with respect to question general learning from question general
generation.

1107
01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.760 
but steven also pointed to work by

1108
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.330 
my kulkarni on peer study

1109
01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.310 
that at least has some relevance and some

1110
01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:33.360 
paper the related work sections in their papers is certainly relevant.

1111
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:39.460 
great thank you. yeah great.
so a poster session in fifteen minutes

1112
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:45.920 
and there's a link marcus's place to gather early.

1113
01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.450 
so let's take a little bit of a

1114
01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:54.400 
break. and then all come together lee and

1115
01:13:56.070 --> 01:14:01.770 
enjoy there thanks off to all the presenters as reyner in a just said.

1116
01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:06.670 
and it was a great session, and it's been a great conference.

1117
01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:12.450 
so let's continue it into the poster session
and remember as amy said the

1118
01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.080 
suspense about the best paper award will be revealed

1119
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.940 
in that session is that at the beginning amy?

1120
01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:24.720 
are you going to be right at the beginning okay.

1121
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.730 
but you should stay the whole time

1122
01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:30.850 
go celebrate with everyone afterwards.

1123
01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:38.610 
yes indeed all right um yeah.
you know it one of the things we miss at conferences is

1124
01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:41.100 
those hallway conversations.

1125
01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:46.050 
so i think we can leave this open for a little while
and anybody wants to

1126
01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.580 
chat a bit in these now fourteen minutes

1127
01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:54.920 
maybe that's okay or or maybe ten of these fourteen minutes.

1128
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:59.060 
i mean you get a break yeah you can if you want i don't know,

1129
01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:02.780 
if the people present here know galilee.
but it's a kind of tool where

1130
01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.260 
you can like mingle a little bit walk around, and then if you

1131
01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:10.080 
close to other people it automatically pops up and creates a

1132
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:15.460 
kind of spontaneous video conference with a bunch of people.

1133
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:18.180 
so yeah try it out.

1134
01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.650 
so people can go there early and find others to as another form

1135
01:15:22.650 --> 01:15:25.480 
of hallway conversation is that what you're saying or well that's not

1136
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.160 
absolutely

1137
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:28.460 
right

1138
01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:32.750 
have fun everybody.

1139
01:15:34.110 --> 01:15:35.420 
all right girlie.

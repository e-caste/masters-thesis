1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.880 
We will finish our first
course week in our openHPI

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.840 
course about Cyberthreats by Malware
with a short history of cybercrime.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.730 
From phone freaking
to cyber war.

4
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.210 
Since lectronic systems have existed, there have
been many attempts to attack systems.

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.110 
There were different reasons
different motivations and purposes

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.210 
but there is from the beginning a way
to do this. So for example here

7
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.590 
in 1903, in the
very beginning

8
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.300 
of the twentieth
century,

9
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.070 
when Marconi, he
was a pioneer in

10
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.180 
electronic communication

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.730 
demonstrated a public
radio link in London,

12
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.640 
Maskelyne accepted the
communication and sent an

13
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.230 
unauthorized Morse code message
to the receiver. So often this

14
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.740 
is seen as the first
hacking in history.

15
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.750 
Then since the

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.100 
1930s and during
the Second World War,

17
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.190 
successfully attempts were
done to break the Enigma

18
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.860 
encryption at the end this was done
in a real industrial setting

19
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.900 
and it was successfully
under the

20
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.450 
head of Alan Turing.

21
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.750 
Then, only to mention a few of
such activities - in the 1970s,

22
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.730 
there were the Phone
Freaking movement starting.

23
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.000 
And the idea of this phone
freaking was that the

24
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.740 
hacker searched for weak points
in the telephone system and

25
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.160 
the idea was to make
free calls possible

26
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.610 
and to this end, I have
to remind you that

27
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.760 
in the early days it was very
expensive to have a telephone

28
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.860 
call, in particular
to a foreign country.

29
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.810 
There was a justification, a convoluted
ideological justification and

30
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.490 
the hackers said that "Freedom
of communication is a

31
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.150 
prerequisite for the freedom of
humanity" and in this way

32
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.940 
they hide that they
are criminal, that their

33
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.390 
activities are criminal activities
against the telephone companies.

34
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.340 
An example here for this
is the so called Blueboxing.

35
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.090 
The connections
could be terminated

36
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.080 
ostensibly by an internal control
tone, a tone of 2,600 Hz

37
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.070 
but the line for the
exchange remained open.

38
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.700 
So the Phreakers were
able to make new call

39
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.900 
at the original one. The original
one was stopped and so they

40
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.920 
continued to have a call for the
cost of the original phone call.

41
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.690 
So the ideas of phreakers were able
to make a new and extensive long

42
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.910 
distance call at the
original cheap local ones.

43
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.900 
And the Bluebox - this was a device for
generating such various control tones

44
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.830 
to influence the

45
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.030 
telephone system in that way. So if we look
for the first generation of computer hacker,

46
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.880 
then it starts when
computer became popular.

47
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.720 
This was when the PCs got
distributed, the personal computers,

48
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.320 
then fast growing
hacking scene

49
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.420 
could be observed - first established
itself in the underground.

50
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.380 
To mention one - in Germany,
is the Chaos Computer club

51
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.030 
in 1981. It's one of the
biggest hacker associations

52
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.900 
which in 1981 was
founded in Berlin.

53
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.690 
So originally it was from
Germany and a German activist

54
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.790 
but now it's a big
international organization.

55
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.190 
Since 1984, this
Chaos Computer Club (CCC)

56
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.870 
has organized annual
internal conferences

57
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.370 
the Chaos Communication Congresses,
the C3 Congresses.

58
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.830 
In this year, or it was actually a
couple of weeks ago, in the last year

59
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.650 
the first completely
remote Chaos

60
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.120 
Communication Congress
was organized.

61
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.480 
It was the thirty seventh one. So the
thirty seventh C3 was the first

62
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:44.010 
rC3, remote Chaos Communication
Congress that was organized.

63
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.150 
So it features lectures and talks
and workshops that are related

64
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.980 
to the latest issues in a computer
security area and cybercrime.

65
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.140 
Some spectacular
actions from the CCC

66
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.530 
were when they revealed
software errors

67
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.470 
and security holes in different systems,
for example in 1984

68
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.100 
they proved that it was
possible to abuse

69
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.660 
the newly introduced
BTX service

70
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.380 
of the Hamburger Sparkasse by
transferring a Deutschemark

71
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.350 
amount of one hundred thirty four
thousand to the CCC and speaking

72
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.810 
publicly about this great
big media spectacle.

73
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.280 
To mention from the many
activities another one was

74
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.450 
in 1996 when the

75
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.590 
Chaos Computer group demonstrated an
attack against Microsoft's ActiveX

76
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.230 
and in 1998
where the CCC broke

77
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.350 
an encryption algorithm, the COMP128

78
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.300 
an encryption algorithm that was used
for many GSM SIM cards at that time

79
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.080 
and of course
this was very

80
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:18.550 
important for the continued development to
show this weaknesses of that encryption

81
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.100 
scheme. Another activity
was in 2008

82
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.390 
where the Chaos Computer
Club published

83
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.790 
the fingerprints of German
federal Interior Minister

84
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:40.540 
to oppose to the use of biometric data
in Germans' ID cards, the e-passport.

85
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.930 
And to mention one more of the
activities of the Chaos Computer Club

86
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.960 
is to mention this activity
from 2011

87
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:59.110 
where the CCC published the analysis
of poorly crafted federal trojan.

88
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.660 
Then if we look at the hacking
in the 90s, then the rapid

89
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:12.290 
spread of computer systems led to equally
rapid development of hacking scene,

90
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:20.420 
of developing malware, of finding vulnerabilites
of software and developing exploits

91
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:28.530 
to misuse these vulnerabilities. So the state legal
system began to enact legal requirements.

92
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:35.160 
For the Computer Misuse Act in the
United Kingdom in 1990,

93
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.520 
other states also formulated
similar regulations.

94
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:46.260 
So with these new areas that in the start, in
the beginning was completely unregulated

95
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:53.590 
by means of the electronic
media fitting regulations, this

96
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.740 
was the first where the
situation got changed.

97
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.880 
So attacks on computer systems
were increasingly automated.

98
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.660 
This was also a development, so
no more sophisticated hackers

99
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:12.790 
are working no designed software
attack software, this run

100
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.510 
automatically and attack
the system, the victim system

101
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.550 
automatically. So automated worms, scanners
or other attack tools cause

102
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:33.240 
a huge flood of security incidents. So the
first IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

103
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:39.130 
and surveillance systems were
developed. So systems that detect

104
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.430 
such attacks because in
many cases the attacks

105
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.080 
remain undetected. If we look at
some characteristics of cyber

106
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.340 
crime in the 2000s, then
meanwhile almost every computer

107
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.150 
system was connected
to the open internet

108
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.020 
and as a result the number
of security incidents

109
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:08.810 
got the next push. So it was rising
dramatically - viruses, worms,

110
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.460 
trojans, malware
attacks everywhere.

111
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.280 
Another attack method was
run to

112
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:26.230 
introduce botnets and then
to misuse these botnets for

113
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:31.390 
attacks, industrial espionage
attacks became common.

114
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.710 
So no large
company could

115
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.740 
survive without an IT
security department and

116
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.240 
sophisticated
protection tools.

117
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.490 
Hacking software tools now could be
downloaded from the internet. So also

118
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.520 
this pushed the hacking activities.

119
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.980 
I mentioned there are groups of
hackers like Script Kiddies that

120
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.760 
work with such
downloaded

121
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.680 
attack tools and used and
played around with these tools.

122
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:12.360 
So the rise of underground
networks like Tor, like

123
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:19.980 
I2P (Invisible Internet Project)
and Freenet occur and of course

124
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:27.690 
the darknet became important. Another
characteristic in the last year or

125
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:33.420 
to describe the computer security
and crime scene is cyber war.

126
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.510 
So the security services
of most countries

127
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:44.990 
detected that the internet provides
the possibilities not only to attack

128
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.820 
systems of companies or

129
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:55.930 
users, but they could also be used to attack
critical infrastructures in the states.

130
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.420 
So in the most countries they built
cyber defense departments

131
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.670 
for both for inside and outside the
country, for example in Germany it's the

132
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.270 
National Cyber Defence Centre, in
NATO it's Coop. Cyber

133
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:16.070 
Defence Centre of Excellence, in USA it
is the United States Cyber Command.

134
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:21.940 
And various groups of hackers are
repeatedly accused of being

135
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.560 
close to the government. So
governments are using such groups,

136
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.830 
for spending money and gives
them goals for the attacks

137
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.850 
so that often it is difficult to
find out was this an attack

138
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:41.660 
by an hacker group or was an attack that
originally was initiated by a state

139
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:47.420 
agency. So it's difficult to
get the connections known,

140
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.920 
the professionalism, but
the financial resources

141
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.320 
and the targets of the attacks
are indicators that there is

142
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.970 
not only a single hacker group
behind, that there is a state

143
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.610 
organization behind.

144
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.240 
To mention some
spectacular examples in

145
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.350 
the recent years, here

146
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.720 
I mentioned some events
which becomes aware in 2020,

147
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.960 
here what became publicly
aware is some information

148
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.960 
about the Crypto AG

149
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.460 
and the Project "Rubicon".

150
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:37.180 
This is a Swiss company that shows
encryption mechanisms to various governments.

151
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:42.040 
Meanwhile it's more than hundred
around the world and it is

152
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.690 
not in the last year, it was
done after World War II.

153
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.010 
And for a long time this
company was owned by the CIA

154
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.780 
until 2018 and the BND

155
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:05.730 
until 1990s who could read
everything via a backdoor which was

156
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.930 
available for this
encryption mechanisms

157
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.250 
in this Project Rubicon.

158
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.270 
Another very spectacular example
of a cybercrime

159
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:26.680 
of recent years was the hack of Jeff
Bezos' phone in 2018.

160
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.010 
He is the owner and CEO
of Amazon

161
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.290 
but also owns the Washington
Post. He is a multi billionaire

162
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.910 
and so of course it's a valuable target for
hackers and cybercriminals

163
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:52.080 
of every color. And here a hack
became publicly known that was done

164
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.000 
probably through a
video obtained

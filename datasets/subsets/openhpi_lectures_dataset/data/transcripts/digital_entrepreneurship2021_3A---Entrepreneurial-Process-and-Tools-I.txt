00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.559 
Welcome. My name is Katharina Holzle, and I welcome you to

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.329 
today's session on the entrepreneurial process.

3
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.940 
Now, if you have listened to our previous sessions,

4
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.679 
you might remember that we have been telling you that entrepreneurship is

5
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.149 
actually not only an art, but much more

6
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.829 
a science. And for a science, we talk

7
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.909 
about different steps.

8
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.380 
We talk about processes and methods.

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.219 
And today I will show you that the funding

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.599 
of an enterprise actually follows a process

11
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.719 
that is not very linear, but it's rather iterative.

12
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.380 
It's a breathing process, as we call it, because it comes from

13
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.539 
diverging to converging to diverging, converging

14
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.420 
again and again.

15
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.709 
And what you can see is that it all starts with actually

16
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.599 
recognizing an opportunity or detecting an opportunity

17
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.467 
to see that there is something that is worth pursuing

18
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.069 
and that needs to be followed to in order to solve

19
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.729 
a problem. And once this opportunity has been discovered, you

20
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.719 
actually have to think about how do I find a solution to this

21
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.348 
problem? And with that, we recommend using

22
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.200 
a design thinking process, which then leads to

23
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.119 
actually creating a solution and then taking the solution to a market

24
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.620 
fit. And the three sessions that will follow

25
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.307 
will show you how to actually go through this process

26
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.129 
and give you a first impression of the different tools that can

27
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.870 
be used along this process.

28
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.135 
As we have mentioned before, this is not a class on how

29
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.699 
to actually go through this process in detail.

30
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.189 
It's not about writing a business model or a business plan,

31
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.379 
but it's rather about you understanding that entrepreneurship

32
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.830 
follows this process and that there are scientific methods to learn.

33
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.210 
So start with the opportunity.

34
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.249 
The opportunity actually is core to the entrepreneurial process, because

35
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.169 
in that opportunity comes together what the person

36
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.673 
the entrepreneur actually brings with them and the ecosystem

37
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.473 
we will create this opportunity, we will create

38
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.259 
that venture. So the opportunity, the entrepreneur and

39
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.700 
the ecosystem come together in discovering the opportunity,

40
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.930 
in exploring different possibilities to actually

41
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.179 
transform this opportunity and then lead to action,

42
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.889 
to combine different resources, to build an organization, to

43
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.539 
derive a strategy. And this is what we call following chain, the

44
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.370 
entrepreneurial process.

45
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.754 
Now looking a little bit more in depth, whether this entrepreneurial process

46
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.959 
is actually a unique process.

47
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.017 
No, it's not. It's a process that we can find in many

48
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.011 
other aspects as well. For example, in business development

49
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.995 
or innovation management.

50
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.939 
And what you can see here is obviously in order to create

51
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.684 
something new, in order to create something big, we need

52
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.297 
to recognize these opportunities.

53
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.238 
We need to identify possible business ideas and have

54
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.499 
this key question in mind.

55
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.479 
Do we solve a problem for a certain user

56
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.860 
or customer group? And then the second question, obviously,

57
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.449 
is the customer willing to pay for our problem,

58
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.219 
solution for our product or service and building on that,

59
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.410 
developing strategies and actually executing and growing

60
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.934 
the venture. And here is where the traditional

61
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.169 
entrepreneurial process, the business plan, business creation

62
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.268 
process comes in, where you conduct a marketing analysis, where you plan

63
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.703 
your value chain, where you do financial planning and analysis, and

64
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.746 
then found the firm, you execute the business idea and

65
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.459 
you actually realize hopefully a long term competitive advantage

66
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.106 
in order to stay on that market, to grow your business

67
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.589 
and to continuously develop the business further.

68
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.569 
So the entrepreneurial process stays in line within

69
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.639 
management, literature, management, research that it is not so unique,

70
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.630 
but it obviously has some aspects that are unique.

71
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.580 
So let's look into that.

72
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.709 
Starting with what exactly is an opportunity recognition.

73
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.939 
Now, you might have heard about opportunities, so

74
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.913 
starting with this process of an individual or maybe also

75
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.950 
a group identifying an opportunity.

76
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.339 
So seeing that there is something that is worth solving,

77
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.949 
many people talk about problem, but it could also not be

78
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.509 
a problem yet, but an opportunity to create

79
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.519 
something bigger. So looking at the world

80
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.866 
with fresh eyes, detecting such an opportunity, taking

81
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.348 
this first step to actually think about is

82
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.970 
this an opportunity worth pursuing?

83
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.690 
Is it worth creating a solution to this opportunity

84
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.459 
and then developing through the building of a new venture?

85
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.879 
So this is opportunity recognition.

86
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.859 
All right. You might ask yourself, OK, I've understood what an opportunity

87
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.149 
recognition is, but what do I actually need

88
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.699 
to recognize such an opportunity and how, if so,

89
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.079 
can I learn to recognize opportunities better?

90
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.445 
Now, you might remember that I told you that the entrepreneurial process is

91
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.509 
the opportunity, the individual and the ecosystem.

92
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.199 
So it all starts with the entrepreneurial attention.

93
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.959 
The entrepreneur, per se, is a curious person, so that person looks

94
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.949 
for information everywhere.

95
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.077 
So what are needs by people, by markets, do

96
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.360 
we see events happening?

97
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.335 
We currently have the covid-19 pandemic, there are lots of things

98
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.019 
that are actually popping up, problems to be solved.

99
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.889 
So to see these problems, to have a sensitivity for

100
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.487 
interests and new combination of resources, that will

101
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.830 
be a first step in the entrepreneurial attention process.

102
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.470 
Second, information asymmetry.

103
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.707 
What we have come to see in entrepreneurship research, but also practice,

104
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.874 
is that if you learn how to perceive

105
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.709 
your environment in a different way, you actually have an information

106
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.069 
overflow if you want to.

107
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.160 
You have that step before the others.

108
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:55.110 
You have more knowledge to actually create solutions.

109
00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:00.059 
So your personality and that will be the third factor is actually

110
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.709 
creating something, having this curiosity, this optimism

111
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.779 
to not only see the opportunity to create something

112
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.920 
out of it. The fourth factor would be social networks.

113
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.399 
And all of us have social networks, you have a family, you have friends, you have

114
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.980 
colleagues. And you might remember that we have told you before that there

115
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.839 
is this theory of strong ties and weak

116
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.898 
ties. So strong ties. This is your family.

117
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.629 
These are the people, your friends that know you best.

118
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.339 
And they can give you feedback on your ideas you have developed.

119
00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:42.899 
But you also have weak ties with colleagues, with business contacts, and those might

120
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.429 
actually be the ones who give you very good feedback on your

121
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.540 
first ideas, who help you with actually giving you new contacts.

122
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.789 
And then the fifth factor in the opportunity recognition is the

123
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.889 
process you're using to actually detect or recognize

124
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.850 
these opportunities. And this can actually be either strategically planned,

125
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.698 
systematic discovery or just rather randomly, because you just

126
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.950 
have learned how to look into the world with new eyes.

127
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.029 
So all of these factors are important to be aware of

128
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.149 
and they can be trained.

129
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.949 
It's not easy, but using this recognition

130
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.020 
can help you to actually develop these these

131
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.859 
skills and capabilities.

132
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.826 
So, not only training yourself, but actually

133
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.817 
using different tools help you in this first stage of the entrepreneurial

134
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.890 
process and there are a multitude of instruments and methods

135
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.238 
you can use. So you can, for example, look for value

136
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.259 
levers. So actually, can we take an opportunity and

137
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.309 
solve it in a different way? You might remember the mobility problem.

138
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.070 
We used all to have our own cars.

139
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.450 
Now we just use cars that are standing around.

140
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.700 
So the value lever is a different one.

141
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.209 
But we still have mobility. It's just not our own car anymore.

142
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.679 
We can observe macroeconomic trends.

143
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.039 
So, for example, if we see we're living in an older

144
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.559 
or older growing society, we have to think about

145
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.749 
again, taking mobility. Maybe the mobility means should look differently.

146
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.590 
We could solve the problem differently by creating new solutions.

147
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.859 
So again, does it always have to be your own car or can you actually

148
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.669 
use a combination of a bicycle, the

149
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:54.039 
S Bahn or the train or maybe also other means

150
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.470 
of transportation, so actually assembling those different solutions in

151
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.549 
a new way? And last but not least, it all goes along

152
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.130 
the way of identifying market gaps.

153
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.919 
So all they're actually Niches, that are not adequately served yet.

154
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.699 
And here again, there are different methods and tools you can use to actually

155
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.920 
look into the market and identify those opportunities.

156
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.289 
So this was just an overview of where the whole

157
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.159 
entrepreneurial process starts.

158
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.100 
It starts with the opportunity.

159
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.969 
Opportunity recognition can be trained and learned.

160
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.459 
There are different instruments and methods.

161
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.660 
And this is what we will explain in the next sessions to follow.

162
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.649 
Thank you.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.150 
This course is the third part of
our series on design thinking.

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.360 
You can still participate if you
haven't taken the first two

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.300 
courses but are interested in the
particular skills of prototyping

4
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.750 
and testing. Nonetheless, we recommend
to take a look at our first

5
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.600 
two MOOCs on design research
and design synthesis

6
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.990 
which are still accessible
in archive mode.

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.670 
In this video we will give you
a short summary of the other

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.930 
two courses. In the 'Inspirations
for Design' course, we walked

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.980 
through the phase of finding inspiration.
We focused on two essential

10
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.000 
skills in design research: observation
and qualitative interviews.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.940 
We asked learners to pay attention
to workarounds in their

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.250 
environment. Workarounds are fast
fixes that people create themselves

13
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.960 
to fulfill an unmet need. Participants
learned to phrase a 'Job

14
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.150 
to be done' formulation which helped
them to figure out the user's

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.090 
motivation. In the next step, we
explored the skill of qualitative

16
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.820 
interviewing together. Having an
open and honest conversation

17
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820 
with an interviewee can be very
inspiring for your topic.

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.240 
It helps us to learn about
other people's experiences.

19
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.540 
The course provided examples
for interviewing techniques

20
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.500 
and asked participants to
conduct their own interviews.

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.350 
In the course 'From synthesis to
creative ideas' we focused on

22
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
the skills of synthesizing user
data, facilitating a brainstorming

23
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.110 
session and selecting ideas. Our
learners sorted user data, extracted

24
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.620 
user needs and phrased a brainstorming
question based on their

25
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.330 
synthesis process. Participants learned
about different brainstorming

26
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.550 
techniques, facilitation principles
and ideas selection techniques.

27
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.340 
They facilitated their own
brainstorming session with the team

28
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
and shared their selected ideas.
In this course you will learn

29
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.890 
how to turn ideas into
tangible prototypes

30
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.080 
and how to test them with
users. We hope you enjoy it.

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.320 
Hi. In this lecture we're going to look at the regulatory framework that surrounds

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.990 
sustainable software engineering.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.680 
The software engineering team does not work in an isolated environment.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.070 
It's embedded into an organization and that organization is

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.690 
embedded into public regulation that might be laws or policies set by governments

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.490 
and of course our teams have to adhere to these.

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.460 
Why do we even need to talk about regulation when we talk about sustainable software engineering?

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.880 
One of the key goals of sustainable software engineering is

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880 
to take action against climate change.

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.910 
But when we talk about climate change, there are a couple of

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.820 
very strong impediments for stakeholders in the market to actually take action.

12
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.850 
And one of the key problems with it is that climate change

13
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.920 
and climate gas emissions that cause climate change are based on

14
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850 
an economic concept called negative externalities, which means that

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.440 
if your software for example uses a lot of infrastructure and

16
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.090 
that emits a lot of climate gas, for example carbon dioxide,

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.780 
these emissions are not a direct cost to your own organizations

18
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.900 
but there are costs to everyone else. For example by making earth less inhabitable.

19
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.380 
So what can regulations do to overcome these impediments for taking action?

20
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.030 
One of the things regulations can do is they can force market

21
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
participants to internalize these externalities. For example

22
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.990 
by placing a price on emissions. And that's one thing that's

23
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.640 
called emission certificates, for example that's already practice

24
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.990 
in a couple of legislations.

25
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.860 
Another thing is forcing companies to have to provide transparency

26
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.470 
about the negative externalities that they cause. For example,

27
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.270 
by forcing them to report how much emissions they are responsible for.

28
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.380 
And this can then allow other stakeholders in the market and

29
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.070 
participants to make better decisions. For example consumers

30
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.480 
can make decisions to purchase more sustainable products from more sustainable companies,

31
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.010 
investors can decide to only invest in sustainable companies and also

32
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.020 
employees can decide to only work for more sustainable companies.

33
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.290 
When we talk about establishing transparency, it's important

34
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.720 
that we have a common frame of reference for reporting the

35
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.360 
emissions caused by a company. And one of those is the greenhouse gas protocol

36
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.730 
that divides emissions into three different scopes. The first scope

37
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.100 
covers all the direct emissions caused by a company. So that's

38
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.470 
the emissions caused by the buildings or the vehicles that the company operates.

39
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.970 
Then we have the scope to emissions which also include all

40
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.030 
the energy and heat and steam and everything in terms of energy

41
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.590 
that the company consumes.

42
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.560 
And the scope three then is the broadest perspective and looks

43
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.840 
at the whole value chain. So it looks at the supply chain, so

44
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.070 
that's all the upstream activities, everything that the organization purchases.

45
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.670 
And it looks at the downstream activities. So everything that

46
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.710 
is caused by the products that the organization sells.

47
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.330 
And how does that apply to IT

48
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.810 
infrastructure specifically? Which is the most relevant aspect

49
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.050 
of it when it comes to sustainable software engineering.

50
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.240 
So if we had on-premise infrastructure that our application

51
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.240 
runs on, we would be talking about scope one emissions for the

52
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.560 
data center building for example, scope two emissions for the

53
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.220 
electricity that we purchase to run that data center

54
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.390 
and if we instead of running on prem, if we purchase our infrastructure

55
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.010 
from the cloud provider or from a colocation facility, we would

56
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.200 
be talking about scope three emissions for leased assets or services that we

57
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.350 
purchase. And downstream activities would be things like how much energy

58
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.140 
does our application consume on our users' devices? That would

59
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.320 
be covered by scope three emissions.

60
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.730 
So, if regulation comes and we have to report those, the greenhouse

61
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.470 
gas protocol would offer a very good framework for reporting these emissions.

62
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.080 
So, what regulations are there actually?

63
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.480 
The European Union has last year adopted a proposal for a corporate sustainability reporting directive

64
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.310 
that would require all companies

65
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.830 
in regulated markets, about fifty thousand companies right now, to report

66
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.690 
their sustainability

67
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.020 
in the financial year 2023 already.

68
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.090 
And this is expected to be signed into law by the end of 2022.

69
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.700 
The standards that have to be reported against like scope one,

70
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.140 
scope two, scope three emissions and how exactly to

71
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.080 
report this data is still being worked on by working groups.

72
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.410 
On a more global level however, a recent study found that it's

73
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.230 
very unlikely that even though there are initiatives, that there

74
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.270 
will be a common uniform sustainability reporting framework

75
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.420 
and that means that a thing like the corporate sustainability

76
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.700 
reporting directive is the most likely effective measure for

77
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.120 
the coming years.

78
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.220 
So if we talk about the corporate CSRD,

79
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.450 
we now have companies that will be forced to report their scope three emissions.

80
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.680 
And that will put additional priority on supply chain management specifically.

81
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.520 
And the way supply chain management is commonly practiced in

82
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.550 
the market today is that many organizations require their supply

83
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.950 
chain partners to have certain certifications.

84
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.080 
And the relevant certifications in terms of sustainability

85
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.020 
would be the ISO 14000 and ISO 50000 which

86
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.820 
are management systems for environmental management and energy management.

87
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.960 
What is a management system? A management system is the way in which an

88
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.470 
organization runs its internal processes and businesses to achieve its objectives.

89
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.780 
And that means if you have the ISO 50000 for energy

90
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.700 
management, it means that in your organization there's an established

91
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.380 
system for tracking how much energy you use and how you use it responsibly.

92
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.420 
How relevant is that in the market? So if we look at the infrastructure

93
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.010 
supply chain providers like Hyperscale cloud providers for example

94
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.710 
at the moment only Google cloud has a certification according

95
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.680 
to ISO 50001 and that only covers the European Union

96
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.040 
data centres in the EMEA region.

97
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.890 
What other certifications are there?

98
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.560 
There are attempts for example by the Blue Angel certificate,

99
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.060 
which is a German certificate system, very relevant for things

100
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.060 
like office supplies for example,

101
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.560 
to cover also things like software or co-location data centers and service.

102
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.410 
However looking at the relevance in the market at the moment

103
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.350 
there's very little certificates actually issued, which makes

104
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.470 
it questionable whether that is a an approach or a regulatory

105
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.980 
approach that will have a lot of influence on actual sustainable software engineering

106
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.850 
in the future.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.810 
Welcome back. This module is
about working through the data

2
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.580 
that you gathered and identifying the
hidden need or motivation behind

3
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.450 
what people say or do. The goal
here is to frame a new problem

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.300 
statement based on the needs
that you discovered.

5
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.010 
Let us give you an example of
how re-framing a problem from

6
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.970 
the user's perspective led
to innovative solutions.

7
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.510 
Doug Dietz was an industrial
designer at GE healthcare where

8
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.530 
he designed a new MRI
scanner machine.

9
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.300 
Once he visited a children's
hospital in Pittsburgh in the

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.550 
States to see the machine
he designed in use.

11
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.830 
There, he had a very
shocking observation:

12
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.210 
He saw a family with a little
girl going to the MRI room.

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.260 
But this little girl was
terrified! She had

14
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.960 
tears rolling down her eyes and
her family was also so exhausted

15
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.140 
and desperate.- Although MRI
is a cutting edge technology

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.700 
the experience of going into
an MRI is rather unpleasant.

17
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.440 
You have very little space in
there, it's very noisy and

18
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.650 
you have to go so in there by
yourself. So you can imagine as

19
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.340 
a kid it's a rather terrifying
and unpleasant experience.

20
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.410 
So Doug realized: "What
I designed is really

21
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.490 
looking like a brick with
a hole in it."

22
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.360 
Actually most of the children who
had to go through the scanner

23
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.090 
had to be sedated because they were
too afraid and they were moving

24
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.810 
around too much.- So when he
saw the reaction of the girl

25
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.790 
he was determined to make a change.
He signed up for a course

26
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.560 
and started to take this course called
"Creative Confidence"

27
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.270 
at the D.School in Stanford which
is a course where he learned

28
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.090 
about the human-centered approach
to design and innovation.

29
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.320 
So after that he went out and he
did field research: He talked

30
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.290 
to experts, he observed
kids in a kid's museum,

31
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.620 
he went to daycare centers, he went
to playgrounds, and he realized

32
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.430 
that kids don't need to be scared
of scary things as long as

33
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.450 
they are turned into
an adventure story.

34
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.250 
So he framed a new problem statement
and he wondered: "How might

35
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.570 
we turn an MRI scan for a scared
kid into an adventure?"

36
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.690 
So the solution that his team came
up with is called "Adventure

37
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.980 
Series". The
Adventure Series is

38
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.530 
a story around the MRI experience.
So it turns the whole

39
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.970 
MRI scanner, the scanning
room and the days even

40
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.940 
before the scanning appointment
into a big story.

41
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.850 
Imagine a little boy who likes
adventure stories about pirates.

42
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.710 
Before he goes to the
scanning appointment he

43
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.680 
receives a comic a book
that tells him about

44
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.040 
the adventure he's about to go
into. In this story he's a pirate

45
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.160 
he has to lie down very still so
that other pirates wouldn't

46
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.790 
hear him. When he arrives with
his family at the hospital

47
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.210 
the whole scanning room is
turned, visually transformed

48
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.180 
into a pirate ship. Even the
opening chamber of the

49
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.560 
MRI machine is surrounded
by the captain's wheel.

50
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.960 
So it's less claustrophobic and
looks more like a pirate ship.

51
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.540 
So at the scanning time he
has to lie down still,

52
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.610 
make no noise and it's exciting,
it's fun, it's part of a story.

53
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.450 
And when he's done he gets
to pick a treasure from

54
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.490 
the pirate's treasure chest.- So
as you can see the experience

55
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.580 
went from being terrifying
to being terrific.

56
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.620 
Parens and kids don't need to
fear the procedure anymore,

57
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.430 
the kids don't need to
be sedated anymore,

58
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.070 
and when they tried this out in their
first test round at the children's

59
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.030 
hospital in Pittsburgh,
they actually saw that

60
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.720 
the number of patients
who had to be sedated

61
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.850 
dropped by 99
percent: from 345

62
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.440 
cases down to just
four cases.

63
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.750 
So learning from the people
we wish to design for

64
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
helps us to frame a problem
from their perspective.

65
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.480 
Once you reframe to problem
from your user's perspective

66
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.880 
we can make sure that the solutions
we create will tackle a

67
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.990 
real need.- So in this week we
will talk about different types

68
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.520 
of qualitative data and also
give you this skills that you

69
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.410 
need to look into this data and
draw hidden needs and motivations

70
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.410 
behind them. And finally
we'll talk about how to

71
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.830 
phrase a new problem statement
from the user's perspective.

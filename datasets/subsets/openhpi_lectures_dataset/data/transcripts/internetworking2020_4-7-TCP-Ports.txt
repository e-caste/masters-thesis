00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.120 
In OpenHPI course a half century
of Internet now we speak about TCP ports,

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.960 
TCP ports, sockets and socket numbers.

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.440 
When TCP

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.800 
established a connection between two
systems and when TCP wants to maintain

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.720 
that connection, this virtual simulation
of a connection, then then the receiver

6
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.680 
set up end points of this connection,
so-called so-called sockets.

7
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.080 
In order to communicate,

8
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.160 
each socket contains a buffer to buffer
to stores read and to send data

9
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.040 
sockets exclusively to each sender

10
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.480 
and receiver and are available to use
for the entire TCAP connections duration.

11
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.080 
So they are provided
to support exactly that.

12
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.480 
That

13
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.000 
connection.

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.040 
And one can address such sockets.

15
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.480 
So each socket has a number.

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.200 
And this number consists of the IP address

17
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.920 
of the computer and a 16 bed number
which is assigned locally.

18
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120 
And this is the so called port.

19
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.040 
So ports and ports are the service
access points of the transport layer.

20
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.600 
They are part of the network address ports

21
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.240 
established assignment of a connection
between their client server and TCAP.

22
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.720 
Connect indifferent to IP, which connects
to computers to network interfaces.

23
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.400 
TCP connects to applications.

24
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.200 
So each GCP connection has two ports,

25
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.240 
a client port and deserve a port
on both sides.

26
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.720 
And this port can be no doubt
you remember a 16 bit number.

27
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.760 
So there is a range between zero and sixty
five thousand five hundred thirty five.

28
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.720 
This is equal to 2 to 16.

29
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.800 
This is a number of valid port numbers.

30
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.080 
And these poll numbers, this is this area

31
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.920 
of possible port numbers is separated into
the well known ports, these are ports.

32
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.600 
from number 0 to 1023.

33
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.440 
These poll numbers are reserved
for standard services.

34
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.000 
You know, HTP the protocol.

35
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.000 
So hypertext transfer protocol.

36
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.040 
Also World Wide Web application
is the port number 80.

37
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.960 
is 23, a domain name service, 53.

38
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.960 
Then we have the range between

39
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.640 
2024 to 60535.

40
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.200 
This can be freely assigned
to each application.

41
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.360 
And then there are further
poll numbers, numbers.

42
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:25.920 
So inside that range of well known ports,
there are so-called reserved ports.

43
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.840 
Number 0 to 255

44
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.800 
is reserved for TCP IP applications
for Internet applications

45
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.240 
and the range 256 to 1023 is
for certain Unix applications reserved

46
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.640 
and then on top of this well-known ports
inside the free the assigned ports

47
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.480 
there is a range
for so called register ports.

48
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.000 
There's a range of port numbers between

49
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.840 
2024 to 49158.

50
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.440 
And this registration is done by Yoanna

51
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.360 
and Internet national Internet
governance structure.

52
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.320 
Obviously also, you'll remember,

53
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.040 
responsible for the names, domain names
and then all the rest is called dynamic or

54
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.640 
private ports, which can be assigned
to communication parteners.

55
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.600 
How is that poll numbers are chosen?

56
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.680 
So poll numbers are chosen by two
applications when it is a connection is

57
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.040 
established, a destination port is a poll
number of the desired application.

58
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.040 
You remember,
for many of these applications,

59
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.200 
it is a reserved number
and a sore spot on the side of Zehnder.

60
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.640 
And this is not reserved and

61
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.240 
no which is not reserved and which is
not used by another connection.

62
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.240 
So it is a connection can be identified
by using two socket numbers

63
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.680 
to send us circuit number
and the receiver's docket number.

64
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.960 
You remember circuit numbers,

65
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:24.440 
our IP address of a computer plus support
number and same on the receiver side.

66
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.200 
So this succored number is
specify and TCAP connection

67
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.240 
is a socket can serve multiple
connections at the same time.

68
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.600 
And applications use

69
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:47.320 
Citicorp Transport Service
and they are using the TCP IP primitives

70
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.240 
as a simple controls which are
implemented way as a socket.

71
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.320 
So for example, for the command command

72
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:06.600 
request for response for confirm, read,
write, these are as simple TCP primitives.

73
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.840 
So these are connections between different

74
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.880 
applications, run wires, the TCP ports,
as a we are we have a

75
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.120 
system A, system B

76
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.160 
and here on the sender
sideare the source port.

77
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.040 
And on the receiver side, the server
side there are the ports.

78
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.560 
So if the sender wants to communicate,

79
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.840 
wants to have an HTTP communication
then here on the sender and the server

80
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.520 
side, it's clear the reserved
port for HTTP is 80.

81
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.720 
And here on the source port,

82
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.160 
a number can be chosen that's
not used by another connection.

83
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.240 
Or for me, for SMTP protocol
is a mail protocol.

84
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.480 
Then here we know is a
reserved port is a SMTP.

85
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.400 
It is port number 25.

86
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.920 
So here  the source port,
a number can be choosenchosen that's not used

87
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.160 
as a poll number.

88
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.680 
And so there are connections possible.

89
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.120 
There are interactions of different

90
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.040 
applications possible
over one TCP connection.

91
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.840 
And the reason that it works
are the use of TCP sockets

92
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.480 
for each of the applications set
one to interact with the other.

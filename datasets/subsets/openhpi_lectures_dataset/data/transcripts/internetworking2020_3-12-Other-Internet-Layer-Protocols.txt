00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.700 
In our OpenHPI course, a half-century
of the internet, we have discussed

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.410 
various details of the
internet protocol.

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:15.490 
Internet protocol belongs to the internet
layer of the TCP IP protocol stack

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.030 
and there are many more
protocols on that layer.

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.090 
And in the following, we have
to mention at least a few

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.390 
here is our TCP IP protocol stack,
here the internet layer IP

7
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.510 
protocol is the most important
protocol on the internet layer

8
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.690 
but on the internet layer there
is also the ICMP protocol or

9
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.170 
the as a pdf protocol spf
record we already discussed

10
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.360 
in the context of routing the same
is true for the bgp protocol

11
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.880 
but there are two more protocols
rpc arp and the rap era protocol

12
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.070 
which play an important role so
what we want to do is to have

13
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.960 
a closer look first to
the icmp protocol icmp

14
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.620 
the internet control
message protocol

15
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.410 
it was he published in RFC 792
and later on improved in

16
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.270 
RFC1256 and ICMP protocol
is very fundamental

17
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.960 
in the context of
error handling.

18
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.940 
So you see this on the small number
of RFCs that is an old protocol

19
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.080 
it is responsible for
error diagnosis,

20
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.970 
for example the accessibility
test of a system

21
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.280 
a with ping, it is responsible
for time stamp recording,

22
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.610 
recognizing expired time-marks,
routing table administration, and

23
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.540 
permissible MTU
determination.

24
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.570 
So ICMP messages are sent, they are
encapsulated in IP datagrams.

25
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.000 
If you remember the header field,
so there was a protocol field

26
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.810 
in the IP header
which shows itself

27
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.750 
as ICMP message
that is one.

28
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.320 
And these are the messages, so
the let's start here with the

29
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.560 
ICMP message, there is a type, a code,
a checksum and this is a payload

30
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.530 
of an IP datagram, where in
the header it's a hint that

31
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.620 
it is an ICMP message, and
this is the protocol type.

32
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.210 
These are the ICMP messages and
its message type has a number.

33
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.100 
So in the field, I just show you the
number of the messages included.

34
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.520 
So 0 stands for Echo reply, 3
for Destination Unreachable,

35
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.230 
4 for Source Quench, 5 for Redirect,
you see there is a list

36
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.790 
of different things. I do not show all,
these are the important messages.

37
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:24.720 
And ICMP messages are sent with such
numbers, encoding the message type,

38
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.670 
to show you an example, let's
look for the reachability test

39
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.150 
which can be done with ICMP. We have
our computer and we want to know

40
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.850 
whether there is another computer
connected to the internet,

41
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:50.250 
so we can send an ICMP reachability
test and then the response

42
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.000 
as the router responses with an ICMP
echo request and which tells us yes,

43
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.570 
if a system is accessible
not. The service

44
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.050 
that is doing this is ping, that's a tool
for testing the accessibility of the host,

45
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.110 
and this tool utilizes
the ICMP echo request.

46
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.370 
So here this is the ICMP
echo-request for reachability.

47
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.900 
and this is for unreliability,
you see 2 different responses.

48
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.860 
This is a very easy, very simple
service because the question

49
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.540 
with the system is accessible, is asked
in situations if something goes wrong,

50
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.940 
that is a little bit in the context
of also of failure handling. So

51
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.190 
the messages need to be very simple
to give a corresponding answer.

52
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.430 
Second protocols that I want
to mention here which is

53
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.590 
in addition to the IP
protocol on layer 0 or 1,

54
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.310 


55
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.960 


56
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.590 


57
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.830 
TCP/IP protocol stack. This
is our protocol's address,

58
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.130 
resolution protocol, we already
discussed in different situations

59
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.900 
about ARP protocol without
going into detail.

60
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.970 
You remember the router must convert an
IP address in the local network address

61
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.220 
into the IP address when it
realizes that the receiver

62
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.000 
of a message belongs to a local network
then it has to translate this IP address

63
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.010 
into the local network address, for
example into the internet address.

64
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:53.040 
Because inside a network inside the
internet, for example, no computer,

65
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.080 
no system knows and can
handle internet addresses.

66
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.010 
The internet addresses are part of the
body of the payload of the packages,

67
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.400 
so the router for coming from the internet
from a network far away of course,

68
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.760 
to transport is organised on
the basis of IP addresses,

69
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.780 
because it's the only
way in these networks

70
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.610 
to uniquely define a network.
So this router reaches

71
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.870 
this IP package,

72
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.870 
and sees a message should be
sent to this IP address,

73
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.570 
this is a receiver of said message
coming from the internet,

74
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.380 
now the router has a task to
translate this IP address

75
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.180 
into a MAC address, because
inside the local area network,

76
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.500 
only such MAC address
could be understood.

77
00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.860 
So in practice what is
done, it's done by means

78
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:08.060 
of ARP tool, a database
which interconnects MAC

79
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.600 
addresses and IP addresses
of the systems.

80
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.680 
So the ARP protocol, it looks like
to this database, finds out

81
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.100 
okay, this was the IP address, this
is a corresponding MAC address,

82
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:29.940 
and then the router can wrap
this data and IP package in a

83
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.600 
internet package. When it's on the
internet and address it to this

84
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.740 
corresponding
mac address.

85
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:47.060 
The DHCP protocol I also want to mention
the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,

86
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.140 
and it is an important scenario
the internet is accessed

87
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:59.160 
with a smart device via a local
network y a WiFi, so you

88
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.440 
are anywhere in the world and
you want to connect with your

89
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.360 
smartphone to
the internet,

90
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:11.220 
then you need an IP address
to be able to receive

91
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.420 
packages over the internet,
as well as to send them,

92
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.110 


93
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.890 


94
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.570 
IP address is needed.

95
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.830 
Which is done
by themself,

96
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:36.440 
if one knows the host network in detail
and if one knows which is the range

97
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:43.170 
of IP addresses and what are the
IP addresses. But this seldom,

98
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:53.450 
more often one needs support
which is provided by the DHCP

99
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.410 
by the dynamic host
configuration protocol.

100
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.320 
And this protocol takes
care of the allocation

101
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.200 
of an IP address have a
dynamic IP address,

102
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:12.020 
and it assigns to hostname and IP
address and it gives information

103
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:17.630 
for the source what are the default
gateway to connect to the internet,

104
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.680 
and then this information about
the next domain name server

105
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:29.990 
is given by this protocol. So
the protocol is equipping

106
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:36.730 
a system that arrives in a network, with
all the information that is needed,

107
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.080 
to a to get connected
to the internet.

108
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.970 
DHCP server typically is
a part of the router,

109
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.780 
records as a host and records its
information. So when data packets arrive,

110
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:58.740 
the router is able to forward
it to the right receiver.

111
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:06.690 
You can see what the DHCP protocol is doing
, the dynamic host configuration protocol

112
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:13.330 
they are depending on the
operating system of your device.

113
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:21.370 
The IP configuration can be used
with the tool ipconfig or

114
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.460 
ifconfig tools and here then
you see this information. You

115
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.170 
can see this is the IP address
it's a sign system that is a

116
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:37.410 
broadcast address, it's important
for sending information to

117
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:44.140 
a router and to others. So
it's a system after the DHCP

118
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:51.240 
protocol has done its work, it can behave
like an ordinary member offices network.

119
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.660 
It can send any kind of message
into the internet, it can receive

120
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.320 
messages from the internet so
it's a very important tool,

121
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.600 
particularly for our mobile
access to the internet.

122
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:13.430 
So there are also other protocols,
but these are the main important

123
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:20.030 
protocols of the
internet layer.

124
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.840 
and I hope you have got enough
insight to understand what the

125
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.530 
IP protocol and the other
protocols are responsible for.

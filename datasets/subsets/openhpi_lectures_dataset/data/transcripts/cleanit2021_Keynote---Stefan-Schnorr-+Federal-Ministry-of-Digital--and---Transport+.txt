1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.969 
Ladies and gentlemen, dear Professor Meinel, first of all, thank you very much for the invitation to this event today.

2
00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.710 
And I think I'm just peeking into the room a little bit -

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.759 
the percentage of ladies still needs to be increased.

4
00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:19.550 
There are a lot of men here, so a few ladies should be added, I think.

5
00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.120 
The old clichÃ© in the field of technology are more men than women is, I think, no longer necessarily given, but still

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.750 
still a little bit.

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.239 
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, I am very pleased to be here today.

8
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:37.640 
You know that the new federal government, which took office last year, is committed to

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:47.549 
has dared to make more progress. On the one hand, of course, the topic of digitization is a key element of this, so to speak,

10
00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:55.810 
Digitization in all areas, public administration, health, business, education, working life. On the other

11
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.990 
side, however, this necessarily includes, and this is a realization that is not new, but has now been brought more into focus,

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.709 
sustainability. So climate protection and digitization are both top priorities for the new federal government.

13
00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:21.109 
And I believe that the two are also compellingly interrelated, because digitization precisely involves a large number of different measures

14
00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.650 
to achieve the goal of sustainability.

15
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.079 
We want, it's clear, to become carbon neutral as quickly as possible.

16
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.969 
And we have a cross-cutting theme not only on the topic of digitization, but also on the topic of sustainability,

17
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.980 
a topic that moves us all. Found it very nice, as someone just said, the issue of sustainability and energy efficiency

18
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.609 
Is just our common theme as well.

19
00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:53.480 
It's not the job of politics, it's not the job of business, it's not the job of the individual, it's our common.

20
00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:03.500 
Everyone has to do their part here. As the Ministry of Digital and Transport and Mobility, I think we have two crucial

21
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:13.469 
points and directions to take. Because the mobility sector is one that produces significant CO2 emissions still, the entire mobility sector, in fact.

22
00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:19.539 
In this respect, to tie in with this and, on the other hand, to bring digitization forward.

23
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.750 
I think that this mixture in the ministry, as we have it now, is indeed good as well.

24
00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:33.610 
We have first of all readjusted ourselves in the BMGV, as the abbreviation is called, in the sense that we now have two departments for

25
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.449 
digitization, one for digital policy and one for data policy.

26
00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.289 
Because I think in all of this - and this is also to some extent the case with the clean IT initiative.

27
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.949 
You also need data, you need to know where the consumption actually is. Digital and data policy on the one hand.

28
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.759 
And the issue of digital connectivity, so networks and applications on the networks

29
00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:05.599 
on the other side. And of course, not just because it's appropriate, but because I think it's compelling, we

30
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.770 
also have departments or units for sustainability in each of these areas, so that in all the activities that we do on the

31
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.250 
sustainability issue along with all the activities that we are launching.

32
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:24.250 
The first task that we've set ourselves, where it's our turn now, is that for the federal government, we're going to have a digitalization strategy

33
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.250 
develop, so to say: where will we be in four years, what goals do we want to achieve?

34
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.280 
We've always done quite a bit of work in the past, a little bit there, little bit here

35
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.280 
but we never had the vision, where do we actually want to be in four or five or in six or in seven years. And

36
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.930 
that's what we want to show with the new digital strategy, which is to be adopted by the summer. Where do we want to

37
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.680 
actually go, and then to look at making sure that everything that we do along the way over the next four years is aligned with that

38
00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:04.539 
goal and doesn't have a lot of small construction sites where you do something, but that you have a red thread, an

39
00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:11.050 
overall goal and thus also an umbrella for where digitization should go.

40
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.560 
And it's clear that compelling component - I've said this before, and I'm going to say this more and more today - with

41
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.050 
all the measures that we are working out there,

42
00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:29.980 
the issue of energy efficiency, climate protection, sustainability is of very central importance. The contribution of digitalization

43
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.600 
to achieving this sustainability is, I believe, in many ways. We can on the one hand

44
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:47.019 
capture data through digitization, provide data, analyze data, create higher transparency. We can model

45
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:55.399 
through digitization, we can capture the increasingly complex processes through digital technologies,

46
00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:56.480 
make them more transparent.

47
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.149 
We can show interactions, we can also control processes in real time.

48
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.300 
You all know the examples,

49
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.850 
I want to briefly mention some of them again independently:

50
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:17.519 
In agriculture, we can use digital technology to significantly reduce the use of chemicals and fertilizer systems,

51
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:20.750 
Because we can use in with pinpoint accuracy.

52
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.160 
We can use in traffic control, and I don't just mean avoiding stop and go, traffic control

53
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.600 
optimization, we can especially - and the issue of energy is, after all, made more difficult by the terrible war of aggression waged by the Russians against the

54
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.209 
Ukrainians in all our consciousness -

55
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:48.730 
we can use it, in particular, to advance the issue of energy, intelligent energy systems. In 2010, when I was in the Federal Ministry of Economics

56
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.750 
back then, there were already initiatives for smart grid.

57
00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.649 
That was - I'll put it this way - a bit of a thing for enthusiasts, for technicians, what you can do there, how you can build an intelligent

58
00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:02.050 
energy system that can be made.

59
00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:11.009 
Ten years later, we have made significant progress and are well on our way, even though the smart meter in Germany is still

60
00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.800 
a niche existence.

61
00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
But we can simplify energy control, and therefore energy consumption, quite significantly through digitization,

62
00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.410 
including electromobility.

63
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:32.160 
The car as storage, all of that can only be done through digital control, and that's something we've been talking about in recent

64
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.250 
years.

65
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.000 
When Professor Meinel and I sat down, I think, in the autumn of last year,

66
00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:41.230 
he said: Dear Mr. Schnurr,

67
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.370 
the software also consumes energy.

68
00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:50.649 
Yes, that is clear, but that has not been so on the screen, I must say quite honestly. I have just in the institute

69
00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:56.649 
in the interview with your students, you notice it when you have a lot of applications running on your computer,

70
00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:00.180 
That it gets hotter than if I'm just doing anything else.

71
00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:01.490 
As I said, I'm a lawyer,

72
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.540 
not a technician, so there's a higher energy consumption.

73
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.819 
And how can the software actually affect that?

74
00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:14.550 
I'll get to the Clean IT Initiative later, but I think it's very good that we're looking at this issue as well.

75
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.120 
The first order of business that we took for us,

76
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.170 
next to the digital strategy is first of all to expand Internet and telecommunications infrastructure in Germany, fiber optic connections

77
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:35.250 
for everyone by 2030 and to triple the current number by 2025.

78
00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:41.720 
This is part of the gigabit strategy that we have presented in the key points last week to you through our minister

79
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:50.449 
We want to make fiber optics and also mobile networks with the latest standard, of course, available nationwide.

80
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:56.939 
That's imperative because when we talk about the contribution of digitization also for sustainability and about new technologies

81
00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:57.350 
talk -

82
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.029 
without the infrastructure, without the network, of course, the whole thing doesn't work.

83
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:10.120 
And I'm very glad that the industry, the telecommunications industry, the companies Telekom, Vodafone, Telefonica, 1und1,

84
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:18.639 
but also all the fiber optics and many other providers will spend 50 billion euros on the expansion of the digital infrastructure

85
00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:22.170 
in Germany by 2025.

86
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:30.290 
This also shows the pressure that exists in the industry to optimize the networks in Germany, that ideally we will then have

87
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:37.539 
as soon as possible, we no longer have any wireless gaps. And we are also, by the way, this on the side for those who use the railroads, with the

88
00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:44.049 
Deutsche Bahn to significantly improve the Internet and cellular coverage on the trains.

89
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.110 
The important thing, ladies and gentlemen, sustainability through digitization. I have given examples, but the important one just

90
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:58.000 
is also sustainability in digitization, and I found the examples that were just brought up in the panel discussion

91
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.659 
very nice- When I buy a refrigerator, especially with the TV probably also, I look at the energy label.

92
00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:11.850 
What number does it have- A or what we changed everything, but I have a transparency. I know what

93
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:18.750 
my device consumes, and of course that also decides or determines the buyer's decision to some extent.

94
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.409 
In this respect, I think that label, standards was also addressed,

95
00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:32.409 
is certainly important. I don't know if the state is the most called upon to make specifications now for energy efficiency

96
00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:33.149 
of appliances.

97
00:09:33.149 --> 00:09:36.850 
I think that's a shared responsibility of all of us as well.

98
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:44.620 
I'm a great believer in the self-reliance of the business community to get things done through self-commitments, because for

99
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:52.269 
every company, an energy-efficient device of course also represents a competitive advantage in the market,

100
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:54.950 
but certainly you have to set targets.

101
00:09:55.139 --> 00:10:02.649 
That just wouldn't be the number one thing for me to sort of drive sustainability in digitization.

102
00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:10.470 
But, and this is also important for me - in the area of infrastructure, which we are working on, we can also do a great deal of

103
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.720 
generating sustainability.

104
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:20.019 
Fiber needs much less energy than copper networks and modern mobile standards in turn need less

105
00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:22.179 
energy than previous networks.

106
00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:27.250 
In this respect, we can also build our grids more energy efficient.

107
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.049 
But what we really need is to improve the data.

108
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.049 
The labels can provide such an opportunity.

109
00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:43.600 
The discussion of "I don't care about energy consumption if I have green electricity" doesn't lead anywhere from my point of view.

110
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.860 
Of course, we want to and will significantly increase the share of green electricity.

111
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:53.629 
But we will not be able in the foreseeable future to cover the entire energy consumption in Germany with green electricity,

112
00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:54.659 
with green power.

113
00:10:54.669 --> 00:11:01.899 
It's not going to work, perspectively maybe, if you have storage technologies and other. So we will continue to

114
00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:09.570 
have to use electricity from non-renewable sources. So we need to look at making sure that our devices

115
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:20.700 
consume less and therefore just improving the data. And also transparency, because I don't know how it's just

116
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:27.450 
whether everybody knows what a Wikipedia search query consumes in terms of electricity.

117
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:34.259 
I don't know if everybody who streams a video and pays attention to it, depending on where they watch it -.

118
00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:40.190 
if they're watching it on the three meter screen, they might want to have full HD resolution, if it's on smaller

119
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.549 
device, then maybe a lower resolution is enough - and that you use a lot less power.

120
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.850 
You know that, I know that, but does everybody know that?

121
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:57.669 
That's why I think the transparency question: what electricity consumption are we generating by what we're doing?

122
00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:06.490 
This transparency, I think, needs to be significantly increased, and we need to, through this data situation that we're creating, just

123
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.549 
also look at how we can better link different sectors.

124
00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:21.559 
And if you look at the HPI initiative, I think, in fact, the issue for you as well, Prof.

125
00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:26.059 
Meinel and for your team not so easy to determine.

126
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.860 
What power consumption is generated by the software?

127
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:35.029 
That's what you're working on, that's what you're researching. Not just looking at what does the device need with software, but what does it need?

128
00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:43.250 
the software alone. Bringing about that programming and sustainability in the design in the programming,

129
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.700 
I think that's a very important contribution, and that's why I was happy to come to this conference and hope that

130
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:56.700 
you also gain new insights in this conference. And all I can say is that the more information you have, you give

131
00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:03.980 
us that! We're like a sponge there and we're happy to soak it all up and, of course, integrate that into the strategies,

132
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:09.299 
that we will be launching in terms of digitization and sustainability over the next few years.

133
00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:16.909 
And we will of course discuss these issues not only in Germany - we also have an international conference here.

134
00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:25.740 
We will, for example, also discuss the issue of sustainability at the G7 Ministerial Conference, which will be held on May 11 in DÃ¼sseldorf

135
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.669 
will be very prominent.

136
00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:35.649 
How can we also contribute in the circle of the G7, the world's leading economies, to ensure that

137
00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:42.200 
not only digitization, but also sustainability in and through digitization can be brought forward?

138
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:50.429 
We have a first multi-stakeholder conference on this with many players on April 6th and that's where Professor Meinel will be

139
00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:55.129 
presenting the status of our work so far.

140
00:13:55.139 --> 00:14:00.149 
That is, also at the international level, we are trying to elevate the whole issue.

141
00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:08.730 
But what we need at the end of the day is the expertise and professionalism that you have, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why I'm glad to see

142
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:16.669 
very happy to see that you are not just doing research in the quiet, as they say, but that what you are developing

143
00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:25.210 
publicly as well. That you also inform us as a government about your findings, so that we can then also jointly

144
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:32.559 
look at how we can translate what you have worked out into policy, into more transparency, into maybe

145
00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:34.600

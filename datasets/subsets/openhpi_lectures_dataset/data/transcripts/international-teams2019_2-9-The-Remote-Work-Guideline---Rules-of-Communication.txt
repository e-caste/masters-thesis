1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.440 
So, Salim. You said communication
plays a great role and sometimes,

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.520 
poor communication may actually
ruin the whole project so, are

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.210 
there any rules of communication?
Definitely Hanadi, without good

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.240 
communication the successful remote
teamwork, will not happen.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.780 
Let's say this is the gold
rule, for having success

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.180 
in the whole project
of remote work.

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.240 
Particularly because, if you
do not communicate properly

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.520 
at the end, it is not the
success of the project what

9
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.710 
is been in question but it is
the whole success of the

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.700 
whole organization.
There are some rules

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.630 
but therefore, we need to
consider, first of all,

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.350 
communication has to happen because
we need social interaction.

13
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.810 
We need social interaction, even
if we are remotely working.

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.710 
We need social interaction
and this interaction

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.770 
must be promoted by the
management, by the team leaders,

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.260 
even by the people that
are working there.

17
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.210 
When I say social interaction,
it doesn't need

18
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.530 
necessarily to mean that
we are talking about

19
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.090 
the project, the delivery time,
the format of the document.

20
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.600 
We can talk also about easy
things, what's going on in life?

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.170 
what is news? All this
normally happens in

22
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.870 
the traditional offices, probably
in the kitchen or probably

23
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.840 
when we were working together
in a meeting room, and

24
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.600 
you cannot get rid of this, social
interaction is important.

25
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.040 
Not only for some people but
for the whole organization.

26
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.540 
It is necessary to know,
which is the flow in the

27
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.630 
organization. Please listen
constantly to feedbacks,

28
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.550 
if you stop listening to feedbacks,
the other thing will happen

29
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.680 
you will fail because if you
don't listen what is the

30
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.020 
problem? Also, again not just
about the project, or what you

31
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.730 
are doing, feedback about what
is happening for you working

32
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.850 
remotely? Probably you
will say, you know

33
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.880 
these things are working so good,
that I will move now to the place

34
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.310 
I wanted to be all my
life, I will go there.

35
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.730 
Make sure of course, you have
a good internet connection,

36
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.610 
otherwise, you would not be
able to work properly.

37
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.420 
Please keep in mind, don't hide
information from the rest of

38
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.260 
the company. If you start saying,
only with this team, I will

39
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.310 
start a remote work environment
and the others will not get

40
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.160 
involved in that or at least will
not get informed about what

41
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.490 
is happening, it will make
a lot of noise and the

42
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.260 
potential projects starting
with the target of having

43
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.190 
success, will not happen because
the people feel that they

44
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.800 
are not involved. They probably...
one day I can work into

45
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.410 
remote environment? Probably not. Just
speak about the whole project to

46
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.620 
everyone, clearly, even if they
are not going to be part of this

47
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.720 
but at least they know that
something is happening there.

48
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.130 
And also the feedback from the
people that are not going

49
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.790 
to be part of this starting project,
you also need the feedback

50
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.780 
from them because for them
sometimes, something relevant and

51
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.910 
probably they are not going to
be there but they will have

52
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.460 
also, information that you
will need to consider.

53
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.590 
When you're talking
about communication,

54
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.930 
Tom mentioned before, there are two
kinds of communication, synchronous

55
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.140 
and asynchronous communication. When
to use synchronous communication

56
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.830 
and when to use asynchronous
communication?

57
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.970 
Please, and this is something
I really... great advice,

58
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.530 
don't try to manage everything,
using the chatting system.

59
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.740 
The chatting system can
make things easy,

60
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:22.340 
but prefer before, talk to people, take the phone and talk to them because, the
missing elements in the chat communication are enormous and you're losing a lot of

61
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.360 
fidelity in this communication.
Talk, take the phone, talk

62
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.720 
even if you have a
video, talk via video.

63
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.340 
Don't find an excuse, it is by far
easier now? It is easier, yes.

64
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.190 
but remember, you are losing
lots of information that

65
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.300 
is definitely relevant in order
to make things happen. In the

66
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.420 
rules of communication, consider
when to use synchronous and

67
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.050 
asynchronous communication. And
also, the effect of the missing

68
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.150 
face to face communication that
exists in normal settings.

69
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.970 
You will have some people
complaining because we used

70
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.680 
to have a meeting, we used to
discuss this in the kitchen,

71
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.850 
When we have something...
What do you recommend for

72
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.080 
this? They don't need to go into
a full program, permanently

73
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.800 
remotely. Share people,
join people, make things

74
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.530 
to work dynamically because
then the people will not feel

75
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.760 
that they will not meet each
other again in our life

76
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.010 
and some people are quite
dramatic. No, we will keep...

77
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.960 
Just make things that have rhythm in the organization
and believe me, the team themselves they will find

78
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.430 
their own rhythm. But only you
will get this if you are

79
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.880 
ready to listen to feedback, if
you are not ready to listen

80
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.310 
to feedback then things are done.
Make the follow-up meetings,

81
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.660 
not a lot, but make them
and try them to be

82
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.180 
five people with video
start talking, chat,

83
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.910 
make also desktop sharing, so
that the people are seeing what

84
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.740 
you are doing, use the collaboration
tool that Tom mentioned before.

85
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.180 
All those are expectations
that the parties,

86
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.610 
all parties are having,
will it work in this way?

87
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.170 
Can I rely on them if they
are working outside

88
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.070 
of the city? Will they
deliver what I expected?

89
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.170 
All these communications
they bring a lot of

90
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.230 
energy and a lot of input, that the
whole team will profit from it,

91
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.070 
not just organization, the whole
team. If I know that you

92
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.240 
have some experience of
good or bad experiences,

93
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.730 
working in such conditions,
certain settings, then I would

94
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.440 
not go into that thing. If
I know that for instance

95
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.120 
you reserve a room and your
home, only for this thing and

96
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.160 
you close it, you had a different kind
of lighting or something like that,

97
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.820 
these are some experiences
that we share.

98
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.900 
This is a new environment, this
is a dynamic environment

99
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.980 
and all of us need to profit
out of this management

100
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.750 
also the employees. Thank you,
Salim. We would like now

101
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.880 
to see what would you consider
as mandatory in the

102
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.460 
communication with managers, or
with your colleagues, or with

103
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.740 
any member of the organization
you work, when working

104
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.140 
remotely? If you have any questions
or any comments, please

105
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.230 
feel free to join the discussion, we will be
happy to read them. Thank you. Thank you Hanadi

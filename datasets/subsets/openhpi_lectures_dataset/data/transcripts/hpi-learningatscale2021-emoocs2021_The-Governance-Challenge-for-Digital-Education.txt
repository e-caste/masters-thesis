1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.420 
so welcome to everyone to this

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.950 
last but not least meeting in our future track.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.420 
the governance challenge for digital education.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.470 
now for those of you i hope most of you who have been listening

5
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.970 
to the plenary session.

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.970 
the overall picture was incredibly

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.690 
promising  and looks like

8
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.820 
we are now you know in this fantastic new digital highway

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
moving very fast towards the goal that we had in a way in our minds

10
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.530 
for the past ten years.

11
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.310 
of course we know that this is happening to some

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.870 
extent, but at the same time

13
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.780 
we are aware that it is not exactly so

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.380 
easy to manage the change.

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.980 
and the aim of this panel

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.100 
is just to try and discuss together

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.130 
what different experiences are in various savings universities,

18
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.870 
but also what kind of

19
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.750 
idea we are in a way getting from our understanding from our status within our

20
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.080 
church about what is going on

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.300 
all over all over europe all over the united states all over the globe.

22
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.420 
because one thing we are definitely aware of

23
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.520 
is that this is no more

24
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.650 
a western game. this is something which was a bit lacking

25
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.070 
in the plenary that we just followed a few minutes ago.

26
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.830 
and it's very interesting to see what are the expectations with

27
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.920 
respect to the tremendous rise in asian

28
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.530 
distance learning digital education that we have seen through the college year

29
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.590 
both in china and in india.

30
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.230 
and so what kind of governance issues are there for

31
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.230 
individual universities for government facing.

32
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.250 
this change for the first time.

33
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.350 
and i am very happy to introduce the panelists.

34
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.450 
i am arakanese am a professor of political science a size social scientist.

35
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.350 
i look at this with interest over the researcher in the first place,

36
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.640 
but i am also the founder and director of federica web

37
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.220 
learning which is the largest

38
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.460 
multimedia provider of italian courseware words white.

39
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.470 
and we also have an i would managing director of online education

40
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.440 
at cambridge university press.

41
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.910 
lee lama vice president over the plus and chief operating officer

42
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.210 
or as you online at it's own a state university.

43
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.760 
and an old friend of all MOOCs, eMOOCs.

44
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.660 
i mean editions martin verseing

45
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.570 
professor

46
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.390 
and a former vice president for teaching a status at this university.

47
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.470 
and also one of the outstanding researcher in this field that

48
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.890 
we have all now somewhat fallen in love with.

49
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.830 
so i would say that we start with individual presentations.

50
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.430 
and then try to have as much as questions and answer as much as

51
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.570 
time for questions and answers from the floor. so if Anna would

52
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.150 
take the stage thank you very much.

53
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.750 
thank you. hi everyone i'm just going to pull up my presentation so bear

54
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.580 
with me a minute.

55
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.620 
let me start by just briefly introducing myself.

56
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.190 
my name is Anna Wood. and i'm managing director of cambridge online education.

57
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.920 
we're a new team based in cambridge university press and working to basically put

58
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.390 
more content online across the university of cambridge.

59
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.820 
and our first program of activity is a suite of around fifty short courses which we're

60
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.540 
launching under the kind of umbrella title of cambridge advance online.

61
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.440 
and but before i joined cambridge in january,
i spent six years building an online.

62
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.300 
and professional education capability at king's college london.

63
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.110 
so i'm going to be talking today about the challenges of digital

64
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.550 
education governance within universities, and how to overcome them

65
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.560 
and much of what i'm saying here is uk specific and tends to

66
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.320 
refer to the more traditional universities and their approaches.

67
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.540 
ok disclaimer over. time to dive into the challenges. so

68
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.040 
this is kind of just the backdrop in.

69
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.850 
i think it was focused on the it was a UK workshop. but these are i

70
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.220 
think global challenges. so

71
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.450 
the two that i'd like to really pull out here is digital is

72
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.810 
now the top growth strategy for one quarter of higher education leaders

73
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.260 
and lots of them see it in a way of terms of gaining competitive

74
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.870 
advantage over other close competitors. so

75
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.580 
effectively this is still seen as something new and something

76
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.900 
that people can get ahead on.

77
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.750 
and then actually i just want to skip one to the last.

78
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.570 
but point which is the complexity of the task ahead.

79
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.020 
you know that's recognised there's lots of competing ideas.

80
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.210 
but not an understanding of the integration and implications of different systems.

81
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.590 
and i want to kind of pull both of those things

82
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.100 
out in my presentation now.

83
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.790 
so the first challenge,

84
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.120 
i think for universities in education governance and otherwise is speed,

85
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.340 
agility and flexibility and what do i mean by them. well digital

86
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.330 
is faster than the rest of the organization generally speaking.

87
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.120 
yet and university processes and structures are rarely set

88
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.750 
up to accommodate a non standard academic year

89
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.180 
or to be able to jump on to new kind of market signals new opportunities

90
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.010 
at a short in a short space of time.

91
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.550 
when i started kings online in early twenty sixteen.

92
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.130 
we went live with two master's programs that had six enrollment periods a year.

93
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.910 
and despite our best planning efforts when we went live. the sister

94
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.110 
systems just one set up to be able to automate much of the

95
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.320 
back-end work that we needed to put in place.

96
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.420 
so when we started with manual processes it meant that the

97
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.230 
operational setup did not then evolve at pace with our scaling of student numbers.

98
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.190 
and at each intake the manual interventions we designed to

99
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.160 
work around existing systems did not always adequately support

100
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.030 
the learning experience.

101
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.630 
kings worked hard on getting that right,

102
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.420 
but it was five years down the line. it wasn't at the start.

103
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.230 
and you know furthermore i think the programme approval at

104
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.580 
universities committees is cumbersome. it's long winded and

105
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.520 
committees generally only meet twice a term. you

106
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.310 
know that the paperwork is like a doorstop.

107
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.160 
and the annual planning round at least within UK universities

108
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.070 
are always based on september course launches.

109
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.610 
so as a result innovation in education online courses, short

110
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.890 
courses, professional education can feel out of sync with the normal education ecosystem.

111
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.110 
and it becomes hard then to make it part of core business.

112
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.430 
i have a couple of mitigations though. i think

113
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.720 
if you're thinking about doing online education at scale.

114
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.400 
i would say you know

115
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.340 
my one big piece of advice from kings would be to push for

116
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.420 
system integration and automation right from the start. it's

117
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.390 
what i'm doing now at cambridge. and it's gonna make a huge

118
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.810 
difference further down the line.

119
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.100 
also kind of use the flip to remote working to try and influence. how

120
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.090 
things are working within universities you know part of the

121
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.140 
reasons why academics didn't want to

122
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.900 
hold frequent meetings was the schlepping between campuses.

123
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.230 
but you know we can now hold meetings online. they can be shorter

124
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.590 
they can be more frequent and in these ways we can really start

125
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.790 
to sort of embed digital as something more than an adham.

126
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.710 
the second challenge i'd like to speak about is silo'd teams,

127
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.900 
so in the uk at least digital education is often fragmented.

128
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.930 
and there's overlap in roles and responsibilities making a holistic and coded

129
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.840 
coordinated approach extremely complex.

130
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.300 
for universities that have already made significant investment

131
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.380 
in the digital space. there can be up to four different units

132
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.510 
with responsibilities for kind of facilitating that, so you

133
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.300 
have a kind of central what we call technology and an enhanced

134
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.310 
learning team in the UK. they sometimes report into at they

135
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.510 
sometimes report into education. but they're principally responsible

136
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.280 
for the virtual learning environment and digital tools. you

137
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.190 
then have your centers for excellence in teaching and learning.

138
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.100 
they're primarily focused on pedagogy and academic staff development

139
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.980 
within faculties you have some local faculty resource

140
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:30.280 
differing levels of course. and they tend to focus on supporting and upskilling

141
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.890 
faculty in learning technologies and the digital environment.

142
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.120 
and lastly and often the newest team teams that

143
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.880 
leah and i both run it will be online and desert online design and development

144
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.820 
capability and units which tend to be the ones that are growing

145
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.120 
most rapidly within universities.

146
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.450 
all of these units on paper have responsibility for different things.

147
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.250 
but there's an actual reality. there's loads of overlap.

148
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.730 
key elements of the digital environment including the v early

149
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:06.330 
learning design and pedagogy become the responsibility of multiple areas.

150
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.240 
and it you know it makes for a confusing environment particularly

151
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.290 
for academics of who to go to for what.

152
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.560 
so what couple of things we did at king's was to

153
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.660 
encourage consistency across these particularly these towle

154
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.570 
roles the faculty technology enhanced learning roles with standardized

155
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.940 
job descriptions of grades.

156
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.970 
we protected resource to deliver the commercial priorities

157
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.680 
which was primarily the online master's programs. but we also

158
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.150 
had an ability we created an ability to be able to share expertise

159
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.130 
more widely and help to deliver the wider education strategy.

160
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.190 
i think the universities need to think now. sixty post code

161
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.520 
about what their strategy and business case for blended learning

162
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.790 
is as that is where a lot of confusion across the siloed teams happens

163
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:57.540 
and moving following on from that you need to establish who

164
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.710 
is responsible for what. no overlaps and no gaps is ambitious for university,

165
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.110 
but a useful goal.

166
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:12.610 
for challenge three is devolved structures. and it's in a way it's

167
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.080 
similar to the second challenge. but here i'm really referring to

168
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.110 
decision making and where it sits so.

169
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.850 
you know we know that the vice chancellor set the vision and the road map.

170
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.030 
and then it's actually up to the faculty deans to decide whether

171
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.880 
or not they're going to implement this road map or not. you

172
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.440 
know they hold a lot of the power and as a result when we started

173
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.750 
online at king some faculties were waring to go and other faculties

174
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.120 
were preferring to take. let's wait and see approach and of

175
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.130 
course, it's often the ones you want most the busiest and least

176
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.290 
able to work with you and it takes a lot of persuasion to get

177
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.780 
them on board and to get online learning really scaling up.

178
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.340 
and if you do want to scale up online learning i would say

179
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.370 
i've got a couple of handy tips.

180
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.270 
basically keep very visible at the vice chancellor
and vice principal education level.

181
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.970 
and ideally make sure that online is one of the vc's strategic projects.

182
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.150 
normally showing what a great diversification of income.
online education is

183
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.840 
works in that regard. i think you then have to find your senior champion,

184
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.450 
really keep them up to date you know constantly keep them up to date

185
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.090 
regular written verbal updates. so they're really fully aware

186
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.010 
of what you're doing and can talk about it to other people.

187
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.940 
and then at faculty level we really went for a kind of multi-pronged attack

188
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.250 
because to really get this moving you need faculty on side

189
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.680 
to the dean the vice deans for education the faculty operating

190
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.610 
officers the professional services teams understanding their
individual motivations.

191
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.810 
making sure that there's something in there for everyone and

192
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.590 
that treaty is for online education whether it be revenue

193
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.060 
watching access different ways of learning and teaching etcetera.

194
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.530 
challenges training and upskilling. and here i'm primarily referring

195
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.540 
i guess to academic staff.

196
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.320 
and you know of course the most significant short term change during the pandemic

197
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.410 
was the pivot. i don't know if it was quite as widely used

198
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.390 
in other countries. but in the uk i think i use that word more

199
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.560 
than any other word at work in

200
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.670 
twenty twenty. the pivot from on- campus teaching to fully remote learning.

201
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.690 
there's a really good article called am strategic tech decisions

202
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.100 
during the pandemic it's online.
it's published by the chronicle of higher education.

203
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.380 
i really recommend reading it, if you haven't already.

204
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.330 
but they described the pandemic as a higher education's burning platform.

205
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.650 
something that literally forced academics to change the way

206
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.230 
that they'd always worked.

207
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.190 
at king's in terms of my team. we went from working on in a

208
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:01.170 
very focused way on three to four modules for a specific online program

209
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.140 
to dedicating a significant portion of our time running multiple

210
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.890 
interactive staff development sessions on basically how to

211
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.430 
teach online and you know other universities

212
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.500 
rapidly did the same thing.

213
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.610 
in the article there was a great quote that i wanted to repeat here which was

214
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.480 
basically the fact that it's not really about the technology a cia

215
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.470 
from an ivy league institution said we have the technology

216
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.350 
in place. but ninety five percent of our faculty have never

217
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.410 
really used it to teach and learn. we realize we have to start

218
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.940 
transforming the way teaching is done by spending time helping faculty.

219
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.970 
learn how to teach in a remote environment. and i think that

220
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:42.260 
the need for that kind of training will continue as more faculty members

221
00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.410 
deliver courses fully or at least partially online.

222
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.960 
i think one of the challenges here is how to retain interest

223
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.260 
in online learning. and technology once the world has gone back

224
00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.560 
to normal if it ever does

225
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.820 
cambridge where i work now is a campus and collegiate university.

226
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.100 
everything in normal circumstances is based around the in-person experience.

227
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.930 
so my professional challenge is make sure that cambridge sees online

228
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.210 
as these part of its long term future.

229
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.070 
and actually what i think is most needed in the longer term

230
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.920 
is a shift towards training and upskilling rather than doing

231
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.640 
it all for academics. so in the way we work at the moment there's

232
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.250 
a fantastic beautifully polished finished product at the end of what

233
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.980 
we do academics give us the content and we do the rest,

234
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.420 
as over every short course we create. there's a

235
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.430 
team of six ones pedaling furiously away behind the scenes

236
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.220 
to create the course. but again the way we're doing currently

237
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.810 
working for universities isn't that scalable and instead i

238
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.720 
think we just need to make it much much easier for academics.

239
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.450 
so we need to make the platform's great for academics to just plug things in

240
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:53.130 
directly that i read that includes either new learning management

241
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.080 
systems or reconfiguring the ones we have already building

242
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.500 
design systems and components

243
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.650 
investing in new x teams to make the learning experience great

244
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.300 
for both students and staff. and then i think the instructional

245
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.050 
design role needs at least in part to be focused

246
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.770 
on training and upskilling.
and it will reach a wider academic audience that way.

247
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.540 
and i also think the academics would benefit from you know

248
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.920 
seeing more how learning technologies work in practice and understanding real advantages.

249
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.210 
we've just integrated miró into canvas for our road mapping

250
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.560 
course and having that best in class tool for collaboration

251
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:34.180 
helps to get academics excited about doing this work. too often

252
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.730 
universities i think tend to revert to what's in the microsoft tool box.

253
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.540 
and lastly i think in a way this is the most complex challenge even though

254
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.940 
it's easy to put together in some ways is that the governance framework.

255
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.470 
the best known definition of a digital governance framework

256
00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.560 
is by lisa welchman in an article called managing chaos,
digital governance by design

257
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:06.250 
and she describes digital governance as a framework for establishing accountability roles

258
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.170 
and decision-making authority for an organization's digital presence.

259
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.860 
and of course the university's digital presence can mean any

260
00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.240 
number of things from the website through to social media and

261
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.370 
digital education and research products.

262
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.010 
and she goes on to say that means a digital governance framework

263
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.930 
does not specify a production process, its not articulating a content strategy

264
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.430 
information architecture or whether or not you work in an agile or waterfall

265
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:38.280 
development environment what a digital governance framework does is specify

266
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.130 
who has the authority to make these decisions.

267
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.520 
so this sounds simple ish,

268
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.390 
but when you put it alongside other digital education challenges such as

269
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.660 
you know silo'd teams devolved structures the framework actually,

270
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.020 
becomes really hard to create who is responsible for this area

271
00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.790 
of work it education, the vc faculties, and when you're unsure

272
00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:04.110 
who is responsible or accountable and you don't necessarily

273
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.540 
have a digital first approach across the organization.

274
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.220 
this can mean a lack of cohesion at both the strategic and operational

275
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.850 
level without a clear process for decision making.

276
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:20.250 
i would say however that i think fortunately universities are working on this

277
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.900 
a friend of mine works as a leader

278
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.040 
in the digital space at a different global university in london.

279
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.790 
says that their new approach to digital governance is keep

280
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.340 
it simple, ensure space and support from top make a governance

281
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.360 
on digital with a small group of heads of departments and senior

282
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.180 
digital experts that will make the most impact and report directly into the principal.

283
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.910 
with that's one way of trying to address the challenges. but

284
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.610 
i do think it's important that universities find their own

285
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.880 
ways of addressing this. because it is a good digital framework that sets out

286
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.490 
roles responsibilities and accountability could help start

287
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.640 
to address many of the challenges we're facing now.

288
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.480 
so just to summarize my five key points. i think digital is

289
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.980 
faster than the rest of the organization understand this and

290
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.170 
find ways to help the university keep pace.

291
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.500 
aim for no overlaps and no gaps across various digital teams.

292
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.760 
take a multi-pronged attack for scaling online education. it

293
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.680 
needs to be on everyone's radar at all levels of the organization

294
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.640 
make digital design and development simple and high quality

295
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.220 
for academics to want to engage with and work towards clarity on accountability.

296
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.730 
thank you very much.

297
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.100 
thank you. thank you very much Anna in the end.

298
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:44.060 
I mean I in introducing your talk other than imagine. it was

299
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.910 
would be so perfectly feeding the questions that i was raising

300
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.940 
at the beginning. i mean

301
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.530 
it would have been very interesting to see your presentation.

302
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:58.700 
you know in the plenary session and then the question becomes of course,

303
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.950 
if this is the reality and i must say that my account from

304
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:07.980 
what i have seen there only my university naples' spread across the country looks

305
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:12.530 
much more like the one you just did from inside or from

306
00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:17.190 
within then the question is. are we looking at two different words or simply?

307
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.530 
i mean of course there are universities especially probably

308
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:27.870 
in the united states where the management is flocking to the MOOC

309
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:34.090 
bonanza or i mean is it just simply that if you look at the

310
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.580 
overall picture with all this big numbers

311
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.650 
clearly. there are some were

312
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.790 
participating in the increase and the trend is there. but still

313
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.910 
it would be interesting to understand if this is

314
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.830 
what you are describing how long is it going to

315
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.430 
take to really change or is the change coming from. maybe the

316
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:59.810 
students is coming from another perspective.

317
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.390 
i mean maybe we know the feedback and then move to the second.

318
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.510 
i'd love to see your  reaction to this point.

319
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.950 
you can speak if you want to.

320
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.550 
just want to lose the momentum because it's very interesting,

321
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.320 
yeah i mean i think it is partly driven by students. because you know

322
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.590 
we can see now that there is

323
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.590 
a real audience for online education people you know

324
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.590 
they want to work they want to study online and it isn't just

325
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.420 
a necessity of not being able to spend a year on campus. they

326
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.140 
actually prefer online as a learning environment. so i think

327
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.650 
it is partly the students driving the change of course a matter

328
00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.490 
of marked change. a desire to change has come from the pandemic itself

329
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.990 
and seeing the opportunities. but probably also

330
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.640 
starting to realize that digital isn't really anything to be afraid of.

331
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.100 
but universities were moving

332
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:04.120 
in this trajectory on this trajectory already. some much more

333
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.090 
quickly than others i think now. we're just going to see all universities

334
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.090 
moving more quickly in this space.

335
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.800 
thank you very much. so i would ask at this point

336
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:24.010 
leah Lommel to take the floor and and i did already introduce her to you.

337
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:29.570 
she is vice president president of eight plus and chief operating officer of

338
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.240 
added on a state university which has been at the forefront of online education

339
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.470 
for several years. now thank you leah.

340
00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:44.440 
thank you morrow i appreciate the opportunity to be here.

341
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.640 
I am from arizona state university and i treated you with a thorough

342
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.360 
cactus in the background on a beautiful sunset.

343
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.540 
in case any of you are missing the wild west of where we are.

344
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.830 
so we have been in online education for just a little bit

345
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.630 
here at arizona state university. i am leah Lommel associate

346
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.060 
vice president and chief operating officer in a department

347
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.790 
called ed plus who runs all of our full online degrees. and

348
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.660 
i have actually been working with our ace online degrees since

349
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:22.370 
our inception twelve years ago. so we started this because we

350
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:26.080 
have a very clear mission at arizona state university

351
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.210 
that we are measured by whom we include not exclude and how they

352
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.300 
succeed and that we are overall responsible for the health

353
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:41.070 
of the communities that we serve. so if any of you have seen

354
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.910 
any presentations from arizona state university we live

355
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.860 
in breathed by this charter. and i think when you're talking

356
00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.700 
about governance in general the university needs to start at a high level

357
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:56.170 
in terms of how you're going to support digital education. and

358
00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.700 
if you can't see digital education as a part of your charter and your mission,

359
00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.940 
then it's just an add on and it will never be something that

360
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.270 
could be offered to true quality and scale which was a goal

361
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:10.050 
of arizona state university. and that's why they created this

362
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.870 
department that i'm working in right now called EdPlus. we

363
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.160 
are central enterprise unit meaning we work across the entire

364
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.130 
university. we are not running anything digital in a silo for

365
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.720 
this university. we work with every single department and faculty.

366
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.710 
and we're responsible for the design and scalability of digital

367
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.990 
teaching and learning models

368
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.900 
that reaches many different students helping reduce barriers

369
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.000 
that aren't just academic barriers, but also student success

370
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.220 
barriers as a whole. so within this department,

371
00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:47.390 
we to ana's point the faculty training is crucial and key to

372
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:52.720 
the first part of overcoming resistance to online education making sure

373
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.630 
that we have a support group around them and are training them,

374
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.480 
making sure that we have clear learning objectives that our

375
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.590 
online education is as good or equal to,

376
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.160 
sorry as good or better than which of course. a traditional

377
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.280 
campus don't like to hear that, but there are just so many tools

378
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.930 
and ability to deliver education at a different level when

379
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:21.110 
you can move to things online and digital. and then we just

380
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.350 
really again the communities we serve that part of our mission.

381
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:29.220 
we believe in helping other higher ed institutions also in

382
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:34.660 
digital and online education partly, because there's a big problem

383
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.590 
in terms of how we reach new populations and making sure that

384
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:42.300 
we build these partnerships. and that problem is the demand

385
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.410 
for higher education is going to grow significantly over the

386
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.570 
coming will now a few more years. my guess is we're getting

387
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:53.460 
closer to half a billion. but there's just a huge hunger for

388
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.990 
more higher education. and there's a lot of place bound students

389
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.080 
in a lot of different countries.

390
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.530 
obviously in some countries, it's easy for people to get to

391
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.260 
a university or something, but place and time bound is another

392
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.380 
way to look at it. some students just don't have a way to get there.

393
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.590 
and obviously covid highlighted that we have to find ways to

394
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.980 
deliver education that isn't a physical brick and mortar building.

395
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.740 
because to be able to meet a demand like this with brick-and-mortar

396
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.810 
universities, we would have to build four universities that

397
00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:30.880 
serve eighty thousand students which is the size of our traditional

398
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.360 
campus at arizona state. we'd have to build four of those every

399
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.630 
week every year for fifteen years. and i'm pretty sure this

400
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:39.310 
pandemic has spread faster than we could put those buildings

401
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.950 
up to be able to meet that demand. so there's a certain amount

402
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.060 
of reach and then of course a certain amount of demand from students.

403
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.590 
so a couple of beliefs that are fun that i like to go in here

404
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:56.510 
speed and scale are allies. we have to make education effective and affordable.

405
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.010 
by speed and scale we mean if you sit around and talk about

406
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:04.210 
this for ten plus years. you're not going to start to reach

407
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.050 
the learners and help them advance where they need to be.

408
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:13.260 
so we went around to start off we begged we literally begged

409
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.300 
faculty and academic departments to help put their programs

410
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.410 
online. and it was the land of the willing when we started twelve years ago.

411
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.990 
so we went live with about six programs and now today. we're

412
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:30.190 
currently managing over two hundred and fifty full- one hundred

413
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:35.130 
percent online degree programs at asu by using a model of

414
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.940 
a mission. and a charter at this university that's important

415
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.430 
and we built it the students came. and now

416
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.380 
not only are rebuilding a lot of programs, but we're also ranked

417
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.780 
in the top ten by US world news report in terms of online education

418
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.290 
in this ranking is a big deal, because we're actually larger

419
00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.710 
than the other top nine schools combined. so rankings often

420
00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.290 
don't take into account the scale at which you're operating

421
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.870 
on. so to be able to maintain this level of a ranking with the

422
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:10.970 
amount of students we have which this year we reached eighty zero hundred learners

423
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.790 
that are in our one hundred percent online degree programs.

424
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.860 
so we do serve a growing international population. so obviously

425
00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.310 
students from many different countries are seeking an online

426
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.290 
education again. place time bound is often a concern and they're

427
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.790 
looking for quality education. and so we're lucky that we're

428
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:37.070 
able to serve those and help other higher education institutions become online institutions.

429
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.120 
this is just a little something you guys know how people are

430
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.990 
very strict about when you can publish fiscal year numbers

431
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.900 
which i'm like right on the cusp of when i can announce that eighty thousand.

432
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.390 
so but aren't just an idea of the scale the last few years

433
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.860 
for us and we've just tripled in six years and we expect to

434
00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:00.290 
continue to grow by fifteen to twenty five percent over the coming five years.

435
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:04.210 
so the demand is definitely there, but it also starts with that

436
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.410 
belief that anyone with the desire to learn should be able

437
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.030 
to pursue a college degree.

438
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:13.330 
here in the US we have people in rural areas. so for example

439
00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:18.650 
just in the state of arizona we have many small towns that

440
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:23.190 
are a minimum of an hour to three hours away from anyone of

441
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.950 
any one of the university campuses. so they don't have an option

442
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:32.260 
of higher education unless it kind of comes to them in a digital space.

443
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:36.590 
and we don't want to continue to make it impossible.

444
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.530 
but we also wanted to make sure that we delivered something

445
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:44.610 
with quality. so i think if people are to anna's point if part

446
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.980 
of getting people to buy into it is. they have to start to understand

447
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.580 
how online education works. i am still amazed to this day how

448
00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.590 
many people i meet with who have had zero experience with an

449
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:59.840 
online course and how robust it is. and how we have these

450
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.090 
amazing virtual labs you you build this student community and you have

451
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:09.620 
quality videos that require lots of discussion and really good engagement

452
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.670 
with peer critique across people a lot of people say. oh there's

453
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:18.320 
no way you can deliver stem programs in an online environment

454
00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.830 
and we have just really advanced the technologies in the ability

455
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.390 
to where we now ship. this is an example i'm not going to share

456
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:30.770 
this video with you just for sake of time, but we ship students'

457
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:35.550 
lab kits at home they video themselves taking the labs sometimes

458
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.520 
in groups or what not so imagine versus students being crowded

459
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.360 
all around one. this is the perch fish, because i can't handle

460
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.310 
some of the other animals that they have where they do the dissection part

461
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:51.370 
and just imagine that the student now has the entire animal

462
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.760 
at their own disposal versus crowding around a single one and

463
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.750 
they have step by step guides of the videos where they can

464
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:03.080 
kind of follow along with the dissection and really understand

465
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.990 
what they're learning for those labs.

466
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:10.290 
so with that it's like bringing the technology to the student.

467
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.410 
but also making sure that you're developing relationships. and

468
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:17.390 
this is one of our great faculty members betsy schneider who

469
00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.190 
talks about building relationships with students. and making

470
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:23.590 
sure that they're engaging in a critical exchange, because even

471
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.930 
though all of our classes are considered asynchronous meaning

472
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.650 
the student logs on. there's a lot of discussion board and engagement

473
00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:34.450 
across students to really be able to dive in. she happens to

474
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.490 
be one of our faculty in our photography program which digital

475
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:46.430 
photography is a very popular program not as popular as psychology and biology however.

476
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.690 
so then you have those academic components and you're saying.

477
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.370 
ok well we know we can put this stuff online. but then we also say

478
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.760 
well ok them taking the course is one aspect of it, and how

479
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.340 
you support them with that, but another aspect especially in

480
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.310 
the us is how you support them holistically. so we also built

481
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:09.180 
a custom digital platform that helps the student be more holistically successful.

482
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.810 
so in the us paying for your education is a really big problem.

483
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.630 
and so again the governance of how much are you going to charge

484
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:19.670 
for your online education programs are students going to be

485
00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.370 
able to afford it. and how are you going to be able to deliver

486
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.030 
this and not completely

487
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.270 
be broke at an university, right? i don't think any of us are

488
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.500 
floating in money as higher education. it's we're not in it for the money.

489
00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:37.130 
but we also have to be able to deliver something that is of

490
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.430 
quality to these students. and so these technologies help us

491
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.300 
with scale in a new way and so by building these platforms.

492
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.110 
we're able to surround the student in a lot of great ways. but

493
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:52.440 
we're also able to extract really great data. so we have this

494
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.090 
team inside of a place called action lab. and their number one

495
00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:01.340 
job is to make sure we have strong learning efficacy inside of our programs

496
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:06.060 
and we just make sure that everyone is working together. because to ana's point,

497
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:10.340 
if you build these groups in a silo like if we were to build

498
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.110 
an instructional design team inside of ed plus and said go

499
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.760 
build these courses, then tell faculty go teach these courses.

500
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.610 
it absolutely would not work, so we work we assign instructional

501
00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.400 
designers directly to faculty they build relationships and

502
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.900 
we help the colleges as a whole. that's what we call our individual schools

503
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:35.950 
here.
we help them become comfortable with the quality that they're producing online.

504
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.320 
and we also have teams like success coaches that focus on just

505
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.620 
the personal issues of students. and why they may not get through

506
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.670 
school not just finances.
well so maybe a lack of support at home higher education.

507
00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.550 
i'm sure you guys know isn't always regarded as something that

508
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.570 
everyone does so we have a lot of first generations students

509
00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:58.510 
who may not be getting support from their families. and so we

510
00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.770 
want to make sure we're supporting them in other ways.

511
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.870 
so i've talked a little bit about surrounding with technologies

512
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.390 
and then the success coaches. the whole point is that you build

513
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:12.490 
the technologies to be able to be proactive and outreach. but

514
00:34:12.490 --> 00:34:17.580 
you never take away the human interaction. so the idea is that

515
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.820 
we're able to identify when students might be having issues

516
00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:26.910 
and be proactive in their outreach. so one example is we monitor

517
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:29.790 
when students log in, and if they don't log in over so many

518
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.870 
days we actually start an outreach program to make sure. they're

519
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.560 
getting engaged in their programs.

520
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.890 
and so you just have to for us we have to holistic look at

521
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.960 
the student and make sure we can support them.

522
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.190 
this is just an example of all the different flows by which

523
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.610 
we go through and the data that we're pulling and building

524
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.260 
these massive systems and able to have these outreach including text,

525
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:57.780 
emails. we do voice mail drops. so this outreach is a big deal again is

526
00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.050 
we want the students be successful in the course. we want the

527
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:04.080 
course to be of high quality and we want the student to

528
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.760 
keep going towards ultimate success which is a degree.

529
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.630 
because that degree is the

530
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.920 
catalyst of them to advance their life their families and their careers. so

531
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.860 
i've talked a little bit about what we've done for you online.

532
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.650 
and what we've done for our programs, but we also because we're

533
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.150 
a digital teaching learning department. we've worked a lot with

534
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:32.480 
different corporations foundations across the world.

535
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.830 
and built different systems that help students. become successful

536
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:41.540 
in college or help people build programs for college students.

537
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.020 
so one program is we built this young thinkers program,

538
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:49.770 
and this one with this algorithm foundation. they're based in dubai

539
00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.480 
obviously building the mena region is a challenge, because they

540
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.760 
don't believe in online education well. now they would.

541
00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.830 
because of covid just based on different countries their acceptance

542
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:06.250 
of online education and while this wasn't particularly online

543
00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.340 
programs. it was purely to help people get ready for college.

544
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:14.620 
at the time we took this on the nri youth were only eighty

545
00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.300 
percent, or i'm sorry only twenty percent were actually fully

546
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.960 
eligible to be successful in university when they went they

547
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.330 
just didn't have the concept of career readiness or college

548
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.430 
readiness. so we helped build out this system which now forty

549
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.290 
thousand people across twenty different mena countries are leveraging.

550
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.080 
we've also built another platform for the mastercard foundation,

551
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.720 
who runs a massive scholarship program in sub-saharan africa

552
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.410 
to serve about right now. we serve about one hundred thousand young

553
00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:50.180 
african leaders, and so these are people who have attended college

554
00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:54.620 
or some kind of higher education with the mastercard foundation

555
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.620 
anywhere in the world. and we help them stay engaged for life,

556
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.590 
because i think one thing we forget that online digital education

557
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.130 
isn't just about serving them up to a degree.
it's also a way

558
00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:08.690 
to keep alumni connected and conveyed and continuing to advance

559
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:13.100 
people for lifelong learning. so that's an example of that, and then

560
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.560 
when we talk about governance. this one i want to bring up, because

561
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.180 
i think what we're forgetting is there's actually the government

562
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:23.940 
governance as well. and when we launched this scholars program

563
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.920 
which was a scholarship offered again by al Ghurair foundation for education.

564
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.320 
and we have about five hundred students who have enrolled at

565
00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:37.990 
asu on behalf of this across these arab countries. what we realized

566
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:41.450 
is that many of these countries the government themselves would

567
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:45.500 
not recognize an online degree most corporations accept an

568
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:51.220 
online degree.
but the governments would not now assume because of our tradition

569
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:56.220 
high quality programs and stuff.
we don't distinguish online from regular

570
00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.840 
in our transcripts in our diplomas.
but it definitely what we

571
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.910 
started doing is advocating. and so we spent some time in dubai

572
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.710 
with a group called the knowledge human development and we

573
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:12.370 
helped write a manual for them of how to perceive online education

574
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:16.670 
of quality. so that the government would recognize that degree. and

575
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.160 
you know areas like lebanon and jordan are a little bit more

576
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.750 
advanced and they will. but this is something where now with

577
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.860 
covid. it's like well if people don't have another option,

578
00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.100 
how do you ensure online is good because part of the issue

579
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.390 
is there's been a lot of bad players in the online space giving

580
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.890 
it a bad name. but it doesn't mean that all online education

581
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:40.570 
is bad. and how do we help educate people to to understand that.

582
00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:46.070 
so again we have big aspirations here we are doing a lot of

583
00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:49.640 
big things. but we also love working with colleagues around

584
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.960 
the globe and in the US. and i'm really

585
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.520 
look forward to discussing this further with you guys later on.

586
00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.550 
thank you thank you very much. and it is really

587
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:10.280 
amazing. how these two presentations in a way

588
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.540 
are the fare with respect to the

589
00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.590 
both men you know the kind of experience.

590
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:20.160 
and the kind of

591
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:25.080 
it. both are very different from the MOOCs as we you know i

592
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.040 
have been listening to MOOC environment and everything. but they reflect

593
00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.100 
experiences and of course in my view the one that anna presented us

594
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:40.490 
is as quite to say widespread all over at least europe.

595
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.530 
then the question for you would be and then i just

596
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.880 
can't resist raising the question.

597
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:52.270 
how would you explain the fact that this landmark experience

598
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:58.670 
by added honesty which of course owes probably a lot also to the inspiring rdc

599
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.890 
leadership will michael kroll i mean there is always

600
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.430 
something like that, behind them in such a

601
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:11.230 
such a important experience. but how do you explain the fact

602
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.490 
that it didn't set i would not say a standard a benchmark. but

603
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:19.640 
i mean if we look at our universities we may expect to find

604
00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.120 
i would not say one thousand not one hundred, but maybe at those

605
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.250 
in which would have fallen into this pattern,

606
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:31.940 
what are the reasons why this is not happening yet. i mean you

607
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.990 
know those in this online i would say environment have been

608
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:40.390 
following. it's own state for years and looking around to see

609
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:43.130 
are you setting a pattern and

610
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.350 
doesn't look so. what's your explanation for that. i imagine

611
00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:50.900 
you've been wondering so many times. i mean ok you say i'm we

612
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.230 
try to do our business in the best way. but then of course you

613
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:59.890 
look at the world and you wonder is there more universities trying to

614
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:04.540 
come along trying to look at you using you as a parent. oh just

615
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.320 
every university works

616
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.470 
their own death.

617
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.350 
well obviously there's a certain amount of competition amongst

618
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:18.310 
higher ed universities in terms of recruiting students. and

619
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.950 
yes our leadership under president crow is

620
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.960 
unrelenting we have a

621
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:30.440 
desire to achieve something that i have never met another higher

622
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.120 
education leader with that same desire. and we've been at it

623
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.390 
for twelve years right a lot of presidents in universities

624
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.550 
aren't around for fifteen years like president crow has been. so

625
00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:44.750 
there's a certain amount of momentum we have built. i would

626
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.880 
say there's a lot of higher ed institutions since we've started

627
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.140 
that are in the online space and are doing a good job. they may not

628
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.620 
desire to be quite as big as where arizona state university

629
00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:00.210 
is the number of programs we have. but we've been very proud

630
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:03.340 
of what we've seen stood up university of memphis in tennessee

631
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.310 
actually has a pretty robust set of online educations michigan

632
00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:10.440 
is doing a lot of great work. so almost every state right now

633
00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:14.640 
actually has a school who is leading the way in the online space.

634
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:19.440 
it's hard to say you know should everyone be compared against arizona state and

635
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.160 
i think every institution has its own mission and what they're trying to achieve.

636
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.260 
but i do think that you have to get more regional with who's

637
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.270 
offering online education, because arizona state can't achieve it all.

638
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.380 
so many people aren't familiar with what we're doing they want

639
00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:40.260 
a flagship school in their state offering quality online education. but

640
00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:43.190 
we've been very impressed with where a lot of schools have

641
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:46.510 
come along and we've helped a lot of schools build. we offer

642
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.580 
instructional design training. we offer training to faculty

643
00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:52.250 
we've actually been working with american university beirut

644
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.450 
in training their faculty. so change is slow. but some of this

645
00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:00.930 
is like a generational thing. there's not a pattern that can be seen yet.

646
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:04.470 
but i think in the next generation we will see it right, change

647
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:08.780 
takes a long time and now people covid kind of forced it.

648
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.130 
I think it's going to start to move much more rapidly.

649
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.650 
thank you very much thank you also for your optimism which

650
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:19.370 
is also empirically based to some extent. so the trend is there

651
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.720 
and it's also interesting to see that you see some kind of

652
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.570 
regional basis i mean like

653
00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:30.680 
each state in a way has its own local approach i mean to do

654
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:32.850 
online learning. that's also very interesting.

655
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:39.130 
and we may now move to Martin and Martin Wirsing.

656
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:45.400 
i am very, do i see martin anywhere yeah oh. but that's

657
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:50.120 
okay martin you have the floor okay thank you. just

658
00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.380 
share my screen on second.

659
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.380 
thing so okay,

660
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.840 
well not yet.

661
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:19.650 
okay so welcome everybody nice to see you here unfortunately on a virtually.

662
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.190 
i would have preferred being presence in Potsdam.

663
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:32.260 
but as this is not possible. i will tell you from our governance issues

664
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:36.620 
here at my university of munich. what we tried to do

665
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:41.980 
in the last or some issues of that what we tried to do

666
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.990 
in the last ten years somehow.

667
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.460 
so everybody has experienced the same thing.

668
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.990 
the covid pandemic came and gave us a

669
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.550 
really really big push to digital learning education.

670
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:04.180 
at LMU we had maybe fifteen percent of online education.

671
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:10.960 
and we had to move to full digital education last year as everybody.

672
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.340 
and i was surprised that this

673
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:19.130 
worked rather well, if i

674
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.680 
talk with the students and look also at some studies about that,

675
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:30.620 
then many students struggle with this online education in germany

676
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.470 
for different kind of reasons we might take later about that.

677
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:38.400 
but that's not a governance issue. it's a student issue,

678
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:44.470 
but somewhere many students learn better at home than in the university.

679
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:50.060 
a big issue was that students miss social interaction and the

680
00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:55.340 
extra curricular aspects of studies well going to sports, dancing, whatever

681
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.650 
on the other hand the teachers are stuff

682
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.600 
also did the transition to digital education mostly successful

683
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:10.980 
which was surprising that because before we had somehow fifteen percent of

684
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.220 
our staff who were really in digital education.

685
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:19.250 
this worked because we had media labs.

686
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.070 
we have experience colleagues who helped

687
00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.380 
and team teaching. and

688
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.280 
what the problem was of course digital education needs appropriate

689
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.580 
pedagogy and course development.

690
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.950 
so when i'm looking at this from the governance point of view now.

691
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:43.330 
just for teaching and learning and in particular digital teaching and learning,

692
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:48.470 
then a main issue is the strategic management.

693
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.500 
well this is a challenge still because for digital teaching

694
00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.970 
and learning we need a participatory

695
00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:05.900 
management. so it's not what we already anna said and

696
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:09.430 
it's not only the university executive board

697
00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.360 
who decides we need to put together the teaching staff the admin staff,

698
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.770 
those people who do the media development,

699
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:25.460 
and also the students. and have to find the decisions here.

700
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:30.090 
if you look at what i said student experience,

701
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.750 
for this education we need comprehensive student services

702
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:41.470 
which is a challenge student counseling mentoring student,
interaction student health etcetera,

703
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:47.840 
and we need also quality assurance and in our university in particular.

704
00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:53.160 
we cannot do anything in teaching without research,
so we need accompanying research

705
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.020 
also this is difficult to achieve.

706
00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:01.210 
but i would like to talk a-plus sorry. i would like to talk

707
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:07.050 
here in this discussion about one particular aspect and Anna talked about it.

708
00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:11.320 
already this is agile teaching and learning.

709
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:19.450 
so how do we bring digital education into a staff

710
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.980 
of people who are not always

711
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.210 
very keen to do digital teaching.

712
00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:34.910 
i'm fort well i'm a computer scientist, so sorry give me

713
00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:38.880 
two slides for talking about the agile approach

714
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:43.490 
in the area of software development where it started

715
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:52.200 
to race. so indeed in the last century so until two thousand, or so.

716
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:58.000 
there was a high rate of failing IT projects software development projects,

717
00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:03.410 
failing rate was more than thirty percent we can go into more detail.

718
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:06.880 
but something we would not expect.

719
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:12.130 
this led to the manifesto for our china software development

720
00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.510 
in two thousand one where

721
00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:22.500 
a group of people came together in two thousand one

722
00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.150 
and wrote this manifesto and they said well we have to

723
00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:31.330 
to development governments in that sense while when we wanted to advance.

724
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:38.070 
we need to well value individuals and interactions have a processor and tool's

725
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:42.020 
working software have a conference's documentation.

726
00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.960 
that's maybe not so interesting for us here

727
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:48.360 
customer collaboration over contract negotiation as

728
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:54.900 
responding to change over following a plan,

729
00:49:54.980 --> 00:50:00.190 
with this starting point in fact started in all in the nineties

730
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:04.970 
and this way of doing software development. we are now

731
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:07.610 
in twenty twenty

732
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:12.390 
at the point that more than seventy percent of software companies

733
00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.670 
use agile development methods.

734
00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:17.760 
and the failure rate

735
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:24.040 
for it project has fallen to about eight percent.

736
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:29.070 
so if you have a classical project the failure is still more than twenty percent,

737
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:32.400 
but not for this rj projects

738
00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:38.760 
and one word to the way how it is done.
they're development methods called scram

739
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.140 
kanban and safe.

740
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:47.600 
and the most popular one is the scram method.

741
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.210 
it works the following way.

742
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:57.140 
the idea is to iterate development and to make small iterations

743
00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:03.070 
time box turn always planning,
then the development phase called

744
00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:06.080 
sprint and then the review, and then a review where you

745
00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.980 
think about what was going well how at which point rb and then

746
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.770 
you make the next interaction.

747
00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:19.660 
on the right inside you see how this works even there's a lot

748
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.310 
of communication in these

749
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.120 
development cycles in particular

750
00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.850 
in software development every twenty four hours people meet very shortly meet

751
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:32.500 
to tell other people what

752
00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:37.080 
they have done and discussed this.

753
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:42.100 
the interesting thing is you have three kinds three roles, the

754
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.430 
product owner the scram master the development product owner

755
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:49.820 
is the one who says what one has to do if he somehow gives the requirements.

756
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:54.550 
the scrum master is the one who knows is the expert who knows

757
00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:58.350 
how things have to be done in this development, and then the

758
00:51:58.350 --> 00:51:59.720 
people who do the development.

759
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:03.940 
and the values are transparency

760
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.500 
regular inspection and reviews and almost adaptation. if after

761
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.510 
these four weeks things have changed, the requirements have

762
00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:14.500 
changed infrastructure stranger.

763
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:19.490 
so you can correct, so this is the most successful software development.

764
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:22.990 
in teaching and learning

765
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:28.420 
interestingly when i looked at that in the last years, well,

766
00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.330 
we saw that in then

767
00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.190 
well shortly after that

768
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:41.360 
the same ideas came to education. there was an agile manifesto in

769
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:44.520 
education in two thousand and nine, another one

770
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.990 
in two thousand and twelve. and

771
00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:52.770 
the one i just show you is the larger manifesto for teaching and learning

772
00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:54.600 
in two thousand seventeen.

773
00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:02.230 
the idea is there also adaptability over prescriptive teaching methods collaboration over

774
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:06.020 
individual accomplishment, achievement of learning outcomes

775
00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:07.730 
everybody would think of that.

776
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:12.110 
a very important point which is not always easy with online

777
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:18.440 
teaching digital education is student driven inquiry.

778
00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:24.560 
over classroom lectures and demonstration application over accumulation of information.

779
00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:29.560 
and finally again continuous improvement over

780
00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.500 
maintenance of current practices.

781
00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:38.950 
so this for the general thing i just want to give you an example

782
00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.600 
what we did and LMU in order to promote this.

783
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:49.700 
so in two thousand and twelve we started a

784
00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:54.790 
a method a project the so called multiplier method

785
00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:59.670 
where we want to inspire for teaching and teach competently and

786
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:02.070 
bring this in all faculties.

787
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.830 
the aim was to combine combine excellent innovative teaching

788
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:11.070 
with appreciation and values, other think about values also.

789
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:16.830 
and impart knowledge action skills and values to our teaching stuff.

790
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:21.990 
the main ideas were that you have

791
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:28.090 
concerning government's topic selection at the faculty level not at the

792
00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.020 
well not at the vc level at the vice president level.

793
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:39.720 
and because this comes from the faculty level we try to reach into the faculties

794
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:41.640 
through so called multiplier effect.

795
00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:48.830 
we support as in this software development ideas are

796
00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:55.830 
the development by individual and situation specific

797
00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:01.330 
in an evil institution pacific way by coaches experts,

798
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:05.590 
media experts, pedagogues pedagogy experts.

799
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:10.330 
and of course we have a quality assurance and accompanying research.

800
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:18.360 
values are that we want autonomy foster the autonomy of the students.

801
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:24.280 
the social integration and interaction of the students and the own competence

802
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:30.700 
of the students. so how was this method we iterate

803
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:37.010 
in well in two parts in semester parts we always

804
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:40.720 
work in semester parts in two parts planning and development

805
00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:44.270 
with workshops where we

806
00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:48.210 
discuss good teaching, leading, and inspiring.

807
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:55.580 
and also exchange between different faculties so in this project all faculties were

808
00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:01.210 
represented and met regularly.

809
00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.260 
the similar to what in software development is done.

810
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:12.560 
we have for all we have not one product owner the product owner is

811
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.010 
a tandem of professor and teaching assistant,

812
00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:20.740 
then we have experts a coach and e-learning expert, other experts

813
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.350 
and the project team which does the development.

814
00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:28.230 
and what were the results we had

815
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.120 
over one hundred and fifty such projects

816
00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:37.990 
about sixty of them were pure online

817
00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:46.640 
projects involving staff of all our faculties and excellent evaluation results.

818
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:53.720 
so just summing up what i propose for governance that is a

819
00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:57.410 
challenge one can discuss this later. it's an agile approach

820
00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:00.490 
to pedagogy and online learning.

821
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.300 
and other issues i have not really talked serious.

822
00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:12.810 
but which are very important is strategic management in a participatory way

823
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:18.090 
comprehensive student services and student interaction.

824
00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:23.680 
and of course quality assurance and research, thank you.

825
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.880 
thank you martin very much.

826
00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:35.000 
and again we get some very

827
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.250 
sparing considerations about

828
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:45.410 
what could be a path to i would say a compromise path by the

829
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:47.900 
path which would take into consideration both

830
00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:53.570 
the opportunities. and the i'll say the resistance now they

831
00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:57.580 
always talk about the resilience that was much more resistance,

832
00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.510 
than resilience in many cases. but this is a good example

833
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:05.790 
about how a woman can manage to

834
00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:11.320 
take the opportunity, if we may say this expression of the pandemic

835
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:17.340 
to move several step forwards towards this i jail learning

836
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.240 
model which in a way seems to be

837
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:24.500 
the model which is going to be very much

838
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:30.330 
more successful. because it takes into consideration

839
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.100 
so many of the

840
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:39.900 
you see difficulties that we do face in everyday

841
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:45.530 
university life. at this point i would like to see,

842
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.510 
if we have questions from the floor.

843
00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:54.290 
i mean especially and in the first place for anna was going to

844
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.210 
leave us have four children in a thick fifteen minutes and so

845
00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:04.530 
let's simply see if there are questions or also questions of course

846
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:11.110 
from the panel. and i am looking at the chat window. and

847
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:15.340 
let's see if there is anyone is going to break

848
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:19.060 
the ice. i consider is carlos out there, carlos,

849
00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:24.860 
if that's your life presence why don't you make oh so your voice hurt

850
00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:30.350 
with love to. hello hello hello good. so why don't you step into the

851
00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:34.350 
panel i mean we like very much to hear your considerations

852
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:36.440 
great here you are. so

853
00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:41.840 
close as one of the storico organizers of this MOOC

854
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:47.110 
conference's, and so let us tell you ah i mean tell us

855
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:54.310 
what i don't know i thank you the three of you for these great presentations.

856
00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:59.940 
i think we have seen different approaches, no i

857
00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.790 
think as you is very much driven top-down.

858
01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:12.740 
maybe i'm wrong. but i think micro really putting the structures

859
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.380 
and the means to to achieve a great

860
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:25.050 
movement in the university, what's martin proposes

861
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:32.380 
is still top-down, but then also bottom-up. no i think i would say that in

862
01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.970 
to have not rigid structures but to have be very agile, and

863
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:42.010 
this had to what is more water flow model, if you if we compared to

864
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:47.280 
software development in everyone is the opposite agenda no?

865
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:52.240 
i don't know whether the two of you can compare the two approaches or whether

866
01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:58.500 
there's some something to learn from these two competing ideas.

867
01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:04.830 
and i step in a little bit i think what they what they do it

868
01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:11.070 
is you is really spectacular. i mean we cannot achieve this in our university.

869
01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:17.230 
we have relatively few MOOCs, and from MOOCs we try to cooperate with other

870
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:20.190 
with other universities of bavaria.

871
01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:22.580 
now in this virtually

872
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.830 
individual university bavaria,

873
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:34.420 
but what is difficult for us is to have also we have very top down structures

874
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:38.540 
to persuade our teaching staff

875
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:45.280 
to go into this digital education. the point is we have in germany

876
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:50.390 
the freedom of teaching so we cannot really tell our

877
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:55.830 
staff or teachers. you have to make an online course.

878
01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:02.900 
we have to persuade snow the idea was to choose this bottom up

879
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.090 
idea, the faculty's have their problems with

880
01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.830 
digital education what are the problems and the faculties

881
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:19.070 
that bring them up have small teams to work on this. and

882
01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:23.010 
bring them together with the other faculties regularly also

883
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:27.510 
in the time MOOCs. they read for weeks for discussing

884
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:33.010 
in this workshop.
so that there's interaction and the multiplication somehow of the

885
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:40.990 
ideas so our problem is that we don't we cannot really force them. so

886
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:44.360 
sometimes i would have liked to do like yulia

887
01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:46.370 
and force everybody. but

888
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.700 
anna is the same situation with you i mean would you say that

889
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:56.910 
one of the main obstacles is how to convince

890
01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.170 
your faculty to do. so or

891
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:05.330 
i mean we we all admire the top of them, then

892
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:10.270 
leigh's gonna tell us, what it's also so really top down.

893
01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:11.900 
but we know that that's very important,

894
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.700 
what's your take of the situation?

895
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.990 
i think it's

896
01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.260 
really important to have, if you want to do online learning

897
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.660 
in any significant way you need the vice chancellor

898
01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:33.670 
to really drive and champion what you're doing actually.

899
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:36.980 
we made significant inroads

900
01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:40.550 
at king's. yeah i think it's probably got.

901
01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:45.390 
now i say we i'm not we any more there we at cambridge.

902
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:51.580 
i think we could now get more on online masters students in the probably

903
01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.810 
any other university in the uk apart from the open university and perhaps edinburgh.

904
01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:01.840 
but that we didn't get there, because i spent all my time doing

905
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.820 
internal business development with faculties although i did spend probably sixty

906
01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.650 
percent of my time doing internal business development faculties.

907
01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:15.900 
it was because you know the the vc at berne came from an australian university

908
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:20.120 
with a very clear mandate of what he wanted to do and achieve

909
01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.420 
and that obviously had a trickle down effect to faculties. i

910
01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.520 
don't think without that we could have made it work of course

911
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.850 
at cambridge. it's completely devolved as a university and so

912
01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.700 
we have different ways of making it work.

913
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.170 
but also the vc is enormously behind what we're doing online.

914
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:47.520 
so that's an important factor and in the game i mean really

915
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.130 
would you say that the critical factor as been the leadership

916
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:56.350 
both through i mean and also as you say the continuity of the leadership

917
01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.500 
in arizona state as this is

918
01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.910 
the timespan is very important to

919
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:09.350 
me can you hear me.

920
01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:16.040 
sorry i didn't know that was directed towards me. oh sorry yeah so first.

921
01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:21.780 
i want to address the agile versus top-down and some of those things is that.

922
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:25.990 
well there's a clear mission from present crow and we all say

923
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:29.890 
we drink the kool-aid and believing in online. we actually run

924
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:34.880 
our business in agile project management formats. so we kind

925
01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.140 
of implement programs learn from it, and they're constantly

926
01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.390 
iterating on everything that we're doing, so we are

927
01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.410 
in a weird way it comes with very strong leadership. but also

928
01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:52.250 
a lot of fluidity in going back and forth in terms of what we're doing.

929
01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:56.290 
so i just wanted to say we kind of do both.

930
01:05:57.290 --> 01:06:02.030 
and then i noticed in the chat there were a couple of questions, one

931
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:07.640 
like how are coaches like what do you look for in coaches what

932
01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:10.830 
skill sets and everything we look mostly for and some people

933
01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:15.080 
called them learning advisors strong student support

934
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:20.740 
good customer service skills. and sometimes they have bachelor's

935
01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:25.270 
degrees in psychology. we do require degrees of anyone working

936
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:29.520 
with a student because we feel like you can't promote wanting

937
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.630 
to get a degree, if you yourself don't have a degree so that

938
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:34.690 
is something that we look for.

939
01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:39.240 
and then the second question that was in the chat was on the virtual labs.

940
01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.890 
we've actually had some departments completely change their

941
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:46.750 
lab formats based on what they learned in the online environment.

942
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:50.750 
so for example we have one biology degree that's a hybrid degree

943
01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:54.640 
and students come in the summer to do like a two week intensive

944
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.440 
lab. so they took all the lecture content and then they come

945
01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.830 
do two week lab, it was so successful and how they built it

946
01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:04.950 
for the online population in that format that they switched

947
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.330 
all of their campus traditional laboratories instead of like

948
01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:12.940 
the normal one day a week or whatever that labs would be offered they flipped it.

949
01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:16.500 
so this is a very good back and forth between

950
01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.520 
what works for online what works well for campus and always

951
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.960 
trying to get to the right approach for the right learner.

952
01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.230 
thank you, thank you very much.

953
01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.810 
well i have seen these three questions also in the in the chat. maybe

954
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:35.950 
shortly what is the role and necessity of the coaches

955
01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:41.470 
for us, we have this multiplier idea. so what we did is we took our

956
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.950 
our chair for social psychology who runs our

957
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:50.940 
kind of department of leadership and people management.

958
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:58.540 
and they provided these courses for a day he and his phd students and

959
01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:05.210 
assistants provided the courses for our faculty in this tandems,

960
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:07.820 
only two people pair little project. so that

961
01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:15.470 
and then they this what they learned they brought it into the faculties

962
01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:22.270 
by providing well when in faculty meetings and and groups which they put together

963
01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.980 
to spread how it works. so we cannot relieve it.

964
01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:31.850 
we gave them also then students psychology students to help in the faculties

965
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:37.980 
in this coaching, but somehow the idea was to give the knowledge to

966
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:42.710 
the staff professors and teaching assistants in the faculty

967
01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:45.360 
few of them and then to multiply this.

968
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:50.880 
ok for the lab, just for the other questions

969
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.310 
for the lab qualifications.

970
01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.130 
this was something we

971
01:08:55.950 --> 01:09:00.210 
did that's really great i would like to have. we did it in some

972
01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:03.280 
cases in medicine that we somehow did simulation

973
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:11.060 
instead of the labs, but in chemistry and most in biology we have still

974
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:16.140 
labs where the students have to go in presence and not the simulation.

975
01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:23.410 
that's what was the last question here. third one, i was wondering whether

976
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.740 
i could take one of the

977
01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:30.190 
guys no no just i see there are five minutes is that any of

978
01:09:30.190 --> 01:09:31.930 
the questions you may be taking up.

979
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.000 
Anna, so i'm just looking at them now.

980
01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:39.590 
may i something to cambridge.

981
01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:44.770 
yeah i mean cambridge was very late to the MOOC

982
01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:50.190 
movement. no i mean for many years they said no we're not we are very

983
01:09:50.530 --> 01:09:54.490 
face to face we want the experience we don't want to have MOOCs etcetera.

984
01:09:55.030 --> 01:10:00.720 
and then probably because you mentioned that you bc it came from australia.

985
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:04.510 
there was this change i think one of the most difficult decisions

986
01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:08.380 
is to define the moment

987
01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:15.430 
on when to jump into a new technology or a new way of teaching for instance

988
01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.600 
take them on the rain mexico uses holograms,

989
01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:26.360 
as doing this now. but where where to find the right balance of wait

990
01:10:26.650 --> 01:10:29.930 
and see what happens or try to push something

991
01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.870 
very governance decision.
it's very difficult sometimes to find the right way

992
01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:39.980 
yeah i think that's right i mean at cambridge.

993
01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:48.620 
it's been a very i well my plan is to take a fairly softly approach to

994
01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:55.000 
online education because the on- campus experience is so treasured and valued

995
01:10:56.110 --> 01:11:00.770 
and every face-to-face student is a member of a college. and

996
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:06.010 
i don't think online degrees are on the cards for you know

997
01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:10.440 
a few years yet possibly never. and so what we're trying to do is find

998
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.580 
really really creative and interesting

999
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:18.020 
short courses that we can put into market instead.

1000
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:20.030 
and that's actually we've got like

1001
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:25.800 
quite quite big enthusiasm within faculties within the university have actually

1002
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:30.540 
had to do far less of the persuasion than i did at king's i guess because

1003
01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.610 
committing to a masters program is very different to committing

1004
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.640 
to a short course. but it's been quite freeing.

1005
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:43.040 
and i also think that you know what we're trying to do at cambridge

1006
01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.290 
isn't just business and tech short courses. it's drawing on the academic strength

1007
01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:51.180 
across the university which is obviously significant.

1008
01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:56.090 
so that's been quite nice as well that we've been able to do

1009
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.070 
an experiment with some different types of courses like we've

1010
01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:02.310 
got one coming out in bio nano technology. for example,

1011
01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:06.690 
and you know. i'm hoping that will for various reasons that

1012
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:10.120 
they will be you know maybe not as successful as a leadership

1013
01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:13.520 
business school program in terms of you know profitability.

1014
01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.570 
but that isn't what drives cambridge actually,

1015
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:22.040 
it's we need to make the program commercially successful,

1016
01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.700 
but it's much more about widening access which is you know very

1017
01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.070 
motivating to my team.

1018
01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:33.740 
thank you, thank you very much thank you for being with us, and then

1019
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:35.380 
if you have to leave we understand

1020
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:38.390 
apologies very much we'll be back

1021
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.120 
hopefully somewhere not

1022
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:43.820 
from here and now okay fantastic.

1023
01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:49.700 
thank you very much and there are more questions, if anyone wants to

1024
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:53.160 
pick him up from the floor you'll feel free. i mean

1025
01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:59.130 
there was a question about his participate strategic management or maybe

1026
01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.020 
you also have to leave earlier or so no.

1027
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:07.760 
i think she can stay okay yeah, but please take this strategic management

1028
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:10.840 
there is one about success.

1029
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:15.690 
this is a very difficult issue of course,

1030
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:22.710 
because in a university the university executing board in fact

1031
01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.930 
wants to have to full power

1032
01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:30.970 
that german regulations are such that at least in the

1033
01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:35.670 
extended university board we have representatives of

1034
01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:42.640 
well student and also non academic stuff.

1035
01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:52.830 
and this is always a tension between well who really drives the university.

1036
01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:57.590 
my approach during the time of being vice president was that

1037
01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.530 
we somehow formed smaller groups and in particular for digital

1038
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:11.970 
for the digital education we have our board a smaller board who has

1039
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.890 
of course less money, but can

1040
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:24.440 
well govern in a participatory way somehow under the view of the

1041
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:29.720 
of the highest board, so that we can make this small

1042
01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.570 
agile way of governing. so in this kind of board we had again.

1043
01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.150 
we had me as representative of the

1044
01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:42.700 
executive board of the university.

1045
01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:48.650 
we had professors of the different faculties not of all, but i should

1046
01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:55.730 
say a fourth of the faculties and also representatives of the students

1047
01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.640 
and also of the non-academic staff in particular of those who are

1048
01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:05.750 
working with student counselling and working with this

1049
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:10.820 
media lapse and so. this worked very well

1050
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.690 
at that level.

1051
01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:18.420 
the different attention is always there the tension between

1052
01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:22.740 
top-down and agile is always there, and when you make it when

1053
01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.100 
to make this successful is not so easy.

1054
01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:32.480 
yeah is that me or leah maybe i'm pronouncing your name wrong

1055
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:36.180 
what is that it's leah, or it's leah.

1056
01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:42.240 
so leah what about this question by valentina i can see here i mean

1057
01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.550 
how is your experience with engagement i mean i imagine. this has been a

1058
01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:53.890 
core a core challenge a main task for our development. and how

1059
01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:57.860 
do you see that i mean how important it is. because it is now

1060
01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:02.050 
becoming more and more important into the new blended

1061
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:07.010 
a format that we've been hearing a lot through through the conference.

1062
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:12.390 
yeah i mean i think it's important to understand how you build engagement at scale.

1063
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:15.250 
and i think definitely in the MOOC environments and some of

1064
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:18.760 
those other areas you see a lot of people start something and

1065
01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.360 
not finish it you know, when you're looking at one hundred thousand

1066
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:26.880 
learners, and rolling in one particular moot class and like ten complete it.

1067
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.540 
there's it means people are shopping around they aren't totally

1068
01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:33.140 
dedicated they aren't sure what they're going to get out of it, and so

1069
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:36.600 
some of it is how do you make sure people understand the full

1070
01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.900 
value of what they're going to get, if they're going to sign

1071
01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.910 
up for something. that's longer than twenty minutes, and then

1072
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:47.240 
the other part is you have to find ways to engage people that can scale.

1073
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:51.590 
so for example how to build it into chat rooms free open scale

1074
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:55.080 
discussion boards something of that nature, because i think

1075
01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:58.980 
it's one thing when we build engagement into student success

1076
01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:02.640 
for people receiving a full degree, because the return on investment

1077
01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.400 
that it takes to build out that kind of engagement for learners there,

1078
01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:12.060 
when you're dealing with much smaller cost formats you have

1079
01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.440 
to get to a really large scale to be able to justify anything

1080
01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.350 
like that. so again i think technology's and how like a chat

1081
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:22.720 
box artificial intelligence is going to be able to get to that

1082
01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.960 
point that it helps build out some of those engagement ideas

1083
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.680 
with students. but i do think it's one of the biggest issues

1084
01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:33.570 
with some of the actual new classes right now is we're putting

1085
01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:37.150 
a lot of content out there. but nobody is actually completing it.

1086
01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.250 
and so then that just becomes starts to become a waste of energy.

1087
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:43.100 
and so how do you put meaningful content that people see the

1088
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:47.840 
value and actually want to engage all the way to the end great

1089
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:53.360 
before i have so many questions say i don't want into this,

1090
01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:57.850 
as there is another one here on the check the box i will leave the room.

1091
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:02.210 
but maybe i'm missing something among all this

1092
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.960 
MOOCs which have been published recently

1093
01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:11.830 
is there another MOOC about how to do arizona state, i mean

1094
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:16.230 
because i mean we we have seen all these moocs about how to

1095
01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.100 
learn how to teach.

1096
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.870 
but i mean this is a success story clearly.

1097
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.510 
and there is so much i mean we know there is a MOOC.

1098
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:30.040 
and that's fine i mean but is there a MOOC where you

1099
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:34.740 
you know just teach your experience which has been as you tell

1100
01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.110 
us pretty much expect usually i mean this is the best

1101
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:41.640 
way to spread the gospel. and that's what we believe we believe

1102
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.900 
about how to you know become a good. i don't know expert in

1103
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:50.520 
programming languages or so forth but after all everyone

1104
01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:55.820 
in this conference. but well beyond this conference

1105
01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.220 
is trying to build something probably,

1106
01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:02.190 
as you have been doing, so did you ever think about making up a mooc?

1107
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:07.690 
we have a lot of open content on our website teach online

1108
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:11.900 
edu that people are welcome to look at i think it's a matter

1109
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.570 
of finding the right platform of the MOOC and

1110
01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:17.940 
what the engagement is and everything else, but it's actually

1111
01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:21.060 
a really good idea i'm happy to ask president crow. hey

1112
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:22.250 
let's build out a MOOC

1113
01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:28.070 
of our story. i also think the story is

1114
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:33.410 
complicated, and so it's sometimes hard for people to follow.

1115
01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:36.990 
and so we have to break up the chapters a little bit more and

1116
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:40.740 
make sure that it's delivered in a way that isn't so aspiration.

1117
01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.420 
but actually breaks it down into step one

1118
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:47.560 
do this and we do actually do assessments for universities

1119
01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:51.680 
to help break down what they need to look at for going online, so

1120
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:55.850 
that's a good idea absolutely you don't need to make it short.

1121
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:58.460 
i mean if people really want to learn,

1122
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:02.910 
they should be able to say just approach the thing with the

1123
01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:07.210 
time which is necessary i think that now it's the right moment because

1124
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:11.160 
and again you know, so much about what's happening in the united

1125
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:15.590 
states around, and it can be contribution from other experiences. but

1126
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:19.130 
just getting started with your own experience would be a fantastic idea.

1127
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:23.090 
keep us us informed, if you feel if you move further in that

1128
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:24.270 
direction we'll be very

1129
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.480 
ok we'll do we'll send an announcement.

1130
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:35.270 
ok so more questions from from people. maybe maybe a remark.

1131
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:43.940 
i am admire is you because, if i'm looking to kind of maybe

1132
01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:49.450 
we can discuss maturity level of core online education.

1133
01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:53.330 
so also in again software development.

1134
01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:57.220 
there are five stages of maturity level.

1135
01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.460 
so the first stage of zero state is having no good organization,

1136
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.920 
then there's the second stage where you get standards everywhere,

1137
01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.710 
while the third stage is in fact you get standards everywhere,

1138
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.150 
level four is where you do,

1139
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:20.130 
monitoring everything what you do and level five is optimizing.

1140
01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.940 
so i fear that my universities may be between level two and three.

1141
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:30.030 
and it seems that a as you is on a higher level.

1142
01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.040 
maybe it would would be interesting to look at

1143
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:42.440 
ways of how mature an institution is for

1144
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:48.760 
online for digital education. and

1145
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:56.970 
if i compare what leah has done with so on so many MOOCs and online degrees

1146
01:21:57.510 --> 01:22:00.180 
and what we do which is more

1147
01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:07.640 
humble, then it seems that there is also a level of maturity a difference sharable.

1148
01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:12.380 
and it is interesting to see that after all i mean we know

1149
01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.190 
just about everything about what's happening in cosara, what's

1150
01:22:16.190 --> 01:22:19.290 
happening in bex what's happening in teacher learn.

1151
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:24.830 
and on the other side there's a growing sentiment we were speaking about this with

1152
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:28.930 
in off with callus theatre evening i mean that people start

1153
01:22:28.930 --> 01:22:33.760 
saying well yeah sure MOOCs are ok, but after all i mean see how

1154
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:38.410 
universities are going did you lower the word that maybe they don't really

1155
01:22:39.010 --> 01:22:44.460 
give much about this MOOCs format and and and and of course both sites

1156
01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.570 
are to mute we can see the tremendous spread over the mooc

1157
01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:51.610 
gospel i mean at least as it's been portrayed.

1158
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:57.610 
even this afternoon and on the outside and we've seen it with its presentation.

1159
01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:02.430 
there is a lot of resistance from several universities to go

1160
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:05.810 
the mooc way though they are taking into account the fact that

1161
01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:11.880 
they have to be more digital.
so it's been becoming an incredibly complex environment a

1162
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:15.910 
process that people want to study and understand and also possible to do.

1163
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:17.740 
even a more challenging one.

1164
01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:22.020 
but here we have a success story where the two aspects

1165
01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:26.780 
we are being combined so there's still a lot of open access.

1166
01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:28.960 
but it comes from within the universe.

1167
01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:34.300 
and way only we you have been in university life for several decades know

1168
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:40.640 
how very complicated and i see almost a

1169
01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:46.890 
surprising i mean that may be. so that's why that makes for

1170
01:23:46.890 --> 01:23:50.710 
a very interesting sexist story because of course you would

1171
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.930 
find the charismatic and the would you say

1172
01:23:54.610 --> 01:23:58.880 
unique in a way or no motivic aspects. but you will still so

1173
01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.860 
find a lot to learn in terms of how they have been

1174
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:06.970 
making this grow and also the fact that they are moving to be more international.

1175
01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:12.860 
this is also extremely interesting, because i am convinced as also

1176
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.750 
yeah and i think gallo's a knocking and most of the people we're

1177
01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:21.850 
taking here that the big challenges that the huge numbers of people.

1178
01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:26.150 
so it's really exporting models this is becoming

1179
01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:32.160 
more and more i mean the idea of exploiting a model for building successful.

1180
01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:41.160 
you know open access top quality teacher education from within the universities,

1181
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:43.570 
because i don't weisel mean.

1182
01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:46.880 
we'll be caught in between, and

1183
01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:50.340 
so it's very interesting.

1184
01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:58.480 
so i guess valentino just that last question that you had asked.

1185
01:24:59.390 --> 01:25:03.900 
so first we answer you one of the things we do is we partner with everybody,

1186
01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.210 
we'd like to say that we're poly amorous meaning we love everybody.

1187
01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:12.040 
we want to partner with everybody, so we actually have partnerships

1188
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.520 
with coursera and with nx. so coursera we offer a series of

1189
01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:20.030 
uc's including learning english and we have our

1190
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:21.590 
masters of computer science.

1191
01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:25.870 
so there's a micromasters you get with coursera and then you

1192
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:29.790 
transfer into asu and complete the masters program, that's actually

1193
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:32.630 
a very successful program what we like about that is

1194
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:37.610 
uc's have a global audience by which we can't necessarily enter into.

1195
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:42.810 
so that's been very successful we did launch with edux with something

1196
01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:48.020 
called the global freshman academy probably seven years six six years ago

1197
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.020 
that we did that which was very successful

1198
01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:56.050 
in terms of the hype of it. but i would say very few people

1199
01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:59.930 
wanted to actually complete the class where we've had the best

1200
01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:03.700 
success with the global freshman academy is we learned that

1201
01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.560 
about a third of the students that apply to the university

1202
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.900 
arizona state university actually or not don't meet our admission criteria.

1203
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:15.240 
so we turned that global freshman academy actually into universal
learner courses' or

1204
01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:20.990 
a pathway into the university guaranteed admission pathway called earned admission.

1205
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:25.060 
so if you complete so many of these courses that we have both

1206
01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.640 
on edux, but we also have the ones that

1207
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:32.390 
to earn admission are actually in the su platforms partly,

1208
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:36.780 
because the platforms do not have the technology that offer the

1209
01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:42.310 
same amount of academic rigor and variety that the traditional

1210
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:46.150 
l a masses do. they're good for the quick hit quick content,

1211
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:49.930 
but they didn't quite have the levels of technology needed

1212
01:26:49.930 --> 01:26:54.540 
to offer the robustness for students to get a complete grade,

1213
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:57.130 
right?  when you're talking about three credit hour class or

1214
01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:00.390 
what not we needed that to be environments that we could surround

1215
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:03.590 
it. the other thing we found is those students still need the

1216
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:07.710 
other kinds of support than just purely content online. so they

1217
01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:11.060 
still need the tutoring they still need the academic coaches

1218
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:14.410 
and they still need those other support things that aren't

1219
01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:18.270 
necessarily available in the mix so again. this is an example

1220
01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:22.270 
of we're learning as we're going are constantly adapting and changing,

1221
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.710 
so we're still doing the MOOCs and we're still experimenting with

1222
01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:29.460 
different things and then ultimately finding new uses for it over time.

1223
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:35.710 
okay. thank you very much and i see this is also i mean

1224
01:27:36.370 --> 01:27:40.180 
the question that valentina been rising. and i say something

1225
01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:44.930 
you might think with my previous question to cambridge would you say leah

1226
01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.940 
that your approach is experimenting trying things out see what

1227
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:52.720 
works and what does not and then continue and then learn through the way

1228
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:55.760 
where as cambridge was more wait and see

1229
01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:59.640 
what others are doing and when it's ripe we adopt it.

1230
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:02.490 
oh no yeah we don't wait

1231
01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:07.320 
our philosophy is we launch a million boats and a few of those

1232
01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.670 
boats will really float well, and then we constantly add to

1233
01:28:11.670 --> 01:28:16.440 
those and make them better. so yeah like some could say that

1234
01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:20.260 
global freshman academy in concept was a failure. but we've

1235
01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:23.310 
gotten so much out of it with our earned admission pathway

1236
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:26.090 
it was just the first boat that had to launch something had

1237
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:31.050 
to be done for us to find this new way of doing things. so we learn from every

1238
01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:34.950 
every single experiment. but we don't i can't think of a single

1239
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:38.340 
thing we've waited for it to be mature. sometimes will launch

1240
01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:42.130 
something with a smaller population a pilot group or something like that,

1241
01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.570 
but i mean there's no such thing as maturity i mean that's like

1242
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.260 
acting like we're all perfect at a certain point we're not

1243
01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.450 
we're constantly learning and morphing. and it's the same thing with all these

1244
01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:52.950 
processes pedagogies technologies all of it.

1245
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:57.390 
well thank you very much. it's been

1246
01:28:58.150 --> 01:29:01.630 
quite an interesting panel, we also reached over fifty

1247
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:06.810 
people which is almost double the average of this which simply

1248
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:11.210 
means some in it. it was a very interesting topic and the recurs,

1249
01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:16.090 
also very much thanks to the speakers and the panelists.

1250
01:29:16.090 --> 01:29:20.090 
and thank you to all that have been following us this late into the evening,

1251
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:26.230 
and will be as you see meeting again hopefully soon hopefully

1252
01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:29.820 
life face to face. thank you very much again.

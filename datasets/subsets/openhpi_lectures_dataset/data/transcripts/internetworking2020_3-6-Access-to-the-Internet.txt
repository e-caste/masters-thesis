00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.690 
In our openhpi course "A
Half Century of Internet"

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.470 
now we want to consider the question
how to access the internet.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.490 
Typically we have different devices.
We have computer, laptop,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.840 
we have it at home, we
have our smartphones,

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:26.310 
for the mobile usage. So in the stationary
as well in the mobile environment

6
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.020 
we can use devices that are able to
connect to the internet. Typically

7
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
in the mobile for sure it's a wireless
connection but we can also connect

8
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.290 
via to the internet. And for
that interconnection to the

9
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.340 
internet there are different
technologies available.

10
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.700 
The analog telephone, DSL, cable
fiber, radio relay, satellite,

11
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.280 
mobile internet. So there are
different technologies and we

12
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.660 
want to have a closer
look on each.

13
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.190 
So typically a typical set up using
telephone or cable is the following.

14
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.040 
We have our devices- a
laptop or smartphone.

15
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.170 
They are in a home
network. They are both

16
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.650 
when they want to connect to the
internet, send data to router,

17
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.240 
a router with an integrated modem.
The integrated modem is able to

18
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.300 
transfer the data so that via a
telephone line or telephone cable

19
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.740 
an internet service provider
can be connected.

20
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.950 
Typically the internet provider
has such a dial-up modem the

21
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.810 
internet service provider
has a lot of home of his

22
00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.510 
to connect them to the internet
as ISP has also a larger

23
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.000 
networks, it can also connect larger
networks to the internet. And

24
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.340 
to do this the ISP runs regional
data centers. And the regional

25
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.160 
data centres from the different
internet service providers

26
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.320 
they are interconnected which
is either. This is so-called

27
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.030 
backbone with very fast interconnection,
inter-continental fiber

28
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:35.210 
or others. And then it
works as follows-

29
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:50.420 
you have remembered the
sound. The sound you could

30
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.180 
hear since the
eighties.

31
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.050 
This was an internet access via
an analog telephone with a

32
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.020 
56k modem. Then since ninety two
ISDN connection is possible

33
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.250 
initially with
64kBit/s connection

34
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.540 
and they differ in cost, calls
and the internet in the

35
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.600 
same time. How was this done? There
are flat rates in place. So we

36
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.090 
have to see how
it's done today.

37
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.430 
Today and for a broader access
to the internet to send more

38
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.470 
data and receive more data modern DSL
modems are used inside the router.

39
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.530 
These are device in one device
which with the splitter

40
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.230 
dividing the telephone and the
internet signals so that one can

41
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.620 
telephone via the same
equipment as sending data.

42
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.360 
The term DSL bundles several
technologies. Let's have a look

43
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.210 
to this technologies. They are
ADSL. This was introduced in

44
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.830 
about 2000, it was a a small less
than ten megabits per second.

45
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.120 
Then in 2006 ADSL2

46
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:30.530 
ADSL2 and VDSL came into place,
VDSL2 had already about fifty

47
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.180 
megabits per second as a
transmission rate and with

48
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.120 
VDSL vectoring which
came in 2015-2016

49
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:51.200 
into practice even more than
100 megabits per second

50
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.850 
could be a get transmitted over the
internet and could be received.

51
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.120 
The couple line is used for transmission
exchange for subscriber. So

52
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.230 
it works with
telephone cable.

53
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.990 
A long wire means less
throughput, so here we

54
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.840 
have problems in rural areas where
this technologies do not provide

55
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.850 
a full speed access
to the internet.

56
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.300 
If we look to another interconnection
technology based on wired

57
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.880 
cable then the first cable
network they arrived in 1980s

58
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.540 
was only meant for tv and radio.
So they only were able to

59
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.540 
transmit data in one
direction to the TV

60
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.600 
to the radio to receive
TV programmes.

61
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.140 
The first DOCSIS standard,
it was introduced in 1997

62
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.850 
extends the cable network
with a return path.

63
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.900 
Return path was smaller than
the receiver path but in with

64
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.540 
the DOCSIS standard
it was possible

65
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.450 
also to send data back
over this channel.

66
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.620 
Today's standard here
is DOCSIS 3.1,

67
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.270 
Coax-Cable competitor of DSL which allows
higher throughput and greater range

68
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.500 
compared to copper wire. Here we see if
you go into more details the development

69
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.620 
of this doctor's approach. So beside
a traditional telephone cable

70
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.670 
also here with this TV wire it's
possible to connect to the internet

71
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.760 
DSL within distance of five
kilometres cable with a distance

72
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.300 
of a one hundred
sixty cable.

73
00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
Another technology to access to
the internet is satellite.

74
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.510 
Satellite is a construction of a wired
infrastructure with fibre, copper

75
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:16.050 
wires, cable. This is quite expensive
and only profitable in urban areas.

76
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.870 
So this is a disadvantage for village
and for rural areas, so here

77
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.630 
satellite connection are
an alternative because

78
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.560 
satellite do not need
any extra cable.

79
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:38.390 
So satellite dish is necessary of
course. It has to be correctly

80
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.780 
aligned to the satellite
for an optimal reception

81
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:50.060 
and there is a high latency, five hundred
to seven hundred media per second

82
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.400 
because of the large distance
between for the transmission

83
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.840 
which is done with the light of
with the speed of light but

84
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.090 
it has to go to the satellite and
has to go down to the receiver.

85
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:14.220 
So skyDSL it's available
since 1999, provides a data

86
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.200 
bandwidth with fifty
megabits per second.

87
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.910 
Then this project
of Elon Musk

88
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:31.760 
with spaceX, Starlink. Starlink
was opened in may 23

89
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:38.940 
in 2019. There are meanwhile
sixty satellites in space

90
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:44.480 
to provide an infrastructure,
to connect to the internet

91
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.440 
even in rural areas.

92
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:55.040 
Since this satellites are closer to earth
they are less they have less latency

93
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.340 
than the traditional
satellite connections.

94
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.670 
but problems here are what's with
rubble, what's with reflections?

95
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.420 
So we will see how this technology
competes with the other.

96
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.780 
If we look to the mobile networks
that are used to connect

97
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:21.260 
mobile devices to the internet
then the GSM standard has to

98
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.370 
be mentioned which was
introduced in 1990

99
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:34.310 
for mobile networks. It is a
second generation technology

100
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:42.000 
which follows ABC nets It handles
mobile telephony or short messages

101
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:47.700 
with a maximum throughput
of 9.6KBit/s.

102
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:54.590 
In practice it's less. Following
technology allow crater bandwidth.

103
00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.410 
So we have EDGE, it was introduced
2005 and provides up to

104
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:07.920 
four hundred seventy three kilobytes
per second. This is a 2G technology.

105
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:13.410 
HSDPA introduced 2007,
it provides up to

106
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:20.000 
42 MBit/s, it's 3G generation.
G stands for generation

107
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:27.700 
and different technologies are connected
into generation and each generation

108
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.820 
has certain characters characteristics
mainly concerning to the bandwidth.

109
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:40.890 
They are able to transmit data. So
then LTE came into place 2010.

110
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.690 
It provides the possibility up
to transmit up to one thousand

111
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.550 
two hundred megabit per second.
It's already a 4G technology

112
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.960 
and 5G. These are considered
technology which are able

113
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.970 
to transmit more than ten gigabits
per second came into place

114
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.370 
in 2019.

115
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.590 
Thec sim card allows
access to USB model

116
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.600 
or internet router. So smart
phone can access the internet

117
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:22.060 
via sim card and also
accounting is done

118
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:28.900 
this way. Let's consider
how mobile devices

119
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.900 
mobile devices

120
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.320 
can connect to the internet
without a mobile phone.

121
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.800 
We want to connect our
laptop to the internet.

122
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:44.090 
So there are different possibilities.
There are UMTS or LTE wire adapter.

123
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:51.560 
This connects a sim card via
USB. So although with this

124
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.920 
via the USB port
we can connect

125
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.920 
via the USB port use be
pulled we can reconnect

126
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.920 
via the USB port use be
pulled we can reconnect

127
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.830 
a sim cards to our laptop, that
data has to support the LTE

128
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.620 
frequencies. Otherwise
this does not work.

129
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.210 
A few words about frequencies
for the mobile internet.

130
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.700 
Which frequencies are used and
allowed for mobile internet?

131
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.800 
Here are some answers for
situation in Germany.

132
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.630 
So frequency range is divided
into two distinct bands,

133
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:33.230 
uplink from mobile device and
downlink to the mobile device.

134
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:39.720 
So frequencies are different
throughout in the world. Germany

135
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:48.150 
uses the GSM900:
890-915 MHz

136
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.600 
per second MHz for the
upstream and 935

137
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.600 
to 960 MHz for
the downstream

138
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:03.880 
and LTE is using
800 MHz, 1.8 MHz,

139
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.270 
2 GHz and 2.6 GHz.

140
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:14.330 
So here it depends on what kind
of provider is used, what kind

141
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:21.980 
of devices is used in Germany. The
question is in which frequencies

142
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.270 
what kind of support
is available.

143
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.040 
So the federal network agency handles
the allocation of frequencies.

144
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:36.870 
So there are auctions. You remember
this auction falls on 5G frequencies

145
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:43.200 
in the last year. So here is a
link for more information about

146
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:49.290 
the 5G auction to the federal
network agency. Who is interested

147
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.080 
please have a
closer look.

148
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:58.710 
Let's summarize. We can access,
can get with our devices

149
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.830 
access to the internet
a on a wired basis.

150
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.990 
For example with an analog
telephone, with ISDN,

151
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.410 
with DSL, with the various DSL
technologies, with the cable and

152
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.800 
what we need is the corresponding
network card and network

153
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.260 
interfaces for
our devices.

154
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:27.770 
And then if we look to the wireless
access we can get it with radio relay,

155
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.590 
for example WIMAX, we can get
it via satellite, for example

156
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:41.180 
SkyDSL, starlink, from Musk, or via
mobile internet for example with GSM,

157
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:51.020 
GPRS, UMTS, HSDPA, LTE, LTE advanced
and new 5G technologies.

158
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.370 
Thank you for
your attention.

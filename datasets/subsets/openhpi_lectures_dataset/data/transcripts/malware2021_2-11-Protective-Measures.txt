00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.010 
At the end of our openHPI course
about Cyber Threats by Malware,

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.870 
we have to discuss protective measures.
We have seen that there are so many

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.150 
different types of malware,
what can be done to protect

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.050 
one's own systems the laptop,
smartphone or other devices from

5
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.780 
getting infected
by malware.

6
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.280 
And let's start with the
topic- Program Updates.

7
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.950 
Program updates, in general, are provided
to close system vulnerabilities

8
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.010 
and to eliminate the security risk
of a program or of an application

9
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.780 
of the operating
system.

10
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.210 
So, if you use an old software
which is not updated

11
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.980 
then this is a really
big security risk.

12
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.630 
The risk comes from the point that
typically the vulnerabilities

13
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.860 
that are closed by such
updates are publicly known,

14
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.960 
so attackers know that those old systems
have this vulnerability and then

15
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
they can employ exploit them to
infect the system with malware.

16
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:27.390 
So, the general advice is - install updates
as soon as such updates are available.

17
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.220 
The reason why such updates are needed is
that manufacturers do not find all errors

18
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.690 
of a software, of
an application

19
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.870 
during the test phase

20
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.980 
and so many security
gaps are

21
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.250 
only known when the program is in
use, when many people are using it,

22
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.810 
and then all such
vulnerabilities are detected.

23
00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.450 
Also, if an attack is detected that
exploits this vulnerability then

24
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.350 
the vendor immediately can try
to close this security gap

25
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.760 
that results from that vulnerability
and provide updates to help you

26
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.100 
to secure your system.

27
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.720 
So, known security vulnerabilities
can usually be closed by

28
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.080 
smaller updates, by
smaller update packages.

29
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.450 
If there's more, basically
you have to step over to

30
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.130 
a new version of the program
or install the program

31
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.470 
completely. So,
currently

32
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.730 
in the recent time, most
programs automatically provide

33
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.370 
information on available updates
because it's really a serious thing.

34
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.380 
So, if your system shows that
an update needs to be done

35
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
then please try to do this
update as soon as possible.

36
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.850 
There are also helper applications
that automatically check

37
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.540 
for updates for the installed
software on your computer.

38
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.410 
Also, anti-virus programs check
if the installed software

39
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.390 
can be updated by new
updates that are provided.

40
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.810 
So, information is available but you
should follow the advice - as soon

41
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.090 
as the information available that the program
needs to be updated then do that (update).

42
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.110 
But with all the updates you need to
be careful, you need to be careful

43
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.880 
that it comes from a
trustworthy source.

44
00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.430 
Sometimes attackers claim their
malware as an update for a system,

45
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.990 
so every time check is it really
from the producer of the software,

46
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.280 
from a known company or
from a trustworthy source

47
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.880 
where you take the update and from
where you update your systems.

48
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.050 
Otherwise, I mentioned that attacker,
that cybercriminals often

49
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.860 
claim their malware
as updates

50
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.990 
and then it's very easy for them if
you think you update your system

51
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.120 
but in reality, you install
the malware then they can do

52
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.630 
their work on
your computer.

53
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.740 
I already mentioned anti-virus
software: anti-virus software

54
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.180 
is a very important type of
program, it's a system

55
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.600 
that you need to install in your
computer system and the use

56
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.830 
of the anti-virus software is it
helps you to detect malware.

57
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.460 
It not only helps you to detect virus malware,
but it is also the name for a software

58
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.590 
that detects,

59
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.080 
detects all malware which is
installed on your computer system.

60
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.360 
So, it detects not only viruses but also
worms, trojans, spyware, scareware,

61
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.520 
and all the other malware types
we have discussed and have

62
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.210 
introduced in our
openHPI course.

63
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.490 
Sometimes people say instead
of anti-virus, they say

64
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.750 
anti-malware software, it's
more correct but more popular

65
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.350 
usage is of anti-virus
software.

66
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.010 
Yeah, it is also

67
00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.940 
possible, it's also able to monitor
internet connections and warn you

68
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.380 
when you try to access
an unsafe website.

69
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.340 
This could happen when you try
to follow a link address.

70
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.850 
So a good anti-virus software is not
only to detect installed malware,

71
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.430 
it also helps
you to prevent

72
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.470 
malware infections.

73
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.610 
So, the anti-virus software
should be mandatory,

74
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.870 
a mandatory component of each
system to ensure that the system

75
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.730 
runs as secure as possible. How this
anti-virus software is working?

76
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.510 
We explain this in an additional
excursus on anti-virus software.

77
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.210 
"Backups" - the next topic
you should think of.

78
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.180 
Many malware attacks on the
internet result in data loss or

79
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.410 
in data damage, for example,
if you remember ransomware

80
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.700 
then they would render the data encrypted so
that you no longer have access to your data.

81
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.020 
In case of data loss due to malware or
due to damage to the operating system,

82
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.920 
the data can easily be restored
using the previously created

83
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.110 
back up copy.

84
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.280 
It can be
restored better

85
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.020 
if a more recent
back-up was done.

86
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:39.080 
So, important data, important personal
data must be backed-up regularly,

87
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:45.510 
not once a year but you have to do it,
depending on the usage of your system,

88
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.960 
once a week or even
more often and

89
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.300 
because it's so important, many
systems offer automatic data back-up

90
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.140 
at pre-defined
intervals.

91
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.180 
But you need to be careful
that the stored back-up,

92
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.910 
possibly the
encrypted backup

93
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.360 
should be stored on
an external media

94
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.370 
or should be stored
in the cloud

95
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.550 
because if the attacker managed to
gain access to your computer then

96
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.700 
you can lose the data, you
can even lose the backups.

97
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.810 
So it is important that
you connect a special

98
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.720 
disk or you have to do
this with the cloud, you

99
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.390 
have to create a backup and then
you have to take care that

100
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.380 
this back up is no
longer connected

101
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.730 
to your system.

102
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.050 
Another tool which provides
protective measures against

103
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.990 
malware are Firewalls.

104
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:06.320 
What are Firewalls doing? The Firewalls
monitor network connections

105
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.110 
and they monitor
all the traffic

106
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:16.560 
over the internet. So, the Firewalls
check all the incoming packets

107
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:26.250 
to your system and so it can prevent
unauthorized connection attempts.

108
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.430 
If someone for example, from a
known attacker site, wants to

109
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.010 
connect to your system, the
Firewall can detect it.

110
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:42.030 
Additional protection is given by
Firewalls against network attacks

111
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.720 
such as attacks from
backdoors or botnets.

112
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.180 
So, if someone tries to connect
to your computer because he/she

113
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:58.640 
was able to install a backdoor or
he/she was able to install to

114
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.580 
make it a bot in a botnet then by means
of Firewalls this can be detected.

115
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.380 
There are different types of
firewalls, there are local Firewalls

116
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:15.180 
which are installed on your machine
and only are able to check

117
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.640 
your traffic, traffic
of your machine

118
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.850 
with the network. And
the other type is a

119
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.200 
Network Firewall which
checks all network traffic

120
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.430 
and is usually installed on
connection nodes between the local

121
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.450 
network and the internet. So here, with
a network firewall, all the traffic

122
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.880 
is considered. In the case
of local firewalls exactly

123
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.470 
your systems' and how you need the
system, all this information is taken

124
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.070 
to protect this
special system.

125
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.010 
So, in enterprise software,
enterprise networks you need both

126
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.550 
you need Firewalls on your system
and you need network Firewalls.

127
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.930 
How does this
technique work?

128
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:13.960 
How are Firewalls are able to monitor
and detect different malicious

129
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.020 
attackers or people, that
try to connect? This,

130
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.240 
we will also explain in an
extra excursus on Firewalls.

131
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:32.820 
Perhaps the most protective
measure against malware is

132
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.980 
a healthy suspicion.
Always be careful

133
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.490 
because this is the most effective
protection that could be done

134
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.520 
by yourself with
your knowledge

135
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.990 
and you're at the
end responsible

136
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.440 
to protect your system
from malware attacks.

137
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.650 
So, it is the best
protection mechanism

138
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.780 
but the best technical protection mechanisms
are no longer active or effective,

139
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.560 
if you as a user open to
non-trustworthy content. If you open

140
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.310 
an attachment and
in this way

141
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:21.280 
upload malware to your computer
or if you visit a malicious

142
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.810 
website and in this way open
the door to upload a malware.

143
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:34.750 
So, you are the one, it is in
your hands to avoid a lot of,

144
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:42.340 
a lot of possibilities for an attacker
to bring their malware to your system.

145
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.550 
So, it starts when
installing,

146
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.840 
when you install
new software,

147
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.920 
check where the software comes from,
who is the manufacturer, what is

148
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.260 
the origin of the software - is
this a known trustworthy vendor

149
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.630 
or is this someone
nobody heard about?

150
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.650 
Do not follow simple

151
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.220 
recommendation, for example in
a spam mail or in a phishing

152
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.360 
mail which says here
that wonderful

153
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.510 
functionalities that are provided
by the software, you can download

154
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.420 
it here and if you
download then of course

155
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.470 
you also download
malware.

156
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.830 
Verify the signature of the
software to be installed,

157
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.660 
verify all the signature
of the updates that are

158
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.070 
coming from the
vendor of

159
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:40.630 
the software. This can be done automatically,
it's a question of configuration.

160
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.630 
Then, if a warning
appears,

161
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.240 
a manual verification
is necessary.

162
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:55.240 
Another very important hint is
what kind of software you

163
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.620 
should install on your
system and the advice is:

164
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.680 
only install that software
which you really need.

165
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.800 
Why should you? If you install
unnecessary applications

166
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.530 
then with the vulnerabilities of
those unnecessary applications

167
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.310 
you open doors
for attacks.

168
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.510 
So, additional feature
or optional plug-ins,

169
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:26.820 
all they provide are possibilities
for the attacker to

170
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.600 
get their malware to your system
or to attack your system.

171
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.390 
If you install the software
you needed, then it's

172
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.050 
justified because
you need it.

173
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.040 
But the software that's
installed and not needed

174
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.230 
which can be misused by the attacker
to break into your system

175
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:53.470 
or to install malware then it
is completely unnecessary

176
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.590 
and increases the
risk without any

177
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:03.230 
improved usage and this is particularly
true for your smartphone.

178
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:09.440 
Check which apps you have loaded
from the app-store to your

179
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:15.030 
smartphone and which of
these apps you really need

180
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.930 
and use, which you have used
in the last two-three weeks

181
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.980 
and then think
to uninstall

182
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.520 
applications you
are not using.

183
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.290 
Then you should turn
off active content

184
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:35.640 
like Flash, Java, Active
X in the web browser.

185
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:41.450 
The reason you should turn these
off by default is that these

186
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.510 
web programming tools

187
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.020 
open doors, provide possibilities
for a number of different attacks

188
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:56.990 
and intrusion opportunities.
Eventually, it does not look

189
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.580 
so nice and dynamic

190
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:08.590 
but you close doors for the attackers to
attack your system, to install malware

191
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.490 
on your system.

192
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.530 
Then, we often already saw this when
we discussed the different types of

193
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.980 
malware, you should not
open an email attachment

194
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:28.490 
if you do not know the sender or if
you do not expect that this sender

195
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.120 
sends you this kind
of information.

196
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.090 
Open email attachments only if
the sender is known and the

197
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.820 
text can be assigned to the
sender and when an email

198
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:47.650 
with an attachment was expected, otherwise,
it's an easy way for an attacker

199
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.710 
to infect your
system by hiding a

200
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.980 
malware in that
attachment.

201
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.070 
And then keep calm
with often-

202
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.770 
faked online warnings.

203
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.920 
You remember, when we
spoke about scareware,

204
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.560 
and the warning is shown to you: "your system
is infected, please do this and this",

205
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:18.250 
this is often a malware attack, it's
often not real and you should not

206
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.040 
immediately follow what
they propose to you.

207
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.660 
So, keep calm with such online
warnings and particularly

208
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.710 
in case of a request for
payment and fines.

209
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:39.610 
And then check installed software
and remove all unused programs.

210
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:45.370 
I already mentioned this as important
advice, to make your system

211
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.720 
more secure.

212
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.560 
Let's mention some protective measures
against malware for mobile devices.

213
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:59.850 
Mobile devices that become more and more
common and also provide the possibility

214
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:05.660 
to connect to the internet and to
run applications on the internet.

215
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:13.250 
So, get your apps, get your applications
only from trusted sources. So,

216
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:18.350 
take the applications from
official app stores

217
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.580 
from Play Store from Android
or from Apple's App Store.

218
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:34.240 
Be careful when you install a new
app which does not have ratings

219
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:41.260 
or has only a few ratings, be careful
because this all provides an entrance

220
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.810 
to your system and
installing such an app

221
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.310 
you also install,

222
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.470 
eventually, hidden malware
inside the application.

223
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:59.940 
Keep apps and operating system of the
mobile devices always up to date.

224
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.340 
This is the same as with
your system, you should

225
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:09.010 
timely install available updates.
One can see this, so regularly

226
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:13.540 
in a regular way, you should restart,
completely restart your app

227
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.750 
because in that way all
the operating systems,

228
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.700 
operating systems
updates are installed.

229
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.780 
Then this is true for systems, for
the computer systems, laptops, and

230
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.470 
also for mobile devices
- create backups.

231
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:35.560 
The system can be restored from an
old backup in case of an infection.

232
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.360 
So, it's not necessary
to negotiate with the

233
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:46.580 
cybercriminals about paying something,
about ransom, you can easily

234
00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.410 
restore your system by taking
the data out of the backup.

235
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.970 
Then this is in particular important
for applications on mobile devices,

236
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.620 
grant apps only
minimal permissions.

237
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.280 
It's possible
to set up the

238
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.950 
permissions, to which sources a
new application can have access.

239
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.580 
One can do this in the phase of
the start-up of the initial

240
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:25.840 
installation and start-up of the settings
or you can go into the settings

241
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.740 
of your system, they
are available here.

242
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.100 
For all the applications they are
available so that you can here

243
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:46.290 
decide whether you want to allow an app the access
to another system or to another application.

244
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.960 
And you know what is the app for
or the functionality of the app,

245
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.980 
so you can select what kind of
permissions the app needs

246
00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:02.260 
to do its work. For example, the
Flashlight app does not require access

247
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.190 
to the contact list, so it is
often if you check it on your

248
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:12.240 
on your device and it's
completely unnecessary.

249
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.640 
And the question is where this Flashlight
app comes from? So, a typical

250
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.200 
entrance, a typical way to attack
your system, your mobile system

251
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.880 
by the attacker is to design apps
with some functionality that

252
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:35.140 
needs to be nice to have but
inside it is the malware. And

253
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.940 
if such a Flashlight app wants to have
wants to access the contact list

254
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:45.220 
then this is a good reason not to
trust in this application and

255
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:52.440 
to assume that it has malware hidden,
and completely deactivate this

256
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:58.380 
Flashlight app or at least
restrict the permissions.

257
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.360 
So, these are the main protective
measures against malware.

258
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.100 
For everyone who is interested in
the technical understanding of

259
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.530 
anti-virus programs
and firewalls,

260
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.880 
there are some excursus.
The goal of this course,

261
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:20.450 
this openHPI course about Cyber
Threats by Malware was to

262
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:26.590 
sensitize you on the different
types of malware and to help you

263
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.990 
to protect your system. Thank
you for your attention.

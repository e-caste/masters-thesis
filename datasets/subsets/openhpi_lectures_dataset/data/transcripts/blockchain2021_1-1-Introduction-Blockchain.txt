00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.730 
A warm welcome to our openHPI

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.320 
course Blockchain -
Revealing the Myth.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.770 
When I try to say what
blockchain means,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.430 
then I run into
difficulties.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.580 
blockchain phenomena has
been around for thirteen years.

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.840 
The first source was this paper
of Satoshi Nakamoto,

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.790 
"Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer
electronic cash system"

8
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.910 
was published in two thousand
eight but in this paper

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.170 
there is no use of
the blockchain notion.

10
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.810 
So even today the term block
chain is still ambiguous.

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.760 
So what is known about
blockchain so far?

12
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.510 
It's a chain of
blocks, its clear.

13
00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.260 
The name tells it. The blocks are and block
chain is something related to bitcoin.

14
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.970 
Yes, bitcoin is very popular and the
technology that's used by bitcoin,

15
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
by this cybercurrency, by
the crypto currency

16
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.370 
is a blockchain and there was
a lot of hype associated with

17
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.190 
bitcoin and in the
consequence also with blockchain.

18
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.980 
So in fact the term
bitcoin existed before

19
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.960 
the term blockchain or

20
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.130 
blockchain as a term was first used when
new bitcoin like projects were started.

21
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.090 
So blockchain describes
a technology concept

22
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.390 
and needs to be distinguished
from the application, from the

23
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.520 
very famous bitcoin
application.

24
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.620 
So what we want to do in this course -
we will start with the basics

25
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.830 
of blockchain technology, we will
gradually try to define the term,

26
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.740 
to see what belongs to
the blockchain technology,

27
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.880 
we enhance our definition during the
course so that at the end of week one

28
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.640 
I think you can receive a clear understanding
of the blockchain technology.

29
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.450 
So this technology,
this is not new, the

30
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.970 
parts that are used and the
techniques that are used

31
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.970 
in the blockchain technology came
from cryptography, came from

32
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.440 
other parts and are well known. What
is new with the blockchain is

33
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.690 
that this techniques are connected
to each other in a new way that

34
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.320 
disrupted many areas like for
example financial system.

35
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.890 
So in the first week of our course
Blockchain: Revealing the Myth,

36
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.570 
we will speak about blockchains, about
its origins, goals, development courses

37
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.420 
and stumbling blocks
encountered along the way.

38
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.760 
And then we start with taking a
look at the initial idea of

39
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.410 
blockchain and how it works and for
that reason we consider in detail

40
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.120 
the bitcoin system and
the bitcoin solution.

41
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.750 
So the fundamental problem that led
to the creation from a bitcoin

42
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.790 
system and from a
cryptocurrency is discussed.

43
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.990 
We consider in detail the complex
solution of bitcoin, this is the

44
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.620 
centre of what we learn
in the first week.

45
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.570 
The building blocks of bitcoins
are discussed in detail and then

46
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.910 
we will examine the evolution from
a decentralized ledger to a world

47
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.440 
computer. And we will
do this and this is the

48
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.800 
end of week one, we will do this with
a post-bitcoin blockchain project

49
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.310 
overview. And then in the next week we
will consider projects which are

50
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.400 
accounted to the blockchain 2.0
generation, the new generation of blockchain.

51
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.930 
So what you need? Yes, you will
need an initial knowledge on

52
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.390 
the topics already mentioned in
the course description; namely

53
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.770 
the basics of cryptography, the hash
function and public-key cryptography

54
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.460 
and de-centralized network, so-
called peer-to-peer networks.

55
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.450 
We provide
material here,

56
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.380 
that if you are

57
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.300 
not clear with this technology,
you still have the possibility

58
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.910 
to get this knowledge by following
the compact courses we have prepared

59
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.220 
in this course. So you can
find it under the course details

60
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.010 
additional resources and of course
you can also take part in former

61
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.270 
openHPI courses. For
example, openHPI course on

62
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.870 
communication, on confidential
communication where we provide an

63
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.530 
introduction into cryptography, into
the hash functions technique

64
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.240 
and into public key cryptography
with public and private keys,

65
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.750 
with digital
signatures and others.

66
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.860 
In the second week with
this understanding

67
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.020 
we got in the
first week

68
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.320 
about the blockchain technology,
in the second

69
00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
week we address the debate about blockchain
alternatives and the company challenges,

70
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.850 
the so called scalability
trilemma

71
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.750 
that private permissioned block
chains are considered in more detail,

72
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.520 
we consider the question of scalability,
decentralisation and security

73
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.420 
and after the discussion of the
alternatives and the challenges involved,

74
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.510 
we look at the possibilities
of implementation

75
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.590 
and consider some best practice examples,
that means projects that have

76
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.450 
been successfully
implemented and that became popular.

77
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.680 
More information about blockchain
you can get from this booklet

78
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.630 
which we have published this
year together with Tatiana

79
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.560

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.020 
with our teaching team,
discussing things

97
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:23.520 
we have introduced in
our lecture videos to

98
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.410 
change your experiences you have
eventually with blockchain

99
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.590 
with blockchain
techniques and

100
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.110 
ask all the questions if
something is not yet clear.

101
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.770 
So, a warm welcome to our openHPI course
Blockchain: Revealing the Myth.

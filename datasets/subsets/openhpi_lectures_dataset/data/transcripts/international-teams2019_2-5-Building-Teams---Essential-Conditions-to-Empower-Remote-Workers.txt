00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.890 
So Salim, let's talk about
empowering teams to give them

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.330 
enough freedom that they can
work remotely. Empower

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.600 
them that they will
be able to do that

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.880 
work remotely and particularly
I think this is one of

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.470 
the most important topics
on how to build trust.

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.490 
yeah definitely, and probably one
of them, not one of the most

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.100 
probably the most. But let
us start as you suggested,

8
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.970 
we need conditions to empower
remote teamwork, it will not

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.610 
happen because of magic.
If we do not empower

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.150 
from the management
perspective, it won't

11
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
work as we expect. Now,
empowerment means also,

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.440 
a kind of freedom and also
believe in trusting each other.

13
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.780 
Empowerment starts with
the freedom to discover.

14
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.980 
To review, go outside looking for
something new there and of course,

15
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.050 
continue working for the organization
in a different dimension

16
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.150 
or probably doing something wrong,
stop doing what you're doing.

17
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
The challenges that remote
work is bringing,

18
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.140 
to all of us, is that outside, it
is a world, it's a dynamic world

19
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.480 
that is changing. It is time to
see that world, how it is moving

20
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.260 
and then to see, what I have been
doing all the time, it is correct?

21
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.810 
or should I stop doing it? Should
I do it in a different way?

22
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.270 
but we need to be careful because
not everyone can deal with

23
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.190 
that. Some people,
want just to have

24
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.280 
a direction, give me what I
need to do and that's it.

25
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.400 
Other people definitely, need
to see this open-world.

26
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.760 
It is important when we are
managing this freedom

27
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.190 
and flexibility, that we also
recognized this factor to

28
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
structuring people. We will
reduce the ritual of commuting,

29
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.130 
but this is a challenge
that allows us to change.

30
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.110 
We want something different,
it is the riddle of coming

31
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.050 
from nine to five and
this will change,

32
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.820 
and also we need to see this,
as a kind of an opportunity

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.650 
because of the stress that we
are dealing daily, going

34
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.300 
into the office, coming back from
the office and remember I'm

35
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.950 
at the office but I need to
leave right now because

36
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.280 
I need to do something else.
This kind of stress,

37
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.270 
it is by far better to be planed
when I am in a dynamic remote

38
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.590 
coordination. So, we also
see, kind of, that it's

39
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.480 
getting more split the work,
like you're not working from

40
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.330 
nine to five anymore but rather
like, from nine to ten and then

41
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.290 
maybe do something else. Probably,
according to your needs, according

42
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.860 
to your needs but remember you need to
fit into a plan. You are expected

43
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.190 
to achieve something, and this
achievement then you deal with

44
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.740 
when do I want to achieve it?
Probably then, you're gonna have to

45
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.920 
work but in the afternoon because
in the morning you need to

46
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.560 
deal with something else and
probably something else, is talk

47
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.790 
to a customer or have a video
conference something like that.

48
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.830 
It doesn't need to be that
your private life is all the

49
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.940 
time. No, but you need to have
discipline, we already talked

50
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.440 
about that. The self-discipline
is also something important

51
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.110 
that we need to consider. Remote
work is not just shifting

52
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.130 
routine from the office to the
home or to the remote office

53
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.680 
You're not moving this to there
because it doesn't make more sense.

54
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.960 
The idea is to bring this
task or what you need

55
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.600 
to do out there but in
order to, perform

56
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.420 
faster, to perform more effectively,
and those are some things that

57
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.680 
people also need to deal
with that. Some people,

58
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.250 
as I said, they want to
have exactly the same job

59
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.380 
out there without travelling. yeah,
it may be an option but you

60
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.720 
are not exploiting
the whole

61
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.590 
opportunities that you have
there. The traditional settings

62
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.860 
also may slow down because
you are used to (do that).

63
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.520 
I always did it in that way, I will
continue to do it in that way

64
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.350 
until I retire. Now, this dynamic
work of life, it is definitely

65
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.270 
giving more
opportunities to you,

66
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.610 
your family, to your neighbors,
everyone but it is a need, we

67
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.350 
are in a nomadic life right now.
Probably we are going to work

68
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.050 
to the in Berlin, tomorrow
in London and in one week

69
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.500 
in San Francisco. This kind
of working life is given

70
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.460 
us a chance to move,
to continue in this.

71
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.360 
Times may change, you already
said in one of the videos

72
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.690 
before, that even are necessary,
some scheduling tools for

73
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.140 
scheduling proper time because
people may be at the other side

74
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.860 
of the word or in a different time
zone and it is necessary to

75
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.730 
coordinate this and it is
important also, to consider

76
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.690 
that probably we are going
to coordinate more people

77
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.690 
but the idea is that we will
continue targeting the same

78
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.560 
topics that we want to
achieve. Make sure that when

79
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.800 
you give freedom to people,
they don't feel ignored.

80
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.230 
because, OK, you are doing a small
project, you are probably in

81
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.320 
a different time zone and you
forget about those people .know

82
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.130 
all of them are still
important to achieve

83
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.790 
the task that you want. If people feel
ignored, of course, immediately,

84
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.160 
the performance will go down.
Now, it's a very good question

85
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.490 
what you prefer to have control?
or to trust your people? what

86
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.780 
what you think is
better? I would say

87
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.300 
in a remote setting, if your team
is fit to do that, so it really

88
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.170 
kind of saves you a lot
of nerves to trust.

89
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.240 
Definitely, you role as a manager in a
remote structure, is not to babysit.

90
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.610 
Babysitting is not for
a professional work.

91
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.490 
You go with people that you trust
out there and that they trust

92
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.430 
you. It means if we are believing
that the remote worker

93
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.980 
is trusting how I work, as a
manager, and I trust how they are

94
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.970 
working, believe me, at the end
of this cooperation, it will be

95
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.930 
just success. And don't
expect this trust to come

96
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.670 
from today or tomorrow,
it will take a while.

97
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.610 
It will take a while
because it's a rhythm,

98
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.550 
how do you perform, do you have some
issues out there, I have some

99
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.280 
issues in the organization,
you've been out there

100
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.920 
..........and no
organizations are identical

101
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.710 
what may work in one organization, may
not work in other organizations.

102
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.120 
It means keep it easy, It
will take a while but

103
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.940 
the idea is that you trust each
other. If there is no trust

104
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.290 
forget, Tom, don't start this
program because you won't work

105
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.420 
in any way. But trust is also highly
dependent on communication,

106
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.110 
if you are not properly
communicating, if you have issues

107
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.140 
working remotely and you
don't tell me, as a manager

108
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.590 
how should I know? and you
start underperforming but

109
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.540 
what will happen the whole process
will not work..... and i think

110
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.160 
also as manager you want
to see that you really

111
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.220 
trusting its worth to trust
your people because

112
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.530 
they show you that they
actually doing something.

113
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.220 
exactly and it's about
communication that you see that

114
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.950 
exactly as some people also say
if you cannot trust someone

115
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.760 
you are making a mistake in hiring
people because in the selection

116
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.360 
process is not the proper one,...
but now we continue the frequency

117
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.440 
of communication is also very
relevant, communicate properly

118
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.460 
define the times when it's better
for you to communicate probably

119
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.210 
not very early in the morning,
probably not very late in the

120
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.380 
afternoon and do not
keep communicating

121
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.370 
permanently because you
get overloaded but also

122
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.200 
make it at least twice a
week, three times a week

123
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.740 
it is important that this rhythm
how often we communicate we

124
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.560 
we agree on that, and also the
team that is communicating

125
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.470 
whole chain they identified
their own rhythm.

126
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.710 
when do you want to communicate
probably,.... ok we communicate

127
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.310 
once a week or three times a week
it depends on the team, depending

128
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.080 
on the task, depending on what
kind of job are doing the

129
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.890 
depends also the deadlines if
we need to deliver a project

130
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.000 
on friday, today is monday probably
we want to have tomorrow, the

131
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.720 
day after tomorrow, some feeling
this is very important

132
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.470 
just to define the frequency
of communications.

133
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.820 
and finally it is
necessary to define that

134
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.660 
this trust and this control
we'll be the depending on

135
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.770 
which tools are we using in
the back for communicating

136
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.440 
if probably we were using just
chat for communicating to each

137
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.340 
other ok i'm sorry but this is
not a rich communication we

138
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.300 
need to probably talk
or to see each other

139
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.720 
and this will definitely, increase
the quality of the whole

140
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.830 
communication finally i just
want to comment on something

141
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.180 
that said a professor of work
and organizational psychology

142
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.000 
at the university of Vienna
last week or two weeks ago

143
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.450 
companies must learn to avoid
control and develop a healthy

144
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.590 
culture of trust within a clearly
communicated set of rules.

145
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.930 
only in this way can they remain
attractive as a contemporary employer

146
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.280 
a lot of organizations are already
moving in that direction

147
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.800 
if i keep my organization
in the stone era

148
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.170 
people start living because
people would like to do better

149
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.050 
I can enjoy this kind of
a working environment,

150
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.890 
and this is something that
we need to keep in mind

151
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.200 
i read a book a couple of months
ago and it's by a guy from

152
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.340 
Brazil, Ricardo Semler
and he kind of

153
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.590 
transformed his company back in
the eighty's, kind of this...

154
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.370 
from this very control based
type of organization,

155
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.990 
to trust-based organizations. Really
important to.. really interesting

156
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.340 
to read this book, I really recommend
it as fun to read as well.

157
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.230 
called Maverick..... Maverick
ok.., great I think is this also

158
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.890 
for the community, it would be pretty
interesting that we exchange

159
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.860 
also, some of their experience
because trust, trust Tom

160
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.190 
it is probably, the most

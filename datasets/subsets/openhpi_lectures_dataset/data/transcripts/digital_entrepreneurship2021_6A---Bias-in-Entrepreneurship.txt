1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.060 
What role do stereotypes play in
entrepreneurship? Can we observe

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.460 
differences between entrepreneurs
of different gender, and if

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.950 
so, can these differences influence
entrepreneurial activities?

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.010 
Let's take a closer look at what
researchers have found out

5
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.980 
about potential imbalances and biases
in the field of entrepreneurship.

6
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.480 
Hopefully, we can point to some
answers to these questions.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.630 
Welcome to the session "Female Entrepreneurship".
My name is Katharina Hölzle,

8
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.230 
and next to me is Robert Rose. As
entrepreneurship researchers,

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.910 
we want to understand how we can
characterize successful entrepreneurs.

10
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.360 
And in that sense, we want to
identify what an entrepreneur

11
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.180 
needs to succeed with
a business idea.

12
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.450 
Research shows that it makes a
difference in some contexts

13
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.480 
and situations if you are a
male or a female entrepreneur

14
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.290 
when pursuing an
entrepreneurial idea.

15
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.870 
For this session titled "Female
Entrepreneurship", Robert and

16
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.160 
I want to present a snapshot of
the current research findings

17
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.260 
in this field and its
wider implications.

18
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.890 
Often, when we think of a
successful entrepreneur,

19
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.160 
a famous founder comes to mind.
One that we have seen often

20
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.840 
on TV or social media.

21
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.740 
Prominent founders such as Elon
Musk from Tesla, Bill Gates

22
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.070 
from Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg from
Facebook or Steve Jobs from Apple.

23
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.630 
Of course, perhaps you did straight away
think of a famous female entrepreneur.

24
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.820 
Maybe you thought of Cher Wang
from HTC, Janice Bryant Howroyd

25
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.570 
from Act One group, Estée Lauder
from Estée Lauder Companies,

26
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.280 
or Tory Burch from the
fashion label Tory Burch.

27
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.380 
But maybe, for some of us these
names don't ring a bell.

28
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.330 
In fact, studies have shown that people
such as venture capitalists or students,

29
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.210 
think of an entrepreneur as a man or
someone with stereotypical male traits

30
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.600 
such as boldness, high risk
tolerance and aggressiveness.

31
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.740 
Research further shows that these
stereotypes pose a challenge

32
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.930 
for female entrepreneurs and those women
thinking about becoming an entrepreneur.

33
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.680 
In his book "The Unicorn's Shadow",
the management professor Ethan

34
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.240 
Mollick discusses this idea of the
so called start-up monomyth,

35
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.500 
meaning the persistent perception
that typical entrepreneurs

36
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.320 
are white and male. According to
Ethan Mollick, this monomyth

37
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.120 
bears the risk of developing into
a vicious never-ending cycle.

38
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.390 
Suppose venture capitalists, for
example, are biased by the idea

39
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.110 
that successful entrepreneurs must
portray stereotypical male traits.

40
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.740 
In that case entrepreneurs who do
not fulfill these expectations

41
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.970 
might not be funded. If female
entrepreneurs do not receive

42
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.590 
the necessary financial support,
it is difficult for them to

43
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.450 
follow up on their
business idea.

44
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.560 
And without successful female
entrepreneurs functioning as role models,

45
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.220 
research shows that other women
will be increasingly risk averse

46
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.290 
towards becoming an entrepreneur.
And the vicious cycle as

47
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.480 
described by Ethan Mollick
continues.

48
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.030 
We can find evidence for these assumptions
in entrepreneurship research.

49
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.630 
Studies show that it is more
difficult for female entrepreneurs

50
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.790 
to get funding
for start-ups.

51
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.270 
When they do, they tend to receive
less than male entrepreneurs.

52
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.430 
The emergence and implications
of gender biases have become

53
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.930 
a most popular research
stream within the field.

54
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
Overall, research surrounding female
entrepreneurship has been increasingly growing

55
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.280 
in the last
twenty years.

56
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.580 
Under the term gender gap, we
summarize the observation

57
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.980 
that women to date are under-represented
in the creation of new ventures.

58
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.070 
For example, in Germany, only about
15% of all entrepreneurs are female,

59
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.320 
according to the Female
Founders Monitor.

60
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.890 
Through female entrepreneurship
research, we aim to understand the

61
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.300 
underlying reasons
for that.

62
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.220 
So, we have already mentioned how
a gender bias in funding can

63
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.450 
lead to fewer women receiving
the necessary funds.

64
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.100 
We have also talked about how
stereotypical believes about

65
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.220 
how a successful entrepreneur should
look like, should act can decrease

66
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.450 
the chance of a woman choosing
to become an entrepreneur.

67
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.100 
What are other possible reasons for
the gender gap in entrepreneurship

68
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.170 
currently being
discussed in research?

69
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.680 
Another factor that influences
the gender gap cultural norms.

70
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.890 
Research shows that the
social-cultural background

71
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.700 
influences females' chances of
starting an own venture.

72
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.080 
A further impeding factor is the
issue of individual self-perception.

73
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.540 
Meaning, some women choose not to
become an entrepreneur because

74
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.290 
they believe that they don't have
the necessary entrepreneurial skills

75
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.100 
or lack those stereotypical male
attributes we mentioned earlier earlier.

76
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.280 
Another reason is the potential lack
of task specific skills such as

77
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.190 
digital knowledge or
financial literacy,

78
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.390 
which decrease the chances of
becoming an entrepreneur.

79
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.560 
For example, a written study
by Oggergo and colleagues

80
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.160 
shows that digital skills and
financial literacy and most relevant

81
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.670 
for chances of becoming
an entrepreneur,

82
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.580 
that these core skills are less
developed for female entrepreneurs,

83
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.960 
and that this can be addressed by dedicated
entrepreneurial education programs.

84
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.630 
For all these research areas, it
is crucial to consider the

85
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.970 
context when analyzing the gender
gap of entrepreneurial activities,

86
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.740 
which means that the gender gap
depends on the economic and

87
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.030 
regulatory structures
of a country.

88
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.110 
If you're curious about these
mentioned reasons and want to

89
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.210 
go more in-depth and learn about
the interdependencies of the

90
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.980 
factors and the gender gap, then
make sure to check out our

91
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.890 
linked studies
of this session.

92
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.410 
As a key take-away, we want you
to understand how relevant the

93
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.840 
findings from female entrepreneurship
are for the entrepreneurship

94
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.260 
research field as
such as a whole.

95
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.090 
Through research on biases, we can see that
entrepreneurship is, for example,

96
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.950 
a gender phenomenon and
not gender neutral.

97
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.090 
Female entrepreneurship - in fact,

98
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.990 
research on female entrepreneurship
shows us how powerful socially

99
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.250 
constructed gender-stereotypic
beliefs are, how powerful they

100
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.070 
are and how they impact
entrepreneurial activities.

101
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.050 
So we hope that this introductory
session gave you an impression

102
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.390 
on what female entrepreneurship
research is about and that

103
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.220 
you now understand how we can explain
the gender gap in entrepreneurship.

104
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.500 
Stay tuned for the session's upcoming
videos to learn even more about

105
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.350 
female
entrepreneurship!

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.780 
Welcome to today's lecture series
on Future of Computing - on

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.420 
the Road to Quantum. My name is
Marcus Lorch, I'm an architect

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.780 
with IBM, I've been here working
for the Germany Development

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.460 
Research Lab in BÃ¶blingen for
the last fifteen years and

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.500 
I will talk about edge
computing today.

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.390 
We define edge computing as
placing enterprise applications,

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.100 
placing workloads closer to where
the data is created, to where actions

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.150 
have to be taken

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.850 
and improving computing in a number
of ways with this approach.

10
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.050 
If you look at this diagram, you can
see that we're moving processing

11
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.030 
from the cloud or from the mainframe
or from the compute center

12
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.580 
to the edge and in this example,
you see we're talking about,

13
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.330 
or in this example especially talking
about IT sensors, IT scenarios

14
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.690 
and in today's life you know we
have sensors, we have compute

15
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.500 
in almost every device, starting from
your car to your mobile phone

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.940 
to your home. Even your coffee machine
has a computer inside today.

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.640 
So we have the ability now to
move processing out to this edge

18
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.700 
and this as a number of advantages
that I will talk or will

19
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.160 
explain to
you in this talk.

20
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.630 
Before I jump into edge computer
today I wanna take the title

21
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.440 
of this talk future of computing and
actually look at the past of computing.

22
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.800 
You're all aware of the Apollo
missions and the flight to the moon

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.160 
and this was a grea engineering
an achievement in human history

24
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.620 
and computing played
a huge part in this.

25
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.950 
You can even define this as a
very early form of edge computing.

26
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.820 
Why? Look at this. On the left hand
side you see the flight computer

27
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.610 
of the Apollo capsule. It's about sixty
pound thirty kilograms computer

28
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.880 
that was very novel. Putting all
of this compute power into such

29
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.700 
a light and small packaging at this
time it was a tremendous effort.

30
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.510 
It was built by IBM and basically
provided the compute power

31
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.180 
of an early calculator

32
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.740 
to the people in the capsule. That's all
they had and they, because of the latency

33
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and because of other, you know, just
transmission power and other constraints,

34
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.830 
power constraints they couldn't
afford more. Also weight and

35
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.140 
size constraints
of course.

36
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.950 
On the right hand side you see
IBM engineers working

37
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.240 
the back end, at this time it was
a IBM three sixty main frame

38
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.460 
that did all of the calculations
that would lead to a go no-go

39
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.350 
decision, weather
calculations and the like

40
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.870 
that helped the ground crew and of
course the people in the spacecraft

41
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.700 
to actually perform this flight
safely and return to home.

42
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.800 
Looking today, what do we have to
day? Everybody has a smartphone

43
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.280 
many of us actually have old
smartphones sitting around at home

44
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.870 
not being used anymore and even
an old smartphone is millions

45
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.830 
of times more powerful than
what they had in the Apollo 11

46
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.110 
guidance computer. And we don't
just have smartphones, you see

47
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.050 
the different devices, we have
wearables they have computers, you see a

48
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.490 
a little garment wristband here,
that thing uses your heart

49
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.230 
rate variability to determine if you're
stressed and gives you a stress index.

50
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.570 
Then you have smart watches, you have
a smart underwear in this case,

51
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.870 
on the right hand side you
see an underwear that

52
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.110 
also monitors your heart rate, it
does a full ECG, then you

53
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.160 
see a gas sensor and at the bottom
you see typical small gateways,

54
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.060 
you know them as Raspberry Pi
type computers that have huge

55
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.270 
processing power and you can
place them almost everywhere.

56
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.080 
One of the big issues

57
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.280 
on why we need to use this computer
at the edge is our speed limits.

58
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.280 
So I'm not talking about road
speed limits, I'm talking about

59
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.930 
the speed of light
speed limit.

60
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.660 
We cannot communicate fast enough
or we have a natural barrier,

61
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.120 
we cannot compete with
this. And if you're

62
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.910 
looking at how fast light travels
and then you know maybe from

63
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.660 
physics that once you put a light
signal into anything else

64
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.830 
in a vacuum, it slows down and the
same as for electromagnetic waves.

65
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.260 
So they have a speed limit and it depends
on how you communicate with them.

66
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.160 
When we're communicating from here to
the United States, to another continent

67
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.170 
it's tens of milliseconds and when
we have to communicate something

68
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.200 
and have the round-trip time of data
coming back, so we have an

69
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.000 
acknowledgment was received we
can now send the next package,

70
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.630 
we're doubling that latency.
And this is a big problem.

71
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.370 
Now when you're using
satellite communications,

72
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.240 
you're increasing the distance dramatically.
You see here thirty five kilometers,

73
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.690 
thirty five thousand kilometers above
the earth in a geostationary

74
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.890 
orbit is where satellites usually
are. So you have seventy thousand

75
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.430 
kilometers that you need to travel.
If you have a fibre-optic

76
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.730 
wire going to the United States
or going to another continent

77
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.970 
it's five thousand kilometres
maybe that it needs to travel.

78
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.870 
Now just to go one way you need to travel
seventy thousand kilometers. This is

79
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.170 
a killing argument against many
applications. It just takes too long.

80
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.100 
And then in addition to just a pure
latency, you have computers

81
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.940 
in between, you have routers,
bridges, switches, and each one

82
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.070 
adds a couple of milliseconds latency.
Some are very fast, some are slower,

83
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.770 
depends on how many layers. If you
had networking lectures

84
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.810 
you'll know about all of this.
And you also know about the bandwidth

85
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.160 
delay product. Just to
mention one more thing here, you

86
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.050 
can look it up but it basically
defines how much data I can

87
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.590 
send. When I need to get an acknowledgement
you can have a very fat

88
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.550 
pipe and you can starve this one
because you always waiting

89
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.110 
for acknowledgment. So you can
send a huge bucket, but then you

90
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.650 
need to wait, you can send a huge
bucket, then you need to wait

91
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.980 
or you can send many buckets but then
one package in between is missing

92
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.190 
and yeah if you're looking if
you are familiar with the TCP

93
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.750 
protocol and with all of the complications
of the bandwidth delay product,

94
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.130 
if not here is a
link where you can

95
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.480 
look it up and read more on
these networking. So the speed

96
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.850 
is an issue and the further away
you are, the bigger the issue

97
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.240 
is, depends on which type of
application you have, video streaming

98
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.370 
where you can buffer and lag a
couple seconds behind,

99
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.010 
maybe not, but when you
need to take actions

100
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.370 
this becomes an issue because you
don't want to wait for sending

101
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.630 
a full video stream to the cloud,
it being analyzed and then the

102
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.730 
response coming back.

103
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.910 
Now let me give you
a couple of use cases

104
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.830 
that drive the edge computing. I
just mentioned video analytics.

105
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.800 
We can use cameras to monitor if people
are wearing the protective equipment

106
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.870 
or to detect dangerous situation,
to detect people in areas

107
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.290 
where they shouldn't be or machines in a
state that it shouldn't be. For example

108
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.860 
assume an open pit
mining in the blast area.

109
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.340 
So the blast area needs to be
monitored so nobody enters it when

110
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.920 
they are about to
blow it all up.

111
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.870 
We can also use it for other
purposes of facial recognition,

112
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.460 
license plate recognition, to
automatically bill a car for the

113
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.510 
fees that you have to
pay for using

114
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.760 
a specific road. Then in industrial
environments, also safety aspects but

115
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.820 
also quality checks. So with
cameras you can check the output

116
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.900 
of a welding robot you can check
if a robot that for example

117
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.510 
applied some sealant and if it made

118
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.420 
a mistake and a sealant is missing
a specific part or if a robot

119
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.150 
that painted something if it made, you
know, if the outcome is not acceptable.

120
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.560 
So all of this is what we call visual
inspection automated by cameras.

121
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.060 
And if you think about how fair some
of these robots produce things,

122
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.720 
or how quickly

123
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.460 
problems need to be determined
and some sorting machines for

124
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.920 
example, what they do, they
have a very fast flow of

125
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.830 
material coming by and
they need to sort

126
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.610 
and determine some specific
properties and this is all

127
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.450 
while the whole material is
flowing by very quickly. And then

128
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.930 
they use pressurized air to
determine this one goes in

129
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.050 
that bin and that one goes in the
left bin, this is good, this is bad.

130
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.730 
So all of this cannot be sent
or cloud, it cannot even be

131
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.150 
sent to a data centre, remote data
centre. It needs to be calculated

132
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.700 
on the edge
directly there

133
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.700 
and it is possible today.
we have the power, we can

134
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.420 
distribute the
compute power

135
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.660 
and this is why the whole industry
is also moving in this direction.

136
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.840 
It has some problems which I
will talk about in little bit.

137
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.190 
And we need to put things in place
for the management of all of this,

138
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.000 
because the more computers you
have the more moving pieces

139
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.190 
you have, the more complex a
system is and without automated

140
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.900 
management it becomes
problematic.

141
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.560 
The other two areas that I have
on this slide and they are

142
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:47.750 
not all, there many many more, automotive,
I talked about this one before.

143
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.340 
If many computers in the cars the
cars do even self driving

144
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.920 
calculations, they also use video
analytics, they use other sensors,

145
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.870 
light hour sensors to judge
distances and so forth.

146
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.020 
And all of this comes together
to enable elf driving, which

147
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.050 
is the latest revolution in the
mobile transport. But also car

148
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.890 
to car communication. Some people don't know,
but cars are actually already possible

149
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.210 
from usually from one manufacturer
to talk to each other. So

150
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.640 
if a car that is ahead of you in the
road, maybe half a kilometre ahead

151
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.270 
he detects a slippery road because
it's ABS system had to work

152
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.270 
or ASR system detected that
there was a slippery condition,

153
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.580 
it notifies all of the other
cars behind itself, so your car

154
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.510 
will tell you and slow down, make
a suggestion before you even

155
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.100 
reach a spot that
is dangerous.

156
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.230 
An energy utility is like
many other machinery,

157
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.480 
the wind turbines here for example,
they are out there operating

158
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.650 
twenty-four seven, they have huge
bearings that need to be monitored,

159
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.300 
degrees needs to be monitored, they
usually have an uplink but they do

160
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.730 
local computation and when they
detect vibrations that are

161
00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.930 
outside of the norm only then will they
notify basically the back end system,

162
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.160 
because the communication over
mobile networks is expensive

163
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.880 
and you want to minimize that. But also
because in the centralised system

164
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.420 
where you monitor
all of these

165
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.720 
wind turbines, in this case, you
don't want to get all kinds of

166
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.750 
information. You only want to
get the information it's very

167
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.690 
relevant. When there is
something that causes you

168
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.200 
to take action, that requires
action to be taken.

169
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.630 
I've already
mentioned this.

170
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.220 
Indirectly here are a summary of the
five huge benefits of edge computing.

171
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:42.070 
The first is the sensibility.
You can place a technology

172
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.290 
where it's most useful, it is most
sensible, where you're closest

173
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:52.090 
and that's also the faster. You can do
instant analytics and with low latency

174
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.620 
and because of
this also provide

175
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.220 
the grounds for
instant actions.

176
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.660 
Sometimes it's dangerous.
You have analytics of

177
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:06.310 
machinery or cars approaching
each other, scenarios

178
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.780 
again open pit mining, you have huge trucks
and little pickups driving around

179
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.850 
and there's a huge truck approaching
behind you. The truck

180
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.160 
driver of that big dump truck
doesn't see a small pickup. It's

181
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.150 
just way too small, is
way too far down.

182
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.120 
So analytics in both cars is
detecting that and it's warning

183
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.240 
the drivers that there's another vehicle
around, there is dangerous machinery around.

184
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.690 
And latency because these are driving at
maybe twenty, thirty kilometers an hour,

185
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.320 
latency is an issue. You cannot wait for
this. This needs to be computed locally.

186
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.110 
Another big factor
is availability.

187
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.210 
So sometimes you have connection
issues for whatever reason.

188
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.320 
It's a mobile connection and network is
down, DSL connection is down or whatever

189
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.110 
the reason is, or it's just a computer down,
the backend system is not available

190
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.890 
but this localized system
needs to continue to operate.

191
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.470 
So that's why when the
analytics runs locally,

192
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.870 
you can continue
to provide

193
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.810 
the service that is required,
for example, to ensure safety.

194
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.810 
Then load is
also an issue.

195
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.620 
By reducing network bandwidth,
by operating at the edge you

196
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.820 
make the whole system more efficient.
Network bandwidth is huge

197
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.490 
today but it's not infinite and it costs
money. Not just money, it costs energy.

198
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.060 
Think about all of the switches
and hubs and network components

199
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.770 
that are needed to transmit
energy, to transmit data

200
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.430 
and so forth and reducing network
bandwidth is always a good thing.

201
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.330 
And finally you have data security
and privacy concerns that

202
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.900 
you can address with
edge computing.

203
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.330 
For example I mentioned earlier
we're doing video analytics. We can,

204
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.780 
for example, use a camera to count
how many people are in a room

205
00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.260 
how many entered, how many are currently
in the room, how many left the room.

206
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.640 
But what we don't want is these
video camera pictures to be

207
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.690 
stored somewhere in the cloud and
may be used for other purposes.

208
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.030 
With edge computing we can place the
analytics directly into the camera.

209
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.580 
No video ever leaves the camera.
It's a video sensor,

210
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.210 
it basically generates a picture,
the pictures are analyzed and only

211
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.870 
numeric data for example leaves
the camera. The same goes for

212
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.060 
infrared cameras. We're
using this today

213
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.620 
in the COVID scenarios to detect
if people are running a fever.

214
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.430 
They are actually measuring the
temperature of a tear drop

215
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.330 
in your eyes. So the camera takes
a picture of your eye, locates

216
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.000 
the hottest spot which is
usually the liquid in your eye

217
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.470 
and sees if you have an elevated
body temperature. It's as close

218
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:49.180 
as we can get to a body temperature,
basically it's your eye temperature.

219
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.780 
Everything else would be invasive
and not so accepted. So, but

220
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.820 
at the same time while we want
to measure the temperature, we

221
00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.810 
don't want to take the
picture of that person.

222
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:08.850 
I mentioned earlier that in order to
manage all of these edge devices, we need

223
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.900 
a management infrastructure. It's
just too much. You cannot go

224
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:17.370 
out and install a static software
on an edge device and expect

225
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.990 
that to run there forever with the
same configuration. There's also

226
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.390 
too many devices to
manage them manually.

227
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.970 
So what we need is an edge device
and application management.

228
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.630 
And in addition what is needed is what
we call continuous orchestration.

229
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.110 
That means you need to be able or the
system needs to be able to automatically

230
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.960 
provide solution updates
out to the edge.

231
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.860 
So the edges have to be defined
with some parameters on what

232
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.010 
they are supposed to do what
type of edge note this is

233
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.660 
and then the central cloud or
the management system needs to

234
00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.490 
be able to push workloads and update these
workloads and also to fix problems.

235
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.770 
If you have coded, you know yourself
there is always an issue

236
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.130 
that you didn't think of, always
a situation you didn't think

237
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.650 
of, we need to be able to do updates.
We need to be able to do security

238
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.360 
updates to the edge, we need to
be able to do logic updates

239
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:19.150 
and also if you're using artificial
intelligence, if you're having models that

240
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.940 
the system needs to score against
these models need to be updated,

241
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.490 
not just the code
and logic.

242
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.340 
So for all of this, you
need a management system

243
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.740 
and ideally an
architecture that can

244
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.120 
change, that can be modified. Here
is architectural revolution.

245
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.260 
So it can be adaptive to new
workloads as they come out, you

246
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.840 
don't want to be stuck with a ten
thousand devices edge infrastructure

247
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.410 
and have a workload
and cannot

248
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.100 
cannot perform
this workload.

249
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.800 
This is where I want to mention and
give you an overview of

250
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:03.520 
Open Horizon. Open horizon is a project,
an edge management project solution

251
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.440 
that was coded by IBM, original
code-named Blue Horizon. It is

252
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.490 
available from IBM as IBM
edge application manager

253
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.130 
but is also open source.

254
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.670 
It's a linux foundation edge
group which I have at the end

255
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.460 
of this talk, you have a number
of references. So you can go

256
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.390 
and look at it.

257
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.210 
This application
manager

258
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.150 
or management system basically
consists of two components.

259
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.550 
On the left hand side you see one
edge note, could be ten thousand

260
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.370 
and on this edge node we have
an agent running that manages

261
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.720 
the edge node and manages
the workload and edge node.

262
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.240 
And this agent communicates with an edge
management hub in the cloud for example.

263
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:53.250 
And in this edge management you see
four areas. It basically has a switchboard,

264
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.790 
where edge nodes and management
hub can communicate with each

265
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.530 
other, also peer-to-peer communication
between edge nodes is

266
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.350 
possible. So they can negotiate
things. It has an exchange which

267
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.520 
is sort of a directory for
all services available

268
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.410 
and also for all the policies.
I'll talk about the policies

269
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:16.070 
in a little bit. So all of the rules and
guidelines on how workload should

270
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.350 
be provisioned to edge nodes
and to which edge nodes.

271
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.220 
And there are more components, so
for example bottom right you see the

272
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.360 
model management.
So when you are

273
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.310 
having artificial intelligence and
you're scoring against the model,

274
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.070 
then these models need to be
communicated to the edge node,

275
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.980 
need to be updated and models are expensive
to update because they are larger.

276
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.410 
They are several hundred megabytes
usually and so you don't

277
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.100 
want to frequently
copy them around.

278
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:54.890 
And then you have the agreement
bot which is basically

279
00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.970 
the tool that

280
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.590 
figures out on which edge node you
need to run which workload. It's

281
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.340 
coming to an agreement
based on policies and on

282
00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.840 
properties that an edge
node has. So for example

283
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.830 
an edge node can come up, say I
am a standard edge node but I have

284
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.850 
a GPU, so I can also do graphics-processing.
So these are my properties.

285
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.780 
And then there is a deployment
policy that says, okay when it's

286
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.220 
an edge node with at least two
gigabytes of RAM, has a GPU,

287
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.690 
is available, has a CPU load of
less than whatever percent,

288
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.870 
has this type of
architecture,

289
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.630 
then please provision this video
analytics component to the edge node.

290
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.880 
Also what the edge
notes do or the

291
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:47.140 
edges do with the agreement
bot in collaboration,

292
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.480 
they determine which version
of workload should need to be

293
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.860 
deployed. So they always,

294
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.210 
it can be defined by usually
always try to deploy the latest

295
00:19:55.210 --> 00:20:00.800 
version of a workload but if this one
fails, if the workload has an error

296
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:05.320 
then the system automatically goes back and
takes an older workload and sees if it can

297
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.600 
can make that
old workload run.

298
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.920 
And what the system also does is
ensures that workload continues

299
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.270 
running even if the communication
to the cloud is interrupted

300
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.310 
or not available.

301
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.060 
I want to go into an example. I told
you earlier I am an architect for

302
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.880 
IBM. I work on a product called
IBM Maximo Worker Insights.

303
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.550 
This product tries to provide
or provides workplace safety

304
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.150 
in companies and production environments,
in industrial environments.

305
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:46.470 
So what it does is it helps a safety officer
to see where in his company where

306
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.020 
in his buildings they have safety
issues or potential safety issues.

307
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.510 
And the goal is to prevent
accidents, one of the big goals.

308
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.080 
So for example by seeing in this
area I always have people that are

309
00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.150 
what we call a near miss. There are
nearly falling from the movement that

310
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.630 
we could track with wearables or
in this area, or in this machine

311
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.430 
I've people that always at 4 o'clock in
the afternoon they get too tired to operate

312
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.260 
dangerous machinery. The
accident risk is too high.

313
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:21.660 
This is type of information that such a
safety officer gets through the system

314
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.860 
and can act.

315
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:32.050 
One of today's topics is everything
around COVID, returning to work,

316
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:37.270 
ensuring people are having the social
distance, staying apart from each other

317
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:42.150 
and if somebody has been found
to be sick, tracing back - who has

318
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.700 
been in contact with the person, who needs
to be tested or put into quarantine

319
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.330 
so the infection
doesn't spread.

320
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.010 
What you see in this
as examples top left

321
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:57.280 
are badges that can be worn by employees
or can be attached to equipment

322
00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.250 
and what dispatches do is
use location anchors to

323
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.470 
using bluetooth technology
determine where they are within

324
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.960 
a building. So for example
you have one anchor

325
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.080 
in each meeting room. When
you enter a meeting room

326
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.560 
the anchor would know right now
I see three employees

327
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.360 
in this meeting room, I see five and
then you can do an occupancy planning.

328
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.840 
But also what these badges do is
they determine if you're close

329
00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.530 
or how close you are
to a colleague

330
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.370 
and when you're too close to a colleague
they give up a sounding alert

331
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.530 
and they send this information over
radio frequency transmission

332
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.120 
to a gateway. This is in the middle.
It's in this case it's using

333
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.760 
the LoRa protocol. It's a
long-range communication in the

334
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.480 
ISM band, eight hundred
megahertz can reach kilometres

335
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.780 
and outdoors and also very far, much
further than wi-fi or bluetooth

336
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.550 
in indoor scenarios. It's lower
frequency, so lower bandwidth.

337
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.210 
But we don't need to send so much.
Why don't we need to send so much?

338
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.990 
Because the badges are already
doing some pre-computation.

339
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.720 
Now they're sending this information
to the gateway, and the gateway

340
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.950 
or we call here the edge gateway,
the lower edge gateway does the

341
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.850 
second level of computation. It's
running what we call edge shields.

342
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.870 
These shields are
customizable

343
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.260 
pieces of industry analytics that
can be put out on the edge

344
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.140 
and they determine what to be done, what
is to be done with the sensor data.

345
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.630 
So for example a centre he says
I am too close to Marcus,

346
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.550 
it reports that and it reports
five minutes later, it reports

347
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.990 
I'm still too close to Marcus, and
ten minutes later it reports

348
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.220 
I'm still too close to Marcus. And now
a very simple rule could run, it says ok

349
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.230 
these two people have been very close for
fifteen minutes. I'm gonna flag this.

350
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.750 
They are, if one of them is found later
is found infected I'm gonna flag this.

351
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.420 
Or the location anchors there are
reporting I have three people

352
00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.820 
in the room, I have ten people in
the room. Now the very simple

353
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.530 
edge analytics says ok for
this room they are currently

354
00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:05.260 
in the occupancy limit, is at
seven. So once we breach seven,

355
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.180 
I'm going to report it.

356
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.480 
Now these are very simple examples.
If you look at, for example,

357
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.160 
vibration monitoring,
noise monitoring,

358
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:20.270 
then you have a certain allowance
per day that you can be exposed

359
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.980 
to noise at a certain level
without having to fear that your

360
00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.360 
health is going
to be impacted.

361
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.180 
So the edge gateway analytics
would sort of take a summary

362
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.500 
of how much exposure you had
during the day and at some point

363
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.620 
says okay now it's enough. It's gonna
warn you and is going to mark it.

364
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.610 
In this area of our building we
keep having people that are

365
00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.880 
exposed to too much noise for too
long. Now the safety officer

366
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.150 
needs to take action. Now they
can change, they can impose you

367
00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:51.800 
have to wear hearing protection,
they can raise additional walls.

368
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.160 
Same with occupancy. They can route
people differently, too many people

369
00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.350 
in too small a space, they can
increase ventilation and so forth.

370
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.760 
So this is the feedback
to this safety officers

371
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:09.200 
so they can improve the workplace and
in some cases also prevent accidents.

372
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.060 
For example I've shown you earlier
sensors that detects gases.

373
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:18.340 
The one that was on the picture
detects four different gases

374
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.290 
and when people are entering in,
utility workers are entering for

375
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.780 
example a waste
treatment plant,

376
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.140 
that sensor might go off because
there might be gases in there.

377
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.490 
So he sensor warns them locally
but also over the edge gateway

378
00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.370 
tells the cloud basically that it
detected something. The edge gateway

379
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.780 
runs analytics that
okay, this is important

380
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.850 
to communicate
to the cloud

381
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.780 
and on the cloud people see
that in this part of our

382
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:49.010 
production plan refinery, we keep
having issues with this type

383
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.030 
of gas. So we need to do something.
Well, it could be a slow gas

384
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.500 
leak, it's not dangerous right now,
but if this keeps building up,

385
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.900 
right, the edge analytics can also
do projections. So, okay of today

386
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.710 
I have detected gas leaks , you know,
and they keep building up. So three

387
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.100 
hours from now, it's going to
be an explosive atmosphere.

388
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.130 
So I want to prevent it by alerting now.
I don't want to wait until I have

389
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.450 
reached a threshold. So much
for the use case scenario. Now

390
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.970 
let's look at the workload on
the edge gateway. You see that

391
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.540 
in the middle the workloads
are docker containers.

392
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:29.170 
They're being moved to the edge gateway
based on the agreements

393
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.940 
by this agreement bot,

394
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.470 
by determining policies
and properties

395
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:40.480 
and this can be rearranged,
it can be updated, basically

396
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.460 
automatically also. It
completely runs autonomous.

397
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:49.100 
We as a product or solution
providers never have to access

398
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.570 
these gateways and that's a very
important fact. We could have

399
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.390 
hundreds or thousands of these
gateways for single customers

400
00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.250 
there's nobody that can go out
and maintain these gateways.

401
00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.150 
So we need to be remotely able
to maintain the gateways. Now

402
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.660 
the very important fact is you
cannot reach these gateways

403
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.720 
by tunneling into them, because
they are sometimes behind the

404
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.990 
firewall. They are using network
address translation,

405
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.280 
they might have a mobile connection
where it's not allowed

406
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.980 
to tunnel in, they might not
even have a public IP address.

407
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.600 
So all of this requires that
the gateway and the agent

408
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.910 
That's running on the gateway
is able to communicate with

409
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.000 
the cloud and basically
download its workload.

410
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.170 
I've mentioned many of these
properties just here as a summary.

411
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.950 
In worker insights edge processing
has huge advantages. For

412
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.250 
example, because we can with edge
processing monitor huge or

413
00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:49.020 
very large frequencies on sensor
readings. When we are monitoring

414
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.700 
heart rate frequencies, its like
one Hertz is good to monitor.

415
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.900 
When you monitor movement patterns
of people you need to monitor

416
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.000 
at least ten Hertz and if you
monitor for noise exposure,

417
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.050 
you need to monitor
at a hundred fifty Hertz

418
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.150 
to capture the
needed frequencies.

419
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.880 
Many of the other properties
here I have already explained,

420
00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.310 
we can put machine learning on the
edge and then create a personal

421
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.910 
model for each person. So for example if
your edge device is your mobile phone,

422
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:25.860 
the mobile phone
continuously tunes itself to

423
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.490 
your heart rate variability and
with this, for example, you can

424
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.490 
detect when you're fatigued or
even when your body temperature

425
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:37.510 
is higher than usually when you're in danger
of a heat stroke. Many very interesting

426
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:43.740 
research there, you can do a lot, derive
a lot from heart rate variability.

427
00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.320 
Look it up if
you're interested.

428
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:52.370 
Video analytics, we talked about. This
is of course a data volume issue.

429
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.570 
When we process at
the edge, we can

430
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.890 
we can reduce the data volume and
we can react much faster

431
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.840 
and when we're looking at environmental
monitoring or location detection.

432
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.620 
By doing this at the edge, for
example doing at the edge of

433
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.130 
trilateration triangulation between
different signals to determine the location

434
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.980 
we are offloading a lot of this
processing and can be much

435
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.340 
faster. I gave you the example of
two cars approaching each other

436
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.130 
at a significant speed. So you
have to be fast in making a

437
00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.900 
decision there.

438
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.710 
We come to the end of this lecture
on edge computing. I hope

439
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.760 
you enjoyed it. I wanna show
you a little piece of

440
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.590 
a video that shows how video analytics
is used to do the social distancing.

441
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.170 
When you look at this video now, you
see how the computer determines

442
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:45.920 
distance between different people
and determines which two

443
00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.760 
are too close to each other, would
mark them. It would not identify

444
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.920 
the people. We don't do
facial recognition

445
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.590 
but what we do is, we are telling
the safety officer in this

446
00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.720 
case that in this space he has
people who are too close together.

447
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.570 
In another scenario that you see
here, people could enter a room

448
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.790 
that is called a no-go zone. So we
need to alert that somebody is

449
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.810 
in an area they couldn't be. I
gave you the example of a blast.

450
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.220 
So on here it's a closet room
that shouldn't be opened.

451
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:23.660 
You have to link on the slide
so I welcome you to go to the

452
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:28.270 
youtube website and look
at the complete video.

453
00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.000 
And on coming to the end of this
presentation, on my last slide here

454
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:38.830 
I've put together a few resources.
I talk to talked about Open

455
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.290 
Horizon and the Linux
Foundation Edge project.

456
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:45.210 
I even give you a link directly
to the GitHub so you can look at

457
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.020 
the code, look at examples, play
with it if you're interested

458
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:53.970 
and there are more details about,
there's for example our fellow

459
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.540 
talking about what is edge
computing here in a little

460
00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.840 
video that I
have referenced.

461
00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.630 
And finally I also gave you a
link to IBM worker insights

462
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.980 
and IBM video analytics.
If you're interested,

463
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.450 
take a look or contact
me directly. To sum up,

464
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.870 
edge computing brings communication
closer to where data is

465
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.900 
created and actions are being
taken. I think that's the key point

466
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.920 
you need to take away. I hope
you enjoyed his lecture. I'm

467
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.550 
looking forward to lecturing to you
again sometime in the future. Goodbye.

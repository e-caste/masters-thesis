00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.160 
There are many aspects to consider when building effective entrepreneurial teams,

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.289 
one of the most frequently discussed questions is how to recompose teams

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.310 
and more specifically, how diverse should open teams be?

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.579 
Research on teams consistently points out the importance of compositional

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.659 
differences across team members.

6
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.910 
That is team diversity.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.239 
In this video, we will address key facets of team diversity research

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.009 
and highlight insights from our partnership studies, in particular, to learn more

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.970 
about the influence of diversity, entrepreneurial teamwork.

10
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.969 
Welcome to this video where Nina and I discussed the topic, Team

11
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.175 
Niversity. So let's start by getting specific

12
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.210 
about what diversity in teams actually refers to.

13
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.659 
Team diversity is frequently thought of in terms of variety, meaning the

14
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.339 
differences of any given characteristic across team members that reflect

15
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.810 
unique sources of information.

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.209 
But what kind of characteristics are we talking about?

17
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.715 
Team researchers have come to use at least three differentiating categories

18
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
of categories of diversities.

19
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.829 
First, a common distinction is made between observable so-called

20
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.819 
surface level diversities, such as demographic attributes, as

21
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.069 
well as less observable so-called deep level perversities, which

22
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.309 
involve personal attitudes, beliefs or values.

23
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.111 
While both surface and deep level attitudes have been found to impact

24
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.480 
team processes and outcomes available, empirical findings are often mixed

25
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.769 
and depend heavily on contextual factors.

26
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.969 
Still, a consistent approach inside is that deep level attributes

27
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.719 
such as the diversity of expert knowledge play a stronger and more long

28
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.670 
lasting role for team effectiveness in comparison to surface level attributes.

29
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.708 
However, you probably remember that we emphasize in an earlier video the

30
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.259 
distribution of equity at an important defining feature of optional

31
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.593 
teams. The difference in ownership qualifies as

32
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.830 
a form of surface level diversity because it concerns accessible information.

33
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.559 
Therefore, this is a good example of why it is crucial to look at team diversity

34
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.449 
in very specific terms.

35
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.894 
And second, a further distinction can be made based on whether a team member

36
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.517 
characteristics change, meaning other rather stable traits such

37
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.949 
as one's personality or characteristics so-called status that

38
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.300 
shift over time, such as team members decision preferences or moods.

39
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.289 
This view, however, implies that it is crucial to look at the interplay of diversities

40
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.739 
over time, the so-called micro dynamics, while this appears

41
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.399 
as an intuitive statement, of course, differences of any changeable attributes

42
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.540 
and a team will evolve over time.

43
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.140 
It is quite challenging to study this and field settings and therefore empirical

44
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.599 
evidence for the dynamics of team diversity.

45
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.379 
For instance, Stevens and his colleagues looked at Swedish and teams

46
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.599 
and found while differences in team members startup experience and

47
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.949 
age did not relate to the short term performance of entrepreneurial teams

48
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.639 
and the long term, a significant influence can be confirmed.

49
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.022 
And third, it is also important to take into account the perceptions

50
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.720 
of diversity, besides what can be objectively observed to

51
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.219 
organizational research of Mayor Stemler and his colleagues, define perceive

52
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.779 
diversity as the degree to which members are aware

53
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.720 
of one another's differences.

54
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.610 
This perspective can help to explain how feelings of dissimilarity

55
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.809 
influence teamwork and how subgroups are being formed.

56
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.699 
Research on teens often described the role of diversity in teams

57
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.569 
as a double edged sword.

58
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.559 
On the one end, the university has been frequently found to improve team processes

59
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.220 
as well as team outcomes such as creativity or innovation.

60
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.290 
On the other hand, not being mindful about high levels, diversity

61
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.679 
can also lead to conflict and eventually harm team performance.

62
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.309 
You may recall our video on the ABC is often put on mindset

63
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.921 
and importance of effect and motion to disregard.

64
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.140 
Dimel and her colleagues conducted a study of 107 new Wenche

65
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.850 
teams that take part in a high technology accelerator program.

66
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.790 
You also studied adversity of passion among team members

67
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.620 
and how this diversity influences the quality of the business idea

68
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.579 
and the financial success of the Wenche.

69
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.779 
Five years after the program, few of us found a negative

70
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.339 
relationship of these outcomes with the diversity of our passion

71
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.600 
regarding its intensity, how passionate team members are,

72
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.129 
as well as its focus about what members are passionate about.

73
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.290 
In short, the more members we try and passionate about our partnership,

74
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.970 
the less the quality of the business idea and later financial success.

75
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.339 
These results both highlight the impact of unburnable passion on team

76
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.869 
effectiveness, as well as the complex nature of diversity in

77
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.040 
entrepreneurial teams

78
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.649 
and view the differentiation of diversities into categories and types

79
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.541 
enables us to understand the influence on teamwork, effectiveness and

80
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.540 
the complexity of this relationship.

81
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.812 
Above and beyond, and to conclude our remarks on diversity and entrepreneurial

82
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.746 
teams, it should go without saying that increasing the levels of

83
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.059 
diversity is paramount in our pursuit of improving equality and inclusion

84
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.294 
at work. In the following session video, we will focus on the role

85
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.779 
of gender as an exemplary attribute of diversity in teams

86
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.019 
and certainly as a pressing issue for entrepreneurship.

87
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.590 
For now, we would like to thank you for your attention and hope to see

88
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.350 
you again in the next video. Until then, bye bye.

1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.760 
okay. so good morning everyone and welcome to this session

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.020 
about a perspective from Oceania.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.250 
and in this session we are going to have four interesting

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.230 
presentations, very interesting works.

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:32.480 
and the first one i think in a young kun zhao
is going to present the first

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.960 
paper which is entitled a student barriers to active learning

7
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.190 
in synchronous online classe,

8
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.640 
a characterization reflections and suggestions.

9
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.420 
hello, everyone i think

10
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.520 
it's here. so here will be the present.

11
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.520 
okay, so yeah i can see Reza now.

12
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.960 
ok, so thank you. so then

13
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.380 
i think this is going to present this work.

14
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
hello everyone, ok sorry actually, i'm contacting from iran and we

15
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.640 
have some vpn problems without the vpn i cannot actually contact zoom.

16
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.540 
sorry actually i apologize.

17
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.690 
but yeah. it's okay, it's just in time now. ok, it's great great.

18
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.410 
so let me actually without further ado go to our representation.

19
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.930 
so hello my name is Reza Hadi, and i'm a phd student at

20
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.130 
hong kong university of science and technology.

21
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:49.090 
today i will present you our sari.

22
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.320 
do you have my screen?

23
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
yes we can see you scream out, ok. sorry yeah actually today.

24
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.570 
i will present you our latest work about students barriers

25
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.140 
to active learning in synchronous online classes.

26
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.360 
ok, this work has been conducted with my co-authors Mr. Jo,

27
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.770 
Mr.Haq, doctor Hu and doctor Ma over the past decade online

28
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.170 
education has rapidly expanded in popularity and very recently

29
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.770 
due covid-19 pandemic many university instructors have

30
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.470 
shifted their classes online at this point many of us can more

31
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.450 
or less agree that online education is the way is the way forward

32
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.550 
in a broad categorization online education can
be divided into two different categories.

33
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.110 
it can be either synchronous or asynchronous just

34
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.480 
as a quick refresh or synchronous learning happens when teachers

35
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.710 
and students interact with each other at the same time in real time

36
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.950 
something similar to what we experience in zoom meetings like we have now.

37
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.990 
and asynchronous learning is exactly the opposite and we do

38
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.190 
not have that essence of real time interaction.

39
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.710 
for example, you can think about the familiar example of book platforms.

40
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.990 
in this dichotomy synchronous learning has not received adequate

41
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.900 
attention in the literature until the

42
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.230 
emerging of covid-19 at that kind of makes sense.

43
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.920 
because before the pandemic only less than ten percent of academic lectures

44
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.830 
were delivered synchronously online yet some recent global

45
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.510 
scale surveys show that this number has soared up to eighty percent

46
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.890 
to even hundred percent of online classes today.

47
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.660 
therefore research about synchronous

48
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.100 
learning seems to be needing a little bit more attention at this time,

49
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.740 
and our work here is focused on synchronous learning.

50
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.090 
ok synchronous learning can be also offered with different

51
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.630 
types of pedagogies or teaching styles.

52
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.130 
for example it can it could be either passive learning or active learning.

53
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.260 
impassive learning is students are expected to assimilate information

54
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.920 
only through listening to an instructor or watching lectures.

55
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.180 
passive learning often takes the form of memorization or rote learning.

56
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.760 
however, this is sadly not very productive.

57
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.440 
in active learning on the other hand students participate in

58
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.720 
the process of learning by doing educational activities and

59
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.930 
thinking about what they do. in fact they try to own their

60
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.860 
knowledge through a hands-on a minds an approach. this can

61
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.160 
take the form of games projects a group discussions and etcetera.

62
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.970 
the advantages of active learning include increased duration

63
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.030 
of attention retention in classes better critical thinking

64
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.890 
and improved inter-personal skills and fewer course failures.

65
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.270 
because of all of these benefits and its importance. our work

66
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.910 
here is focused on studying active learning in synchronous online classes.

67
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.790 
in this research we answer three research questions.

68
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.420 
first what are the barriers students are actually sensing or feeling

69
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.210 
in synchronous online classes what do expert active learning educators

70
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.910 
think about these barriers,
and finally how can such list of barriers empower

71
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.480 
novice educators novice active learning educators who want

72
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.000 
to teach synchronously online.

73
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.710 
accordingly we conduct three qualitative studies
with hong kong-based academia

74
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.370 
to answer each of our research questions.

75
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.880 
in a study one we explore students perceptions
of the existing barriers to active

76
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.190 
learning in synchronous online classes. we use a variety of

77
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.160 
sources for our analysis social media content analyzes semi-structured

78
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.150 
interviews with thirty two hong kong-based international students.

79
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.560 
and even collecting some follow-up surveys from over actually interviewees.

80
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.410 
in a study two we triangulate our previous findings by asking

81
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.940 
expert active learning educators to let us know what they think

82
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.570 
about the student barriers found in study one. a side note is

83
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.010 
that over experts teaching experience in active learning styles

84
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.560 
range from six to twenty five years. so they really are actually experts in

85
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.050 
actually this sort of education.

86
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.160 
and finally study three uses a summative study with twelve

87
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.260 
novice educators all with less than four years of experience in teaching

88
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.330 
with the active learning style to show how they can benefit

89
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.050 
from our barrier list for planning their active online classes.

90
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.850 
here i want to refer you to our paper for checking out more

91
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.290 
meticulous details about each phase of our study.

92
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.160 
so as to mattick actually careful thematic analysis we build

93
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.270 
a detailed reference for understanding student barriers to

94
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.560 
active learning in synchronous online classes. all in all we

95
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.850 
find twenty eight granular barriers within the general themes of human site

96
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.270 
technological and environmental barriers.

97
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.420 
again more details about each code and sub
code are available in our paper.

98
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.680 
but what are the main problems.
there six and here i want to review them quickly

99
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.090 
first as think focus is still the biggest challenge for students

100
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.410 
in active online classes.

101
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.240 
the main reasons we here include facebook online games chat

102
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.860 
environments youtube and etc.

103
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.530 
the typical online learning excuses can also cover for students,
for example,

104
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.120 
if they do not respond to a question. oh sorry my network was down,

105
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.300 
my microphone didn't work. i couldn't type it on time,

106
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.060 
or you were breaking up my pc shut down and many other examples

107
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.910 
like these we all know. actually i am also

108
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.990 
accused of actually these excuses second incentives for online

109
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.120 
active learning might be insufficient and unfair in face to face classes

110
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.620 
we had atmosphere social environment and actually many other things

111
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.250 
related to the people influencing our students to motivate

112
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.660 
them for participating in activities. but the sad truth for

113
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.580 
now is that most of these atmosphere social and environmental

114
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.460 
features are gone or contorted, if not distorted.

115
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.110 
some students do not even see their peer classmates until the

116
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.520 
end of the semester. and then we have despite think that we

117
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.040 
try to cover for these lacs by bonus points, but how what happens

118
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.100 
to the students' interest intrinsic motivation
and would our evaluations be fair.

119
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.360 
these are all questions that demand further contemplation.

120
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.520 
third students cannot get timely help from their teacher.

121
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.930 
just think about the break-out rooms in zoom. it feels like getting

122
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.030 
trapped in an isolated room without teacher. some students complain

123
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.890 
for example that they cannot raise their hand as easily to

124
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.320 
ask a question from their teachers when it's needed.

125
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.320 
fourth the communication efficiency of group work in an online

126
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.320 
setting is lower than face to face.
and it's mostly because of the actually

127
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.340 
back channels limitations in this type of education,

128
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.530 
for example you cannot really see what people are actually
feeling how they actually

129
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:42.280 
respond back with small phrases like aha, i got it, or maybe

130
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.950 
nodding their head or things like that these are very important

131
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.290 
for actually this type of communication. and active learning

132
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.850 
could be even more time consuming online many of actually over

133
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.680 
expert educators were saying that it really takes time to actually

134
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.590 
instruct the students have to set up things for the first time

135
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.480 
when they are actually in this type of education.

136
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.730 
are finally active online classes are sometimes
more prone to be inequitable.

137
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:12.240 
so not all of the students have the condition eventually to

138
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.390 
for example have the equipments, the proper network or

139
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.780 
maybe the room the environment they need at home to be able

140
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.210 
to actually participate in such activities and that might cause

141
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.180 
some unfairness that should be considered by teachers.

142
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.250 
ok, but how can our barrier list help novice educators according to

143
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.950 
over summative study novice educators can benefit from our barrier list
in three ways.

144
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.940 
first the barrier list can help novice educators

145
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.940 
not to forget about non-technological barriers,
because they often do.

146
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.360 
second the barrier list can serve as a trustworthy reference

147
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.490 
for online course planning previously most of the teachers
we were interviewing.

148
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.670 
were using their heuristics just saying that this might be an issue,

149
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.420 
but they were not actually thinking about

150
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.820 
all of the details or they were not even sure that they had

151
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.180 
actually covered all of the aspects when they were teaching.

152
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.240 
a third the barrier list can inspire educators to modify old

153
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.830 
active learning strategies and make them more inclusive.

154
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.940 
our work also presents some design suggestions to improve the

155
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.930 
quality of this type of online education.
we suggest that developing new interaction designs

156
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.820 
based on new input face for example we are an a r might be

157
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.210 
advantageous to improve students communication, and different

158
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.480 
virtualisation techniques can be applied to protect the student's

159
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.960 
privacy and transmit more visual information between student's.

160
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.590 
and actually peers while actually preserving their privacy for example.

161
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.360 
and finally we suggest that using and enabling instant
communication tools between students

162
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.210 
might actually be useful for students' learning.

163
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.330 
so it should not always be considered as something bad.

164
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.850 
this paper is of course more detail and has more information,

165
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.440 
but in summary this paper is the first systematic research

166
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.290 
to characterize student barriers to active learning
in synchronous online classes.

167
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.190 
in this work we successfully reveal and characterize twenty

168
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.520 
eight granular student barriers to active learning and finally

169
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.070 
in our work we discuss the main problems students face and

170
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.460 
shows the advantages of our work for planning this type of courses

171
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.930 
actually buy novice educators.
for more information i encourage you to

172
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.710 
look at our paper and and i want to thank you all for your

173
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.140 
valuable time and attention, sorry for my actually delay and

174
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.860 
if there are any questions or any comments, i would be glad

175
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.070 
to answer and hear your comments.

176
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.080 
thank you, very mad recipe or for your presentation.

177
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.720 
let's give an applause to the speaker.

178
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.450 
thank you, hey ok i think.

179
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:49.070 
it's a very interesting work in which you give different insights about

180
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.160 
the problem. so for active learning in online environments.

181
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.200 
and this is very useful oka.

182
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:02.880 
so now it's time for  questions thrown from the audience.

183
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.570 
okay i think Mar has a question.
on a low thank you very much for the presentation.

184
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.250 
it is indeed very interesting having a

185
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.890 
qualitative analysis of data in situations like the one we lived

186
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.830 
during the great pandemic.
so i appreciate very much their the results.

187
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:27.900 
my questions is related on how would you think

188
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:33.060 
that these barriers that you have identified can help
teachers in the future.

189
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.250 
so how do you imagine that you could provide

190
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.050 
support to teachers according to the barriers that you detected.

191
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.980 
thank you, so much actually for the question

192
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.800 
this is a very important question.

193
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.840 
you know over barrier release just provides the may be preliminary

194
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.520 
step for further analysis and we believe that each of the categories.

195
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.900 
we have introduced in our paper. actually demands further exploration

196
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.280 
and we were thinking that maybe learning at a scale researchers

197
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.700 
and the hc researchers can actually go in depth to each of

198
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.740 
these categories to provide some tools or maybe methodologies

199
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.510 
for the teachers to solve each of these problems, because at this

200
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.230 
time actually we just touched a surface.
we do not actually go into maybe

201
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.030 
the complicated details of how to answer or address all of these needs.

202
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.460 
over actually contribution is just maybe enlightening and informing

203
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.330 
the educators about the existing existence of such barriers.

204
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.720 
people can think about especially when they are planning their

205
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.040 
courses because there are some techniques in

206
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.010 
actually education for planning the course.

207
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:49.470 
they can get informed, but for actually very specific answers

208
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.370 
that demands further actual research that may come up in future studies.

209
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.220 
maybe in learning at scale communities or even ahc research communities
we believe.

210
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.190 
thank you very much. thank you so much.

211
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.750 
more questions patrick. yeah, please go ahead.

212
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.210 
i have half a question please forgive me. it's 2 a.m

213
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.680 
where i'm at so i'm a little bit out of it. so i kind of had

214
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.300 
half a formulated question,
but just looking over the list of barriers

215
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.100 
for this kind of online synchronous learning i was wondering as

216
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.110 
offline courses actually are incorporating these kinds of technologies

217
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.720 
more and more you see this more in like design classes where

218
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.890 
we are having these kind of virtual reality, augmented reality,

219
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.080 
explorations and like people using clippers and whatnot in classrooms.

220
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.080 
i'm wondering like how does something even touch your paper,

221
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.880 
but like to what extent

222
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.290 
do you think these barriers

223
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.950 
are also a problem like not just in like these
online seamless learning environments,

224
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.970 
but offline environments that are starting to incorporate.

225
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.950 
this kind of technology such as you know video conferencing and

226
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.310 
what not i'm sorry if i didn't articulate that very well.

227
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.180 
thank you. so much for the awesome question. actually this is

228
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.740 
also a very great question. so in our paper we have also given

229
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.460 
thought to actually this aspect that not all of these barriers are

230
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.670 
restricted for only online environments as some of them might

231
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.480 
even exist in offline environments.
so what we have done. we have tried to

232
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.730 
have a survey in over a paper

233
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:29.540 
taking the opinions of both students and expert educators to

234
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.240 
see to what extent they think these problems are

235
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:39.260 
important for online and offline environments
and to what extent they are frequent

236
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.570 
in online environments.
so we have tried to actually take their opinions

237
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:49.680 
yes some of these are more actually current in online environments.
we have actually

238
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.460 
actually put that in a table.
i don't have the table right now next to me

239
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.080 
but you can actually check out the paper for a details table

240
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.640 
in which we have tried to

241
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.180 
mentioned the frequency of each of these plot problems for

242
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.580 
online environments and their importance in the online environment

243
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.530 
from the perspective of students and expert educators.

244
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.650 
ok i check out the full paper.
thank you, so much thank you.

245
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.540 
so much i appreciate

246
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:31.190 
well i would like  to append a topic for discussion

247
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.230 
related to the paper.

248
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:40.370 
i think in some occasions actually active learning,

249
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:46.650 
if it's not done in a good way can be dangerous and and indeed

250
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.170 
from my point of view in some cases, if it's not done in a good way

251
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:59.500 
can be a bad thing when you are learning okay.

252
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.220 
i think active learning in in online environments is.

253
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.740 
it is  even active learning methodologies

254
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:18.120 
i think in online environments,

255
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:24.850 
but i think if it's not applied in a good way. it could be even dangerous

256
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.740 
okay so i don't know what would you think abou

257
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:35.270 
how active learning methodologies can be applied

258
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.530 
in a good way or if you think that

259
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.440 
if it's not applied in a good way it can be also

260
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:53.320 
dangerous and and if  you think in online environments
active learning methodologies are

261
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:58.460 
even more important than  in face to face

262
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.740 
teaching. so yeah it's

263
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.960 
an open discussion

264
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:12.030 
what do you think yes absolutely as you mentioned if actually

265
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.300 
active learning is not deployed correctly or carefully, it might

266
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.550 
even have severe consequences. for example it might totally

267
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:26.480 
devastate the students' intrinsic motivation or their engagement

268
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.330 
in the class or even the students might

269
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.410 
totally drop out from the course saying that this is just a waste of time.

270
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.870 
so we should actually think about how to make the process

271
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.540 
of active learning as something useful in such a way that the

272
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.380 
students think that their time is used in a valuable way they

273
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.210 
are not wasting their time is very important. and

274
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.230 
the consequences can be severe we have actually not a studied

275
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.820 
at this point what can be the consequences of maybe

276
00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.070 
poor deployed actually active learning on students behavior.

277
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:09.140 
this might be a future direction to go, but yeah from our analyzes

278
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:14.280 
we can see that this is of course a very authentic actual research direction

279
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.310 
that can be pursued in future work. okay.

280
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.840 
thank you, thank you very much.

281
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:31.440 
thank you, so oh yeah.
well i'd like to also i want points about the some.

282
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.080 
maybe it is advantage of a potential disadvantage about active learning.

283
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:42.100 
as mentioned by a paper presented in a session two yesterday,

284
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.960 
actually mentioned that according to their study when they

285
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.930 
applies them they are techniques in their class.
it caused a great distraction problem

286
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:55.700 
in their classroom and in their online classroom.
so i think maybe that's one

287
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.260 
perspective about this disadvantage of online active learning.

288
00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.110 
thank you.

289
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.830 
thank you very glad.

290
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.760 
are there more comments more more questions?

291
00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.060 
ok so thank you very much again.

292
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.110 
and thank you.

293
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.010 
thank you, so much sorry for my delay, i really apologize.

294
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:30.430 
i had to actually connect to the vpn to get connected
to the conference i apologise.

295
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:37.550 
thank you. not no problem at all.
you were in time and and everything goes in time.

296
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.290 
and we can follow your presentation very well.

297
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.010 
thank you, so much thank you.

298
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:52.210 
ok, so now we move to our next paper. and I think our miss

299
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.980 
a speaker is Chee Wei Tan.

300
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.930 
and the paper is entitled

301
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.910 
blending peer instruction with just-in-time teaching joining optimal

302
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.340 
task scheduling with feedback for classroom filipping

303
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:24.500 
was so in yeah we can see the screen correctly.

304
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.620 
yeah, hello everyone.

305
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.690 
welcome to my talk on blending peer instruction with time teaching

306
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.850 
joining optimal task scheduling with feedback for classroom flipping.

307
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.770 
in connection to what some of

308
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.350 
us have put early on i think patrick also mentioned about

309
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.830 
the importance of integrating asynchronous

310
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:58.090 
classroom learning with synchronous activities in real time teaching.

311
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.250 
i think this is a very interesting problem and that's what we

312
00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.700 
will be talking about in this talk.

313
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.140 
and my name is a two-time, i am a professor of

314
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.050 
computer science at the

315
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:11.780 
university of hong kong.

316
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.670 
the lecture is less essential to content delivery than it once was.

317
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.810 
one whale lecturing stays on youtube.

318
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.030 
class time is for interaction.

319
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.590 
so how should we design and optimize content delivery to the students

320
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.450 
and interactions between students and instructors.

321
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.830 
so indeed classroom flipping is a pedagogical idea that class

322
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.390 
time can be used to engage students through active learning,.

323
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.880 
the instructor will integrate a five to ten minutes

324
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.900 
hence on learning activities into a class period.

325
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.820 
and consequently lectures for five to ten minutes less.

326
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.610 
the contributions in our paper work is a classroom flipping framework

327
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.500 
that brings out the value of feedback,

328
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:16.190 
negative feedback that can blends together
both asynchronous pre class learning

329
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:22.350 
together with synchronous custody. and this is achieved through our

330
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:28.190 
AI chatbot that i'm going to demonstrate later on so
and we also implement this

331
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.910 
classroom flipping framework in a real world setting teaching

332
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.900 
on an AI class right for the past two years.

333
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.790 
so this work actually opens up avenues for online classroom flipping

334
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.820 
and i also want to bring our just on petri mention

335
00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.910 
these that are the few tools like for example clickers.

336
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.130 
so our software actually digitizes this clicker,
but more than that

337
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.130 
it can act as a smart

338
00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.290 
audience response system for this online classroom flipping.

339
00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.980 
and later we shall talk a little bit about the usability evaluation

340
00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.950 
for teaching that university class on ai course in 2019 or 2020.

341
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.920 
so there are several teaching

342
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.570 
curies in classroom flipping just in time teaching

343
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.890 
is an asynchronous approach,

344
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.140 
in which our teachers they close the gaps with students by

345
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.340 
using some form of feedback before coming to class.

346
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.980 
so typically our shot diagnostic assessments would be carry out

347
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.790 
before class. and teachers would then use this diagnostic feedback

348
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:44.990 
as the talking points in class to engage the students turns

349
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.180 
out that actually this a just in time teaching

350
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.430 
was around kma came about around twenty years ago actually and

351
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.800 
were created by physicists.

352
00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.610 
and roughly at the same time that another group of physicists who

353
00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:04.750 
was created are not a body of teaching theorie.

354
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:10.610 
they call is the peer instructions.
so peer instruction is a synchronous approach in which instructors

355
00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.830 
would rely on the use of clickers which
is a kind of audience response systems

356
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:21.880 
to issue quiz and to encourage the students in class to engage

357
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.330 
in peering discussions.

358
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.920 
so our mobile software software actually
integrates these two approaches together

359
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.340 
to achieve our blended learning.

360
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:40.260 
and i'd just mention right a just in time teaching.
it was invented by physicists

361
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:45.570 
likewise for the few instructions.
they were also invented by physicists,

362
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.440 
namely our harvard professor eric massu and now

363
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.950 
currently who is a nobel physicist us this

364
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.980 
call view men who is now a stanford

365
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.080 
both of them invented the instructions.
so now we are going to integrate

366
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.040 
this two approaches together using our mobile software.

367
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.960 
so for pre-class learning activities just like just-in-time teaching

368
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.580 
our students use our mobile software for low states assessment.

369
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.120 
and the software can send out auto prompts right to regulate

370
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.220 
the student's learning progress and thereby provide

371
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.650 
the track and provide just in time teaching feedback to the educator

372
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:33.190 
for in-class activities the students would use the same software

373
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.700 
to regulate to carry out actually to carry out a poll quiz routine

374
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.750 
in the class. so in the following let me

375
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:47.890 
describe briefly what this poky poll quiz routine of a few instructions

376
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.150 
is using our software. okay so

377
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.030 
what you see on the screen right i say suppose you're in class now

378
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.140 
on this ai class. so what the

379
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.830 
allocate is a poll i am roughly speaking. it will take around

380
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.390 
five minutes to carry out for example on this figure that you see.

381
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:18.030 
it will be a say a easy poll i in the form of
a multiple choice question mcq

382
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.190 
and a few options like a-b-c for example tic-tac-toe that we all know,

383
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.280 
if you are going to be the first move

384
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.200 
player and which obvious lots which you are put your choice.

385
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:35.080 
and the students actually get to see  the poorest fonts

386
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.250 
after they have entered their choice a-b-c, for example.

387
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:44.480 
and once the educator sees that a lot of students have input at

388
00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.290 
their poke well the educator will say hey our class take around

389
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.770 
ten to twenty minutes to find appears to discuss.

390
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.180 
once you have seen that response and

391
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.630 
the educator will actually try to go around the room

392
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.310 
to hear what the students are discussing.

393
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.730 
and then after that say at the end of that peer this discussions

394
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.780 
similar quiz would then be sent out to all classes

395
00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.650 
again. all the students get the same quiz, which is

396
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.580 
perhaps related to the poll and sometimes would be the same,

397
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.880 
or else would be a somewhat harder question. for example,

398
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.390 
this one that you see on the right hand side of the screen.

399
00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.190 
so the key advantages of this poor quiz

400
00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:35.120 
routine is that this is what we call a clicker polling.

401
00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.630 
it does not embarrassed the shy students who might be fearful of

402
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.740 
ridicule if they get the wrong answer. right, so

403
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:48.410 
and not adventitious that's instructors
who choose to use this form of clickers, right.

404
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.670 
they feel obligated to use them in the class and so they must conceive

405
00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:00.270 
interesting and informing polling and quick quiz kind of questions

406
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.980 
to enhance interaction in the class.

407
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.740 
now it turns out that the original pure instructions
is designed for in-person teaching,

408
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.150 
right? it was like invented twenty years ago.

409
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.990 
and we started using that twenty eighteen twenty nineteen,

410
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.330 
but turns out that this pure quiz routine can still be very effective

411
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:24.000 
for remote teaching and learning that
was necessitated by this covid nineteen,

412
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.280 
since last year.

413
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:31.550 
so  the nice thing is that this

414
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.990 
interaction in class also provides instant feedback

415
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.890 
to the students and the educators. for example,

416
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.700 
just like as i mentioned if it's going to be conducted
in a remote teaching setting.

417
00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:47.640 
there is a need to enhance interaction in class,

418
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:53.490 
if not most people are passively listening and not responding

419
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:59.270 
or following the progress of the talk, so indeed the poor response

420
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.570 
provides a very valuable feedback to the instructors.

421
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.650 
and as well as to the students who might have chosen the wrong

422
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.440 
choices and see that hey they're actually in the minority and

423
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.180 
they should then try to beef up yeah yeah progress.

424
00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:22.590 
so the critical thing that we encounter
between in-person teaching and remote teaching.

425
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:26.860 
experience are peer discussions how should we carry out peer

426
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.410 
discussions in groups,

427
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.370 
then in an in-person classroom the instructors could easily

428
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:37.080 
ask the students to discuss their navels.

429
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:41.460 
but not in the zoom environment and indeed when this is carried out

430
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.950 
in a remote situation, then there's a need to

431
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.050 
kat into the zoom break-out rooms or find other ways

432
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:55.310 
to engage students in small group discussions
related to that poke quiz routine.

433
00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.010 
and how to pass students together this is where the feedback

434
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.570 
from the just in time teaching pre class activity comes in handy.

435
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:08.030 
for example during our pre class activities we actually encourage students

436
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.430 
to try out different levels,

437
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.230 
different level in terms of difficulties of those

438
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:20.190 
pre class quizzes diagnostics. and we use that to assess which

439
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:25.050 
students should go with which other students when they conduct

440
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.170 
peer discussions in the class.

441
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.680 
so in a nutshell there could be different strategies different ways

442
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.610 
to group students together

443
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.660 
depending on their ability and their learning programs.

444
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.420 
and this would come in the form of feedback that the

445
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.590 
educators would get from those pre class

446
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.350 
activities using our software.

447
00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.160 
so here's the learning profile for our students

448
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:58.790 
in the next few slights. i will show this.
it's a usability evaluation

449
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.620 
on this slide what you see is that the three students, as i said

450
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:06.340 
they would use this software for say once master a spending

451
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.440 
say nine weeks and the three students that you can see here

452
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.260 
are we thought they are a performance quiz performance

453
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.780 
consists of both pre class as well as in class quizzes.

454
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.990 
and now what you see is that turns out that

455
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.740 
even when we prompt the students to try how to quiz

456
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.520 
and  who are willing to do that they actually can score

457
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.070 
much better than students who try easier quizzes

458
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.460 
over this course are of this over the course of a semester.

459
00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.190 
now sure what you see is the statistics that students are very

460
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:47.100 
much willing indeed to try quizzes that are harder right at

461
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.860 
the beginning of the semester.
but maybe towards the end of the semester,

462
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.900 
and this is a plot for two years 2019 ，2020 what

463
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.990 
we see is a similar trend that students actually are will try

464
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.130 
to opt for the easier quizzes towards the end of the semester.

465
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:10.450 
and i think that this opens up new avenues
for us to track a student's ability

466
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.700 
in learning

467
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.460 
in the form of using software and in the form of a classroom flipping.

468
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:22.230 
and also just now the first speaker mentioned the need to incentivise or

469
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:27.370 
provide incentive to students and i we very much agree that and we

470
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.050 
want to post this questions to everyone how to incentivise

471
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.350 
students is actually key.

472
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.020 
for example well we could actually give more points to students

473
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:40.100 
who attempt harder quizzes or maybe to students who are more

474
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.170 
willing to help other weaker students in the

475
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:48.810 
classroom peer describe discussions situations and things like that

476
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.210 
no here is another graph showing that our students in general

477
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.420 
using our mobile software they actually respond very quickly.

478
00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:03.490 
because our students are digital natives very
comfortable with using the mobile devices to learn，

479
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.590 
and as i mentioned twenty nineteen was in-class

480
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:13.670 
teaching and twenty twenty was entirely remote.
but we saw that

481
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.420 
students usually would respond in the pre class quiz

482
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:22.540 
in a couple of days well within the two or three days.

483
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.680 
and we are actually very delighted
because that means that students

484
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.700 
are willing to participate

485
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.180 
in this our experiment.

486
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.310 
here's another chart showing that

487
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:37.970 
students write that this is the end of the feedback
a cost feedback response.

488
00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.930 
and we send this in the form of a pope write to all the class

489
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.010 
and we saw that hey for these two years 2019,2020.

490
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.810 
the students are very much

491
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.530 
satisfied with this form of classroom flipping.

492
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:56.820 
there's a pre-class component and an in-class component
that they have to actively participate in

493
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:03.590 
and the majority actually say hey um
let's retain on the same kyaw from quizzes

494
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.260 
that they receive right for pre class and in class.

495
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:11.480 
so we believe that this is a very interesting way to

496
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.700 
conduct low states assessments even, if it's going to be a high bright

497
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.830 
entirely remote form of teaching and learning going forward.

498
00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:24.630 
i think what we have presented is a

499
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.270 
online classroom framework that blends together.

500
00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:35.010 
this pre class activities that at hills to this just in time teaching

501
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:39.750 
pedagogy together with the pure instructions that talk about

502
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.610 
a peer quiz within an in classroom kind of interaction.

503
00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:49.210 
in our paper we actually devised convex optimization our framework

504
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.610 
to mathematically combine these two approaches together.

505
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.460 
and then say, hey you know associate sudden amount of time to

506
00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.810 
each of these two activities, so if you're interested in the

507
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.010 
technical details, please take a look at our paper.

508
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.320 
and i'll mobile tribal software has been successfully deployed

509
00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.560 
in the last two years later, i can show screen to you

510
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:16.730 
to see how it was like from your site, you can see as

511
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:21.660 
i imagine that your students see how that interface looks like from a

512
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.860 
c i experience and we also provide the

513
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.410 
teaching datasets right made publicly available on this website.

514
00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.940 
so at this point, let me share that

515
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:35.560 
interface with you.

516
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:59.450 
i am sorry we don't have a lot of time for questions. so i need

517
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.440 
to be the problem, yeah yeah ok. it would be quick, so here's

518
00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.880 
the facebook messenger chat, but we also have it in telegram.

519
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:11.070 
so like last semester we taught a complex optimization costs.

520
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.130 
so students will receive say us a screenshot.

521
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.850 
it could see the code, and then they could response

522
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:22.090 
easily through this interface.

523
00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.740 
and here's an example of a pole for example of

524
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:29.820 
even a graph by the max-cut,
but that's easy a small graph and then

525
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:33.660 
students get to see the response after they've voted, and then

526
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.820 
comes a much harder quiz a much harder quiz.

527
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.280 
and that they can collaborate together,
so that pretty much

528
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:44.450 
concludes my presentation, right thank you very much.

529
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.520 
thank you very much,

530
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:53.450 
and they okay so now.

531
00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.030 
there is time for four questions and a for discussion

532
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.520 
one question for me.

533
00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:18.340 
yeah, thank you they're very interesting work as thanks a lot.

534
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.790 
i think it's a real nice combination of using mobile tools.

535
00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.260 
one thing we're currently looking into and i'm interested in

536
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.110 
your opinion on that is

537
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.820 
of course attention spans.
we all are spent with a lot of tools.

538
00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:40.410 
and that often leads also to a lack of concentration especially when

539
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:46.560 
my point is a little bit how do you take care of especially
when you blend

540
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:52.420 
like you do the mobile back channel.
so to say and use that in the classroom,

541
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.810 
so there's also some research that shows that,

542
00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:00.350 
so how do you take care of like keeping the students focused

543
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.710 
on the different activities so that the mobile

544
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:08.390 
power of the mobile learning gets more complimentary than it

545
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:12.290 
gets in the way and students lose attention of what they actually do.

546
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.250 
thank you. marcus for the question. i think it's a very good questions.

547
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:24.360 
because to be honest as a lecturer we do not know,

548
00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.850 
how the students respond to the teaching, because most of the tim

549
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:33.280 
it's just turn off the camera. okay,
so that's a confession and so therefore.

550
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:37.590 
i think that to answer your question,
there is a need to incorporate more low state assessments.

551
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.290 
so they are kept on their toll in other hey you know.

552
00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:47.710 
there's a quiz coming, so they have to ready to in and follow the course.

553
00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.450 
and so that's one example that i just mentioned we actually conduct

554
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.250 
roughly three of this kind of pool quiz routine throughout

555
00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.550 
a one and a half lecture.

556
00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.810 
so indeed a lot of

557
00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.550 
the responsibility lies in the students

558
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.740 
to follow the this form of remote teaching.

559
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.970 
maybe not just multiple choice questions like
what you have seen focus routine.

560
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.510 
it could be more perhaps more diverse more fancy a way of interaction,

561
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:22.660 
perhaps that can be implemented by more powerful
software that we haven't seen.

562
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:26.160 
but it certainly is very interesting to continue to

563
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.250 
ponder that question.

564
00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.060 
thank you, did you collect some experiences from teachers so

565
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.580 
that they say they change their style of teaching and

566
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.480 
their way of teaching

567
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.420 
with your solution or with your approach.

568
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.690 
thank you, macos for that question again.

569
00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.850 
i'd like to point out again one thing that pure instructions

570
00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:52.530 
and just-in-time teaching they are still pretty much young,

571
00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:58.210 
twenty years of developments and evidence collection,
so what i think that

572
00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:03.030 
we should try to integrate more mobile software with all this

573
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.890 
teaching pedagogies and see what other things that

574
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.590 
can still work on the remote

575
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.350 
high bright way of teaching.

576
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:17.350 
so very much welcome you know collaboration and

577
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:21.880 
you know connection to you guys on doing that we certainly are going to

578
00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.850 
continue exploring not just chatbot, but perhaps mobile apps and

579
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:33.230 
other form of a convenience software for the students.

580
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.580 
thank you very much. thank you very much.

581
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.670 
thank you mac marcus for the question yourself and  wie

582
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.420 
for the answers. are  there more questions?

583
00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.270 
ok, i have a question.

584
00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.530 
do you see him current platforms are

585
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.500 
prepared for this type of methodology,

586
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.580 
so in many occasions we have

587
00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.450 
through more blackboard collaborate or other platforms.

588
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:34.080 
but could we adapt this type of methodologies to win to current platform?

589
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.290 
petrol thank you for the question.
so you're saying the software itself

590
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.840 
can it be adapted to other platforms?

591
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:51.550 
yeah. i think with current platforms is very difficult to do due

592
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.350 
to this methodology. right i agree with you and in fact for

593
00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:00.210 
example, just to share for example like using
facebook messenger quite a lot.

594
00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.850 
and students in china did not use facebook for example then

595
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.050 
the indeed a rise of fragmented

596
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.480 
usability. and this is itself a problem.

597
00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.460 
and maybe let me point out one thing i think also patrick a video

598
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.710 
about this clicker use for somebody when you look at this clicker.

599
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:21.440 
it is used for example in person teaching yes indeed.

600
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.330 
you could use it with many different kinds of platforms,

601
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.360 
there are already software out there,
but turns out that there is no

602
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:31.380 
say of connection between courses the courses, say what if you

603
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.290 
are students using just this software.

604
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.560 
say the h and you could use it across the courses.

605
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.300 
for example, year one year two year three

606
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.290 
using the same interface. and this is not happening

607
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.300 
with africa and not happening in

608
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:51.500 
whatever platforms that we have right now.
so how should we better

609
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.470 
integrate this to benefit the students.

610
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.150 
i think this is what we are thinking as well.

611
00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.990 
i hope that answers the question petros thank you.

612
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:07.750 
thank you, thank you very much,
thirty we have a great presentation and great work.

613
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:12.850 
and now let's move to our third speaker for the session.

614
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:19.450 
our third speaker is patrick crain and he

615
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:25.990 
is going to present the paper.
what's the point how is course undermine writing comments

616
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:31.190 
on open ended work. hello my name is patrick crain and i'm a

617
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:33.940 
phd student at the university of illinois at urbana champagne.

618
00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.220 
today i will be sharing the results of an experiment on how

619
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.640 
scores and written comments influence feedback perceptions

620
00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.350 
and revisions to open ended projects.

621
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.410 
here is an example of an open ended creative project shared

622
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.220 
with an online feedback exchange community.

623
00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.260 
the creator of this project received constructive comments

624
00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.520 
offering insight suggestions for improving their work,

625
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.970 
both the comments and the design itself include some feedback

626
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:58.640 
in the form of votes used primarily within the community to

627
00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.380 
increase the visibility of the highest quality designs and feedback.

628
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:05.710 
a similar coupling of summit and constructive feedback
is often present in classrooms,

629
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.870 
in the form of instructor grades and comments on open-ended assignments.

630
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.310 
despite the prevalence of this pattern.
it is not well understood

631
00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:14.760 
how summative feedback gives context to constructive feedback

632
00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:17.840 
or influences subsequent revisions to in-progress open-ended work

633
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:23.010 
additionally increased participation in online feedback
exchange in learning communities

634
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.730 
has necessitated a move towards automated assessment techniques.

635
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.610 
these techniques typically involve scoring several smaller

636
00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.560 
components of open-ended projects selecting pre authored comments

637
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.130 
for each component from a pool based on that component's score,

638
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.490 
and showing these comments in scores to the project's creator

639
00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.780 
while these techniques assume both comments, and scores are

640
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.380 
valuable to creators of open-ended projects. little research

641
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.410 
has considered the individual roles of written comments in

642
00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:47.690 
quality scores in motivating revisions. a deeper understanding

643
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.860 
of how constructive and some of the feedback in operate

644
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.500 
is essential to informing the design of future scalable automated

645
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.110 
assessment systems for open ended work.

646
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.580 
with this in mind. we designed an experiment to answer the question

647
00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.130 
of how quality scores in pre authored written comments influence

648
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.090 
creators' perceptions of feedback and subsequent
revisions to their work.

649
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.940 
our experiment included three hypotheses for brevity i will

650
00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:08.990 
discuss two of these today.

651
00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.190 
first we hypothesize that showing written comments with
or without a score

652
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:16.360 
would prompt higher task satisfaction and higher feedback satisfaction

653
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.570 
than showing only as for.

654
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.980 
second we hypothesize that showing a score would elicit more

655
00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.570 
revision effort and greater improvement than not showing a score

656
00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:25.670 
regardless of the presence of written comments

657
00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.760 
to test these hypotheses. we recruited four hundred forty one

658
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.710 
participants to complete a creative writing task

659
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.780 
creative writing was chosen as a representative of a class

660
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.260 
of domains where open-ended projects are iteratively revised

661
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.260 
with respect to feedback.

662
00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.690 
after completing a short background survey participants were

663
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.990 
asked to compose an original creative story of approximately

664
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.240 
two hundred fifty words based on a visual writing problem.

665
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.910 
each story was evaluated and assigned to one of four feedback

666
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.030 
conditions wherein participants were shown either pre
authored constructive comments

667
00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:57.330 
a qualities for both comments
and a score or no feedback on their story.

668
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:00.290 
these feedback conditions comprised a spectrum of feedback

669
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.810 
presentations commonly used within classrooms
and online feedback exchange platforms.

670
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:07.130 
participants were asked to revise their stories with respect

671
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:09.760 
to the feedback they received or based on self-reflection,

672
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.900 
if they were not assigned feedback.

673
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.370 
following these revisions participants were given a post-test

674
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:16.810 
survey inquiring about their satisfaction with the feedback.

675
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.270 
and story writing experience the amount of effort they put

676
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.970 
into writing or revising their stories and the types of revisions.

677
00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:23.070 
they made to their stories.

678
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.410 
finally participants' revised stories were re-evaluated to

679
00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.810 
determine their degree of improvement, since their initial drafts

680
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.340 
to mirror the feedback produced by existing automated assessment

681
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.220 
systems for open ended work. we collaborated with two graduate

682
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.370 
students from our university's reading department to refine

683
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.360 
a creative writing rubric.

684
00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.340 
the rubric evaluated stories for narrative cohesion character development

685
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.810 
use of imagery variety and sentence structure use of proper

686
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.270 
writing mechanics and adherence to task instructions.

687
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.250 
the team iteratively developed a piece of written feedback

688
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:55.370 
corresponding to each possible score
and dimension on the writing rubric.

689
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:58.610 
following the writing phase of our study the team evaluated

690
00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.900 
each of the participant's stories according to the writing rubric.

691
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.090 
a script automatically assign three comments from the feedback

692
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.940 
pool to each story based on the lowest scoring dimension of those stories.

693
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.010 
these comments were shown to participants in the comments plus

694
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:13.030 
score and comments only feedback conditions while the combined

695
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.900 
rubric score was shown to participants in the comments plus

696
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.320 
score and score only conditions.

697
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.250 
in our experiment we found that participants were significantly

698
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:23.550 
more satisfied with the feedback they received if that feedback

699
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:26.190 
contained comments than if it consisted of only a score.

700
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.510 
satisfaction with the writing task was positively correlated

701
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.820 
with initial test performance among those who were shown a score

702
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.450 
suggesting scores may play a role in incentivizing revision.

703
00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.050 
however participants who received scores did not invest any

704
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.100 
more effort in their stories or produce stronger revisions

705
00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.310 
than those who did not receive scores.

706
00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:44.610 
additionally participants who received both comments,

707
00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:47.710 
and scores made no more deep revisions to their stories
than those who received only comments.

708
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.560 
these findings suggest quality scores may undermine effort

709
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.350 
by signaling minimal room for improvement.

710
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:56.040 
finally we found a negative correlation between initial draft

711
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.120 
quality and revision quality. this could reflect diminishing

712
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.780 
returns from feedback on nearly complete open ended projects

713
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.250 
which may be exacerbated by the presence of a quality score.

714
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.120 
based on our findings we offer two recommendations for designers

715
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.590 
of feedback exchange platforms incorporating automated assessments

716
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.810 
of open ended work. we discuss additional implications in our paper

717
00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:19.100 
given the lack of demonstrable utility of quality scores our

718
00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.330 
first recommendation is to refrain from showing quality scores

719
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.890 
for in-progress open ended work using them only for selecting

720
00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.290 
appropriate prix author comments.

721
00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:28.940 
alternately a feedback exchange platform might let creators

722
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:30.780 
decide for themselves whether they'd like to receive quality

723
00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:31.680 
scores on their work.

724
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.410 
our second recommendation is to prioritize the personalization

725
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.930 
of constructive comments as much as possible,

726
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.100 
although automated assessments inherently
lack some level of personalization,

727
00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.660 
techniques for repurposing existing feedback or crowdsourcing

728
00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.590 
feedback could enable future automated assessment systems to

729
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:49.240 
offer a deeper degree of personalization and elicit stronger

730
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.480 
revisions to open-ended work.

731
00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.880 
we see many directions for future research,
i will briefly discuss three of them.

732
00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.190 
it would be valuable to explore, how alternative forms of some

733
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.500 
of the feedback influence perceptions of constructive feedback

734
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:02.780 
and subsequent revision behavior,

735
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.780 
two examples might be showing scores indicating,

736
00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.640 
how much a project has improved since the last draft
or scores indicating

737
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.040 
the priority of addressing individual constructive comments,

738
00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.730 
given our experiment only allowed for a single round of feedback

739
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.390 
future research should also investigate how scores in comments

740
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:19.810 
influence longer iterative processes consisting of three or

741
00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:21.100 
more feedback revision cycles.

742
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:24.710 
finally our findings should be field-tested in a classroom

743
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:27.520 
or online feedback exchange community by comparing how constructive

744
00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.940 
feedback within without qualities for is influences feedback

745
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.210 
perceptions and revision behavior.

746
00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.360 
to summarize while constructive and summative feedback are

747
00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.030 
critical for scaleable automated assessments of open-ended work.

748
00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:40.300 
there has been little research investigating, how these components

749
00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.860 
interact to affect perceptions of feedback and revision behavior

750
00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.330 
in our experiment. we found that task satisfaction was correlated

751
00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:49.180 
with performance on an initial story draft when the quality score was present.

752
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.650 
we did not otherwise find any significant benefits to showing a score

753
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.590 
and found that in some cases scores undermined revision depth an effort

754
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.980 
to instructors and designers of online feedback exchange platforms.

755
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.550 
we recommend exploring alternative forms of summit feedback,

756
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.490 
such as improvement scores or priority scores to incentivize revision.

757
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:08.710 
we also recommend utilizing techniques
such as repurposing or crowdsourcing feedback

758
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.480 
to further personalize automated assessments and help improve

759
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.380 
the quality of revisions to open-ended work.

760
00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.910 
thank you for your time. and thank you patrick for the presentation

761
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:20.370 
of these interesting work.

762
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:30.690 
and the an hour we have time for  questions and for discussion.

763
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:46.500 
i think marcus who wants to make a question maybe，

764
00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.380 
yes,  please go ahead.

765
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:54.930 
super interesting work and thanks a lot for staying up, so late.

766
00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:00.790 
so, i'm curious and i'm puzzled by your bio conclusions slight

767
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:04.570 
in the way that we're working on an essay feedback system which

768
00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:09.540 
basically use machine learning to generate feedback and we

769
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.320 
went a bit way  of textual revisions, but we want to give

770
00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.230 
the kind of dashboard that you showed on one of your last slides

771
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:23.070 
also to the users. so we want to give them formative feedback

772
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:24.990 
to motivate revision for their essays.

773
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:32.430 
so i wonder a little bit that the conclusions

774
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:36.300 
you had on your last on your last slide were a bit puzzling

775
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:41.020 
for me and so far the first one said something
like don't show like scores.

776
00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:46.010 
and the second one is like give some good informative feedback

777
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:49.190 
for motivating revision.

778
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:52.470 
so how do you think  it is  a problem

779
00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:58.310 
students get an overall score for the essay and
that we would need to like

780
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.490 
split it down to like

781
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:04.960 
showing the criteria or what would be a recommendation for

782
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:09.410 
giving kind of formative feedback for for essays in that sense

783
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.770 
for the question mark is i think what we're getting at is basically

784
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.410 
and this is all very dependent on the context for your writing.

785
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:20.780 
i'm assuming you're writing essays for some

786
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:26.680 
academic academic course as opposed to like you know some kind

787
00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:29.630 
of creative writing for like you know just part of a hobby

788
00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.770 
in an academic environment.

789
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.530 
i think what i'd recommend or what we recommend based on our findings

790
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:38.320 
is that you

791
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:45.610 
you know you don't showing a quality score on a creative
or open-ended assignment，

792
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:50.170 
unless that score is like really high.

793
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:56.700 
it may overwhelm students by causing feelings of negativity

794
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.740 
like you know if you're just seeing a score of say

795
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:03.370 
to give a concrete example say you got a bunch of formative

796
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:07.900 
feedback on your essay and a score of seventy percent as opposed

797
00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.500 
to getting all that same formative feedback without getting

798
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.730 
that seventy percent score， just the feedback itself, if you

799
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:17.610 
just saw the feedback you might be more inclined to address that feedback

800
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.250 
work through it read through it at your leisure and to address

801
00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:24.080 
what you see fit whereas adding that quality score i think

802
00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.580 
that seventy percent means goodness i have thirty percent more

803
00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:30.580 
i can improve， or you know the seventy percent corresponds to

804
00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:35.300 
a c i absolutely need to improve my work to make it better. and

805
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:41.270 
prior research and or has shown that
these kinds of scores may stifle creativity，

806
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:47.100 
and lead students to focus more less on how can i make my essay bette，

807
00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:52.320 
and more on how can my essay get a better grade if that makes sense.

808
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:57.230 
so you're kind of it may achieve
the same thing for some people for some people

809
00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.990 
who are motivated by things like grades

810
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.090 
that may be a perfectly valid

811
00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:07.680 
thing to show.
but in the general case you know people who aren't

812
00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.220 
as motivated by grades as others who are just you know motivated by

813
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:14.300 
i want to write a better essay showing these kinds of scores

814
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.480 
may not be directly beneficial.
and may even be harmful in some cases okay.

815
00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.240 
okay， thanks a lot.

816
00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.370 
thank you for the question.

817
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:28.930 
ok that that he said a question shown in the chat

818
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:31.730 
by john phillip.

819
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:40.020 
but he said sorry cannot speak in my current environment.

820
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.090 
so i'm going to read the question.

821
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:47.110 
did you analyze the effect of positive feedback on good aspects

822
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:52.710 
of the students works best with only feedback trittyes mistakes？

823
00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.010 
also an excellent question. thank you, so much.

824
00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:03.040 
so for the purposes of our experiment we did not directly include

825
00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:06.570 
what you're calling positive feedback is generally called praise

826
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.140 
in literature and in if you read our paper

827
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.620 
in the related work section of our paper we actually discuss.

828
00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.620 
a couple of studies that have looked at the effects of praise

829
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:16.410 
specifically.

830
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:22.450 
there's a paper by anastasia lintner
which written in 2008

831
00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:24.990 
that studied the effects of praise.

832
00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.710 
and then before that i think i forget the name, but i think.

833
00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.670 
it's i think the last name is butler and back in the nineteen

834
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:35.190 
eighties also did a study of praise and they basically found

835
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:38.990 
that you know praise can affect ego involved in

836
00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.230 
attributes like you know your feelings of

837
00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:43.030 
well- being confidence.

838
00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:48.050 
but they also found that this kind of praise didn't directly

839
00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:51.900 
affect the quality of revisions to the stories.

840
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:55.820 
so we didn't analyze that because we had already seen in prior literature

841
00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:01.210 
that it didn't really have any bearing on the quality of revisions

842
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:04.660 
to work though it did have positive effects on

843
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.630 
the self or the creator of these projects.

844
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.310 
i hope that answers your question where you can

845
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:13.340 
get any follow-up please let me know.

846
00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:18.520 
thank you. thank you. very much but patrick

847
00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:22.410 
yeah i think hassan i believe that's a question well.

848
00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:27.660 
patrick thank you for the talk. i'm a little puzzled between

849
00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.550 
insights from open learner models and self-regulation where

850
00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:36.330 
we try to provide students as much of the content of where

851
00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:39.420 
their learning is at and leaving the judgment towards themselves

852
00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:44.280 
to kind of make informed decisions versus with withholding that information

853
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:47.340 
in terms of trying to get them have a better positive outcome there.

854
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.300 
i'm germany insights on that because it does school against

855
00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:54.850 
all that open learning model context of trying to get students

856
00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.040 
and teaching them to better regulate themselves rather than

857
00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.390 
withholding information as a way of doing bad.

858
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.780 
thank you, for the question.

859
00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:10.220 
so you should just like kind of like paraphrase your questions

860
00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:14.450 
about you know how does the the results of this paper relate

861
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:17.240 
to like self regulation where students are kind of deciding for themselves

862
00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.740 
whether they would open learner models. i am honestly not

863
00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.690 
familiar with open learner model or not exactly not

864
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.980 
from adaptive learning systems what they try to do is

865
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:31.900 
as you're working with a system they give you

866
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:36.280 
a precise accurate sort of illustration of this is how much

867
00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.080 
you know on topic one this is how much you know on topic two.

868
00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.470 
this is where your gap is with the aim of getting the students

869
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:44.920 
to better understand where the learning is at so that they

870
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:47.980 
can better regulate their learning and improve those.

871
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:52.540 
now i'm comparing that to the findings of your paper where you're saying

872
00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.320 
withhold that information don't really tell them where they're at

873
00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.410 
and just give them feedback, so that they can improve.

874
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.860 
okay, i think i understand what you're saying and like i

875
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.810 
said i'm still not familiar with these open learning models.

876
00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:06.200 
but i understand what you're saying so it sounds like what

877
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.850 
you're talking about is

878
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:12.640 
the paper in our paper we are specifically referring to like showing

879
00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:16.370 
absolute quality scores like you know out of one hundred percent.

880
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:19.590 
this is how close you are to that ideal state of perfection

881
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:22.980 
whereas what you're talking about i think is still a form of

882
00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.310 
summative feedback and that it's still trying to give you some

883
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:28.160 
sense of distance from a goal.
but instead of putting it in

884
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.970 
a concrete numeric term, it sounds like what you're referring

885
00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:32.250 
to is putting it more

886
00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:37.010 
in i guess more a more natural language approach where like.

887
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:40.260 
these are all the ways in which your work can be improved and

888
00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.100 
i think showing scores like that or some feedback like that.

889
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.700 
that's not directly a quality score，

890
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.070 
is perfectly fine and a good way to go about it we also kind

891
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:54.080 
of recommend additional， in our paper，
we also recommend additional kinds of

892
00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:58.360 
summit feedback that aren't direct a quality score
so like instead of showing.

893
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:02.100 
how well you did you know frame, it's more like a framing effect

894
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:06.050 
like okay how well can you do?
how well how well can you improve in the future,

895
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:10.330 
or how important is it for you to address certain aspects of

896
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.090 
constructive feedback that you may have received. so i'm not

897
01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:16.020 
saying in general that somebody's feedback is bad. but we're

898
01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.470 
just trying to make the case that quality scores in particular

899
01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:22.660 
may undermine the benefits of constructive feedback on these

900
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.370 
kinds of open and creative projects. thank you.

901
01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:28.210 
thank you for the question.

902
01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:32.840 
ok, that is another question still but by markku.

903
01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:36.780 
just commenting on that i think
that's a very interesting discussion that hassan

904
01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.230 
project just had and i wonder how much that is linked to

905
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:46.790 
what you would call framing in the sense. so the

906
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:50.840 
question what are these hundred percent and what do you present

907
01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.470 
as hundred percent to a student and what kind of indicators

908
01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.210 
do you choose right it's probably less

909
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.750 
interesting question about the open learning models of course.

910
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:05.100 
the question is what kind of indicators do you put into the learner model.

911
01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.980 
it's less a question of like hiding something,

912
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:14.090 
but the framing of course if i would frame my own performance with

913
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.400 
the best sprinter in the world.
it will only be frustrating all the time.

914
01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:23.440 
but if i choose the right framing it could be very interesting

915
01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:27.730 
for me to motivate me to develop i see that discussion a bit

916
01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:31.120 
in that sense, so patrick how do you reflect on this.

917
01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.090 
i absolutely agree one hundred percent, i'm like yeah we also

918
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.300 
do discuss this in the discussion session or paper where this

919
01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.610 
is kind of like more a framing effective

920
01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:43.470 
than anything else.
like you know inevitably in any kind of classroom or

921
01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.160 
learning environment you're inevitably going to have

922
01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.100 
people who are more experienced in a particular craft than others

923
01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.360 
who are kind of seeking feedback in the same location whether

924
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.450 
this is an online community or whether this is a classroom

925
01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:58.630 
or workplace environment or what have you and i think that

926
01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.120 
basically what we're arguing is like by showing these kinds

927
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.190 
of quality scores,
and even whether or not these quality scores are

928
01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:07.390 
available to everybody or just the person receiving them.

929
01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.590 
these kinds of inherently invoke

930
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.010 
comparison to a golden standard or comparison to the others

931
01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:16.970 
around you and while this kind of social comparison can be

932
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:20.230 
good in a lot of scenarios. i think the argument we make is

933
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:22.930 
that we're trying to shift the focus away from how well do.

934
01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:25.730 
i compare to others and more towards

935
01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.860 
how well do i compare to where i want to be or where my own

936
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.660 
personal goals are and so we do discuss these kinds of framing

937
01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:35.680 
effects both in our discussion
and in the related work of our full paper.

938
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:38.610 
but i agree this is a very valuable thing to think about.

939
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.920 
thanks marcus for.

940
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:52.580 
ok thank you. thank you very very much for the presenting this

941
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:57.060 
work patrick and  for the fruitful discussion.

942
01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:02.660 
and now we move to our last paper for these for this session.

943
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:09.470 
i have to announce that these paper has been no nominated

944
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:14.400 
as best paper has a best paper nomination.

945
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.840 
ok and these paper is going to be presented by a

946
01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.530 
let me see thing is by Ali Darvishi.

947
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:32.690 
a leader there bc on a the paper is entitled

948
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:40.900 
a employing b review to evaluate the quality
of a student generated content at scale .

949
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:45.080 
and truth propagation approach and as i told u.

950
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.240 
the paper has a best paper nomination.

951
01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:55.160 
hi everyone i am a darvish year phd student in learning analytics

952
01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.040 
at the university of queensland. my supervisor are Dr. Hassan

953
01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:03.170 
Khosravi and professor Shazia Sadiq welcome to this talk on employing

954
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:08.190 
peer review r to evaluate the quality of
a student generated content at scale:

955
01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.680 
a trust propagation approach.

956
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:16.010 
engaging a student in creating novel content also referred

957
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:20.020 
to as learner sourcing is receiving increasing attention as

958
01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:23.930 
a viable method for supporting learner centred learning at escape

959
01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:29.200 
previous work on learner sourcing has demonstrated various benefit
for student.

960
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:35.840 
namely, it engages student in higher order learning recognize them,

961
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.850 
as partner in learning helps them develop evaluative job
judgment and leads

962
01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:46.440 
to the development of large repository of study material.

963
01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:53.730 
an important question to consider is can
a student create high-quality learning resources.

964
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:58.560 
there seems to be adequate evidence suggesting that a student

965
01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:03.210 
authored content is diverse in quality ranging from high quality

966
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:07.790 
learning resources that meet rigorous judgment on statistical criteria

967
01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.730 
to those with low quality that are ineffective innappropriate or incorrect.

968
01:05:14.350 --> 01:05:16.860 
as sought to effectively utilize

969
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:21.760 
resources developed by a student a selection and moderation

970
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:27.220 
process is needed to identify the quality of each resource.

971
01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:32.480 
here we investigate the following

972
01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:36.960 
assuming we have a repository of learner source resources.

973
01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:41.860 
how can we partner with the student to evaluate the quality

974
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.630 
of a student generated content at escape?

975
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:51.540 
i first introduced a learner sourcing platform used in this study

976
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.010 
called RiPPLE.

977
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:58.510 
uses learner sourcing to engage a student in creation

978
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:03.740 
of content and evaluation of their peers' watch.
it also provides

979
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.700 
a personalized learning experience by adapting instruction

980
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:10.830 
based on the student's needs or preference.

981
01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:20.110 
Learnersourcing in ripoll has four main steps
first students utter learning resources.

982
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:24.980 
next resources are moderated by peers and tutors,

983
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.890 
then based on a consensus approach a decision is made.

984
01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:34.810 
and finally system would flag questionable resources for spot

985
01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:36.780 
checking by instructors.

986
01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:41.670 
there are four type of resources a student can create

987
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:47.300 
for a multiple choice question to write the question select related topic

988
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:49.960 
and write distractors.

989
01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.670 
then they self assess using a rubric.

990
01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.290 
once submitted, it goes through a moderation process,

991
01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.590 
during the moderation the students first
review the correctness of the resource,

992
01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:15.390 
and then fill out a rubric and justify their
decision by providing a textual feedback,

993
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.240 
once the resource is reviewed by enough moderators.

994
01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:24.360 
it will either add to the repository or will send back to daughter

995
01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.520 
for revision and considering resubmission, if rejected.

996
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:34.830 
not to make a final decision and in france model is needed

997
01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:38.590 
to reach a consensus from the reviewers decision.

998
01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.780 
problem is how can we use the subjective rating of a student

999
01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:49.590 
on a resource to infer its true quality,

1000
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:56.770 
or amy's to identify reliability for each user as their decision

1001
01:07:56.770 --> 01:08:00.960 
weight such that the quality can be inferred using a weighted

1002
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.640 
average consensus in france méthode.

1003
01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.850 
is a well known aggregation approach such as majority vote.

1004
01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.660 
mean and median are considered baselines.

1005
01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:19.300 
this approach assume an equal weight for all moderators
which leads to issue,

1006
01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:24.110 
if the majority of the moderators are careless.

1007
01:08:24.610 --> 01:08:29.760 
here assuming an outcome of three would pass the moderation

1008
01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:35.600 
all of these models would approve this example resource.

1009
01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:40.190 
however a number of resource include in this one have been

1010
01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:42.700 
also inspected by instructors.

1011
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.350 
and you can see, it is rejected by instructor which shows the

1012
01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:51.990 
failure of the baseline in this example.

1013
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:58.980 
a well known challenge with using peer review is that it causes

1014
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.110 
the problem of truth inference since the judgment of a student

1015
01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:06.360 
as expert in training cannot be fully trusted.

1016
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:11.310 
the figure shows a pre analysts is based on near seven hundred resources

1017
01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:15.840 
on instructor moderation from roughly five thousand students.

1018
01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:22.410 
it mainly demonstrates that identifying low quality resources
via peer-review

1019
01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:27.670 
is challenging in case as instructors have rejected a resource

1020
01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:31.860 
the chance of a student also rejecting that resource is less than

1021
01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.600 
fourteen percent.

1022
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.500 
the current model implemented in our platform is a weighted

1023
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:45.670 
aggregation approach inspired by the expectation maximization technique

1024
01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:51.110 
in this model first a student receive an initial value of reliability.

1025
01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.330 
in the expectation that

1026
01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.010 
the quality of a resource is inferred and in the maximization step.

1027
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:06.610 
the reliability of users are updated this method
has some desirable characteristics.

1028
01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:11.150 
first it has low computational complexity to be implemented

1029
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:12.870 
in a live setting.

1030
01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:18.610 
second the inferred rating our reliability of data are easily explainable.

1031
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.920 
and finally students find it to be fair.

1032
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:28.970 
but without academic oversight it would reward
the majority of careless reviewers

1033
01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:31.490 
over a wise minority.

1034
01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.520 
inspection offer an easy way to instructor to go through their

1035
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:44.530 
student's work and find potential ineffective resources
that have been reported,

1036
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.740 
have moderate or disagreement, might have incorrect answer or

1037
01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.250 
have low effectiveness rating.

1038
01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:57.180 
then they can check the details of potential issues that are

1039
01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:02.690 
automatically reported in the system.
and take immediate action by removing the

1040
01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:07.140 
flag or change the final decision and providing feedback.

1041
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:16.860 
to a small set of user and resource to show how instructor's involvement

1042
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:18.680 
is applied in this model.

1043
01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:23.720 
in the spot check resources the inferred quality would be said

1044
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:25.300 
to the instructor's decision,

1045
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.390 
and the student's reliability would be updated based on this decision.

1046
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:35.350 
as we can see in this example only few of student reliability

1047
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:39.610 
were directly at just that using expert judgements.

1048
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:45.460 
now i present our proposed method based on the trust propagation.

1049
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:51.140 
the first two steps in this model are similar to am, however

1050
01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.700 
there is a service step that the moderator's reliability would

1051
01:11:55.870 --> 01:12:00.080 
propagate in a network of users based on the similarity between

1052
01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.250 
them in terms of agreement and disagreement in previous moderations.

1053
01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:11.210 
this scenario starts similar to am however user score would

1054
01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:15.110 
be changed based on the quality of their own decision in the

1055
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:18.540 
current task and also the quality of their peers' decision

1056
01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:25.660 
in the future task.
in this model users only receive an updated a scores

1057
01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:29.390 
from the most reliable connected moderator,

1058
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:37.150 
as we can see here in addition to those fewer students with a direct adjustment in their reliability.

1059
01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:41.540 
another set of a student

1060
01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:47.960 
also receive an indirect adjustment as a result of
instructor's intervention.

1061
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:55.310 
now i compare our proposed model with other consensus in france models.

1062
01:12:57.250 --> 01:13:00.750 
we have collected data from piloting report in five courses

1063
01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:07.350 
with more than two thousand students,
or finding show that identifying low quality resources.

1064
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:12.270 
based on peer review is a challenging task as many of the students

1065
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:18.980 
tend to be easy graders.
results show that the graph based trust aggregation

1066
01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:23.610 
model works well by identifying the trustworthy student

1067
01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:27.720 
with optimal use of instructor's intervention.

1068
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:33.800 
and it was particularly successful in identifying low quality resources.

1069
01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:39.850 
this figure drills down into different model's performance

1070
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:44.540 
on data from one course. the left plot shows that a minority

1071
01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:49.210 
of reliable students correctly identify the poor quality resources.

1072
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:55.950 
however in a basic aggregation model,
judgement from this minority are often

1073
01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:59.000 
overturned by decision from the majority.

1074
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:04.880 
and the current em-based model has moderately improved outcomes,

1075
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:10.120 
but a steep fail to identify the poor quality resources properly.

1076
01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:15.680 
in contrast the graph based model was able to better identify

1077
01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.390 
those minority trustworthy moderators and it provides a higher

1078
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:24.720 
agreement between instructor's rating and the inferred quality

1079
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.150 
from the student rating.

1080
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:31.050 
while the results have improved, a number of poor quality resources

1081
01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:35.850 
have not been yet correctly identify. in most of these cases

1082
01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:41.360 
all the student had approved a resource that had been rejected by instructors.

1083
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:46.260 
this confirms the necessity for instructor support during the

1084
01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.070 
peer review process.

1085
01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.260 
there are several interesting directions for future work.

1086
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:57.990 
we are working on updating the current implementation
and conducting randomized experiment,

1087
01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:04.430 
or ab test to explore impacts on accuracy explainability
and students behavior.

1088
01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:11.590 
next since the current spot checking algorithm mainly
concerns about the

1089
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.430 
overall quality of resources not the reliability of users.

1090
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:20.220 
we can update the spot checking recommendation to also consider

1091
01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:23.790 
resources that would propagate higher amount of reliability

1092
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:25.700 
with the net within the network.

1093
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:31.150 
also a recent study showed a direct correlation between the

1094
01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:35.590 
quality of textual feedback and the quality of moderation.

1095
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:41.430 
so we want to employ advanced ai and nlp methods
for evaluating the quality of

1096
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:46.990 
moderation based on the provided comments. and finally we are

1097
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:51.740 
going to focus on development of processes and mechanisms to provide

1098
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:54.800 
training support and feedback retrace the

1099
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:58.740 
escape. thank you, for your attention.

1100
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:06.800 
thank you, very much honey for for the network and representation.
thank you.

1101
01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:15.070 
okay, yeah i think it is a very very useful work

1102
01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.690 
with very good results.

1103
01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:21.550 
very useful. because it's a real problem.

1104
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:27.420 
in an environment when there are many students
and they are creating content

1105
01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:32.960 
to know if this content can be good or not,

1106
01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:39.290 
and an instructors cannot review everything in an environment at escape.

1107
01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.130 
i have a first question

1108
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:50.690 
in thus the model depends on the number of instructors,

1109
01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.770 
the number of teachers that can be

1110
01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.410 
that can be there.

1111
01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:02.710 
so i mean is there a minimum of instructors that needs to be there.

1112
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:07.050 
so that the model can work well and and depending on the number

1113
01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:11.510 
of instructors. the model can convert sooner or so.

1114
01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.910 
yeah i would like to know about these.

1115
01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.720 
thank you, thank you for this question, well the main problem here

1116
01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:26.130 
is actually the number of instructors. and the budget we have to

1117
01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:30.330 
devote the time of this instructor to in spot check.

1118
01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:35.170 
the resources so if we can have enough instructor to a spot

1119
01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:40.040 
check hole the resources. we don't have any problem. so we need

1120
01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:46.810 
an approach to use minimal effort from instructors

1121
01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:52.850 
to increase the quality of resources. in fact in this model  we use

1122
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:57.530 
we have more than five instructor in each courses in this five course.

1123
01:17:57.870 --> 01:18:02.110 
but we actually use the inspection from

1124
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:10.170 
instructor as like one superstore user.
we set the reliability of instructor as

1125
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:15.530 
a hundred percent trust foresee, and then update the reliability

1126
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:19.610 
of other student based on their agreement to this superstar

1127
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.560 
user that we have so even with one instructor.

1128
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.190 
we can propagate this reliability through their network.

1129
01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:34.130 
but actually in this model i consider all instructor as one superstar
user.

1130
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:40.250 
i have no i didn't differentiate between different instructors

1131
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:42.570 
or academics in the model.

1132
01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.460 
so is there an alley

1133
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:52.210 
in a minimum number percentage of resources that instructors

1134
01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:55.200 
read, so that the model can work.

1135
01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:01.630 
i can do that so by design we designed the platform not to

1136
01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:05.980 
have those minimum so that it doesn't add to the workload
of the instructors.

1137
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:09.820 
so we didn't want to have a minimum specifically that you know that

1138
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:13.940 
needs the instructor to goes in, but essentially it uses as

1139
01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:18.780 
many zero or more sort of inspects that it gets from the instructors.

1140
01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:21.010 
and it tries to make the best use out of that.

1141
01:19:22.210 --> 01:19:25.840 
so the question is not real minimum effort is required,

1142
01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:29.250 
but the more obviously they put in the return is going to be higher

1143
01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:33.110 
one percent seems to be the sort of the threshold in terms,

1144
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:36.580 
of having something meaningful,
if they look at one percent of the resources.

1145
01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.980 
then we're beginning to get enough sort of consensus in the rest of the

1146
01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:41.090 
students as well.

1147
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:44.860 
okay, thank you. thank you very much.

1148
01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:50.530 
essentially system can work without any instructors and you know

1149
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:56.850 
it try to find good reliable moderators among the students.

1150
01:19:57.150 --> 01:20:01.810 
so even without instructor it would change the reliability throughout the

1151
01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:07.930 
moderation process in the system.
so it changed the reliability between student moderators,

1152
01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:15.890 
and find good reliable students and somehow considered them as like

1153
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:19.610 
as some sort of expert.

1154
01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.080 
some trust forces a star student who can propagate more

1155
01:20:24.850 --> 01:20:26.780 
reliability within the network.

1156
01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:32.600 
thank you very much. ok more questions.

1157
01:20:37.670 --> 01:20:42.170 
so i think that he said there are questions in the chat.

1158
01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.880 
so there is a question bye bye reza.

1159
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:52.850 
reza i don't know if  you want to make the question
directly with the microphone.

1160
01:20:53.210 --> 01:20:56.720 
yeah, sure sure actually i want to thank the authors for the

1161
01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.740 
brilliant and very important paper.
i think actually it's very interesting.

1162
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:04.640 
one question i have is who are the target students for this

1163
01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.140 
work are there any specific group of students and have the

1164
01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:11.570 
authors actually thought about commercializing therefore,

1165
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:13.210 
is it commercialized yet or not ?

1166
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:18.980 
thank you so much i take that as well, if that's ok.

1167
01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:22.740 
so that the system is open access i drop the link in there so you can

1168
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.990 
have a look at the platform and you can it's open access and

1169
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:28.730 
free of access. if you want to use it in your own courses.

1170
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:34.940 
it is being used close to one hundred courses across different disciplines.

1171
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:40.300 
so it is by design also used to be quite diverse in terms of discipline and

1172
01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:44.790 
both undergrad students post grad students were trying it in high schools.

1173
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:47.860 
but not much to see to report back there yet.

1174
01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:50.610 
amazing job thank you so much.

1175
01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:55.480 
now you had a question,

1176
01:21:56.970 --> 01:22:00.470 
yeah i had a question. but i maybe because i missed  some

1177
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:01.940 
of the presentation.

1178
01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:08.920 
i'm like talking with tears i want you to congratulate.

1179
01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:12.690 
because it's amazing i agree that the work,

1180
01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.030 
it's incredible in terms of development analysis and everything.

1181
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:19.370 
i think it's fantastic my question is

1182
01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:24.580 
when you distribute once once a student creates a question.

1183
01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:29.100 
how many students do they evaluate this question?

1184
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:32.170 
so do you have fun.

1185
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:37.410 
you have other student evaluate the question,

1186
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:42.840 
do they evaluate or not, and if yes how many ?

1187
01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:48.100 
so the current consensus is approaching the RiPPLE.

1188
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:54.350 
it needs a certain number of moderation from the

1189
01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.080 
student to reach the consensus, so

1190
01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:03.610 
if there are not enough like in this model we consider the

1191
01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:08.110 
reliability of user as a threshold,
if we don't have enough reliable student moderator,

1192
01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:13.140 
system weights for more moderation from

1193
01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:17.050 
a student. there are other criteria like the

1194
01:23:17.790 --> 01:23:22.030 
level of agreement between different student user, student moderators.

1195
01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:27.890 
so if it reach a certain level of agreement between moderators.

1196
01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:32.470 
it can conclude a decision. but if there are

1197
01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:39.110 
more disagreements between a student
it would seek help from the instructors.

1198
01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.060 
and how do you integrate these in a real classroom

1199
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:47.710 
for example? so i want to see if i want to use it in my class,

1200
01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:51.910 
how do i do it so how do i present and integrate this

1201
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:57.340 
in my  design? so do i ask them to write a question,

1202
01:23:57.630 --> 01:23:58.980 
then they will receive ?

1203
01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:01.220 
how is this working.

1204
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:04.820 
yeah i can talk to that one since this system as well,

1205
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:08.190 
and i'm happy to have a chat offline if you wanted to take

1206
01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:10.980 
it in your course, but one of the things that we found and there's

1207
01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:15.650 
a paper on this tomorrow i believe later tonight australia time,

1208
01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:19.580 
in terms of what you make use of whether you make it formative

1209
01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.470 
or summit for people to learn.

1210
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:26.370 
and one of the things that we found is if you make it summative,

1211
01:24:26.610 --> 01:24:28.860 
you get more out of it. there's going to be more engagement,

1212
01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.710 
but obviously the quality may be dropped because you're enforcing.

1213
01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:33.340 
everybody to kind of contribute there.

1214
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:39.230 
we have designed the system, so it could be added

1215
01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:43.370 
as an LTI and it's as an LTI in our university if use it

1216
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:46.430 
is in classes as larges with two thousand students.

1217
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:48.190 
so very very scalable in terms of size

1218
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:52.260 
as well as courses we're really learning at scale. i think we're

1219
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:55.280 
moving towards that learning at scale, but also in very small

1220
01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.780 
scale, so also with courses with seven to ten students.

1221
01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:03.320 
it is a feature in the system allows you to add assessment items

1222
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:08.030 
where you say the assessment is to create one resource
and moderate five resources.

1223
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:11.970 
and check their progress in terms of whether they have satisfied

1224
01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:16.190 
that criteria or not which in large classes is essential,

1225
01:25:16.190 --> 01:25:19.870 
otherwise you know the instructor will just
get bombarded with questions from students.

1226
01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:22.440 
i'm not sure if i have satisfied the criteria or not.

1227
01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:27.270 
very well thank you very much. so it's already

1228
01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.070 
working like for real cases okay.

1229
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:38.650 
thank you. thank you. thank you very much.

1230
01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:41.580 
it's time now to close the session.

1231
01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:49.180 
i think we had the great read the presentations
and great works in this session,

1232
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.270 
and the perspective for genia.

1233
01:25:55.100 --> 01:26:00.010

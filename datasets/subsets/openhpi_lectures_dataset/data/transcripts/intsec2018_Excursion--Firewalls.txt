1
00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.530 
In this excursion, we want
to speak about firewalls.

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.950 
Firewalls are an important tool,
an important security system

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.950 
that protects a singer compute,
that protects a network

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.540 
from unwanted network
accesses. The idea behind is

5
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.610 
that the incoming and outcoming
connections and all the network traffic

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
is monitored. This is monitored
and something happened,

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.920 
a firewall can produce some actions.
So by means of this action,

8
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.570 
the firewall can prevent and can also
unauthorized the connection attempts.

9
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.730 
Firewalls provide some
additional protections

10
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.080 
against attack. For example, they
provide protection against attacks

11
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.350 
by backdoors and botnets.
As the idea is that

12
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.190 
each of these attacks requires a
connection from the attacker,

13
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.980 
to the attacker from the attacker.
And this must be created

14
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.130 
without authorization by the user.
And such type of connection,

15
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.700 
firewalls can detect.
That means firewalls

16
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.760 
can detect such an attack and can
block it, or can alarm them

17
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.010 
to the user, there are
different possibilities.

18
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.500 
The control of a firewall stands by
so carried rules. Firewall rules.

19
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.470 
Such firewall rules define a
circumstance in which certain

20
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.190 
connections or in which
network traffics

21
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.660 
are permitted or are prohibited.
These rules can be formulated

22
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.050 
very special for the individual
situation. So specifically for

23
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.540 
an individual protocol, for
an individual port, for

24
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.050 
an individual destination, all
source address or programs.

25
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.230 
So then if such a rule is
formulated, the firewall checks

26
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.560 
to see, if one of the rules
fits and needs to be applied

27
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.420 
for an incoming or for an
outcoming network packet.

28
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.670 
And then in the rule is also
described what kinds of actions

29
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.680 
need to be taken. So if rule
applies to a network packet,

30
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.060 
then various actions can be performed,
for example, a package can

31
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.810 
be loaded, package can be redirected,
package can be modified,

32
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.490 
package can be discarded or blocked.
The warning can be sent to

33
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.470 
it. So you see is there are
different possibilities

34
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.020 
how to react in a certain
situation and this reaction

35
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.790 
is described in such firewall
rules. Of course is a little

36
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.100 
bit trickier, need some knowledge
to define such rules.

37
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.890 
So it needs knowledge of the
computer of the application of the

38
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.320 
computer, computers'
connection, to specifically

39
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.490 
define ride rules to
control such a firewall.

40
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.500 
An incorrect definition,
for example, can block

41
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.960 
valid connections, can
disturb connections, can

42
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.630 
have a lot of bad
consequences.

43
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.670 
In case of missing definitions
or an unsuitable rule.

44
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.960 
The general policy

45
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.990 
of the system is applied. So general
policy cells security gate

46
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.990 
lines are which dictate
whether or other connections

47
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.770 
are blocked or allowed, or a
user's conformation is required.

48
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.530 
The general possibillity,
for example, can explain

49
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.780 
that all can be done
what's not forbitten.

50
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.750 
A stronger general
policy could be that

51
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.500 
all is disallowed with the
exception of what is

52
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.710 
loaded by the rules. Thoes
are only few examples

53
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.110 
of such general policy.
But we say that the find

54
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.000 
action of fire wall is
described is determined by

55
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.620 
the rules of the firewire and
the firewall can store all

56
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.250 
explicitly permitted
connections and automatically

57
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.230 
set the rules to them to
formulate also rules

58
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.850 
for cases to use did not define rules.
If one looks at two supplication

59
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.750 
of a firewalls than one can
distinguish between local firewall.

60
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.860 
All local firewall is only
implemented as a defined firewall

61
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.550 
rules for a signal computer
on which it is installed.

62
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.190 
Or we can consider network
firewalls and network firewalls,

63
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.860 
say a checks all network traffic
and is typically installed

64
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.410 
on the connection node between a
local network and the internet.

65
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.360 
so typically they are located
we see the routers.

66
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.750 
The firewall rules can be applied
at very different stages

67
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.370 
of the packet processing, so when
such firewall rules are defined.

68
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.870 
It needs to be explained
in which stage

69
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.640 
the rule has to apply. This could
be the stage of receiving a

70
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.670 
package of dispatching a package, on
the another stage could be forwarding

71
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.370 
package all before routing,
So there are various stage

72
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.930 
and verifying kernel with
firewall rules. One can exactly

73
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.080 
say, one can exactly define what
kind of action needs to be

74
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.660 
taken in what stage of
a packet processing.

75
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.040 
The defined actions, than
are exactly executed

76
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.210 
at the respective stages. Let's
have a closer look at firewalls,

77
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.910 
to the local firewalls, local
firewalls act only on that

78
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.580 
system on which is installed.
I mentioned is already.

79
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.880 
So it checks local firewall, checks
all the incoming connections,

80
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.190 
checks all the outgoing connections
exactly to that computer.

81
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.620 
So in a network administrator
can exactly specify what this

82
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.310 
machine is allowed to do
or what is not allowed.

83
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.030 
In this way every system is
specific. specific fine-granular

84
00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.760 
settings can be done, for example,
warnings or packet blocking,

85
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.440 
then of course only effect at
that the system is the local

86
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.100 
firewalls installed. So we have
our network, we have different

87
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.260 
stations the network, each
of them has its own

88
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:19.760 
local firewall and in his own
local firewall specific rules.

89
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.500 
For setting a specific
machine can be defined.

90
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.790 
another approach not
application of firewalls is

91
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.860 
to apply the firewall on a
network based, network based

92
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.990 
network firewall checks all
the incoming and outcoming

93
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.880 
at traffic to one network,
also to stations inside the

94
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:49.280 
networks and typically as such
a network based firewall

95
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.800 
is located at the connection
node between the internet and

96
00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.430 
the local network. so it's a typically
and located in the router.

97
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.620 
And in this way, it controls all
the connections from outside

98
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.400 
from the internet to stations
inside the network.

99
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.980 
But usually is the traffic
between the two the stations

100
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.740 
inside the network that
are not controlled,

101
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.060 
that means the settings of rules of
such a network based on firewall

102
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.490 
they affect all clients
in the same way

103
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:37.030 
in the network. The
administration of fire rules

104
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:43.170 
so simplified the work of
administrators. Because they can

105
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.510 
specifically described for all
the inside the network what

106
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.960 
is allowed and what is disallowed,
so in this way the network

107
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.120 
based firewall controls the
traffic from outside work of

108
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.350 
the internet to the inside
work of a network.

109
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.080 
But it treats also stations
inside the network

110
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.250 
in the same way.

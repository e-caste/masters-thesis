00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.400 
Welcome to Knowledge Graphs. This is
lecture number five knowledge graph

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.380 
applications. As always we start with a
short introduction into the lecture

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.100 
and a brief overview.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.840 
First thing we will talk about in this
section of the lecture are ontologies

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.440 
in action. So what does that mean?
We will have a deeper look

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.890 
into ontologies to see what types
and what categories of ontologies

7
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.740 
are there and especially what kind
of pitfalls you should avoid

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.530 
when designing your ontology and
when working with ontologies.

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.160 
And then we will proceed with
knowledge graphs and this is

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.540 
the chapter where we will first
give you a formal definition

11
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.870 
of a knowledge graph. We
didn't do that so far.

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.050 
And there of course we will focus
on the application of knowledge

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
graphs within information systems,
especially there in search engines

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.980 
followed by a section on RDF and
OWL knowledge graphs and how

15
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.090 
these knowledge graphs are
interconnected with each other to form

16
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.460 
the web of data. And then we are
going to look into knowledge

17
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.820 
graph programming where we are
going to see how we can use

18
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.930 
RDF and SPARQL in the programming
languages such as python.

19
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.490 
Since pictures speak a thousand
words then we are going to

20
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.260 
look into the knowledge graph
visualization techniques

21
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.570 
and then finally we are going to
see how we can use KDD process

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.420 
for knowledge
graph analytics.

23
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.390 
So without further ado let's proceed
with ontologies in action.

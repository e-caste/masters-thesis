00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:03.830 
What is design thinking and why is it important?

2
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.190 
Suppose you want to help people

3
00:00:06.191 --> 00:00:08.000 
to take better care of their health,

4
00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:11.810 
or you wish to improve the experience of daily commute

5
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:12.400 
to work,

6
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:15.100 
or suppose you work at a bank

7
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.500 
that wants to help teenagers with their financial

8
00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.110 
planning in an organic and convenient way.

9
00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.370 
How do you go about solving these challenges?

10
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:25.640 
When we face a problem,

11
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.930 
our initial reaction is

12
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:29.270 
to start to think about possible solutions

13
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:31.960 
based on our own experiences and expertise.

14
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:34.570 
We might have a lightbulb moment

15
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:36.180 
and come up with a great idea:

16
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.770 
Once implemented it may succeed or fail

17
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:41.520 
in solving the problem that people have.

18
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.130 
When applying design thinking,

19
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.600 
instead of thinking about possible solutions

20
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:47.230 
right away,

21
00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.520 
we taking human-centered approach

22
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:52.940 
and try to start by discovering people's hidden needs.

23
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:55.130 
In this way, we make sure

24
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:56.570 
that the solutions we create

25
00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:59.020 
will be meaningful and helpful to people.

26
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:00.620 
Design thinking

27
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:03.230 
is a powerful tool for tackling the unknown.

28
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:05.700 
It starts with finding inspiration

29
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.720 
through careful observation and qualitative research.

30
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.530 
After interacting with people we wish to design

31
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:12.930 
for and learning about them,

32
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.360 
we then create solutions and possibilities for the needs

33
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:17.010 
we discovered.

34
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:20.450 
The next step is to create simple models of our idea

35
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.960 
and test them with the people that we designed for.

36
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:25.560 
Our aim is to hear their feedback,

37
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:28.830 
and refine our solution or create new ones if needed.

38
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:33.210 
Instead of solving problems with purely technological solutions,

39
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.730 
or focusing on what is economically viable,

40
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.680 
we begin by placing a strong emphasis

41
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.240 
on what is meaningful and desirable to people.

42
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:44.560 
You want to make sure that we create solutions

43
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:46.240 
that are valuable to people first,

44
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.740 
then we can apply the technology

45
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.010 
and business models that would support them.

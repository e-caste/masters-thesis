00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.910 
Hi and welcome to our Wrap
Up video. First of all

2
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.320 
we want to thank you all for
participating and uploading

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.650 
your assignments. You all did a
great job there, and some of

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.840 
you already started with reviewing
the work of other peers

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.630 
in the course. And in this review
you have the chance to give

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.550 
awards to assignments that you think
are outstanding or especially

7
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.110 
good. And today we want to share
some of these assignments that

8
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.310 
you've warded and later on
also talk about some topics

9
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.200 
or some questions that you posed
in the discussion forum.

10
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.040 
So first of all let us say something
else about the assignments:

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.570 
We noticed that a lot of you picked
the data of &amp;quot;Juan&amp;quot;

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.920 
from the case material.
This is also the example

13
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.960 
we used, of course, in the example
template that we gave to you,

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.430 
but we just wanted to emphasize
again that this doesn't mean

15
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.180 
that one was the
only right

16
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.180 
person or user to choose from
this material. There were a lot

17
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.340 
of interesting paths
in there to follow.

18
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.950 
And, actually, we want to encourage
you to sometimes take what

19
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.320 
you learned in the course and
apply it to a different example.

20
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.230 
So try to go your own
path in the assignment.

21
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.370 
But now let us share some of the
assignments that were nominated

22
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.030 
by you and that you felt were
really good. So, for example for

23
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.440 
the synthesis template you
gave two nominations

24
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.480 
to Meike. So for her synthesis
Meike chose the design data

25
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.110 
about the security
officer Alima.

26
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.120 
And she described very well
here why this quote stood out

27
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.280 
to her. So she described how the
emotional aspect was very tangible

28
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
for her and also how this
quote was surprising

29
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.200 
to her. And this allows
you as a reviewer

30
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.250 
or you as a potential
design team in the future

31
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.460 
to understand why this quote
was special to her or

32
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.230 
even a golden
nugget to her-

33
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.090 
And then, if we go on in the
template, we see as that Meike

34
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.000 
did a very interesting thing
in her interpretation

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.020 
and she actually went beyond this
aspect of Alima's uniform.

36
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.100 
She looked more
into the context

37
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.420 
of Alima and wondered: Maybe
it's actually about how

38
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.050 
she feels, that she needs to
feel respected, that she needs

39
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.890 
to feel as an authority, because
she think she needs to be this

40
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.810 
authority to coordinate
the passengers at the

41
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.200 
airport. And Meike's How Might We
question is accordingly also

42
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.100 
very well phrased,
because it contains

43
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.240 
the emotional context of the
user but it doesn't contain

44
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.500 
a solution yet. And in her
explanation Meike makes it very

45
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
clear that she also didn't want
to jump to conclusions here

46
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.830 
and keep the solution space
open. So maybe it's

47
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.740 
about this context
that Alima moves in.

48
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.740 
And, by the way,
Meike's design team,

49
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.120 
or Meike's brainstorming team later
came up with a solution that

50
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.150 
was about giving body language
training and non-violent

51
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.810 
communication training to Alima.
So this can also be a solution

52
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.190 
path. - Another
submission that we

53
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.890 
would like to share with you and
that was nominated is from

54
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.700 
Burkhard. So apart from uploading all
the templates, which was necessary,

55
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.420 
he also uploaded a picture of
the brainstorming session with

56
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.550 
us. And this gave us a glimpse
into the brainstorming

57
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.860 
session and idea selection.
As you can see, he wrote

58
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.730 
down the How Might We question
on the board and also

59
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.730 
provided some additional
information, some

60
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.470 
background information about
the user that they were going

61
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.130 
to brainstorm about. And on
the right side you see that

62
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.820 
they have been clustering the
ideas also giving some titles

63
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.270 
to those clusters.
He also reflected

64
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.490 
on the brainstorming session:
What worked, what didn't

65
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.690 
work and reflected on his
role as a facilitator.

66
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.980 
For instance, he
mentions that

67
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.820 
he would like to be more
prepared when it comes to

68
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.230 
timing and material for next
time. The whole purpose of

69
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.780 
us asking you to do a facilitation
yourself and do a brainstorming

70
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.590 
session with your peers was
to try out and maybe fail a

71
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.450 
bit and learn something from it so
that you would be prepared next

72
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.800 
time. So I'm sure that next time that
Burkhard is going to facilitate

73
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.460 
a brainstorming session he
would be much more prepared

74
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.350 
because he has been reflecting and
going through that checklist

75
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.840 
that we provided and also sharing
his shortcomings. So he would

76
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.220 
remember it hopefully. Finally,
we want to talk about

77
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.900 
Cindy's submission and the idea
that she and her team have

78
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.480 
picked. The How Might We
question that they were

79
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.370 
tackling is: &amp;quot;How might we
help Juan to feel comfortable

80
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.820 
as an infrequent traveller in
the hectic environment of the

81
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.650 
airport.&amp;quot; So as you see already
the How Might We question leaves

82
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.340 
enough creative room for exploring
and coming up with ideas.

83
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.880 
And the idea that they
have picked and shared

84
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.680 
with us is to allocate different
lanes to different travellers.

85
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.160 
So they suggest to
have one lane for

86
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.230 
frequent travellers who are
somehow experts in preparing and

87
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.350 
going through the
check procedures.

88
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.380 
They suggests
another lane for

89
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.120 
what they call &amp;quot;casual
travellers&amp;quot;, and finally

90
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.830 
one lane for families that are
traveling with kids and those

91
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.000 
who might need special
assistance in this way.

92
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.200 
Travellers can pick the
lane that they feel is

93
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.800 
addressing their needs and
is appropriate for them.

94
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.480 
Especially they suggest that
in the lane for families

95
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.850 
and special assistance,
there would be more

96
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.040 
airport staff prepared
to provide support.

97
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.570 
The reason why we're
picking this

98
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.190 
idea and sharing it
with you is that

99
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.900 
the idea might seem very simple,
but actually it addresses a

100
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.960 
lot of the user's need
that was mentioned here.

101
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.530 
I can even imagine and that this
idea might even exist in some

102
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.490 
airports around the world,
which is good news because

103
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.700 
this means that Cindy and her
team were on a right path.

104
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.830 
So sometimes these simple
ideas can be very effective

105
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.620 
in addressing the
user's need. So just

106
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.560 
be aware of them, be
mindful of those ideas

107
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.130 
when you're deciding on which
idea to move forward.

108
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.680 
So these were just a few of the
great assignments you uploaded and

109
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.210 
just a few of the assignments
that got nominations from the

110
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.390 
peers, but of course there
would be many more that would

111
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.800 
be worth sharing and showing. - So
now we would like to talk about

112
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.510 
some of the topics and
questions that came up

113
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.750 
in the discussion forum and we
didn't get the chance to respond

114
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.610 
to. For those of you
who have download the

115
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.670 
set of posters that we provided:
You might have realized that

116
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.360 
there was one additional poster
to the brainstorming principles

117
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.510 
with the title &amp;quot;All in all
one solutions&amp;quot;. So what

118
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.460 
is this&amp;quot;All in one solution&amp;quot;
that we are talking about?

119
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.140 
Sometimes, inexperienced
teams, when it comes to idea

120
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.370 
selection, they might want to
merge all ideas and they might

121
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.580 
want to put all the ideas
together, make it complex,

122
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.960 
add all the features
and create a solution

123
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.810 
that works like a swiss army
knife, you know, that

124
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.450 
addresses all the
problems in the world.

125
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.070 
Germans have an
interesting word for

126
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.600 
this situation: it's called
&amp;quot;Eierlegende Wollmilchsau&amp;quot;,

127
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.200 
which is literally what you
see in the picture. It's

128
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.330 
a pig that lays eggs,
also provides milk and

129
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.900 
has wool, so basically does
everything and nothing.

130
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.920 
And this is unfortunately the situation
that sometimes inexperienced

131
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.400 
teams would put themselves into.
And the reason for it is that

132
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.710 
there is this fear of
losing a good idea,

133
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.490 
leaving behind some good ideas.
So that's why they try to merge

134
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.310 
everything together, and also
the fear of letting go.

135
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.780 
So what we really would like to
encourage you to do is: try

136
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.610 
to solve this complexity,
one step at a time.

137
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.820 
So maybe start with a
simple idea, test it, and

138
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.440 
based on the feedback you
get, then see if there is a

139
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.950 
another feature needed to be added
to it. Ff not, you can leave

140
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.600 
it and go back to another
idea. Otherwise

141
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.390 
you would make a very
complex idea that

142
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.910 
solves and, actually,
addresses no specific need

143
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.280 
and it's very difficult to figure
out: what is the critical

144
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.220 
function here, actually, what is
the need that the idea is going

145
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.420 
to address. So just be mindful
of that. - And another

146
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.540 
topic that came up in the
discussion forum that

147
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.390 
a few of you struggled
with was the question

148
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.780 
about the brainstorming technique
of photo brainstorming.

149
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.520 
So: why do we use this, why do we
use random pictures in photo

150
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.330 
brainstorming at
this point.

151
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.260 
The reason is that we choose
pictures here, we choose photos

152
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.940 
here that we see as &amp;quot;food
for inspiration&amp;quot;.

153
00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.650 
Maybe pictures that show different
textures, different shapes,

154
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.520 
pictures that show different
cultural contexts,

155
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.690 
or even situations that evoke
different emotions like

156
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.160 
fear or anger or happiness. And
the reason for this is that

157
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.120 
on all of these different levels,
these may trigger different

158
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.030 
associations within
different team members or

159
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.810 
evoke memories that they
have of situations.

160
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.170 
And by remembering this or
having these associations,

161
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.780 
suddenly they have new ideas
that they can connect

162
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.090 
to other ideas that are
already on the board or

163
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.790 
open up to a completely
new level of ideas.

164
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.030 
And this can only be
sparked by a randomness

165
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.310 
of associations that you provide.
This is why we don't pre-select

166
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.250 
pictures based on the topic that
you're already working in.

167
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.000 
So for example some of you asked
why don't we use, in a topic

168
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.630 
of social engagement,
pictures of teams working

169
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.320 
together or people taking
care of other people,

170
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.830 
just all in this context
that we're working in.

171
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.850 
The reason is that you are
already thinking in these

172
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.130 
kind of associations, you are already
thinking in this kind of context.

173
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.970 
And we want to open up to maybe
completely new, completely different

174
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.440 
ideas and allow these
wild ideas that we need

175
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.420 
at the beginning of brainstorming.
What you're thinking of

176
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.150 
is more a &amp;quot;mood board&amp;quot;
that a designer might

177
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.170 
use in the beginning in a
design research phase to

178
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.850 
make the designer
herself or himself

179
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.790 
feel more about this
topic area or

180
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.240 
be better prepared to
ask questions about

181
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.420 
this topic area. So, again: in
brainstorming we want to open

182
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.250 
up and have wild ideas,
new ideas, random ideas,

183
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.840 
and then in idea selection
phase we frame

184
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.540 
down and we select the best
ideas to go forward with.

185
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.040 
So, now that we're getting closer
to the end of the course we

186
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.300 
would like to encourage you
to share your resources.

187
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.260 
Maybe you have resources
that you were

188
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.830 
using before this course
or you came across

189
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.200 
some new source
when you were

190
00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.060 
searching for terminology.
Still use this opportunity

191
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.020 
to share those resources with each
other under the forum thread

192
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.430 
that we have provided
you with. When

193
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.620 
the course ends, the discussion
forum will also go into

194
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.500 
archive mode. That means that you
would be able to access them but you

195
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.840 
can't really answer and
respond or upload anything.

196
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.770 
And also if you would
like to share

197
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.780 
a picture of your
brainstorming session,

198
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.450 
like Burkhard, please do so.
We have provided a thread on

199
00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.920 
the discussion forum
allocated for

200
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.110 
sharing your brainstorming
session pictures.

201
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.520 
Yes and we also would like to
encourage you to use these last

202
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.380 
days of the MOOC to finish
the reviews of your

203
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.530 
peer's assignments if you
haven't done so yet,

204
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.090 
look into the expert
videos that we have this

205
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.420 
week with Steffi and David
if you want to learn

206
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.560 
more about applying design thinking
in projects and organizations.

207
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.910 
We also have a transfer post in
the discussion forum if you

208
00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.920 
would like to discuss or think
about: &amp;quot;how can I transfer

209
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.460 
these skills that I learned in this
course in my everyday life?&amp;quot;

210
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.790 
Furthermore, we would
like to ask you to

211
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.960 
fill in the surveys, the remaining
surveys, if you haven't done

212
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.180 
so yet, because this
will really help us to

213
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.980 
improve this course and also to
conceptualize new courses.

214
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.500 
So as Mana already mentioned,
after the review phase

215
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.160 
and after you have a chance
to look into your grade,

216
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.850 
this course will go
into archive mode.

217
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.020 
But of course all the material
will still be accessible,

218
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.740 
all the exercises will
still be accessible, so

219
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.750 
if you like the course you can
still recommend it to friends

220
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.970 
or colleagues. So at
the end we would

221
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.200 
like to thank you for being such
a curious and humorous and

222
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.590 
active crowd, and we
hope to see you again!

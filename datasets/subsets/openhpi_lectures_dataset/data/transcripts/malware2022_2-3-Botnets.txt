00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.050 
In our openHPI course about
Cyberthreats by malware,

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.560 
now we want to
discuss botnets.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.190 
A botnet that's typically a huge
number of internet connected devices,

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.740 
whose security have
been breached

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.030 
and which are remotely
controlled by the attackers.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.930 
Remotely controlled by
the attackers means

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.560 
that the attacker can start an activity,
can do something on this machine.

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.960 
So they can control what
this machine is doing.

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.670 
And to be able to do this the attacker infects
different targets through malware.

10
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.810 
This can be done by trojans,
it can be done by worms.

11
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.740 
The idea is that this
machine's different devices

12
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.240 
are infected by a malware that allows the
attacker to control these machines.

13
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.930 
Typically the owner of the machine
is not aware that the attackers

14
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.170 
are able to control his machine
and the control of such a botnet

15
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.290 
is performed by so called
Command and Control server.

16
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.880 
And this servers controls
and coordinates the bots.

17
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.010 
In such a botnet there are
often millions of bots.

18
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.750 
So from this command
and control server,

19
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.320 
the attacker can give
commands and all these

20
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.420 
millions of bots start
to do something.

21
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.830 
The control of such hijacked systems by
command and control server

22
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.830 
is enabled by malware. The computers the
bots need to be infected before

23
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.090 
they can be
controlled by

24
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.130 
the attackers over such a
command and control server.

25
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.140 
And then the command and control
server sends instructions

26
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.750 
and commands
to the bots.

27
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.790 
Here, this is our attacker.
We have the control

28
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.840 
server, the command and control
server and this gives controls

29
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.460 
to the botnets. They
start to do something.

30
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.690 
So this is really like an army in the
internet that's controlled by the

31
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.520 
cyber attacker over this
command and control server.

32
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.250 
To understand how dangerous

33
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.830 
this attack is, let's look at a few
examples and attack scenarios that

34
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.510 
typically are performed
with botnets. So,

35
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.900 
for example botnets can be
used to send spam emails.

36
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.900 
The emails sent from the
hijacked systems so when

37
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.470 
other people want to see who have sent
such a spam mail, where is a source

38
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.210 
for the spam mail.
they only see that

39
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.670 
the mail was sent by the systems.
Such command and

40
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.900 
control server allows the attacker
to send spam and malicious emails

41
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.920 
from the victim's
systems. So

42
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.860 
in this way they can bypass typical spam
filters in the internet because the

43
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.040 
mail which is a spam comes
from a trustworthy sender,

44
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.280 
does not come from
an a system of the

45
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.180 
cyber criminals. Another

46
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.690 
attack scenario is the
provision of illegal

47
00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.450 
resources. Here the victim's storage
systems are used to host illegal content

48
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.680 
without direct danger for the attacker.
If police come and see where are the

49
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.970 
dangerous images or
wherefrom comes the

50
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:21.440 
resisted messages, they see it comes
from the computer of a bot

51
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.650 
of a trustful user
It's not coming from an

52
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.000 
attacker's address. And this is the idea that
the attacker can do their bad work

53
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.030 
over these hundred thousand
millions of machines which

54
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.160 
got infected before.

55
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.730 
Distributed denial of service attacks are
very typically performed by such botnets.

56
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.630 
The idea is - there is from the command and control
server, the attacker send simultaneously

57
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.780 
a huge number
of request.

58
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.740 
So, from the command
and control server, the bot

59
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.100 
gets the task to send a request to
a service, to an online service

60
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.460 
or to a platform with the
idea that all these many bots

61
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.590 
that in the same moment request
the service or online service

62
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.240 
is no more able to react
in the right way.

63
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.870 
Eventually even the complete system
of the service provider

64
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.570 
crash down. There are more attack scenarios
that can be performed by botnets.

65
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.610 
So for example access
online advertisements,

66
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.440 
generate advertisement revenue
for the attacker because they

67
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.230 
can prove this advertisement was
used and sent to so many computers

68
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.820 
and the owner of the systems they become
aware that now there is advertisement

69
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.340 
sent but they did nothing
to get this.

70
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.660 
And you know the companies,
they pay the producer and

71
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.420 
the producer of some goods which
want to advertise as goods,

72
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.040 
they pay for the
people that

73
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.420 
are willing to distribute the
devices they pay money for it.

74
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.030 
Crypto currency mining -
when we speak about

75
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.370 
bitcoin

76
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.410 
they use victim's processor, they
use victims graphics cards,

77
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.110 
resources, the computer of the bot
to mine cryptocurrency for the attacker,

78
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.590 
for example in
case of bitcoin.

79
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.830 
Here are some known
examples of such botnets:

80
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.110 
one is Zeus. The estimated
size of this botnet is about

81
00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.750 
three million six hundred bots.
It was discovered in the year

82
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.770 
2007.

83
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.450 
Another famous botnet is Conficker.

84
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:14.180 
Its about nine million bots which are
infected and can be controlled by

85
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.650 
the owner of a botnet and it was
discovered in 2008.

86
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.350 
ZeroAccess is
another botnet, also

87
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.690 
several millions-
nine million bots

88
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:35.350 
and it was discovered in 2011. And
Mirai is something which was discovered

89
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:41.010 
in 2016 with an
estimated size of one point five

90
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.470 
million bots. You see it's not
an exception, it is a very

91
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.360 
popular phenomenon and so many
computer are infected and typically

92
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.410 
the users of that computer are not
aware that they are infected

93
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.020 
and that they act as
bots in a botnet.

94
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.230 
So school computers which are not
configured in the right way,

95
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.970 
in universities, in public places -
they are especially easy

96
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.810 
to get infected and often they are
parts, they belong to such a botnet.

97
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.150 
Let's have a closer look to another
botnet - the famous Storm botnet.

98
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.530 
This is a botnet that
distributes spam emails and

99
00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.560 
subsequent infections. So in the
spam email for examples there are

100
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.640 
PDF images or other things
sent as an attachment

101
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.210 
and if the people
click on the

102
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:54.060 
attachment, for example to read the
document or look at the image,

103
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.500 
then the hidden malware in that
document infects the computer.

104
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.390 
So here for example an email is
sent to the people to the bots

105
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.990 
subject "230 dead as storm batters Europe".

106
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.280 
And then for this message ,

107
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.930 
the estimated spread is about one
to fifty million windows pc.

108
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.310 
Its not so clear but its
a really big number.

109
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.430 
And the undetected deactivation,
what is particularly dangerous

110
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.560 
in the infected systems is

111
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.930 
the anti-virus programs.

112
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.720 
The anti-virus
programs that are installed to

113
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.510 
recognize if there is an infection, if
there is a malware attack to the computer

114
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.680 
and the dangerous thing is that
the people, the owner of the

115
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.840 
machines are not aware that their
anti-virus programs got deactivated.

116
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.060 
So it remains
undetected.

117
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:15.030 
So, when the system are failed by
a command and controlled server,

118
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.970 
typically in a botnet, the comments
are sent to the bot machines.

119
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.730 
But meanwhile security

120
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:36.410 
experts can monitor such sources of
the commands of such botnets, they can

121
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.540 
detect such a command
and control server.

122
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:48.340 
And for that reason, Storm does not work
with a central command and control server,

123
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.590 
not a central command
control server, instead

124
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.740 
the commands from the
attacker are distributed

125
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.170 
by peer to peer connection.
And peer to peer connection

126
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.280 
looks in that way that
the bots themself

127
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.770 
are sent and transport the
messages to other bots.

128
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.370 
So there is no more central
command and control server that

129
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.280 
gives the comment to all the
machines or to all the bots that

130
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.950 
are connected to the botnet in
the same moment, now it is done

131
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.640 
with the peer to peer
connection among the bots.

132
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.010 
So in 2007,

133
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:39.740 
the operators of the storm botnet
began to split up the organization.

134
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.020 
It's not clear why they did it,
but it seems that they wanted

135
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.900 
to offer parts of
the botnet for sale.

136
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.490 
They have in fact that huge number,
so they have a very big bot number

137
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.650 
and now they look for other
cybercriminals that like to have

138
00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.170 
a botnet and
so, they

139
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.700 
started to split the
organizations in part.

140
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.940 
What is dangerous - the
communication with the bots

141
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:18.020 
within the botnet is encrypted. So,
for the security expert it's

142
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.990 
difficult it's impossible to
understand this commands.

143
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:30.050 
Also the architecture became very
complex with many different components -

144
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.810 
backdoor or downloader malware,
SMTP relay server to send emails,

145
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.200 
(SMTP - do you
remember that is an

146
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:48.110 
email protocol of the TCP/IP protocol stack?)
There are components which attacks software

147
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.920 
to steal email
addresses,

148
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:57.770 
the architecture belongs to the
attacks software for spreading malware

149
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.570 
via emails, there are

150
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.640 
components that can perform denial
of service attacks, distributed

151
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:12.430 
denial of service attacks
and also malware

152
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.550 
installers to update

153
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.780 
these installers with new malware
contact. So this is a really

154
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:27.850 
dangerous phenomenon, such botnets
and a here is another example -

155
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.350 
the Mirai botnets. I
already mentioned this.

156
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.280 
And here the dangerous thing is
that not only computers got infected,

157
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.770 
also smart devices like
cameras, like home routers,

158
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:47.420 
internet of things (IoT) devices -
they all can be abused as bots

159
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.190 
in the botnet. And this is particularly
dangerous if we look to

160
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.550 
the internet of things. Internet
of things are small devices,

161
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.380 
sensors that can communicate
with other sensors, for example

162
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.560 
in smart home scenarios

163
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:09.010 
or others. Here is a
diagram that shows

164
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.150 
which huge
number of such

165
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.380 
internet of things
devices are in place, are sold.

166
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:27.280 
So often these small devices that are
not full computers, they are often

167
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.040 
configured only with
pure security settings.

168
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.740 
These are simple devices,
they take data

169
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:40.930 
from the environment, for example if
your step count or other things.

170
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:46.630 
And such devices are not complete
computers with all the security

171
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.780 
components, so they are
very simple and often there

172
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.820 
are also not much security

173
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:04.980 
algorithms methods involved. So this
is another point with such devices

174
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.180 
for example refrigerator
or others is that the

175
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:13.830 
people are happy that they can connect
to such devices via the internet

176
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:21.870 
but they are not aware that they use these
devices in a standard configuration.

177
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.760 
So there is a standard password,
there is a standard account,

178
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.590 
this is done so that people can start
to work with this but when

179
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:36.320 
the people start to work with such things
they have to configure it before.

180
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.660 
Otherwise a standard
password remains in place.

181
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.240 
The attacker knows these passwords
because they knows the devices

182
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:51.830 
and so they simply can
logon to this device and

183
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.650 
can start to control this device.
These devices are typically

184
00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:00.470 
open to the internet to provide
the possibility to access, to

185
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:06.310 
get the sensor data to the control
platform and to give the

186
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:12.610 
controls to the devices. And often
they are not updated with

187
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.020 
the latest security updates and
measures because they are in

188
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.740 
the environment often in certain
places, for example in a lamp

189
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:26.860 
or in a refrigerator or washing machine
in your flat, particularly the many

190
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.240 
machines also
from China,

191
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.140 
already have such
things integrated

192
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.070 
to make it easy for the owner to
control this. Many people are

193
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:45.480 
not aware many people are not using this
functionality. So here the attacker

194
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:53.390 
exactly focuses on those weaknesses on
such devices and makes them bots

195
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.700 
in their botnets.

196
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.250 
So the bots are used
to find other vulnerable IoT

197
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:06.940 
devices and systems. So with a
standard username and password

198
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:13.570 
combination, they can gain access
to the device, they can get control,

199
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.210 
they can change things

200
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.720 
and so in this way now
the attacker via

201
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:29.060 
the command and control server, they
not only can control computers,

202
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:36.550 
laptops now they can also control
smartphone, lamps and other devices

203
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.980 
in the flat, at home,

204
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:46.030 
in the smart home scenario or in a smart
traffic or smart factory scenario.

205
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.660 
So it's really dangerous and the
reason I want to repeat it is

206
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.810 
that these devices are not
configured in the right way. So one

207
00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.670 
has to individualize the password, one
should not work with a standard

208
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:05.350 
user name-password combination because
this standard is known to anyone

209
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.660 
and in particular to
cyber criminals.

210
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:16.230 
So botnets are real dangerous things
and many computers in private homes,

211
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:21.530 
in schools are part of such
botnets. The owner do not know

212
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:29.480 
this, the owner are not aware of that. So
these botnets are a very strong weapon

213
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.870 
in the hand of the
cyber attackers.

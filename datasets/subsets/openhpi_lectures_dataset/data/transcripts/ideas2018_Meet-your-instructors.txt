00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.810 
Hi everyone! We're excited to take you
on this learning journey with us.

2
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.110 
My name is Lena and I'm a work and
organizational psychologist by training

3
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.290 
and a researcher at the
Hasso Plattner Institute

4
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.480 
together with my
two colleagues.

5
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.360 
I'm Karen. And I also work in the HPI-Stanford
Design Thinking Research Program

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.270 
with Mana and Lena,
and as a journalist.

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.220 
I have a background in
Sociology of Technology.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.200 
And my name is Mana and I'm a researcher
and a design thinking coach

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.940 
here at HPI. And my background is
in economics and management.

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.780 
We're going to start this week by
playing a little introductory game.

11
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.100 
It's an adapted version of Bingo. But
if you don't know Bingo, don't worry!

12
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.960 
We'll explain how
our version works.

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.940 
This game is not about competing
against one another but actually

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.100 
it's about learning about your peers and
getting to know the learning community.

15
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.170 
We have a three by three
grid and the goal

16
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.920 
is to fill it in all together.- So
we hope to fill all the categories

17
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
with some of you and we'll go
through these categories now.

18
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.270 
The first category is called
#Marathon. So who of you has run

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.560 
a marathon before in their life? I
certainly haven't so it'd be good

20
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.160 
if some of you fit this category.
The second category is called

21
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.250 
#Furniture. So we're interested to
know who of you has built a piece

22
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.220 
of furniture with their own
hands. And the third category

23
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.480 
is called #Newbie, meaning who
of you has started to learn

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.780 
a new skill within the last six
months? I actually belong into

25
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.760 
that category because I've
started to learn the ukulele

26
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.320 
but I just started one month
ago so, I'm a real newbie.

27
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.040 
But it's so much fun! So
much fun practicing it.

28
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.250 
But as you see I still need to
learn a lot. So I'm a newbie.

29
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.140 
The three other categories
that we have are:

30
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.460 
Owning a #pet, knowing how to
#juggle, and working in a #team.

31
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.170 
So who of you owns a pet?
Maybe you can share

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.770 
a picture of your
pet in the forum.

33
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.590 
Who of you knows how to juggle?
And who of you is working

34
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.960 
in a team? I for instance belong
in this category because I'm

35
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.190 
working with Karen and
Lana almost every day.

36
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.750 
And we have the category #Food for
you. So who have you grows their

37
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.060 
own fruit, vegetable, or herbs? And
if you like to paint or doodle or

38
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.870 
sketch, that would go to
the category #Sketch.

39
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.220 
And who of you has ever sewn
or knit their own clothes or

40
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.990 
some other thing? For that we
have the category #Clothes.

41
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.650 
So last year, I for example, I sewed
this little ugly doll for Mana

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.300 
which is filled with cherry stones,
to keep her warm in winter.

43
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.250 
Here you can see the
full template.

44
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.580 
So where does this
game go actually?

45
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.950 
We will count how many of you fit
into each category and after

46
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.620 
the first week of the course
and at the end of the MOOC

47
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.150 
we will update the template
with these numbers.

48
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.330 
In the next tab we describe how and
where you can play this game.

49
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.580 
And finally a heads-up
about an assignment

50
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.360 
that you're going to
have in two weeks.

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.700 
As part of this assignment we
ask you to lead and facilitate

52
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
your own brainstorming session. So
you might want to already start

53
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.370 
asking around to see if some of
your colleagues or friends

54
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.690 
would be interested in joining
you for that session.

55
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.890 
Maybe you can already set
up the time and space

56
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.020 
with them. We will also tell you
about this assignment more.

57
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.890 
Have fun and see you
in the course.

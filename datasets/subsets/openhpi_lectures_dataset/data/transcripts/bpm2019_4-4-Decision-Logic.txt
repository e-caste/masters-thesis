00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260 
Welcome to video clip four in
which we discuss decision logic.

2
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.210 
In general decision logic
describes how decision output is

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.900 
derived from the input
of the decision

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.430 
in DMN and it can be expressed
in a number of different ways.

5
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.760 
It can be expressed through so
called value expressions which

6
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.720 
might or might
not be formal.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.570 
So we can define decision
logic in DMN therefore in

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.080 
different ways. The first away is
to provide a literal expression.

9
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.980 
So that can be a textual
representation even in plain english

10
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.950 
texts or literal
expression can be just a

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.750 
text, it can also be programme
code and it can also be

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.060 
expressed in the so called Friendly
Enough Expression Language

13
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.570 
or FEEL that is part of DMN
which is a fairly simple

14
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.210 
expression language that you can use
to well to evaluate decisions.

15
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.720 
It can also be represented in
decision tables and decision

16
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.020 
tables are often used to represent
decision logic and therefore

17
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.090 
we will treat decision tables
also in a bit more detail.

18
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.840 
It might be interesting to learn
the decision tables are also

19
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.390 
serialized in FEEL or you can
express decision tables as a

20
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.630 
as a program written or
expression written in FEEL.

21
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.720 
And also we can have invocations
so decision can call business

22
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.060 
knowledges by passing input and receiving
output and we discussed that in the

23
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
previous video
clip already.

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.880 
So let's start with a
textual expression. So

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.270 
well textual expressions are
typically rather of an

26
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
informal nature which leaves room for
interpretation by human decision maker.

27
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.300 
But still the decision
requirements diagram provides an

28
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.010 
overview of the decision
structure. As an example

29
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.690 
we have here an application
for renting a flat and we

30
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.470 
have to decide for the
application whether we want to

31
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.860 
to rent our flat to the person
doing the application, handing

32
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.510 
in the application or not and we
have a textual expression that

33
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.700 
that we use here and that is as
follows: the applicant lives

34
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.750 
in a stable partnership and has
a good credit rating, he does

35
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.090 
not plan with any pets, all
supporting documents are authentic

36
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.770 
and he must be a
nice person.

37
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.100 
So that's how a decision logic
is represented in a text

38
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.440 
and you can say obviously we
cannot automate that, that at

39
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.060 
least the third part must be nice person
and not really cannot really automate

40
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.440 
this part as well. But at the same time we
can use decision requirements diagram to

41
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.740 
represent the decision
on an abstract level.

42
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.630 
So in order to decide on the
application we need the applicants

43
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.730 
data, we need the credit rating and we need
a number of supporting documents. So even

44
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.190 
if we cannot express logic in
a formal way we can still

45
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.430 
use a decision requirements diagram to
express the structure of the decision

46
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.010 
and the input used
for the decision.

47
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.900 
So another form or literary
expression of another form saying

48
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.990 
that this case the decision
logic is specified

49
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.420 
actually in a former manner,
and then the decision is

50
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.710 
obviously executable, we
can run the decision and

51
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.520 
evaluate it on a on a
machine or a computer.

52
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.170 
And that can be expressed in FEEL
as well. Here we have as example

53
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.790 
and the calculation of the net
income based on the gross income

54
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.220 
and the legal status. Again we
start the discussion with the

55
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.380 
decision requirements
diagram. Here we have the

56
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.170 
activity determined
net income

57
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.360 
that is based on the gross income
and the social contribution.

58
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.800 
social contributions are
represented as a decision

59
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.870 
and that decision is based also on
the gross income and on the legal

60
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.490 
on the legal status and of course
the example is made absolute

61
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.150 
real taxation examples
are a bit more complex

62
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.730 
than that what
we see here.

63
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.960 
And we can provide a
literal expressions

64
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.690 
and we have here the literal expressions
expression on the social contributions

65
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.390 
and that is if the legal status
married than the gross income

66
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.160 
then the social contribution
is gross income times of

67
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.900 
point three five so thirty five
percent of the gross income if

68
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.810 
not married that is
forty two percent.

69
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.190 
And that expression that FEEL
expression somehow tells

70
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.460 
us how to compute how to compute the
social contributions or in DMN

71
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.930 
a speech if you want in
DMN terminology the

72
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.820 
output of the social
contributions decision.

73
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.030 
And then we can define their net
income just by saying it as

74
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.240 
net income as the gross income
minus social contributions. And

75
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.400 
here we nicely see that the gross
income and social contributions

76
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.240 
these are the two inputs of
the decision, one being a

77
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.900 
data input and one being a decision
whose output is then input to the

78
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.870 
top-level decision.

79
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.550 
So I said that decision tables
are the most often used

80
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.730 
way or means to express
decision logic.

81
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.150 
So it's a formal tabular
specification of input output

82
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.230 
expressions and organized
as so called rules.

83
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.670 
And these rules together specify
how output is derived from input.

84
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.080 
There are a number of elements
in decision tables so briefly

85
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.600 
sketched the semantics and also structure
of decision tables in an earlier

86
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.460 
video clip in this week. So
first of all this decision

87
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.740 
table has a name. It has a inputs with
domains, domains are very important.

88
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.250 
So in the domain of input is the set
of possible values for that input.

89
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.540 
Arbitrary input is specified by
these hyphen or minus sign.

90
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.880 
Domains can be specified using
open or closed intervals.

91
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.550 
With the typical meaning that
in an open interval between

92
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.530 
one and ten it's all
elements that are

93
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.670 
greater than one and smaller than
ten and in the closed interval

94
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.700 
also values one and ten apart
of that closed interval.

95
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.400 
We can also have simple
data types and can also

96
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.870 
have enumerations.

97
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.930 
We also have a set of outputs or
typically its output columns

98
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.930 
are typically it's one but it can
also be more than one output.

99
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.050 
In our online course we just look at
tables that do have one output column.

100
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.760 
The elements of decision tables
also has a set of rules and

101
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.500 
these rules are actually
the rows of the table

102
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.170 
and we'll have there's a so
called hit policy of the

103
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:46.270 
table and hit policy will be discussed
in detail in a following video clip.

104
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.680 
So this slide is maybe the most
instructive to decision tables.

105
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.550 
So based on the our example
of a decision table decide

106
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:05.340 
on claim coverage with a bike theft example
I'd like to introduce some some terminology.

107
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.620 
So first of all a decision table needs to
have a name that you see in the upper part.

108
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.130 
The hit policy is in the upper left
part, the hit policy of the table.

109
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:23.020 
We see here the data input so this
is all the columns that are

110
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.660 
well that represents data input.
We'll have in this example

111
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.650 
one output column again
with an output domain.

112
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.100 
We will have an ordered input
value domain and we have an

113
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.690 
ordered output value domain. There
are rules numbers here numbers

114
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.300 
between one and seven and there we have
the input entries. So this is the

115
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.600 
concrete input entries
for the specific

116
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.930 
for the specific columns. And there
we have the output entries,

117
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.180 
this is of course the entries
for the output column.

118
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.160 
Ok so looking at the structure
of decision tables we have one

119
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.810 
rule per row and

120
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.780 
actually it's a when we want
to put it academically we

121
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.600 
can say it's it's a conjunctive
expression on input data

122
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.250 
and it's a disjunction by multiple
rows. So let's try to clarify

123
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.660 
this a little bit. So
maybe look at row three

124
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.000 
which tells us if the claim value
is between two in the closed

125
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.320 
interval between two hundred
one and five hundred

126
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.270 
and this where the conjunction is,
so a conjunction is a logical AND

127
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.800 
and the theft time is between
six and twenty two hours

128
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.860 
and the contract customer
contract type is silver

129
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.830 
then the output is yes.
So this is a this a

130
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:59.960 
one row one rule is a
conjunction of of the values

131
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.030 
or of the expressions of the
different input values.

132
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:05.670 
Okay.

133
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.320 
Alright that brings us to the end of
video clip four in which we discussed

134
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:18.260 
decision logic. We took a
look at three ways of

135
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.270 
specifying decision logic. So one
way is to just use english text

136
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.910 
or text in your favorite language,
we can also have formal literal

137
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.220 
expressions expressed in the
FEEL language and we can

138
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.740 
also have decision
tables.

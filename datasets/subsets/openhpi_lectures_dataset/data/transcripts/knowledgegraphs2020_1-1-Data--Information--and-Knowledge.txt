00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.460 
Welcome to Knowledge Graphs, this
is lecture number 1 knowledge

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.990 
graphs in the
web of data.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.490 
In the first part of that lecture,
we are going to talk about Data

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.090 
Information and
knowledge.

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.670 
What is that? 33.6.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.560 
Just the plain number.

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.420 
It could be an amount of things,
it could be temperature,

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.450 
it could be a length,
nobody knows.

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.440 
Now you see this is 33.6
m which means meters.

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.030 
Again it could be height,
it could be a length.

11
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.750 
So I have to give you more information
that you can make sense of it.

12
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.480 
So now you see, ok this must be
something like a length so it's

13
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.390 
33.6 meters length, but
the length of what?

14
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.300 
What does it mean?

15
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.380 
Of course, I have to give
you more information.

16
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.890 
Now you're going to see yeah
that's kind of a whale,

17
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.910 
exactly speaking this is a Blue whale. So
its Latin name it Balaenoptera musculus

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.880 
and we could also state that here
the maximum length of that

19
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.840 
animal is33.6 meters. And, of
course, this is an animal

20
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.510 
and if you want to formalise this even better
you could say Balaenoptera musculus,

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.140 
that's an animal whose

22
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.540 
largest length is not
larger than 33.6.

23
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.340 
So that's the maximum length
of exactly that animal.

24
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.410 
Ok, but this is something we want
to come across later in the

25
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.530 
lecture and we will go deeper into
that how to express this in a formal

26
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.860 
explicit way that the computer
can make sense of it.

27
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.340 
The important point that I
wanted to give you is that

28
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.840 
if you simply look at plain data you
have no idea what it means, because

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.560 
when we talk about data, data
is raw. It simply exists and

30
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
has no significance beyond its
own existence, that's it. So it

31
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.250 
can exist also in any form and we
are not talking about whether

32
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.280 
it's usable or
it's not usable.

33
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.970 
To make sense of data you have to come
across so called information, then you put

34
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.720 
data in perspective in
relation with each other.

35
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.680 
So information is data that has been
given meaning by way of relational

36
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.400 
connection and this meaning can be
useful, but it does not have to be.

37
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.740 
And this information usually is somehow
contained in terms of descriptions.

38
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.850 
Information answers to questions
that usually begin with words

39
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.960 
such as Who, What, When, Where or How
many and then you can answer these kind

40
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.100 
of questions.

41
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.790 
The next step beyond information
that would be knowledge, there

42
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.580 
you put again things into
perspective and you are about to

43
00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.190 
understand the principles of how
these things are connected. So

44
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.720 
knowledge is the appropriate collection
of information such that its intent

45
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.850 
is to be useful. So
now it's useful

46
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.330 
and even then beyond knowledge
if you come across let's say

47
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.400 
the guiding principles of how knowledge is
organized, how it's connected together,

48
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.070 
then you end up with wisdom. And this then
is the ability to make sound judgments

49
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.560 
and decisions.

50
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.410 
And the process to come from data
over information to knowledge

51
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.710 
and finally to wisdom this is understanding,
so understanding is a continuum

52
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.630 
that leads from data through
information and knowledge

53
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.300 
and alternatively
to wisdom.

54
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.240 
And usually say data transforms to
information simply by convention;

55
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.580 
information transforms to
knowledge by cognition;

56
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.420 
and knowledge to wisdom
by contemplation.

57
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.890 
So this is the usual triangle or
let's say it's a fourfold pyramid

58
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.020 
the so called DIKW permit introduced
by Ackoff in nineteen eighty nine

59
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.680 
that puts into perspective data,
information, knowledge and wisdom.

60
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.770 
And for our purposes when we are
going to talk about knowledge

61
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.770 
graphs later in the lecture, we are on
the so called knowledge lecture in

62
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.460 
level and for us knowledge
always is information enriched

63
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.730 
with semantics and semantics is
the meaning of the information

64
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.970 
and we are going to explicitly
express and formalize that kind

65
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.460 
of meaning. So this is our purpose
and then we end up in so

66
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.700 
called knowledge graph. So you will
see how we will deal with that.

67
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.470 
But before we go further first we have
to understand what is knowledge.

68
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.190 
What is knowledge? If you look
at the world of course there

69
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.390 
are lots of truths
out in the world.

70
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.140 
Does any one of us know all the
truths that are out in the

71
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.810 
world? Of course not. So what's
inside my head? Is everything

72
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.150 
inside my head that
I know true?

73
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.610 
Probably not. So we have lots of
so called beliefs in our head

74
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.440 
and as you see here there is an
intersection between the beliefs

75
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.250 
that anyone believes and the truth.
And exactly this intersection

76
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.760 
are the so called true beliefs
but is this already knowledge?

77
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.070 
Do we really know that exactly
these kind of beliefs that we had

78
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.340 
are true? If they are true,
like in that intersection?

79
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.000 
Probably we don't know
this about all of them

80
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.490 
which means what we are talking
about is knowledge. These are

81
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.490 
the so called justified true beliefs.
These are the true beliefs of whom

82
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.800 
of which we already know that
they are really really true. So

83
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.550 
we have confirmation
about that.

84
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.180 
We could express this also in a
more formal way. So in philosophy

85
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.150 
you talk about the so called
tripartite analysis of knowledge

86
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.270 
and then you say s knows
that p, p is some fact,

87
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.190 
if and only if p the fact is true
and then s believes of course

88
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.690 
that p is true and as a third point
s is also justified in believing

89
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.230 
that p is true. Only then you
can talk about knowledge.

90
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.060 
So traditionally speaking you
say knowledge is a justified

91
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.350 
subset of all
true beliefs.

92
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.880 
And to represent knowledge what we
are going to need is a formal

93
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.010 
knowledge representation. It must
be formal that a computer is able

94
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.570 
to read and this is really important to
understand that kind of knowledge.

95
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.370 
And this we are going to do with so called
ontologies. So what are ontologies?

96
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.930 
The point is to convey knowledge. So
to share knowledge what you need is

97
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.450 
a common language Thomas Davenport,
former IBM employee, hs said once

98
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.440 
people can't share knowledge if they
don't speak a common language.

99
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.360 
And this common language for knowledge
exchange is really important.

100
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.190 
So what does it take for a
language to exchange knowledge?

101
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.190 
First of all to speak a common
language means we need common

102
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.080 
symbols and concepts. So this is
usually defined in terms of syntax.

103
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.310 
And then we need an agreement about
their meaning which is the semantics

104
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.990 
and of course then we have concepts
and they are somehow ordered

105
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.160 
hierarchically. So you need a
classification of these kind of

106
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.290 
concepts. This is in
the end a taxonomy.

107
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.270 
Aand then you talk about associations
and relations of those

108
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.300 
concepts which are formally
described in a Thesaurus and in

109
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.830 
the end of course you need rules and
knowledge about which relations

110
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.770 
are allowed and which
relations make sense.

111
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.300 
So these are the ontologies and
this is exactly where we are

112
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.650 
going to and what we are going
to talk about in the future

113
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.930 
in the course of
this lecture. But

114
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.590 
for the next lecture the most
important thing we are going

115
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:09.110 
to ask ourselves is how are we
going to represent knowledge.

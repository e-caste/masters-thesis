1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.316 
Now, we consider privacy aspects in the context of cloud computing.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.449 
What is cloud computing?

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.369 
Cloud is a metaphor, the metaphor which means that users

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.479 
do not see the technical infrastructure they are using.

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.749 
They do not see the storage machines for storing that data.

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.480 
They do not see the computers on which their programmes are run.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.819 
And they do not have to worry, to worry about how

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.030 
they use these computer resources.

9
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.780 
They simply get the resources which they

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.030 
need and which they want to have.

11
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.009 
To show us at hand of an example let's considere cloud data storage.

12
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.199 
Here the user is able via the Internet to

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.279 
store data without to know on which server

14
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.994 
the data is stored, which hardware is used for that and with which

15
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.379 
operating systems these hardware are run.

16
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.640 
They do not know where the data is stored.

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.409 
They do not have to take care

18
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.296 
about how the access control, how this access controls

19
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.801 
organised. Simply, if they want to store their photos or their videos

20
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.959 
or their production documents, they can use

21
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.996 
this cloud infrastructure to store this.

22
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
This is possible because there is Internet,

23
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.560 
fast internet with enough bandwidth that gives the possibility

24
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.379 
that the storage and the computer resources are no

25
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
more needed to use in a local environment.

26
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.340 
Over the Internet, infrastructures can be used far away,

27
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.499 
which are provided by cloud providers for the use

28
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.500 
of the user.

29
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.129 
So there is a very important development.

30
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.469 
We see this over the last year or so that the cloud technology has

31
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.979 
become more and more popular not only for the private users

32
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.809 
and which typically have difficulty with running own infrastructures, but is

33
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.113 
also very, very attractive for it for companies

34
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.899 
and IT companies.

35
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.120 
If we look said, we see that there are different

36
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.580 
cloud models offered.

37
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
Many, many cloud service providers offer, for example,

38
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.929 
that the user can use a software software user.

39
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.960 
There is no need for the user to deal with licencing or software with

40
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.679 
installing configuring. A software user simply wants to use a programme

41
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.739 
service provider provides this programme.

42
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.800 
This model is called software as a service,

43
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.439 
but it is also the possibility and the offer from the cloud provider

44
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.080 
to offer the usage of a platform, say, machinery with

45
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.702 
a special Windows operating systems so that the user can install his

46
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.080 
own programmes, run his own programmes on such platform.

47
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.240 
The platform about providing the machines, the

48
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.539 
cloud service provider is responsible and the user makes

49
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.219 
use of this platform in the cloud platform as a service.

50
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.350 
And finally, it's also possible that users simply want to have an infrastructure

51
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.900 
that frees him from running an own computing centre.

52
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.247 
So cloud providers of our infrastructure so

53
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.539 
that the user can run computers, they are with

54
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.819 
specified processing power or with the spitting fire storage

55
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.319 
space. And then he can install operating system and

56
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.594 
applications he or she likes to get.

57
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.189 
This model is called infrastructure as a service.

58
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.803 
So we see there is many possibilities, many different possibilities

59
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.816 
to use the cloud. And of course, in this different cloud, models

60
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.269 
also see responsibility for what's done in

61
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.259 
their models is split between the cloud provider

62
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.331 
and between the user. So here in the software as a service,

63
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.259 
almost all responsibility is with the cloud provider and

64
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.199 
the infrastructure, then the responsibility.

65
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.490 
And when the cloud provider has provided

66
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.511 
the infrastructure, if we look to the advantages, then there is a big advantage

67
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.850 
for the user that the user does not need to know.

68
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.930 
It does not need a computing structure in.

69
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.589 
Structure here, when he wants to use computing

70
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.829 
system, when he wants to run the software, when he wants to store data,

71
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.300 
see he can use the infrastructure, the software system,

72
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.119 
the data storage that's provided by the cloud provider.

73
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.449 
They simply need a device to input data

74
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.590 
to the cloud and to show the results

75
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.239 
from the applications from the software set to run in the cloud.

76
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.669 
And the other side, the cloud providers, they take care

77
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.620 
of the computing infrastructure. They install and update the programmes.

78
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.596 
They offer infra interfaces to use this infrastructure

79
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.850 
or to use these programmes.

80
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.600 
So they have professionals and they take care.

81
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.040 
That is, the software is updated to the

82
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.019 
latest possibility that that hardware is run

83
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.370 
safely and secure. There are more

84
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.410 
advantages that make such cloud a very attractive

85
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.569 
feature to be used by industry and end users.

86
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.460 
So users require less in-depth knowledge.

87
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.569 
Everything is offered as a service, as a managed service, for

88
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.379 
example. So back up of the data that's otherwise.

89
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.999 
If the computers are run on site in the location of the user,

90
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.149 
then the user is responsible to back up data.

91
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.619 
So the user is responsible to

92
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.689 
update the programmes that are used to manipulate the data as the

93
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.470 
user has to provide the right machinery for storage,

94
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.380 
users simply can access their data and software with all their devices

95
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.100 
from anywhere via the Internet. Also, this is a very important point.

96
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.379 
If the data, for example, are stored on a specific

97
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.059 
device from the user, only accessing this

98
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.569 
device gives users a possibility to access the data.

99
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.759 
If the data are stored in the cloud he can come from, he can access

100
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.420 
this data from any device, from any place

101
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.870 
manufacturers can save on devices because

102
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.139 
complex calculations take place in the cloud.

103
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.600 
Only data input and display of the results is necessary.

104
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.220 
So is this gives us a possibility with our small smartphones

105
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.319 
to run very complex application, smartphones simply

106
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.750 
is needed to put in our data.

107
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.492 
Our question, for example, for a search machine and then also search

108
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.369 
is done in the cloud.

109
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.847 
Large measuring machinery is necessary to that end and then the

110
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.579 
results are transported over the Internet and can be displayed

111
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.949 
on a smartphone, although the data management becomes

112
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.850 
much easier to restoration the exchange of data.

113
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.385 
So it is relatively hard to organise pick up at home at

114
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.899 
a comparable backup level and much more expensive when it's

115
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.130 
hardware that needs power or software time.

116
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.519 
This all is what's done on side of the cloud provider

117
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.437 
and I think I didn't mention yet.

118
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.289 
But you notice that you have to pay the cloud

119
00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:42.928 
service only for usage, so only

120
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.959 
for that you use you have to pay

121
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.179 
if you has to have to install hardware and software

122
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.260 
on your own, to have to buy hardware, to install software in your own place,

123
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.710 
you has to pay for the hardware.

124
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.519 
You has to pay as a licence for the software, even in cases you are not using

125
00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.809 
the hardware software.

126
00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.269 
So cloud infrastructures are usually quite professionally protected against

127
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.919 
attacks. This is, in our security context, very important,

128
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.479 
though. The cloud providers profit professional team

129
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.710 
is running the infrastructure is installing software.

130
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.959 
So they knew very exactly what to do and how to protect

131
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.399 
infrastructure and software against attacks.

132
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.369 
Even employees of cloud service providers that have access to

133
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.039 
user data, they must be checked.

134
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.380 
They must be kind of certificate, because this when we speak

135
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.670 
about security, that's the problem with the cloud services,

136
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.230 
said the people there have access to.

137
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.319 
ADA or to the systems, so many I.T.

138
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.613 
systems are now closely linked to the cloud, for example, or modern

139
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.190 
operating systems use cloud technologies.

140
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.769 
Many, many applications use cloud technologies, for example, to automatically

141
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:22.349 
update or do other things, particularly if we look to the Apple

142
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:27.120 
IO OS X system and the iOS system,

143
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.000 
they are integrated with cloud.

144
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.649 
So, for example, the photo library that drives the key chain

145
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.560 
passwords back up, including applications and application data.

146
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.759 
If I had my iPhone iPad to make a antitheft software

147
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.679 
or is linked to the

148
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.730 
idea and stored in the cloud.

149
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.809 
But this is not only true in the AP world, but it is

150
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.109 
also true in the Android world.

151
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.809 
So Android phones are integrated into the cloud.

152
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.737 
Google is responsible here, so settings, contact, data apps and

153
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.179 
application data can be stored in the cloud.

154
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.870 
During the Android smartphone,

155
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.419 
one only has the chance to start such application to put

156
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.527 
in data and to see the results of the as is

157
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.988 
the results of that application, all the computing work or the

158
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.169 
access to data. This is realised in the cloud

159
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.299 
here. The activity is linked to cloud account

160
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.399 
and also Windows 10, the one drive

161
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.329 
for photos and office documents for Back Up and Dods.

162
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.669 
All is realised by means of cloud technology.

163
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.610 
And here there is a link to the Microsoft account.

164
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.890 
Speaking about the integration of cloud computing, then, for example, such

165
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.637 
such applications like voice recognition software, for example,

166
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.517 
Siri or Cortana or Google Voice search also

167
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.980 
work with cloud technology.

168
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.929 
Otherwise, this would not be possible to provide such

169
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.679 
kind of service and such kind of quality in the service.

170
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.399 
But they are much more examples.

171
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.760 
For example, document processing in the cloud.

172
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.529 
The browser is used as the editor for the

173
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.481 
document. So Google Docs is such and such an application or Microsoft

174
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.480 
Office 365.

175
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.969 
This are Web apps and that systems can be used over

176
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.350 
the Web to to create documents,

177
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.940 
to manipulate documents, to share documents,

178
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.960 
particularly sharing argument is very important.

179
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.812 
If the data if the documents would be stored on a specific

180
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.269 
device to share the documents, it needs to give other

181
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.080 
people access to this device.

182
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.579 
This is often very difficult, but if the documents are located in the cloud, then

183
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.929 
it becomes very easy to give access to also

184
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.709 
resize people to data storage is a service which

185
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.179 
is very convenient when cloud approach is

186
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.218 
used. For example, Dropbox or Google drive our famous services

187
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.840 
here, even for software development, for example, cloud nine,

188
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.739 
dot com or code anywhere, dotcom.

189
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.849 
These are services that are in the cloud that

190
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.249 
provides and that support with software development.

191
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.559 
In our calls, we speak about security, and particularly this week,

192
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.480 
we are concentrated on privacy aspects, what to say about privacy

193
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.440 
and cloud computing.

194
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.175 
So in order to enable cloud functionality, computers or

195
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.035 
the smartphones or the tablets must be connected almost

196
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.519 
permanently to the Internet because to send data to

197
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:29.350 
receive results, all this needs Internet connexion,

198
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.443 
although not directly linked to the cloud, technology manufacturers

199
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.649 
surveillance or collection of data and use activities

200
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.659 
is similar and uses the same technologies.

201
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.640 
So the main risk are similar without special precaution,

202
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.399 
without special operating special

203
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.179 
precautions. The operating system manufactures of the cloud service

204
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.649 
providers. They have full access to the data, to all the data

205
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.990 
and to all the locks which are stored in the cloud.

206
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.927 
So the locks and lock data give information about how

207
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.570 
the data are processed, by which by which applications data oppressed.

208
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.850 
So compromising the user account usually offers

209
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.860 
full access, full access to all the data.

210
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.869 
So it was a question how to protect the account we discussed in our course

211
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.149 
at the risk of such a cloud so users cannot protect

212
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.799 
themselves against an attack on cloud infrastructure if the attacker

213
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:46.929 
attack and cloud. So users is not aware of this, the user has no chance

214
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.669 
to interact. So user it completely depends from the ability

215
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.269 
of the cloud provider to to

216
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.499 
deal with such an attack situation.

217
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.896 
And of course, because that iCloud users are

218
00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.740 
a target, many users do not realise that data is an

219
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.456 
accurate data synchronisation that needs to be done to

220
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.460 
a give to, for example, in a document

221
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.956 
to synchronise the data in the cloud and on the device

222
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.475 
of the user. It's often done silently in the background

223
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.239 
where the user is doing other things and all data like photos

224
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.519 
or documents are synchronised within the cloud

225
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.333 
storage. Otherwise it would not work.

226
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.289 
Otherwise this would not be able that the users can have a huge amount

227
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.239 
of data and then he can click on and can show a photo from last

228
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.130 
year. So there need to be done synchronisation

229
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.370 
between the cloud and the device.

230
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.409 
So even users who are informed about such cloud technology

231
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.710 
often underestimate the risk.

232
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.729 
So users themselves are so simple.

233
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.779 
Attack target for gaining access to cloud data storage

234
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.719 
systems engineering and to find out information about

235
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.279 
C C account access data.

236
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.744 
So for example, here in the famous, which was popular in

237
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.059 
the media, was Salib Gate and what to celebrate here,

238
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.619 
Hacker attacked the iCloud as the iCloud storage

239
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.362 
and they attacked the accounts of celebrities if

240
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:48.650 
iCloud storage. So by means of the email address,

241
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.589 
which were used by means of an e-mail address, which they

242
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.809 
use to steal passwords via phishing methods.

243
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.006 
So in this way, the attackers get the access

244
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:08.029 
data of a number of celebrities and then

245
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.619 
they use this to they use to steal

246
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.599 
passwords to get full access to their iCloud account.

247
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.539 
And then they could look through the data.

248
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.480 
And this was spectacular.

249
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.079 
They could store private photos of

250
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.334 
a naked person and publish them on the Internet to blame

251
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.930 
that person so as to prevent

252
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.717 
such events to a countermeasure to preserve

253
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:47.089 
privacy in cloud storage is again encryption

254
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.969 
encrypted simply encrypt data before uploading

255
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.469 
it to the cloud. Then even if attacker successfully

256
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.349 
get access to the account of a user, they can see

257
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.140 
data but or what they see are encrypted data.

258
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.928 
So they are not not able to make use to get informed

259
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.780 
or to to blame a user by the content of this data.

260
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.800 
So proprietary solutions with their own client applications, protocols

261
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.527 
and encryption are not trusted because nobody can use

262
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.645 
the source code to verify that encryption and

263
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.909 
encryption and that protocols.

264
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.707 
So iCloud data storage with access via open

265
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.849 
protocols, for example, such like Web stuff.

266
00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:47.299 
There are a number of products here in products and services

267
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.460 
here, and independent client software with encryption features

268
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.979 
guarantee data security, so use for encryption

269
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.720 
such services which are famous

270
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.029 
and checked in a sense.

271
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.105 
So for example, Duplicator is one popular free software

272
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.878 
for encrypting encryption for encrypted, incremental

273
00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.420 
back up. So this is a possibility to use

274
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.519 
with a free, accessible software

275
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.154 
to encrypt data before storing it in

276
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.920 
the cloud.

277
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.069 
But encryption typically requires user

278
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.340 
know how.

279
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.479 
Caution every time speaking about encryption, the key

280
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.819 
must never be lost because otherwise it's no longer possible

281
00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.440 
to decrypt the data.

282
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.959 
So here, encryption is a countermeasure, but one has

283
00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.469 
to deal with it in the right way.

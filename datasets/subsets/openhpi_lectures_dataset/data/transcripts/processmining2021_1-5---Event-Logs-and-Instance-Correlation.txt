00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.890 
Welcome to this video clip in which we
discuss event logs and instance correlation.

2
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.170 
So let's look what we have done so
far. So, so far we have created

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.370 
sets of events based on the heterogeneous
data that we found and that

4
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.410 
together specifies the execution of
insurance claim business processes.

5
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.010 
Now we want to create an event log
by ordering all those events.

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.830 
What is the event log? Well, we can
define an event log as follows -

7
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.610 
an event log consists of an
ordered list of events

8
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.980 
that have been observed for a
given process. And that's what

9
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.380 
we like to discuss
in this video clip.

10
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.190 
So we look at event log creation.
So to create an event

11
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.860 
log we need to investigate the
ordering of events. So far we

12
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.810 
were not interested in the
ordering, this is the place where

13
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.110 
we start looking at
the order of events

14
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.310 
and we use the timestamps in the
events to order all these events.

15
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.640 
So we took the effort of looking really
at the time stamps in this example.

16
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.030 
So here we have the claim
table that you see here

17
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
and you have the check
table that you see here.

18
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
And so maybe I can just

19
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.570 
increase the

20
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.310 
size a little
bit here. Okay.

21
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.020 
So we have here the situation that
the first activities that occurred

22
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.760 
are occurred on the third
of April. So this is the

23
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.730 
first activities and there are also
some on the sixth. So the first

24
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.280 
claims have arrived between the third
of April and the sixth of April

25
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.040 
and the last one sixth of April at 8:10
and then the seventh of april comes.

26
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.080 
And if we now go to
the check table,

27
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.220 
we see that the first check occurs on the
sixth of April at 08:23.

28
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.530 
So we have first a number of
receive events and then we have

29
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.360 
the first check event.

30
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.270 
And we did this for the first
couple of events. So and that's

31
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.590 
represented by this event log that you
see here now we have the event log.

32
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.990 
And you see we have these smaller
and larger symbols. We use

33
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.830 
these as brackets to show ordering.
So whenever we have this

34
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.560 
smaller and larger symbols we use these
as brackets to indicate ordering

35
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.790 
between events. So the first event
that we find here is the event

36
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.230 
receive claim for the claim with the ID
1234. That's exactly the

37
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.590 
first thing
that happened

38
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.090 
at 08:05 on April the third.

39
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.950 
Then we have a number of other receive
claim events. You'll see them here

40
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.120 
until we have a check
claim completeness

41
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.980 
completeness event for
case 1239.

42
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.640 
So here the first check claim
completeness event comes in

43
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.290 
and then we have a number of
receive claim events or receive

44
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.310 
claim 1241 and
so forth. This happened

45
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.160 
a bit later. So you see here
events of different cases and

46
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.180 
how these are ordering. That's basically
what we have observed in the data.

47
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.890 
So now let's motivate instance
correlation. So instance

48
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.310 
correlation is an important concept
not only in process mining

49
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.330 
but also in business process
management in general.

50
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.730 
Correlation always relates
to well coupling different

51
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.590 
things or classifying
different things.

52
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.580 
And the question is
basically in which event

53
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.880 
orderings are we
really interested.

54
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.400 
Which ordering of events
are really relevant for process

55
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.500 
mining and
which are not.

56
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
And that is that is based on
instance correlation. So let's look

57
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.550 
let's look at this following example.
So again I'll show you my laser pointer.

58
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.270 
So which orderings are we really
interested in. So let's look at

59
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.080 
receive claim for claim
ID 1234 occurs before

60
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.690 
check claim completeness for
claim ID 1235.

61
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.540 
So we have claim ID 1234
claim came in and then at a

62
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.260 
later point in time another
claim was checked.

63
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.700 
Are we interested in this
ordering? I'm not sure.

64
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.610 
We also find on ordering check
claim completeness 1236

65
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.190 
occurs before receive claim 1244.

66
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.850 
And you can find all these
dependencies, all these orderings

67
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.500 
you can find in the event log
obviously. So let's look again

68
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.300 
the first one is just the
first two events here, right.

69
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.470 
And we also see that check claim
completeness 1234 occurs before

70
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.090 
receive claim 1234,
so here we have check claim

71
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.510 
completeness 1236
and that occurs before

72
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.330 
receive claim 1244.

73
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.330 
I'll be interested
in those -

74
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.860 
probably not. No, we are not interested
in these. Why? Well, because

75
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.080 
it's apples and oranges. Apples and
oranges being different claim

76
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.270 
identifiers and this is

77
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.220 
where we closely need to look at.
So we are not interested in

78
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.530 
these types of orderings. In which types
of orderings we are interested? Well

79
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.930 
we are interested in the ordering of
events with the same case identifier.

80
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.270 
So we are interested in events that
occur in one process instance

81
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.440 
in one case and these are events with
the very same case identifier.

82
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.210 
So in this example we are interested
that receive claim 1234

83
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.550 
is executed before check claim
completeness 1234.

84
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.500 
That is an important ordering because
it relates to one and only one

85
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.100 
claim with the number 1234
and we have two activities. We

86
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.080 
have receive claim and we have
check claim completeness and

87
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.310 
these are ordered in time. These are
ordered in time and we are interested

88
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.050 
in these orderings, in orderings of
events that refer to the same case.

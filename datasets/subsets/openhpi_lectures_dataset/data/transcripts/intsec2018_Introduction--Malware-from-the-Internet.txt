00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.460 
Welcome to the third week
of our openHPI course on

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.890 
internet security. This
week is about malware.

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.170 
Malicious software that
attackers are using

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.360 
to get access to computers,
to get access to data.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.180 
Malicious software is one
of the major threats

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.620 
on the internet. When we speak
about security on the internet

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.850 
and when we speak about
the dangers. Then

8
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.480 
the topic of malicious
software is of great

9
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.170 
importance and we will need all
the week to discuss this.

10
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.870 
Malicious software is
malicious software, malware

11
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.720 
refers to software that
typically is smuggled by the

12
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.970 
internet by hackers and cybercriminals
onto devices, onto the

13
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.160 
laptop, onto the smartphone
of unsuspecting users,

14
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.790 
in order to commit cyber-attacks.
There are many different

15
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.000 
types of such malware for
distraction or manipulation

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.770 
of data. Another malware
is designed for password

17
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.400 
theft, for espionage
or sabotage. The

18
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.530 
limitation of system functionalities
is one of the attack ideas

19
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.650 
which are realized
by malware,

20
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.380 
extortion, remote control.
There is a really long list

21
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.160 
What such malware is doing
to disturb the user,

22
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.280 
to theft his data, to get
insight into his systems.

23
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.570 
There is a long list also of
different malware types.

24
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.680 
For example viruses,
worms, trojans, botnets,

25
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.530 
rootkits, ad aware, spyware, and much
more. In the most cases today malware

26
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.190 
contains several
malicious functions.

27
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.680 
So sometimes additional
components can be added.

28
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.900 
So there are distinctions
between this different types.

29
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
Modern software has properties
of different types.

30
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.910 
The other
important topics

31
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.600 
of this week are
botnets. Botnets

32
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.360 
constitute a particular
threat on the Internet.

33
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.250 
The idea here is that
there is an attacker

34
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.980 
collecting a huge number of
systems and connects, starts

35
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.170 
to control the systems. The
systems are then called" bots".

36
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.920 
When the attacker
with his

37
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.330 
controlling command
server gives the signal

38
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.350 
all these bots to start to
do something. For example,

39
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.160 
one to get access to the server
so that the server no way able

40
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.030 
to react in the right way. So the
idea of these bots are remote

41
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.170 
controlled and the user typically do
not know this and do not see this.

42
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.910 
However mobile systems and
smartphones are also threaded by

43
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.410 
malware. So when we discuss
malware, we have to see that

44
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.040 
there is a great variety of
activities of types of software

45
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.810 
of attacks against
our systems.

46
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.530 
So what we want to do
this week. We will

47
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.610 
give a first introduction to the
different types and characteristics

48
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.650 
of the malware, and
consider the malfunctions

49
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.600 
which comes with such
a malware. Then

50
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.190 
we will closer
look to botnets

51
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.430 
which due to their huge
number of remote

52
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.490 
-controlled systems, trigger very
special attacks and threats,

53
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.690 
which are really
dangerous.

54
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.900 
Then we will revisit
some spectacular

55
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.040 
malware attacks, to help
understand the threats

56
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.030 
of these kinds of malware. But this
will not only involve attacks

57
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.980 
on laptops, on computers which
are connected to the internet,

58
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.340 
but we will also see attacks
against smartphones

59
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.450 
and mobile apps. And finally
we will discuss and deal

60
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.160 
extensively with protection measures
to address malware attacks

61
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.880 
and to help you to protect
against infiltration

62
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.370 
by malware. There is, again
some especially we have,

63
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.150 
an excursion. This is something
we provide knowledge,

64
00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.300 
so, to give more technical insights
we have prepared an excursion

65
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.490 
on firewalls and what their
general function and

66
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.050 
the idea behind. And then we
have a closer look and we give

67
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.460 
a closer look into personal
firewalls for windows systems and

68
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.850 
their configuration. This
is to help and give

69
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.190 
special interested
participants the possibility

70
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.410 
to have a closer look. But this
materials these excursions

71
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.950 
can be skipped the content
the topics of all the other

72
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
parts of our openHPI courses
can be understood,

73
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.500 
can be understood without
taking part in this

74
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.530 
and looking to this excursion.
But we know that some of you

75
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.520 
are interested in more details
and by means of the excursion.

76
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.270 
We will give some
more detail.

77
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.940 
So, what we hope also
for this week is that

78
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.150 
you can build knowledge
and you also have fun

79
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.770 
when you deal with, and when you
are engaging with the topic

80
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.180 
of malware in our
course in week three.

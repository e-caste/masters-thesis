Welcome to our presentation about
TransPipe- A Pipeline for Automated

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.660 
Transcription and
Translation of Videos.

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.950 
This is a joint work with many
colleagues from the Hasso Plattner

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.380 
Institute. You can see
all of the names here.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.130 
But first of all, why do we need a
pipeline for automated transcription

6
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.530 
and translation
of videos?

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.040 
Massive Open Online
Courses, in short, MOOCs

8
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.280 
have conveyed knowledge to people
all over the world provided

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.070 
by universities or
corporations, for example.

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.750 
They often use videos to convey
knowledge about the topic,

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.090 
often use quizzes to help the learners
reflect on their knowledge,

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.560 
and provide discussion in a forum between
different participants of a MOOC.

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.130 
And the latter two usually
consist of textual content.

14
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.280 
However, videos are multimedia and often
rely on audio to convey knowledge

15
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.070 
as the speaker could explain his/her
presentation or topic in more detail and

16
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.270 
often what we can
visually see.

17
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.390 
Thus, multimedia without subtitles
makes the content of courses

18
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.770 
inaccessible or at least hardly accessible
for hearing-impaired learners.

19
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.630 
However, if we provide subtitles then
the content would be much easier to

20
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.040 
consume for hearing-impaired learners
and also help to navigate the course

21
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070 
and provides indexing and
retrieval for search engines.

22
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.450 
We looked at the workflow for
the creation of subtitles.

23
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.780 
In addition to maybe, hearing-impaired
learners, of course, we also consider

24
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.990 
that some learners just don't speak
the language the course is given in,

25
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.260 
but are maybe, familiar with
a different language.

26
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.170 
Thus, in this context, we always considered
a transcript which is the original

27
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.540 
language of the speaker and the translations
of these transcripts which both are

28
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.040 
subtitles for
the video.

29
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.510 
And there are many different
tools to support creating such

30
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.630 
transcripts and translations, for
example, to create translations-

31
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.280 
speech-to-text programs automatically
generate a transcript

32
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.180 
and then machine translation can
be used to start from this

33
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.390 
automatically generated transcript to create
translations into different languages.

34
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.180 
However, we found that there is
still a lot of manual work needed

35
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.850 
which also slows down the process
and makes it harder for users.

36
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.910 
First of all, we found that only English
works reliably and many tools,

37
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.530 
for example, speech-to-text could
be not as good for languages

38
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.010 
that are not
very common.

39
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.390 
We found that the integration
of various tools can be quite

40
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.020 
complicated and users manually
need to upload files to the

41
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.180 
various tools they want
to use or the programs.

42
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.180 
We also found
that often

43
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.390 
coordination with a different
linguistic expert is needed, for

44
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.030 
example, for different languages there could
be different linguistic experts which help

45
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.100 
to provide a
translation.

46
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.240 
We looked at previous projects
in the MOOC landscape.

47
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.620 
transLectures tried to improve the
transcription quality of videos

48
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.560 
with slides and
previous lectures.

49
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.220 
The Machine Learning and Language
Processing Group (MLLP) at the

50
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.330 
Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Valencia
focused on speech recognition

51
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.180 
and also machine translation for
video content and provided

52
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.090 
a prototype- poliTrans that helps
ease the workflow, for example,

53
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.810 
to make corrections to a translation
or transcript for single videos.

54
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.360 
The European Multiple
MOOC Aggregator (EMMA)

55
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.620 
offered multi-lingual
and large scale MOOCs

56
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.220 
but they mostly focused
on textual content and

57
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.450 
most videos had
no subtitles.

58
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.500 
Finally, TraMOOC did a field test with
translating all content types including videos.

59
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.100 
We found some shortcomings
in the previous projects.

60
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.780 
They were often missing an end-to-end
workflow within the MOOC platform.

61
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.680 
Furthermore, incompatibility with
subtitle formats containing timestamps

62
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.030 
would lead to errors and
needed manual correction.

63
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.650 
We also found that often tools would lack the
support to actually place punctuation marks

64
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.060 
within automatically
generated transcripts.

65
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.910 
Finally, we found that

66
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.750 
current MOOC providers often use a manual
combination of different services

67
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.410 
to get a satisfying
end result.

68
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.980 
Our goal was to integrate all the
different services that are

69
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.180 
available for the different steps
and also provide the users

70
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.290 
or the linguistic experts to
provide corrections when needed.

71
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.670 
And to integrate all of this in a simple
way and make it configurable enough

72
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.550 
for different book
providers to use.

73
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.780 
We called it TransPipe- a Transcription
and Translation Pipeline.

74
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.520 
How did we do this? First of all,
we did a requirement analysis;

75
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.410 
used the user-centered design thinking
approach and started with interviews

76
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.210 
with the process
owners.

77
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.960 
Based on these interviews, we derived
a model of the current workflow

78
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.380 
to visualize pain points
in the process,

79
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.420 
and afterward created and tested
the first wireframes that could

80
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.870 
help solve
those issues.

81
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.980 
We developed a final prototype based
on the feedback that we received

82
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.340 
for the wireframes.

83
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.880 
We used three different MOOC partners
which all run their own MOOC platform.

84
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.450 
One of them is from the education
sector, one is in a large

85
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.490 
enterprise and the third one
is from the health sector.

86
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.560 
We want to look now at
one of the workflows

87
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.960 
that creates a
transcript.

88
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.360 
First of all, the administrators would
request a transcription by volunteers.

89
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.740 
The volunteers would then perform this
transcription using different tools,

90
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.260 
for example, YouTube,
AWS, or MLLP.

91
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.710 
They would then inform the administrators
once it's done about the transcript.

92
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.030 
The administrators would send a transcript
to a linguistic expert for feedback

93
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.300 
and the linguistic expert would proof-read the
transcript, make corrections when needed

94
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.320 
and send a final transcript
back to the administrators.

95
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.960 
The administrators would then sometimes
need to fix encoding issues

96
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.710 
and finally, save the transcript and
upload it to the MOOC platform.

97
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.250 
This is the process for transcript
but it is almost identical

98
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.690 
for creating a translation
of a transcript.

99
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.880 
When looking at this workflow
we identified a few issues.

100
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.450 
First of all, there was a
lack of transparency.

101
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.430 
It was often unclear what is the current status
of the transcription and the translations.

102
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.610 
which file is the newest version?
There was no versioning system.

103
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.500 
And regarding the versioning, we also
found further issues, sometimes,

104
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.100 
the previous version of a subtitle
was lost when a file was

105
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.530 
overwritten in error.

106
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.510 
We also found that the lack of a common
environment leads to some issues.

107
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.110 
The collaboration was not very well
supported by the current workflow.

108
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.750 
The files were shared between the
participants by sending them through email.

109
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.460 
And since, different
users use different

110
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.860 
systems, different programs:
sometimes, encoding issues

111
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.250 
arose by those users and needed
to be corrected manually.

112
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.230 
We also found a lack of automation:
the services were often

113
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.670 
not integrated.

114
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.610 
The conversion between different file
formats also needed to be done manually

115
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.210 
and the administrators, of course,
needed to manually upload

116
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.720 
the files to the
MOOC platform.

117
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.590 
Of all, we identified these four
requirements that we already looked at

118
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:04.340 
during the issues. We provide or want to provide,
in our prototype, transparency for users:

119
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.280 
which step is a subtitle or a
transcript or translation

120
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.420 
and what needs to
be done next.

121
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.460 
We want to write a common environment,
that is, in the best case

122
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.870 
integrated very well into the MOOC
platform where all users just

123
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.530 
have one platform they
need to work on.

124
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.510 
We want to provide versioning, so,
no file is written with errors

125
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.330 
and also users can look at the
changes and see what was done.

126
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.420 
Finally, we want to provide automation: to
integrate the various services automatically

127
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.190 
and also provide, for example,
uploading of the final files to

128
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.680 
the MOOC platform
automatically.

129
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.410 
If we look at the first prototype,
this is what you could see.

130
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.900 
Say, we are a MOOC provider and we
have two different lectures. You

131
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.500 
could immediately see in the prototype
the number of published subtitles-

132
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.230 
3 out of 24.

133
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.870 
If we then looked at the course in
detail, we could see a course section

134
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.210 
and look at one of those videos
and would see, ok, this video

135
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.890 
just has 1 out of 3
subtitles published.

136
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.180 
If we now looked into further detail
for this video, we could see that

137
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:18.070 
the languages, Arabic and Chinese are
already automatically generated

138
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.100 
but only the English one is
already done and published.

139
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:28.970 
Finally, we had a view where users could
edit a transcript directly on the platform

140
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.120 
by having the video and the
transcription editor side by side.

141
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.130 
Doing the evaluation of this
first prototype we found

142
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.950 
that the general features were
very valued by the partners,

143
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.070 
the available transcription and
translation service that were

144
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.170 
automatically integrated
helped a lot.

145
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.390 
Also, the integration within the MOOC
platform was already good for the users.

146
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.010 
However, we also found that the
workflow could still be improved.

147
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.540 
The user navigation within
TransPipe was not always clear.

148
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.990 
Furthermore, some of our partners
needed support for various

149
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.910 
roles and permissions, so, not all users could
change everything about the subtitles.

150
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.540 
Finally, the users wanted a deeper
linking in the MOOC platforms

151
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.190 
to make it easier to
reach the prototype.

152
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.420 
Since we started the project, we
continued the work and already

153
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.490 
did some of these improvements,
for example, if we look at the

154
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.760 
course administration panel of
our platform, we can directly

155
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.550 
go to the subtitles in our
TransPipe prototype.

156
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.880 
If we now look at the overview page
of a course, we can on one glance

157
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.240 
see the different languages and
the status of the subtitles

158
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.610 
for each of the languages,
for each of the videos.

159
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.300 
The color-coding could
still be improved here.

160
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.020 
We enhanced the video details with comments,
so, users could make a note about

161
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.160 
things that still needed to be
changed or corrections that

162
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.030 
need to be made.

163
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.790 
Also at the bottom of this page,
we added a visualization of

164
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.970 
the workflow to make it clear to
users what the next step is

165
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.920 
and what the state of the item they
are currently working on is.

166
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:14.190 
In this case, for example, we would directly see
that the translation is already published.

167
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.320 
Now we want to look at the
future work in this area.

168
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.250 
First of all, the subtitle editor could
be improved with timing support

169
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:28.770 
to help users who are working on
transcription or translation directly see

170
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.710 
how the changes affect the display
of the subtitles in the video.

171
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.660 
Also, users should be informed
about the formatting, since, the

172
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.640 
WebVTT format
for subtitles

173
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.380 
needs to be valid, so, if they make
an error they should be informed

174
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.470 
by our prototype what
they need to change.

175
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.110 
Finally, some of our partners want support
for custom terminology that is often

176
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.840 
translated or transcribed in
error by automatic processes,

177
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.520 
and some of our partners request
a weekly PDF summary export

178
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.300 
that they can use to inform other
members of the team about

179
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.490 
the state of the
MOOC or course.

180
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.350 
Finally, we want to conclude: subtitles
improve the accessibility of,

181
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.400 
especially, videos and MOOCs. They allow
search engines to index the video content

182
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.160 
and our prototype TransPipe
helps reduce the manual work

183
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.380 
that is needed for creating
subtitles- whether it is about the

184
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.250 
transcription of the original speaker
or translation into a new language.

185
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.360 
It visualize the workflow
to the different users

186
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.300 
and supports further research regarding the
quality of other generated subtitles.

187
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.120 
Furthermore, it already helps MOOC providers
to add subtitles to their videos

188
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.700 
and make them more accessible
to hearing-impaired learners

189
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.150 
and to learners who don't speak the
original language of speakers,

190
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.370 
individuals that are
used in MOOCs.

191
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.650 
We thank you for your attention
and your interest in TransPipe.

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.020 
welcome to the second video of the introduction to Qiskit course

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.580 
in this video we are going to go through the IBM quantum services platform

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.360 
and you will learn how to access the quantum devices that we

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.280 
have in the cloud as well as the simulators

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.550 
so let's have a look at it

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.900 
how to find it is the first question you have to type into

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.750 
your favorite search engine ibm quantum and the first link you will see

8
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.000 
will be this one so you can see

9
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.500 
here the details it's www.ibm.com/quantum

10
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.950 
so here you have basically all the information you need but

11
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.880 
we are going to go to the top right corner and click on launch ibm quantum

12
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.210 
it will bring you to these

13
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.880 
platform and here you will have first to create an account

14
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.520 
there are many different ways to do it you can use your gmail

15
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.690 
get have linkedin twitter or just any e-mail account so with that

16
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.540 
let's sign in

17
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.640 
it will first ask you to fill in some questions just about

18
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.940 
the knowledge you currently have of quantum is there some statistics

19
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.530 
that we gather to know a little bit better the users that are accessing our devices

20
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.530 
and when you are done you should see the main dashboard that looks like this

21
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.940 
it will welcome you and here let us exploring what we

22
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.250 
have access to right now

23
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.160 
so if you go to the menu which is on the top

24
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.190 
left corner these nine

25
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.300 
little squares you can click on it and you can see actually all the

26
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.680 
tabs that we have access to so basically we have

27
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.300 
two main tools one is the composer that we will have a look

28
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.190 
to in the next video and the other one is the quantum lab which

29
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.830 
is basically the tool that we will use for the rest of the course

30
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.650 
but right now we are only exploring the platform

31
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.210 
itself so we are going to first have a look at this services

32
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.820 
so let's click on it and as you can see there are many things that we can

33
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.920 
look for here but right now we are going

34
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.910 
to focus first in the simulators so right now because of the

35
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.870 
maturity of the technology it's also important to have simulators

36
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.810 
that are based in classical high performance computing machines

37
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.010 
this way we have like a double check to verify that the behavior

38
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
of the real machines is actually what we expected

39
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.620 
and that's why we also provide access to high performance

40
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.700 
computing machines in the cloud classical ones

41
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.180 
because probably you don't have access to a high performance

42
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.480 
computing cluster on your own or if you do you're probably

43
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.200 
working in a data center but for most of the people

44
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.910 
it's also handy to have access to such a machine because it's quite powerful

45
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.990 
and as you can see the main one that we're going to use is the IBMQ QASM

46
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.510 
simulator which is the one that mimics an actual device

47
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.760 
and it can simulate up to 32 Qubits

48
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.510 
we will see later that it's also possible to install

49
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.700 
a simulator on your own machine so

50
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.690 
if for any reason you have access to a cluster or you have

51
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.090 
you a GPU and you want to try it locally in your machine that's also

52
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.920 
possible and we will show how to do that but you always have

53
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.190 
the option of executing your experiments in the simulator that

54
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.530 
is already available in the cloud

55
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.610 
so as i said the

56
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.230 
IBMQ QASM simulator is the one that simulates up to 32 Qubits

57
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.090 
and it mimics the behavior of an actual device

58
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.080 
you can make ideal simulations as we will see which means they

59
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.610 
do not have noise or you can also do

60
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.050 
simulations of noise

61
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.750 
and there are different simulators but we will learn more about

62
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.070 
it in the next lesson

63
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.760 
so what else do we have access to and this is the most interesting part

64
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.670 
of it because we were the first company to boot

65
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.560 
to give open access to a quantum computer in the cloud

66
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.700 
we did it in 2016

67
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.740 
for the first time so now as you can see we have a full list

68
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.940 
of all the devices that we have they have different names of cities

69
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.220 
and you can check information about all of them but some of

70
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.330 
them have a little locker symbol and some of them don't

71
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.820 
so depending on the account that you have you will have access to

72
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.260 
one device or another

73
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.660 
in this case i have a normal account so this is the one that

74
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.780 
most of you will have and therefore you you have access to

75
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.320 
the ones that do not have the locker so let's have a look at

76
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.110 
how they look like let's open one

77
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.050 
one of them in this case ibmq_lima

78
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.550 
you can take the topology of the background so that means how the Qubits

79
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.950 
are actually physically connected

80
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
and then you have a lot of information also about the error

81
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.320 
the different error rates

82
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.470 
another important data that we may want to have into account

83
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.180 
when executing an experiment

84
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.900 
we can download all these data in a csv file

85
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.620 
about the last calibration, they are calibrated daily

86
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.110 
here we can also we have these

87
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.400 
tool to check each of the different

88
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.220 
data that we might be interested in

89
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.520 
for all the different Qubits and also for the connection among them

90
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.770 
but we do not yet have information about the Qubit dense but

91
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.390 
also about the processors so if you remember about the road map

92
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.460 
you probably have seen or have noticed that all of them have

93
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.770 
its a generation of processors have a different name so here

94
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.770 
you have information about what is the

95
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.590 
generation of this concrete processor

96
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.590 
you also have the basis gates which are the gates that can

97
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.480 
be executed in this concrete processor

98
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.090 
you have information about

99
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.020 
the power of these

100
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.090 
of these processors so there are many things that we have to

101
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.660 
take into account it's not only about the number of Qubits but also

102
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.820 
about the CLOPS - the circuit layer operations per second and

103
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.300 
we have defined a metric which is called quantum volume that

104
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.570 
measures the quality of the Qubits it takes into account

105
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.080 
many things we are also working as

106
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.500 
we are scaling the number of Qubits in coming up with would

107
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.900 
with increasing the quantum volume as we go so you have all

108
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.720 
the information you need to know exactly the machine you will

109
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.700 
be executing your experiments in

110
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.560 
you might be wondering so who has access to these premium devices

111
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.350 
and the answer is

112
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.760 
the members of the IBM quantum network which is an ecosystem of

113
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:26.290 
different partners, universities, research centres, start-ups, companies

114
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.240 
that are working with us we have some

115
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.290 
agreements with them so that they can access

116
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.240 
the premium devices but also

117
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.820 
to some of them if you are a researcher or an educator that need a

118
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.950 
premium access to some of the devices you can also request it here

119
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.840 
so in the menu you have the application form for both the researchers

120
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.590 
and educator program and it will give you also

121
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.470 
a premium access to some of the devices not to the biggest

122
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.760 
ones but to some of them

123
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.430 
so this is what we have access to and so far

124
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.630 
this is all you need to know

125
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.690 
and what else do we have in this platform as i said there are

126
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.970 
two tools so we will just have a quick look

127
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.930 
at both of them and we will get

128
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.440 
deeper into them in the next videos

129
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.810 
so first let's explore the composer

130
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.880 
the composer is a graphical tool to create a quantum circuits and

131
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.650 
also execute them in the different

132
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.040 
simulators or real devices that we have seen

133
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:49.280 
and we also have some of the tools that enable us to visualize

134
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.310 
the results that we are about to get if we execute this

135
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.030 
circuit in an actual bucket

136
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.970 
and well as i said we will play a little bit more with it in

137
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.280 
the next video so for now yes

138
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.060 
keep in mind that we have a graphical tool on the second one

139
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.890 
it's called the quantum lab

140
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.150 
and it's called quantum lab because it reminds us of our JupyterLab

141
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.480 
for those of you that are familiar with them

142
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.330 
and it's a environment where Qiskit is already installed

143
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.760 
and they're on up to date with

144
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.640 
with the latest version of Qiskit and here you can create

145
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:43.680 
different Jupyter Notebooks and you have an environment where

146
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.110 
everything is already installed

147
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.700 
there's also the possibility to work locally

148
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.310 
we will see that in the first video where you actually

149
00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:01.960 
start coding but for now just for you to be aware this is very convenient in case

150
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.740 
you don't want to lose time in installation

151
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.060 
you have an already set up

152
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.050 
environment to start coding

153
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.930 
and to start making your your experiments

154
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.220 
with that we have finished the tour

155
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.690 
of the IBM quantum service platform and in the next video

156
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.350 
we will make a recap about the quantum computing

157
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.510 
fundamentals so that you

158
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.060 
have everything fresh when we start coding

159
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.520 
thanks a lot and looking forward to see you in the next video

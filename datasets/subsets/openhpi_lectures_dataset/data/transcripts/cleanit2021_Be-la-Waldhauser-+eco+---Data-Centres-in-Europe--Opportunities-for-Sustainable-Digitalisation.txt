00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.606 
Welcome to our session data centers in Europe, opportunities for

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.709 
Sustainable Digitalization.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.592 
My name is Béla Waldhauser and I'm the spokesman of the Alliance for Strengthening Digital

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.790 
Infrastructures in Germany, which was founded on the roof of Eco

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.889 
Association of the Internet industry in 2018.

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.510 
And I'm also managing director of Telehouse, Germany.

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.959 
Just let me give you some information about who Eco is and what the alliance

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.960 
is focusing on.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.699 
With more than 1100 company members, Eco is the largest association

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.559 
of the Internet industry in Europe, Eco offers expert knowhow in the competence

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
groups. And we offer relevant services for companies and also for consumers.

12
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.820 
But most important, Eco represents the interests of their members in politics

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.060 
and in national and international committees.

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.639 
With this background, the Alliance for digital Infrastructures was founded under the roof

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.720 
of Eco in 2018.

16
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.390 
This alliance is focusing on the ecosystem of digital infrastructures

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.542 
because we are convinced that this is necessary to have an overall perspective

18
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.209 
of digitalization if we want to reach the goal of sustainability.

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.909 
What does this mean?

20
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.269 
To understand the impact of digitalization in our daily life just

21
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.189 
have a look on what is happening on the Internet.

22
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.610 
Meanwhile, I'm talking to you.

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.550 
What is happening in just one minute on the Internet?

24
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.063 
On YouTube, users upload 500 hours of video content every

25
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.314 
single minute. On Netflix,

26
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.939 
On the other hand, 400000 hours of videos are streamed right now

27
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.890 
worldwide and over 1 million video calls are just happening,

28
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.720 
while nearly over 412 million WhatsApp messages are sent.

29
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.410 
Consumers spend right now in this 1 minute over 1 million US

30
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.610 
dollars online. And the impact of the Internet for economy and society

31
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.370 
is still growing.

32
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.879 
But even more important than that, digitalization supports all

33
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.019 
17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations,

34
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.419 
each with a different approach and impact, but without digitalization,

35
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.360 
these goals are not to fulfill at all.

36
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.090 
Digitalization opens up new opportunities for sustainability.

37
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.369 
Digital transformation is opening new opportunities across sectors to reduce

38
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.259 
waste or improve efficiency through solutions such as predictive

39
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.069 
maintenance, smart supply chains or digital twins.

40
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.739 
According to Greenpeace study, over one, 1.6 Million tonnes of CO2

41
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.479 
could be saved only in Germany if employees work one day

42
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.539 
per week from home. That's a conservative scenario.

43
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.099 
With 25 percent of telework, traffic could be reduced by

44
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.649 
ten point nine billion kilometers.

45
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.666 
As a proof of concept, look at the Corona situation Since 2020.

46
00:03:13.713 --> 00:03:16.359 
Digital technologies and applications keep the country

47
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.849 
and its economy running while the lockdown.

48
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.370 
All over the country, people make positive experience while using video conferencing

49
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.039 
systems or online collaboration tools.

50
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.586 
The world's biggest Internet exchange point kicks sets

51
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.379 
a new world record on data exchange.

52
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.516 
In March 2020 was beginning of the first lockdown and then again

53
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.499 
in November 2020 was over 10 Terabit per second.

54
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.827 
Since then, the perspective of the meaning of digital infrastructures and

55
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.279 
technologies is changing in Germany, because behind

56
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.169 
all these tools and applications, digital infrastructure guaranteed

57
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.849 
the success of digitization and digital infrastructures on

58
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.559 
ecosystem of data centers, interconnection points and of course,

59
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.210 
broadband Internet access.

60
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.172 
And there the potentials for sustainable digital infrastructures are

61
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.618 
getting directly in the focus, and it's getting obvious where we have to start.

62
00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:26.759 
Percentages of fiber connection Total fixed broadband

63
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.970 
in June 2020 are showing where we are.

64
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.850 
Only four or seven percent of broadband access is based on five in Germany.

65
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.319 
So we are still far away from a leading position in the Internet to international

66
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320 
comparison.

67
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.769 
But why would it be so important to have more modern fiber based access in

68
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.543 
Germany? The ecosystem of digitalization I was talking about is significantly

69
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.749 
important for sustainable development.

70
00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.350 
Let's have a closer look, as the following graph illustrates the gateless

71
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.594 
roll out of fiber optic networks is essential to bringing down the

72
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.329 
CO2 footprint of digitalization, the estimated CO2

73
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.711 
emissions, while watching one hour of streaming is directly connected

74
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.429 
to the way it's transmitted.

75
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.730 
The fiber connection reduces the energy need about 50 percent in comparison

76
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.706 
to the old fashioned copper access.

77
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.439 
And if you use the mobile 5G connection for streaming, the amount

78
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.470 
of CO2 is also reduced by nearly 50 percent.

79
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.050 
These interconnection of a digital ecosystem is important to understand

80
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.519 
when we talk about the sustainability potential of data centers,

81
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.889 
because data centers have in this digital ecosystem a minor

82
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.199 
impact concerning CO2 emissions.

83
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.569 
And actually the CO2 emissions of data centers in Europe overall are declining

84
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.769 
over the past 5 years. Already, even the amount of data is growing,

85
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.491 
but actually the CO2 emissions of data centers are directly

86
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
connected to the energy mix of the country where data centers are placed.

87
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.082 
So the CO2 emission footprint is quite different when we have a look

88
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.610 
at the European countries.

89
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.119 
Norway and Sweden, for example, are using renewable energy for their data centers

90
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.220 
and France is still using atomic energy for data centers.

91
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.519 
No CO2 emissions, but is atomic energy sustainable?

92
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.570 
And Germany, well, we decide to leave the coal energy market

93
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.809 
in 2038.

94
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.125 
This is very late, especially when you have a look at the European goals of the green

95
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.579 
deal, where data centers should be climate neutral already in 2030.

96
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.249 
The energy needs of data centers has to be discussed and has to be part

97
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.709 
of the solution. Let's see what we can find out there.

98
00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.299 
Of course, digitalization needs energy,

99
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.213 
data center infrastructure needs energy for air conditioning, power

100
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.770 
supply, fire protection, etc.

101
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.730 
And of course, for their main task to run the service.

102
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.589 
But we are pretty good actually in getting more efficient in this area.

103
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.970 
Just a few numbers.

104
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.939 
Data centers, especially in Germany, become significantly more energy efficient

105
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.439 
in the last years. Between 2010 and 2020, the

106
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.489 
number of workloads and data centers increased by a factor of 10.

107
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.569 
IP traffic, even by a factor of 19.

108
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.389 
In terms of computing and storage capacity

109
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.076 
the energy requirements in the data centers have been reduced by a factor of 6 to 12

110
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.929 
in this time. And there's another big potential to save energy.

111
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.269 
Cloud based solutions enable an additional boost in efficiency up to

112
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.308 
80 percent. That means if, for example, small and medium sized

113
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.329 
companies in Germany will migrate their office IT and the service into the cloud,

114
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.239 
there's a huge potential in saving energy.

115
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.449 
What are the starting points for further promoting the sustainability

116
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.339 
of data centers? First of all,  we need to improve the framework

117
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.574 
in Germany for data centers. One, the energy system transformation

118
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.164 
and approving of the energy mix in Germany has to be high priority to German

119
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.701 
politicians. Second, the gapless rollout of fiber

120
00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:37.119 
optic networks is essential to bringing down the CO2 footprint of digitalization

121
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.269 
in the ecosystem of digital infrastructures.

122
00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:45.399 
Third, data center operators should be supported by inventing sector

123
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.634 
coupling innovations and in the area of power purchase agreements.

124
00:08:49.252 --> 00:08:53.769 
No. 4, further promote research that

125
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.445 
means in the field of new hardware solutions and of Moore's Law is just one

126
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.062 
example. Or in optimization of cooling and air conditioning but

127
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.840 
artificial intelligence.

128
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.745 
5, we need efficient algorithms and optimized software programing

129
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.690 
for efficiently running the service and the data centers.

130
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.299 
And six, and this is very important, promote waste heat utilization.

131
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.434 
In order to make waste heat recovery economically and ecologically

132
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.139 
feasible, we need modern low temperature heating networks.

133
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.270 
All the technologies require much higher temperatures, which increases

134
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.820 
challenges for data center operators.

135
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.190 
Currently in Germany, supplies of heat face a double whammy

136
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.719 
not only do many of the heating networks comprise older generations

137
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.579 
of technology, but also the electricity used to power

138
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.499 
a heat pump to bring the heat up to a usable temperature is subject

139
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.469 
to the renewable energy levy, e.g.

140
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.510 
this makes the provision of heat in this way economically unfeasible,

141
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.429 
which is part of the reason why there are so few use

142
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.460 
cases, examples operation in Germany.

143
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.749 
At the end of the day, there needs to be a change in attitude among energy

144
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.131 
suppliers, city planners, property developers and last but not least,

145
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.580 
governments.

146
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.559 
Wherever heat is produced as a by product, like in a data set,

147
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.047 
it should be mandatory for this heat to be taking it to heating networks, if at all

148
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:36.690 
possible.

149
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.049 
In Germany, there's no obligations for developers to take the heat or

150
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.999 
for energy suppliers to work in partnership with data centers as a producer

151
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.025 
of heat. And of course, an energy supplier can take the

152
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.946 
position that a partnership is not in their best interest because they can then sell

153
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.889 
less heat themselves.

154
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.672 
For the Twin Cities of the future, we need to transform our entire approach to

155
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.026 
creating and distributing heat to move away from every

156
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.289 
house, having its own independent and therefore less efficient heating

157
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.720 
system. Here, the data parks in Sweden, where data centers are planned

158
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.379 
and built from the outset to contribute to the district heating of

159
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.059 
the surrounding neighborhood can provide us with the model for future city

160
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.250 
planning boards In Germany.

161
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.390 
Data centers play a role for sustainable digitalization.

162
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.569 
Data centers provide the underlying IT infrastructure for companies to interconnect,

163
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.309 
migrate to the cloud and digitalize their processes and services.

164
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.919 
The data center of the future is no longer just about space, time

165
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.210 
and availability. It's about efficiency, innovation and

166
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.579 
reliability for all stakeholders, from customers to surrounding

167
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.289 
communities. More than ever, businesses want to purchase digital

168
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.700 
infrastructure and services from sustainable suppliers who can help them

169
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.399 
meet their own sustainability targets.

170
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.110 
According to a recent paper from IDC, 24 percent

171
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.792 
of the German IT decision makers state that sustainability

172
00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.449 
is a key factor when choosing an IT provider.

173
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.361 
For 48 percent it's a clear plus light at the end

174
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.490 
of the tunnel, working together to create a green future.

175
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.850 
So there's light at the end of the tunnel.

176
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.722 
Data center operators are able and willing to contribute to reducing

177
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:45.169 
their CO2 footprint while continuing to provide essential services

178
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.749 
to companies, governments and individuals.

179
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.497 
But they can do it all alone, and certainly not when regulatory

180
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:57.559 
obstacles make it economically unfeasible to behave more

181
00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.560 
sustainability.

182
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.639 
To achieve the targets of the European Green Deal, the role of data centers as factories

183
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.247 
of the digital economy, as forerunners in energy

184
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.909 
efficiency solutions, and as potential contributors of energy

185
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:18.200 
in the form of heat needs to be recognized, not penalized.

186
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.299 
And we will all need to work together as consumers and producers to make those

187
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.679 
targets a reality.

188
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.989 
In this context, more than 25 European cloud and data center

189
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.519 
providers recently launched the Climate Neutral Data Center Operator Pact,

190
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:40.490 
the first of its kind self-regulatory initiative that reinforces

191
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.959 
the goal of becoming climate neutral by 2030.

Thank you very much for listening.

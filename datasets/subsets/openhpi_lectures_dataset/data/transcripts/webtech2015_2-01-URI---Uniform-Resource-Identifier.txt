1
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.280 
Now lets talk about details of the uniform resource identifier. The way how the resources

2
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.890 
in the world wide web

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.270 
are identified. The basic components of the world wide web are

4
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.450 
the web documents. Web documents are characterized, also called hypermedia documents,

5
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.900 
are characterized by the hyperlinks. Hyperlinks provides the possibility

6
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.070 
to point directly to another document.

7
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.100 
But what is needed to implement this, is that each of the resources

8
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.390 
which are world wide distributed may be uniquely identified

9
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.030 
and what's needed and URI provides us is a unique identification scheme

10
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.190 
which make it possible to identify each resource in the world wide web.

11
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.030 
If we look to our social life then there are two identification models

12
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.970 
very popular. The first identification is done by names; each

13
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.950 
person has a name and if we talk to each others and we use

14
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.060 
the name of the other we can directly

15
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.720 
identify our partner by his name. So this is very common it's

16
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.640 
used all over the world.

17
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.750 
A little problem is there are many persons with the same name, so the name

18
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.690 
often does not provide a unique identification.

19
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.770 
Besides identifying persons by names, we have the possibility

20
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.120 
to identify person by their address.

21
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.570 
Addresses are uniquely defined. Addresses are given by

22
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.310 
a hierarchical way by defining the country, the city, the

23
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.570 
street number, housing unique,

24
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.260 
flat of a person. And when we give

25
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.050 
his or her address. We can exactly point

26
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.920 
a resource to this person.

27
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.990 
In the world wide web the identification scheme of URI's the uniform

28
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.540 
resource identifier are used.

29
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.160 
And exactly like social lives there are two types of such uniform resource identifiers.

30
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.480 
There is a possibility to identify as a resources or a web

31
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.380 
resources by their name

32
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.060 
the scheme is a uniform resource name URN.

33
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.610 
Beside of that, there is a possibility to identify resources

34
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.750 
by their address and this is done by the uniform resource locator.

35
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.960 
This is based on defining the address of a resource, defining the server,

36
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.290 
where the resource is stored and then exactly describing the path

37
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.780 
the location of the resource at the server.

38
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.630 
In the practical application in the world wide web the URL are used.

39
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.250 
Only a few exception where

40
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.630 
people work with URN for practical application up to now

41
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.930 
the URL the uniform resource locators are established.

42
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.140 
The advantage is they provide a unique identification

43
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.310 
by exactly describing the place where the resource

44
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.260 
is stored. The disadvantage is, if address changes, if the resource

45
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.720 
is placed on another

46
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
server, or if the website is restructured

47
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.740 
then this change of address cannot be carried out automatically.

48
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.610 
The implementation of the URNs of

49
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.460 
the uniform resource name has failed until now due to a lack of a universal

50
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.190 
name service.

51
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.510 
When we want to access a resource in the world wide web

52
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.810 
we have to use our browser and the user can access a resource in the web

53
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.260 
via the browser by typing the URI or in most case typing

54
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.130 
URL of the resources.

55
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.850 
It's also possible to follow a hyperlink

56
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.820 
by activating a special designed element

57
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.070 
in the text underlined world or an image or video

58
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.590 
in the web document which is displayed by the browser,

59
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.140 
and then behind there is

60
00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.040 
a link which leads to the which exactly points to the document

61
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.240 
we want to access.

62
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.540 
As another way to access a resource in the web we can work

63
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.320 
with for example the history directory of our browser or with the bookmark directory.

64
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.760 
Directories help to make the

65
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.410 
movement in the world wide web more simple and in all cases what's done is

66
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.760 
that a resource is requested by giving its URI

67
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.080 
in typical way by giving its URL.

68
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.460 
What does the requirements for such a uniform resource identifiers?

69
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.060 
First requirement is the universality.

70
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.300 
So via such a scheme such an identification scheme in the web

71
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.860 
it should be possible to address every available resources in the interne,

72
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
regardless

73
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.990 
of a particular information service

74
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.650 
which is used for that resource.

75
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.180 
The other requirement for the uniform resource identifier is the uniqueness.

76
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.850 
The uniqueness of every resource,

77
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.170 
which can be accessed over the web must be uniquely

78
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.040 
identifiable, because otherwise the technique does not know which of the

79
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.880 
different resources with the same name

80
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.940 
should be sent to the browser.

81
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.730 
What is also very important

82
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.020 
is that such an scheme uniform resource identifier is

83
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:56.200 
extensible so all the new resources that have not been offered until now

84
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.090 
should be suitable to be equipped with an identifier.

85
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
And it should be fixable.

86
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.710 
what does it mean? Typically for example if you have a business card

87
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:16.620 
you want to design also a home page. So in URI should not only be

88
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.260 
interchangeable by electronic means it should also be manually

89
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:28.900 
edited.It should be possible to print out for example for business cards.

90
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:35.650 
These are the requirements for such an uniform resource identifier scheme.

91
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:42.380 
Now let's consider the syntax of URI of the uniform resource identifier

92
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.080 
that are used to indentified resources of the world wide web.

93
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.740 
URIs are standardized by the internet engineering task force and by the

94
00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:01.950 
web consortium and it is described in the RFC 1630.

95
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.070 
and the syntax of such a URI looks as follows: as a prefix,

96
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.630 
then a colon, and then a suffix.

97
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:17.210 
In the prefix the protocol is specified, the protocol all the information service,

98
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.640 
is specified over which this resource can be accessed.

99
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.420 
And in the suffix there is the place or

100
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.980 
the identification specified as the resource can be found.

101
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:42.160 
In the RFC 1630 not only complete URIs are described but also

102
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.390 
relative URIs.

103
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.780 
According to RFC URIs is either and URL

104
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.240 
which specifies the location of resources, or it is specified

105
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.310 
by URN which gives as a name of resource.

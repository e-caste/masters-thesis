1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.660 
Now we start to have a
closer look on malware

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.160 
in our openHPI course about
Cyberthreats by Malware.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.010 
So malware, that is malicious
software.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.110 
That is software that is smuggled
on the device of a user. It

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.850 
is smuggled over
the internet

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.980 
by hackers and cybercriminals in such a
way that the user does not become aware

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.690 
that there is such a
malicious software installed

8
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.300 
or run on his devices.

9
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.420 
And the idea of hecho en
cybercriminal to do is

10
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.500 
to get possibilities, for example,
to get access to his system,

11
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.700 
to get access to his data, to modify
the data or other things.

12
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.420 
So the objectives to

13
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.250 
develop ideas, to smuggle such malware
onto the systems of the user is

14
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.990 
to limit the working capacity of the
system, to get access to the resources,

15
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.410 
to disturb the work
of the system or to

16
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.540 
manipulate data, to get access
to the data, to steal data, to

17
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.700 
delete data. And here a
special interest is to steal

18
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.140 
serious information
sensible sensitive information like

19
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.080 
passwords or others. Then also
malware is used for espionage

20
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.210 
and sabotage on the system, for sending
blackmails,

21
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.280 
for bringing remote control
for the cybercriminals to the

22
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.210 
system of the users. So you
see there are different

23
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.640 
many different
possibilities and ideas

24
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.530 
that can be performed by means
of malware. If we look at

25
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.140 
the different
malware types,

26
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.170 
then here is a small statistic
which shows how popular

27
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.700 
different types of malware
are and how popular the

28
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.330 
different attack vectors are misusing
such software. Here the red

29
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.830 
that is trojan. Trojan in software,
the gray is the rest, viruses

30
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.940 
are this, yellow is worms, blue
is adware. So there are many

31
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.650 
other things and we will
discuss in the course

32
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.670 
in more detail how these different
types of malware are working.

33
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.430 
So usually with the modern attacks, there
are several malicious functions

34
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.550 
which are combined within one malware. So we
will see that nowadays it's difficult

35
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.810 
to assign malware to a special type of
malware because many functionalities

36
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.830 
is coming

37
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.910 
from different malware. Here
is the amount of malwaree that's

38
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.500 
in the internet. This is not
hundreds, not thousands,

39
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.580 
it's billions of
malware that are

40
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.740 
infecting user systems,

41
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.310 
that are infecting network
systems, that are infecting the

42
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.330 
services of software
providers.

43
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.910 
The target if we look to
our image here,

44
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.150 
in the grey is the internet, is the different
local networks that are interconnected

45
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.610 
by means of internet service
provider to the internet,

46
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.880 
the various services
that are provided from

47
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.170 
internet systems, the user with his
or her different devices which

48
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.960 
is using these services, which
is using the internet.

49
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.250 
And the user to this end
uses hardware, the hardware

50
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.340 
is run by certain operating systems,
on this operating systems

51
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.360 
applications are available, applications
can come from the internet, applications

52
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.470 
can be run on this computer
systems and on all that

53
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.720 
the cybercriminals are
interested. And on all that, they

54
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.870 
try to attack and they
do the attack with

55
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.440 
the help of malware. They try to attack
the hardware of a user, they try to

56
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.790 
attack the operating system the
user is using for that hardware,

57
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.310 
they try to attack the many
applications the user is running and

58
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.220 
they also try to attack
the user him or herself

59
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.530 
by means of a social
engineering method.

60
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.670 
So in the following,

61
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.970 
in the following clips in
our course, we will discuss

62
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.880 
the different types and
different variants of malware

63
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.350 
and such variants are viruses, Worm,
Trojans, we already mentioned

64
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:40.990 
botnets, these are computers that are
mislead, that are in the end

65
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.550 
user computers and systems that
are in the hand of cyber

66
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:54.110 
attackers which by means of malware
can remotely use this system,

67
00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.440 
we speak about rootkits and backdoors,
malware, adware, scareware, ransomware,

68
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.840 
keyloggers - all these are different
types of malware with a specific

69
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.760 
specific attack idea and attack method. To
learn this is important, to be careful

70
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.790 
to see in which level
and on what

71
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.830 
ways an attacker can infiltrate
malware and an attacker can use the

72
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.390 
infiltrated malware
for their purposes.

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.600 
Thank you so much for that wonderful opening.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.999 
The program chairs are just going to take a few minutes now to introduce you all to the

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.970 
Learning at Scale (L@S) Program.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.891 
So I'd like to welcome you all here and introduce

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.670 
you quickly to our chairs, Mar Perez-Sanagustine, myself

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.277 
(Amy Ogan) and Marcus Specht who unfortunately, cannot be here to join us

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.848 
today, but for a incredibly good reason, which is that he is getting his

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.321 
second vaccination shot and he wishes to share with you all the value

9
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.711 
of doing that, that it's even more important than opening the Learning at Scale

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.590 
conference. So, please get vaccinated, if you are at all able.

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.020 
All right, so to very quickly take you through the Learning at Scale program,

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.460 
we have a very global conference this year, as you might imagine,

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.850 
enabled by the virtual opportunity to join from your own home.

14
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.730 
So, we're very excited to see so many participants from Europe, Asia

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.599 
and across the world.

16
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.739 
This slide might be a little bit of deja vu if you were able to join

17
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.269 
us at our virtual event last summer where we

18
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.739 
declared this a historic moment for Learning at Scale and talked about the

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.359 
covid-19 pandemics impact on education and we asked how

20
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.790 
to do it effectively in today's time.

21
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.469 
Well, it turns out that a year later we're still in this position,

22
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.239 
but we have a lot more data about what has happened in the intervening

23
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.000 
time and hopefully you speak German.

24
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.666 
We are hosting this conference virtually from Germany.

25
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.799 
But if you do not, the statement in this

26
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.335 
very recent article says that a study studies show that

27
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.069 
distance learning is just as effective as summer holidays.

28
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.330 
So we have a quick answer to this question, which is we have not fixed

29
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.338 
this problem yet. We have not necessarily determined

30
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.179 
how to do this the most effectively.

31
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.129 
But actually, most importantly, as we know, that online learning is very

32
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.510 
effective for some and so I'd like to change our question

33
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.704 
for this year to ask instead, how can we do it equitably

34
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.499 
in today's time? And so while we're online, learning may be effective

35
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.224 
for some. What we have learned over the course of the last year is that that

36
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.879 
effectiveness is not distributed equally across the population.

37
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.489 
And so I'm very excited that we have several talks from papers

38
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.613 
this week and also from some of our amazing keynotes that

39
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.020 
will address this question.

40
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.580 
I'm going to now turn it over to Mar to tell you a little bit about the program itself.

41
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.899 
Thank you, Amy, it's a pleasure to have you all there.

42
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.796 
As Amy said that the most important question this year is how to

43
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.781 
deal with equity, right? We are not going to solve, or give an answer

44
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.650 
with this conference, but at least we are going to discuss it.

45
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.669 
And for that this year, what we need is to emphasize in certain areas

46
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.360 
that we thought it was important to to work on.

47
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.970 
And we decided to have five main areas, one in Intelligence at

48
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.187 
Scale, exploring artificial intelligence, how can we use it for

49
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.065 
supporting Learning at Scale.

50
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.980 
Instruction at scale, using most of the covid experience, you will see

51
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.280 
in some of our papers that some of these aspects are discussed.

52
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.941 
Then there are Studies and Interventions at Scale, Systems and Tools at Scale, and Review

53
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.819 
and Synthesis papers.

54
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.589 
For each of these areas we invited a champion that were very kind

55
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.150 
and very, very motivated to help authors to guide

56
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.529 
their writings and then also support some of the review process.

57
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.349 
And that being said, as every other year, we accepted this year

58
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.629 
4 types of submissions, workshop research papers, work in progress

59
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.699 
that are going to be presented at posters in these conferences and also demonstrations

60
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.079 
that will be also presented as posters in an informal way.

61
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.743 
After this year, even with the present circumstances, we had

62
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.198 
89 submissions in total.

63
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.460 
The selection process was very hard, we had 3 reviews per

64
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.325 
paper and one lead reviewer who was in charge of making mata-review

65
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.550 
process and suggesting a final decision.

66
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.369 
Then we also invited certain of our champions to discuss

67
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.553 
some of the papers that were difficult to to evaluate and

68
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.470 
finally, we did the final selection.

69
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.489 
We hope these selection, it's interesting

70
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.370 
for you.

71
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.179 
After these submissions, here are some numbers of the acceptance rate.

72
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.589 
We we have an acceptance rate of research, 30 percent.

73
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.269 
Some of the research papers were invited to become a work in progress paper

74
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.050 
and be presented as a poster and then we also got

75
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.765 
2 demo papers that will also be presented in the poster

76
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720 
session.

77
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.439 
And this year we've seen we are co-hosting, Learning

78
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.329 
at Scale with EMOOCs. This is a very good opportunity, not only for sharing

79
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.761 
presentations and sharing keynotes, as you will see in the program, but also for

80
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.730 
enlarging the discussion. We'll see with Professor Meinel's

81
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.330 
presentation that indeed some of the problems that

82
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.389 
come from MOOCs are also applicable to find solution Learning at Scales.

83
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.170 
So, we thought that this was a good idea to mix these conferences.

84
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.730 
The good thing for you guys is that you will have these amazing keynotes.

85
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.338 
Some of them are coming soon, like Prof.

86
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.399 
Geoffrey West. You can go to the to the keynotes.

87
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.895 
Thank you. And he will be

88
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.350 
talking about a window onto Universal laws of Growth, Living and Dying

89
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.659 
in Organisms, Cities and Companies. Then we would have Prof. Sanna Jarvela from the

90
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.399 
University of Oslo and Motahhare Eslami from Carnegie

91
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.994 
Mellon University. There will be, Geoffrey will be talking today, Sanna today

92
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.589 
at the end of the sessions and Motahhare tomorrow.

93
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.993 
You are always welcome to join these keynotes.

94
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.819 
We had also worksop sessions that started yesterday,

95
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.079 
we didn't receive feedback yet, but I thought there was a good experience

96
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.689 
and then the rest of the program is going to be organized in five different sessions.

97
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.220 
You will find the names quite interesting, but it was quite hard to find the

98
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.444 
good moment for all the sessions to be organized with these global

99
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.639 
global global conferences in which we have people from Asia, Australia,

100
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.890 
the United States, Europe.

101
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.569 
So, we decided to mix the sessions by time zones.

102
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.579 
So, we will have five sessions organized by different perspective

103
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.079 
from the different time zones. And what we did this

104
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.709 
year is not having sessions in parallel, so that you can attend each of

105
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.630 
the sessions. All can be attending these sessions.

106
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.519 
Then after that, we will have the positive work in progress and demonstration

107
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.700 
systems that will be happening tomorrow at 7 PM

108
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.110 
in Europe in German (CET) time.

109
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.660 
And we will be sharing this poster session with the with

110
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.570 
the EMOOCs participants also. It will be taking place in gallery.

111
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.157 
Finally, just to tell you that there are coffee breaks which are informal

112
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:13.029 
places where you can meet people and talk to people when you are tired of listening

113
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.048 
or when you are tired or something, you can just join and discuss really with your

114
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.570 
colleagues. These will be always open.

115
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.779 
And then finally, I would like to show you a little

116
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.063 
bit how it is going to work. I'm sure you are already familiar with

117
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.169 
the openHPI platform.

118
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.090 
There is a menu in which you can find the program.

119
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.506 
There you will see both the program of the EMOOCs and Learning at Scale, but you can

120
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.419 
filter clicking on Learning at Scale to see all the sessions that belong

121
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.320 
to this conference in particular.

122
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.928 
Don't forget that the poster session is shared, so you have to click on the poster

123
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.099 
session to see when it's going to happen and

124
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.059 
then in the same platform where you will find

125
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.499 
all the links to the conferences, you will find a schedule

126
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.754 
that you can personalize, you can filter that.

127
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.092 
We have been filtering all the programs

128
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.909 
for the learning at scale. You click in one session and you go directly to the

129
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.335 
zoom that will be hosting this session, it's quite simple.

130
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.389 
But you have to check that you don't miss any of the sessions because it's a long,

131
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:35.120 
long program. And this is everything I wanted to say.

132
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.974 
Now, I leave the word to Amy, who will close the session

133
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.284 
and will give the mic to Geoffrey West.

134
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.450 
Yes, very good news, we can already access the conference proceedings

135
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.789 
and amazingly, as you'll see from this diagram, it has

136
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.690 
already been downloaded almost a thousand times.

137
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.539 
So, we're getting wonderful visibility for the Learning at Scale program, and we

138
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.559 
encourage you to go check that out so that you can see all of the papers.

139
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.929 
We also will be awarding a best paper award

140
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.415 
later in the conference. You can see here are 3 nominees for best

141
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.440 
paper, and we will be announcing the winner of

142
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.300 
the best paper award at the poster session.

143
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.769 
We will also be awarding 2 special prizes.

144
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.539 
So, we highly encourage you to go observe that and hear about

145
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.880 
the wonderful winners of our prizes.

146
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.889 
And these have been presented by our excellent supporters

147
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.763 
with Oracle for research as well as Schmidt Future.

148
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.450 
So, we encourage you to join the poster session and learn more there.

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.030 
Hello. A Tractica report predicts that edgeAI device

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:14.560 
shipments will increase from 161 million units in 2018 to 2.6 billion units worldwide in 2025.

3
00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.429 
You may be curious about which application areas edgeAI

4
00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.570 
will have a substantial impact on. In this video

5
00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.559 
we will do a brief analysis.

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.450 
5G and edge computing are two inextricably linked technology.

7
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.149 
They both significantly improve the performance of applications and enable huge amount of data to be processed in real time.

8
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
5G increases speed by up to 20 times that of 4G.

9
00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:59.210 
Whereas age computing reduced latency by bringing computing capability into the network closer to the end user and there

10
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:09.709 
are still major unknowns in how 5G will achieve these speeds, it is likely that 5G will rely upon edge computing

11
00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:17.829 
to reach the targets being set. Edge computing can solve the problems in three major 5G scenarios.

12
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:28.260 
First, edge computing devices will provide connectivity and protection services for emerging and existing network devices.

13
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.060 
Second, also 5G will provide cloud based applications with better connectivity and a lower latency.

14
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.260 
Data processing and storage costs are still very high.

15
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.760 
The hybrid solution of edge computing and 5G will reduce these costs.

16
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:57.780 
Finally, edge computing can allow more applications to run on the edge and device reduced the delay caused by the data transmission

17
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:09.680 
and bandwidth limitations, perform preliminary local data analysis and share part of the work for the cloud. 5G and edge computing

18
00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:20.050 
are complementary to a certain extent. On the one hand, 5G needs edge computing to drive service demnd. On the other hand

19
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
edge computing can provide developers and environment to create 5G applications that do not exist before.

20
00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:41.580 
EdgeAI has a wide range of application prospects in all works of life due to its high characteristics such as low traffic

21
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.360 
occupancy, low latency and strong privacy.

22
00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:53.949 
It helps companies to secure their operations products to ensure high productivity, accuracy and safety.

23
00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.979 
Next we will look at the most potential application areas for edgeAI's

24
00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.460 
future development.

25
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.860 
The smartphone is the current generation of intelligent mobile terminals and it is still the most important platform for

26
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:21.270 
edgeAI applications because there is a large number of mobile apps that have reached AI functional requirements.

27
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.620 
For example, in the previous video we introduced the Google's first Federated Learning application was developed for the

28
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.449 
application scenarios on android phones.

29
00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:44.759 
Another examples, Siri or google assistant are also good example of edgeAI on smartphones because this technology drives

30
00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.699 
their voice user interface.

31
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.560 
AI on mobile phones enable data processing on the device side.

32
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.090 
So there's no need to deliver device data to the cloud.

33
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.259 
This helps to protect the privacy and reduce the traffic.

34
00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:11.300 
Many people now believe that VR and AR glasses will become the next generation of the smart mobile terminals. At present

35
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:20.199 
its technology is still being further improved but we can already see that it has many application requirements for more

36
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.210 
efficient edgeAI

37
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:29.160 
such as the visual recognition rendering, 3D reconstruction, video transmission and so on and so forth.

38
00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:34.569 
With the popularity of internet of things,

39
00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:41.040 
home life will introduce more and more smart applications

40
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.930 
such as smart lightning control, smart kitchens etcetera.

41
00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:55.379 
These applications require the deployment of a large number of sensors and controllers in the home environment. In order to

42
00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.449 
protect the privacy of a household data,

43
00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:09.139 
data processing mass rely on the edge side computing so that most computing resources are restricted to the internal gateway

44
00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:09.930 
of the home.

45
00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:21.230 
And sensitive data is avoided from floating out, optimize the indoor positioning and home intrusion detection through the

46
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.750 
edgeAI to obtain higher accuracy and lower latency than cloud computing.

47
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:37.410 
For example, smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home are widely used now. They receive user instructions and response

48
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.759 
through the interaction with the 3rd Party services.

49
00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:50.129 
However, smart speakers rely on the cloud for speech recognition and natural language understanding which will cause the

50
00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.060 
privacy of household data to be leaked.

51
00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.879 
So the application of edgeAI can effectively solve these problems.

52
00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.060 
Similarly, home entertainment will also benefit from edgeAI.

53
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:16.660 
The system can recommend personal life service on its own allowing users to have a better entertainment experience. Sensors

54
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:25.449 
in smart building can detect whether there are people in the room to automatically adjust the temperature, lightning when

55
00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:31.550 
the room is not in use, thereby saving costs and protecting our environment.

56
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:40.980 
The data and analysis results collected by a smart building may change the way infrastructure is managed. For example,

57
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:51.490 
Siemens building an automation system, integrated all building system into a single platform that can be intuitively

58
00:06:51.500 --> 00:07:01.550 
operated. Better managing functions such as fire protection, heating, lighting and video surveillance etcetera.

59
00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
Similar concepts and technology can be further applied in the city area such as campuses or ports. In these scenarios

60
00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:18.540 
edgeAI will give full play to its core technical advantages.

61
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:27.839 
As the scale of cities continues to expand and the data presents the characteristics of the geographic distribution,

62
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:38.389 
edgeAI is needed to solve more task with low latency and high efficiency. For example the building of emerging warning system

63
00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:45.420 
in the city, when danger occurs such as when children falling into a swimming pool or fire occurred,

64
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.449 
we expect the system to provide accurate and fast early warning.

65
00:07:51.339 --> 00:08:03.269 
In addition AI is used to coordinate and dispatch urban infrastructure and apply it to a public safety, health care and transportation

66
00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:08.759 
and many other fields to achieve the best use of resources in the entire city.

67
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.740 
For example, concerning traffic jam.

68
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:22.120 
Singapore has responses to enormous traffic challenges through connected transportation solutions.

69
00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:25.620 
It's intelligent transportation system ITS

70
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:35.490 
supports a dynamic electronic toll collection system at the traffic volume increased sharply,

71
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.590 
the highway toll rates also increases. ITS

72
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.789 
also allows real time traffic information through the GPS

73
00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:46.149 
enabled taxis.

74
00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:56.889 
It shows the dynamic planning and scheduling of the public transportation structures and can make busses more accurate

75
00:08:56.899 --> 00:08:57.750 
in their system.

76
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:05.159 
Farming and agriculture will also benefit from the edgeAI.

77
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:15.509 
In addition to robotic arms and drones, there are also applications of precision agriculture using the internet of things

78
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:16.860 
based on the edge computing.

79
00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:28.500 
For example the yield and Australian based agriculture technology company use sensors, data and AI measures to help farmers

80
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:37.700 
make informed decisions about the weather, soil and plant conditions demonstrating the huge potential of

81
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:43.690 
edgeAI in the smart farming. In the industrial manufacturing,

82
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:54.460 
AI and edge applications are expected to play an increasingly important role in the developing smart factories driven by the

83
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.409 
industry for all standards.

84
00:09:56.419 --> 00:10:04.620 
The next generation of smart factory will apply advanced robotics and machine learning technologies to software services

85
00:10:04.629 --> 00:10:12.149 
and industrial internet of things to increase protection capacity and maximize efficiency.

86
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:22.350 
Edge computing and AI used local sensors to control and manage output this significantly improving efficiency and reducing

87
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.090 
the errors.

88
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:32.159 
For instance, the edge system can response to input within milliseconds either making adjustments to solve the issue of shutting

89
00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:35.759 
down the production line to prevent a serious problem.

90
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.059 
Healthcare has entered the era of data.

91
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:53.070 
The popularity of health awareness has made medical advance devices and terminals more and more diversified and edgeAI will

92
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:59.159 
help facilitate and promote the patient care and enhance the operational efficiency.

93
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.320 
The first is the pre hospital first aid.

94
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:12.559 
So, when the emerging patients arrive at the hospital or transfer between two hospitals, most of the current emerging medical

95
00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:22.830 
services are deployed in the cloud which is easy affected and restricted by the mobile environment, extreme wealth and extreme

96
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.360 
weather.

97
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:35.200 
EdgeAI can establish a bidirectional communication channels between the ambulance and the hospital, realize the real time image

98
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.850 
and language processing and improve timeless and efficiency.

99
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:51.129 
The second is smart variable devices. The current smart variable devices affected by computing power and only play

100
00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:52.860 
a role in the data collection.

101
00:11:53.639 --> 00:12:02.870 
However, this is an active research field such as deploying AI models on viable devices to monitor human

102
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.330 
emotions in the future.

103
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:14.559 
More lightweight AI algorithms will be deployed on the devices to monitor, analyze and predict the health data in real time

104
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.470 
helping humans better understand their physical conditions.

105
00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:24.170 
I only list the part of the potential application scenarios of

106
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.710 
edgeAI but what is certain is that the era of edgeAI

107
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:38.049 
is coming and if you change the AI model, the ecology of AI computing, software hardware and make our lives more comfortable

108
00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:39.360 
and intelligent.

109
00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:50.059 
In this week's practical session we will experience collaborative influence for image classification with Sedna.

110
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.740 
The time required is about 3-6 hours.

111
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.649 
I hope you all have fun and have great success.

112
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.649 
Thank you for watching the video.
